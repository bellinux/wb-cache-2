5|$|Further {{indicative}} of the role cognitive flexibility plays in education is the argument that <b>how</b> <b>students</b> are taught greatly impacts the nature and formation of their cognitive structures, which in turn affect students’ ability to store and readily access information. A crucial aim of education is to help students learn as well as appropriately apply and adapt {{what they have learned}} to novel situations. This is reflected in the integration of cognitive flexibility into educational policy regarding academic guidelines and expectations. For example, as outlined in the , a standards-based education reform developed to increase high school graduation rates, educators are expected to present within the classroom “high level cognitive demands by asking students to demonstrate deep conceptual understanding through the application of content knowledge and skills to new situations.” This guideline within the Common Core Initiative is the essence of cognitive flexibility, and a teaching style focused on promoting it has been seen to foster understanding especially in disciplines where information is complex and nonlinear. A counterexample is evident in cases where such material is presented in an oversimplified manner and learners fail to transfer their knowledge to a new domain.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested <b>how</b> <b>students</b> could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the positioning of student campus activism within a discourse of student engagement to explore <b>how</b> <b>student</b> engagement becomes framed as legitimate/ illegitimate. Using pivotal points within the 2012 - 14 Sussex Against Privatisation/Occupy Sussex campaigns at the University of Sussex; we compare <b>how</b> <b>student</b> activists construct themselves with {{how they are}} constructed by the university administration. Our focus is on <b>how</b> <b>student</b> activists are positioned as troublemakers, lacking valid critical capacity and incapable of independent, mature, reasoned political positioning. We argue that the construction of student activist identities as immature and dangerous both devalues the agency of the protestors but also demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>student</b> engagement is shaped by normative discourses {{of what constitutes a}} legitimately engaged student in higher education. Positioning students as being problematic and misguided is potentially incongruous with discourses of students as consumers, as partners and as producers. We propose that in many cases, student engagement is simply a mirage for other organisational practices and that the concept is limited and can be limiting. The relationship between student engagement and activism is explored using Ahmed’s (2012) work on non-performative concepts {{and what it means to}} speak in and about higher education...|$|R

When the founders worried <b>how</b> <b>students</b> would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he would do well in Slytherin in the first book, but ultimately selecting Gryffindor after Harry asks it not to put him in Slytherin.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{psychology}} of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences {{in the organization of}} cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing <b>how</b> <b>students</b> differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and self-regulation, and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable the teacher to cater for the needs of the different students so that no one is left behind.|$|E

25|$|Romanization is not {{normally}} taught in Taiwan's public schools at any level. Consequently, most Taiwanese {{do not know}} how to romanize their names or addresses. Teachers use only Zhuyin ("bopomofo") for teaching and annotating the pronunciation of Mandarin. There have been sporadic discussions about using a romanization system during early education to teach children Mandarin pronunciation (like <b>how</b> <b>students</b> in Mainland China learn Mandarin using Hanyu Pinyin). However, like all other aspects of romanization in Taiwan, this is a controversial issue. The plan in the early 2000s to adopt Pinyin was delayed due to disagreements over which form to use (Tongyong or Hanyu). The move is complicated by the massive effort needed to produce new instructional materials and retrain teachers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} assertion, {{analysis}} of objects {{with respect to}} approximate (enumerated) ultimates does not create a problem of true establishment. A distinction can be made when analyzing for each case, including the two approaches to cognition (one for the conventional domain {{and the other to}} analyze for ultimacy) which are his additions to the Pramana tradition of valid cognition. Mipham uses this demonstration in his commentary to point out a problem with Je Tsongkhapa's approach of negating the predicate of [...] "true establishment" [...] instead of the object of perception, which is avoided in Śāntarakṣita's approach. Mipham also notes that many Prasaṅgika writers (similar to their Svatantrika counterparts) made positive assertions to move students closer to the ultimate view, pointing out that the distinction between Prasangika and Svatantrika lies in <b>how</b> <b>students</b> are taught about conventionalities and not in the consideration of ultimate truth. He concludes that Je Tsongkhapa, in making a distinction based on true establishment, proposes a Svatantrika rather than a Prasangika approach.|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{writes in}} his article, {{through the use of}} Richard Lanham’s The Electronic World: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts, how “discursive text is in the center of {{everything}} we do," [...] going on to say <b>how</b> <b>students</b> coexist in a world that “includes blogs, podcasts, modular community web spaces, cell phone messaging…”, urging for students to be taught how to compose through rhetorical minds in these new, and not-so-new texts. “Cultural changes, and Lanham suggests, refocuses writing theory towards the image”, demonstrating how there is a change in alphabet-to-icon ratios in electronic writing. One of these prime examples can see through the Apple product, the iPhone, in which “emojis” are seen as icons in a separate keyboard to convey what words would have once delivered. Another example is Prezi. Often likened to Microsoft PowerPoint, Prezi is a cloud-based presentation application that allows users to create text, embed video, and make visually aesthetic projects. Prezi’s presentations zoom the eye in, out, up and down to create a multi-dimensional appeal. Users also utilize different media within this medium that is itself unique.|$|E

40|$|Student {{evaluations}} {{in recent}} years have become widely accepted as a means of evaluating teachers in higher education. This acceptance was to some extent caused by taxpayers, parents, legislatures, and perhaps students, who demanded more evidence that they were getting good value for their investments (Cone, 1996; England, Hutchings, & McKeachie, 1997; McKeachie, 1997 a). This acceptance has not occurred without concerns being voiced by educators about <b>how</b> <b>student</b> evaluations have affected the quality of education. Some worry that the acceptance and use of student eval-uations have resulted in grade inflation and lower academic standards. Although many in higher education may have concerns about <b>how</b> specific <b>student</b> evaluation instruments are designed and constructed and <b>how</b> <b>student</b> evaluation numbers are summarized, interpreted, and used, few in higher education today will argue that student evaluations should not be used at all.
