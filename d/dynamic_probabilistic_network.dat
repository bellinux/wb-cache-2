40|$|In {{applications}} such as tracking and surveillance in large spatial environments, {{there is a need}} for representing dynamic and noisy data and at the same time dealing with them at different levels of detail. In the spatial domain, there has been work dealing with these two issues separately, however, there is no existing common framework for dealing with both of them. In this paper, we propose a new representation framework called the Layered <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>Network</b> (LDPN), a special type of <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>Network</b> (DPN), capable of handling uncertainty and representing spatial data at various levels of detail. The framework is thus particularly suited to applications in wide-area environments which are characterised by large region size, complex spatial layout and multiple sensors/cameras. For example, a building has three levels: entry/exit to the building, entry/exit between rooms and moving within rooms. To avoid the problem of a relatively large state space associated with a large spatial environment, the LDPN explicitly encodes the hierarchy of connected spatial locations, making it scalable to the size of the environment being modelled. There are three main advantages of the LDPN. First, the reduction in state space makes it suitable for dealing with wide area surveillance involving multiple sensors. Second, it offers a hierarchy of intervals for indexing temporal data. Lastly, the explicit representation of intermediate sub-goals allows for the extension of the framework to easily represent group interactions by allowing coupling between sub-goal layers of different individuals or objects. We describe an adaptation of the likelihood sampling inference scheme for the LDPN, and illustrate its use in a hypothetical surveillance scenario...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we present}} a unified {{bottom-up}} and top-down automatic model selection based approach for modelling complex activities of multiple objects in cluttered scenes. An activity of multiple objects is represented based on discrete scene events and their behaviours are modelled by reasoning about the temporal and causal correlations among different events. This is {{significantly different from the}} majority of the existing techniques that are centred on object tracking followed by trajectory matching. In our approach, object-independent events are detected and classified by unsupervised clustering using Expectation-Maximisation (EM) and classified using automatic model selection based on Schwarzâ€™s Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>Networks</b> (DPNs) are formulated for modelling the temporal and causal correlations among discrete events for robust and holistic scene-level behaviour interpretation.

We develop a method that takes a set of DPN submodels and a stochastic finite state automaton that defines a legal set of submodel concatenations, and constructs a composite DPN. The composite DPN is shown to represent correctly the intended probability distribution over possible histories of the temporal process. The use of DPNs allows us {{to take advantage of}} efficient, general-purpose inference and learning algorithms and can confer significant advantages over HMMs in terms of statistical efficiency and representational flexibility.

To avert these effects, {{and to maintain}} {{the high level of}} safety that {{is an integral part of}} intelligent transportation sys-tems, we propose a fault tolerant supervisory con-trol architecture. It consists of five main modules: sensor validation, sensor fusion, fault diagnosis, haz-ard analysis, and a safety decision maker. Two methods have been identified and developed for these modules. One is based on probability theory, the other on fuzzy logic.
