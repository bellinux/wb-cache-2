40|$|A {{description}} of the background to testing friction materials for automotive brakes explains {{the need for a}} rapid, inexpensive means of assessing their behaviour in a way which is both accurate and meaningful. Various methods of controlling <b>inertia</b> <b>dynamometers</b> to simulate road vehicles are rejected in favour of programming by means of a commercially available XY plotter. Investigation of brake service conditions is used to set up test schedules, and a dynamometer programming unit built to enable service conditions on vehicles to be simulated on a full scale dynamometer. A technique is developed by which accelerated testing can be achieved without operating under overload conditions, saving time and cost without sacrificing validity. The development of programming by XY plotter is described, with a method of operating one XY plotter to programme the machine, monitor its own behaviour, and plot its own results in logical sequence. Commissioning trials are described and the generation of reproducible results in frictional behaviour and material durability is discussed. Teclmiques are developed to cross check the operation of the machine in retrospect, and retrospectively correct results in the event of malfunctions. Sensitivity errors in the measuring circuits are displayed between calibrations, whilst leaving the recorded results almost unaffected by error. Typical results of brake lining tests are used to demonstrate the range of performance parameters which can be studied by use of the machine. Successful test investigations completed on the machine are reported, including comments on behaviour of cast iron drums and discs. The machine shows that materials can repeat their complex friction/ temperature/speed/pressure relationships at a reproducibility of the order of +- 0. 003 u and +~ 0. 0002 in. thickness loss during wear tests.

30|$|The {{correlation}} between the wear behavior of a heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) brake liner tested under controlled laboratory conditions and that in actual field conditions is investigated. A brake liner study for friction and wear is performed on an <b>inertia</b> brake <b>dynamometer</b> (IBD) at different temperatures (200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) using 6000 brake actuations in a laboratory. The total wear loss of the brake liner at three different temperatures for 6000 brake actuations in IBD {{is found to be}} 1.12 mm. The actual field test is conducted on four different HCVs, namely, a city bus (CB), a high speed bus (HSB), a highway truck (HWT), and a tipper lorry (TL). These HCVs run at different terrain/traffic conditions and load conditions. When comparing the predicted life of the brake liner through the IBD test with the actual life of the brake liner in different HCVs, a vast difference is observed. Due to the large variation of liner life observed between the actual and predicted tests, an extensive field test is conducted. In the field test, the liner with identical formulation is fitted in the four types of HCVs. The predicted life of the liner using IBD is then correlated with the field test observation and a correlation factor is determined. Based on this correlation factor, the predicted life of the liner and the achieved life on the HCV are found to be fairly close. This study will be useful to design the friction material formulation and to predict the actual life of the brake liner for various HCVs.|$|R

There are over 50 million 2 -stroke cycle engines in Asia alone, powering motorbikes, mopeds, “three-wheelers”, “auto-rickshaws”, “tuk-tuks”, and “tricycles”. These carbureted 2 -stroke engines {{are characterized by}} high levels of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Direct injection is a technology that has shown a great ability to reduce these emissions {{while at the same}} time improve fuel economy. A prototype kit has been designed for use in retrofitting existing carbureted two-stroke engines to direct injection. The kit was designed for use on a TVS 50; a motorcycle from the INDIA that is commonly used as a transportation. It is however, a relatively common engine design and TVS manufactures similar models for sale all over the world. The conventional fuel injection system kit incorporates the Orbital air blast direct injection system. This injection system has been implemented in TVS 50. The design involved replacing the existing cylinder head with one designed to incorporate the direct injection valves as well as a modified combustion chamber. An external compressor was added to supply compressed air to the system. The carburettor was refined with a throttle body outfitted with a position indicator, and an encoder system was added to provide speed and position feedback to the engine control unit (ECU). Once design and manufacture of the system was complete, it was installed on the motorcycle. The motorcycle was then mounted in a low <b>inertia</b> eddy current <b>dynamometer</b> test cell for calibration. Calibration was done on the dynamometer for power and engine performance.

40|$|In the European Union the {{legislation}} governing fleet CO 2 emissions {{is already in}} place with a fleet average limit of 130 g/km currently being imposed on all vehicle manufacturers. With the target for this legislation falling to 95 g/km by 2020 and hefty fines for noncompliance automotive engineers are working a pace to develop new technologies that lower the CO 2 emissions and hence fuel consumption of new to market vehicles. As average new vehicle CO 2 emissions continue to decline the task of measuring these emissions with high precision becomes increasingly challenging. With the introduction of real world emissions legislation planned for 2017 there is a development driven need to precisely assess the vehicle CO 2 emissions on chassis dynamometers over a wide operating range. Furthermore since all type approval and certification testing is completed on chassis dynamometers, any new technology must be proven against these test techniques. Typical technology improvements nowadays require repeatability limits which were unprecedented 5 - 10 years ago and the challenge now is how to deliver this level of precision. Detailed studies are conducted into the four key areas that cause significant noise to the CO 2 emissions results from chassis dynamometer tests. These are the vehicle electrical system, driver behaviour, procedural factors and the chassis dynamometer itself. In each of these areas, the existing contribution of imprecision is quantified, methods are proposed then demonstrated for improving the precision and the improved case is quantified. It {{was found that the}} electrical system can be controlled by charging the vehicle battery, not using auxiliary devices and installing current measurement devices on the vehicle. Simply charging the vehicle battery prior to each test was found to cause a change to the CO 2 emissions of 2. 2 % at 95 % confidence. Whilst auxiliary devices were found to cause changes to the CO 2 emissions of up to 43 % for even a relatively basic vehicle. The driver behaviour can be controlled by firstly removing the tolerances from the driver’s aid which it was found improved the precision of the CO 2 emissions by 43. 5 % and secondly by recording the throttle pedal movements to enable the validation of test results. Procedural factors, such as tyre pressures can be easily controlled by resisting the temptation to over check and by installing pressure sensing equipment. Using a modern chassis dynamometer with low parasitic losses will make the job of controlling the dynamometer easier, but all dynamometers can be controlled by following the industry standard quality assurance procedures and implementing statistical process control tools to check the key results. The implementation of statistical process control alone improved the precision of unloaded dynamometer coastdown checks by reducing the coefficient of variation from 6. 6 to 4. 0 %. Using the dynamometer to accelerate the vehicle before coastdown checks was found to approximately halve the variability in coastdown times. It was also demonstrated that verification of the <b>dynamometer</b> <b>inertia</b> simulation and response time are both critically important, as the industry standard coastdown test is insufficient, in isolation, to validate the loading on a vehicle. Six sigma and statistical process control techniques have shown that for complex multiple input single output systems, such as chassis dynamometer fuel economy tests, it is insufficient to improve only one input to the system to achieve a change to the output. As a result, suggested improvements in each noise factor often have to be validated against an input metric rather than the output CO 2 emissions. Despite this, the overall level of precision of the CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption seen {{at the start of the}} research, measured by the coefficient of variation of approximately 2. 6 %, has been improved by over six times through the simultaneous implementation of the findings from this research with the demonstration of coefficient of variation as low as 0. 4 %. Through this research three major contributions have been made to the state of the art. Firstly, from the work on driver behaviour an extension is proposed to the Society of Automotive Engineers J 2951 drive quality metric standard to include the a newly developed Cumulative Absolute Speed Error metric and to suggest that metrics are reviewed across the duration of a test to identify differences in driving behaviours during a test that do not cause a change to the end of test result. Secondly, the need to instrument the vehicle and test cell to record variability in the key noise factors has been demonstrated. Thirdly, a universal method has been developed and published from this research, to use response modelling techniques for the validation of test repeatability and the correction of CO 2 emissions. The impact of these contributions is that the precision of chassis dynamometer emissions tests can be improved by a factor of 6. 5 and this is of critical importance as the new real world driving and world light-duty harmonised emissions legislation comes into force over the next two to five years. This legislation will require an unprecedented level of precision for the effective testing of full vehicle system interactions over a larger operating range but within a controlled laboratory environment. If this level of precision is not met then opportunities to reduce vehicle fuel consumption through technology that only has a small improvement on fuel consumption, which is likely given the large advances that have be achieved over the last few decades, will be missed...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{requirements}} for new pad and disc materials {{are becoming increasingly}} important due to the growing contribution of non-exhaust emissions to vehicle traffic pollution. Copper usage in brake pad formulations has recently become the subject of considerable debate, primarily due to the potentially toxic effects of copper and other heavy metals (including antimony) on human health and environment, specially in water quality. USA legislation {{requires the use of}} copper to be reduced to < 5 % by 2021 and to 0. 5 % by 2025. Although currently no specific regulation within the European Union imposes limitations on the use of copper, the main brake-producing companies are already manufacturing copper-free brake pads in response to the aforementioned USA legislation being the goal to achieve the same brake performance as the one provided by copper. This PhD work was conducted in collaboration with Pometon S. p. A., a metal powder manufacturer, and GAMA S. p. A., organic brake pad manufacturer. In light of copper being eliminated from the brake pads, this project intends to study the possibility of its replacement in low-steel brake pads using different metal powders produced by Pometon. Therefore, in a first approach copper was replaced by Sn powder, sponge Fe powder and Zn powder. Afterwards, Brakealloy powders were design and produced by a mixture of sponge Fe with a low fusion point metals, such as Sn, Zn or Bi. By means of diffusion bonding, the liquid metal enters the sponge Fe creating the Brakealloy powders. Finally, in a last step, the substitution of a 4 % of metal powder by Carbon Fibers (CF) and the addition of high thermal conductivity graphite was carried out. In the present work the study of the influence of copper substitution on the tribo-performance of the friction material is presented, as well as its effect on the formation of the transfer layer formed on the friction surfaces. This transfer layer will be the responsible for the good friction performance and less wear of the pads. Besides, the friction material has to be designed in a way that a constant friction coefficient and good wear resistance could be maintained over a wide range of stressing conditions (pressure, speed, temperature). In order to evaluate the tribological properties of the brake pads they were all tested on the single-ended <b>inertia</b> full-scale brake <b>dynamometer</b> using the SAE J 2522 procedure. This way, the performance properties, such as friction, wear and sensitivity of friction towards load, speed and temperature were studied as per industrial practice. Wear of pads and discs was determined by a thickness change of the material during the friction test. In parallel, the pads manufactured at CEIT were tested in a new tribo-tester, Pin-On-Disk type, which was designed and built as part of this project. On the other hand, the microstructure and the composition of the transfer layer formed during friction were characterized by preparing different cross-sections using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique and using EDS analyses afterwards. For one of the samples, the transfer layer was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) so that, its nanostructure morphology could be determined. The Glancing Incidence X-ray Diffraction technique (GIXRD) and SEM-EDS were also used to characterize the surfaces of the worn pads and disc. The first friction test results showed that the formulation with Zn powder had a good friction behavior, with a stable friction coefficient and less wear of the material, which was related to the presence of zinc oxide and zinc sulfide in the transfer layer acting like lubricants at high temperature. Concurrently, the presence of metal sulfides and intermetallic metal-Sb compounds indicate the high effect that the chemical reactions between constituents have {{in the formation of the}} transfer layer, especially Sb 2 S 3 and metal powders. Those reaction products were also found in the section of the brake pads. In latter tests, the replacement of Cu by Brakealloy powders was observed to provide a higher friction coefficient and less fade resistance than copper base formulation, except for Brakealloy ZC, with Zn and Cu. Moreover, these formulations showed a higher wear of friction material and disk. This behavior was related to a low reactivity of these Brakealloys to react with Sb 2 S 3 due to the intermetallic phases formed in the fabrication of the Brakealloy powders. This, at the same time, is the responsible for a lower metal oxides concentration in the transfer layer coming from the oxidation of the Brakealloy. The replacement of Sb 2 S 3 by a lubricant based on SnS was also carried out in the selected formulations with Zn and Brakealloy Z, creating a more eco-friendly brake pad. Friction materials with SnS showed a better friction behavior at high temperatures, with a higher fade resistance in formulation with Brakealloy Z. No intermetallic compounds were determined when SnS lubricant was used, being this lubricant less reactive with metal powders than Sb 2 S 3. In the last tests, the replacement of Cu powder with alternatives metal powders such as Zn or Brakealloy Z, and addition of Carbon Fibers was successfully achieved. The formulation M 5 Lub 2 FC showed similar friction behaviour to the copper content reference material M 1 *. Moreover, the replacement of Sb 2 S 3 by a solid lubricant based on tin sulfide was successfully carried out overcoming a new legislation concerning Sb compounds. For further study of the chemical reactions between solid lubricants (Sb 2 S 3 and SnS) and metal powders (Cu, Sn, Fe, Zn and Brakealloys) binary mixtures containing same weight ratio of these metal powders and solid lubricants that pads contained, were prepared. This study was carried out by thermal analysis techniques, DSC-TGA. Additionally the binary mixtures were also conducted to different thermal treatments (in air and argon), and characterized by XRD technique afterwards. In general the same reaction products were determined in the brake pads and in the binary mixtures. Finally, one of the formulations designed in this PhD was validated by GAMA for a commercial use, showing good friction behavior and good results in the noise test. El objetivo principal de la presente tesis ha sido el estudio de la sustitución del polvo de cobre en pastillas de freno orgánicas de formulación bajo-metálico para su uso en vehículos. De este modo, se ha querido fabricar una pastilla de freno más respetuosa con el medioambiente de acuerdo a las leyes estadounidenses, que exigen la reducción del cobre de estos materiales a una cantidad menor del 5 % en peso para el 2021 y a 0, 5 % en peso para el 2025. Este trabajo es el resultado de un proyecto de colaboración con GAMA S. p. A., productor de pastillas de freno, Pometon S. p. A., fabricante de polvo metálico y el CEIT. La empresa italiana Pometon, que actualmente fabrica polvo de cobre y bronce para distintas formulaciones de pastillas de freno, ha financiado el proyecto sobre el que se sustenta esta tesis. El material de fricción desarrollado en este trabajo debía cumplir con las exigencias de los consumidores en cuanto a comportamiento en fricción y desgaste se refiere, es decir, proporcionar un coeficiente de fricción estable en un amplio rango de presión, velocidad y temperatura, así como un bajo desgaste de la pastilla y del disco de freno. Estas propiedades, a su vez, están relacionadas con la presencia de una capa de transferencia en la interfaz entre la pastilla y el disco. Dicha capa se forma, en gran medida, debido a la compactación de partículas debris desprendidas durante el frenado y presenta una composición química y una microestructura distinta a la de las pastillas. Así mismo, la capa de transferencia será la responsable de proporcionar un buen comportamiento en fricción y desgaste del material. En el presente trabajo, se presenta el estudio de la sustitución del polvo de cobre por constituyentes alternativos fabricados por Pometon. De este modo, en una primera fase se emplearon polvos de Sn, Fe esponja y Zn. Posteriormente, se diseñaron los polvos Brakealloy, formados por una mezcla de Fe esponja y metales de bajo punto de fusión (Sn, Zn o Bi). Los polvos Brakealloy fueron fabricados a partir de la difusión en estado líquido del Fe esponja con los metales mencionados. Finalmente, en una última fase, se estudió la sustitución del 4 % del polvo metálico por Fibras de Carbono (FC) de elevada estabilidad térmica para las formulaciones con Zn y Brakealloy Z (Fe-Zn), así como la adición de un grafito especial de elevada conductividad térmica. El efecto de la sustitución del cobre en el comportamiento tribológico de la pastilla se ha estudiado empleando el dinamómetro de inercia de acuerdo al test AK-Master SAE J 2522. El desgaste, por su parte, se ha determinado midiendo el cambio de espesores de las pastillas y de los discos tras dicho ensayo. Por otro lado, se ha llevado a cabo una caracterización de la capa de transferencia en cada uno de los discos, relacionando los compuestos determinados en dicha capa con el comportamiento tribológico que presenta el material. Además, se realizó un diseño y puesta en marcha de un dispositivo de ensayos de fricción/desgaste, similar a un Pin-on-disk en el CEIT, pero que permite el ensayo de piezas de mayor superficie, así como el empleo de condiciones de presión y velocidad más exigentes. Para la caracterización de la capa de transferencia se han utilizado las técnicas de difracción con ángulo rasante (GIXRD), perfilómetro y caracterización microestrutural mediante Microscopio Electrónico de Barrido (SEM) y análisis EDS. Además, se han preparado secciones transversales de los discos de freno mediante Focused Ion Beam (FIB) para su posterior caracterización mediante FEG-SEM. Así mismo, para un disco en concreto se preparó una lámina delgada o foil con el objetivo de caracterizar la nanoestrutura de la capa mediante Microscopía Electrónica de Transmisión (TEM). Los primeros ensayos de fricción realizados en el dinamómetro determinaron que la pastilla con polvo de Zn presentaba un buen comportamiento en fricción y el bajo desgaste observado fue atribuido a la presencia de óxido de Zn y sulfuro de Zn en la capa de transferencia, ya que se conoce que actúan como lubricantes a elevadas temperaturas. La formación de sulfuros metálicos y compuestos intermetálicos Metal-Sb, determinó la importancia de las reacciones tribo-químicas que tienen lugar entre los constituyentes de la pastilla, en especial el lubricante Sb 2 S 3 y los polvos metálicos, afectando en gran medida en la formación de la capa de transferencia. Dichas reacciones se observaron también en las secciones de las pastillas de freno. Posteriormente, se observó que la sustitución del Cu por polvos Brakealloy proporcionaba en todo los casos un coeficiente de fricción mayor que la formulación base con Cu, y una menor resistencia al fade, excepto para el Brakealloy ZC con Zn y Cu. Por otro lado, en general, el desgaste de las pastillas y discos fue mayor al emplear polvos Brakealloy. Este comportamiento se ha asociado a la menor reactividad de los polvos Brakealloy con el lubricante Sb 2 S 3, ya que las fases intermetálicas que presentan estos polvos, creadas debido a la difusión de los metales en el Fe esponja, dificultan la reacción con el lubricante disminuyendo, por tanto, la concentración de óxidos metálicos de la capa de transferencia. Además, se estudió la sustitución del Sb 2 S 3 por un lubricante sólido basado en sulfuro de estaño con el fin de reducir el contenido en compuestos de Sb en la pastilla debido a su carácter tóxico. Dicha sustitución se llevó a cabo para las formulaciones con Brakealloy Z y polvo de Zn ultrafino. Los resultados obtenidos mostraron un mejor comportamiento a fricción, en especial a elevadas temperatura, al emplear el lubricante SnS, aumentando la resistencia al fade para la formulación Brakealloy Z y, obteniendo en ambos casos un comportamiento similar al de la formulación base con Cu. En este caso, se determinó una menor reactividad del lubricante SnS con los polvos metálicos, sin que se llegara a formar ningún compuesto intermetálico, al contrario de lo que se había observado anteriormente con el Sb 2 S 3. En una última fase, se sustituyó el 4 % de polvo metálico Zn y Brakealloy Z por FC consiguiendo un coeficiente de fricción menor y más estable. De este modo, la formulación M 5 Lub 2 FC diseñada presentó un comportamiento en fricción muy similar al material de referencia con cobre. Paralelamente, se prepararon mezclas binarias con los lubricantes sólidos (Sb 2 S 3 y SnS) y adición de polvos metálicos (Cu, Fe, Zn, Sn y Brakealloys) para estudiar con detalle la reacción entre los lubricantes y los polvos metálicos. Este estudio se realizó mediante las técnicas de DSC-TGA y por difracción de rayos-X tras someter las mezclas a distintos tratamientos térmicos en aire y argón. En general se determinó que los productos obtenidos mediante estos tratamientos fueron los mismos que se determinaron en la capa de transferencia, a pesar de que las reacciones no se produjeron bajo las mismas condiciones (presión y fricción). Finalmente, GAMA realizó la validación industrial de una de las formulaciones desarrolladas en esta tesis, obteniéndose un buen comportamiento en fricción, incluso superior al demostrado en los ensayos de laboratorio mediante una ligera modificación de la matriz orgánica, tras ajustarla a una formulación comercial suya. Así mismo, el resultado del test de ruido fue satisfactorio...|$|R

The work has been performed in close cooperation with the Swedish wheelset manufacturer ABB SURA Traction AB, and it has resulted in one brake disc prototype and two different wheel prototypes. Theoretical and numerical investigations have been performed using analytical models and commercial FE-programs. The results are verified through full-scale laboratory and field experiments. An <b>inertia</b> <b>dynamometer</b> for testing of brake components (wheels, discs, pads) has been designed and constructed within the present project. A linear analytical model for calculating transient axisymmetric temperature distributions in finite hollow cylinders has been established. The model {{is used to calculate}} temperature histories during and after braking in a nonventilated solid steel disc and in a ventilated disc made of cast iron. The theoretical results agree reasonably well with the experimental results from dynamometer testing. The conclusion is that, under Swedish driving conditions, a forged solid steel disc may be a possible substitute for the more complicated and expensive ventilated disc. A railway wheel using flexible S-shaped steel spokes between hub and rim is suggested. The vertical dynamic behaviour of a two-axle freight car with such wheels is analyzed and compared to that of a freight car with standard solid wheels. Full-scale field experiments have been performed using wheels without and with wheelflats instrumented for measurement of transient vertical wheel/rail contact forces. Accelerations and strains in the track structure were measured in parallel. The location of the travelling instrumented wheelset in relation to the instrumented portion of the track was determined at each instant of time. Different train speeds and axle loads were tested. The flexible wheel was found to considerably reduce the impact loads {{in the presence of a}} wheelflat. In contrast to a standard solid wheel, no thermally induced residual stresses from block braking will occur in the rim of the flexible wheel. The wheel was also found to radiate less noise than a solid wheel. Calculated temperatures and deformations are verified through experiments on the <b>inertia</b> <b>dynamometer.</b> The performance of a so-called low stress wheel with hub-rim offset is investigated. By use of a two-level fractional factorial design, the influences of six selected geometrical variables (describing disc thickness, rim thickness, and hub-rim offset) are quantified. It is found that a low stress wheel offers high resistance to thermal and mechanical loads. Based on the present study, a first set of twelve forged rim-quenched low stress wheels has been produced. Brake tests have been performed and field testing is underway...|$|E
40|$|Roughness (corrugation, waviness) having {{circumferential}} {{wavelengths of}} 20 to 200 mm on the tread {{surface of a}} running railway wheel leads to vibrations in wheels, bogies and superstructure and also in rails, sleepers and roadbed. The vibrations radiate noise to the surroundings. The {{most efficient way to}} reduce the rolling noise would be to bring down the roughness on wheel tread and rail head. In the present work mechanisms causing wheel roughness are investigated. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments on an <b>inertia</b> <b>dynamometer</b> are presented. In these tests the influence of various parameters such as block material, wheel speed and braking force is investigated. The temperatures of the wheel tread and the temperatures and vibrations of the block are measured during braking. Tread surface temperatures are measured using IR techniques. The evolution of wheel tread roughness is measured after each braking cycle. Finally, the hardness of the tread is registered and the tread microstructure is determined by use of metallographic methods. In parallel to the experiments, a mathematical model of the interaction between brake block and wheel has been developed. Thermal loading, contact mechanics and surface wear are considered. A detailed understanding of the braking phenomena causing the growth of wheel roughness is aimed at. Countermeasures could then be developed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The thesis presents research into the understanding and improvement of heat dissipation from friction brakes. The investigations involved two brake types, {{considered to be the}} most thermally loaded and therefore most challenging; axle mounted high speed railway and commercial vehicle disc brakes. All three modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection and radiation) and airflow characteristics have been analysed experimentally and theoretically in order to increase the understanding of heat dissipation. Despite the very practical aspects of this research, a 'generic heat transfer approach' was applied, enabling wider engineering applications of the results. Experimental analyses conducted on a specially developed Spin Rig allowed measurements of cooling and airflow characteristics for different designs. Methodologies have been developed to determine thermal contact resistance, heat transfer coefficients, emissivity and aerodynamic (pumping) losses. Established values and relationships compared very favourably with theoretical work. Analytical, FE and CFD analyses were employed to further investigate design variations and perform sensitivity studies. <b>Inertia</b> <b>dynamometer</b> route simulations provided disc temperatures for validation of the overall work. Recommendations have been made for optimising heat dissipation, by proposing practically acceptable and economically viable design solutions. A proposed ventilated disc design efficiency ratio allows large, high speed ventilated disc designs, to be efficiently and accurately evaluated and compared, providing a valuable disc design optimisation tool. The determination of the methodologies, parameters and functions defining cooling characteristics, enable heat dissipation to be predicted confidently and accurately for brakes and other engineering assemblies at early design stages...|$|E
40|$|A waste audit study, using a {{modified}} protocol {{based on the}} U. S. EPA Waste Audit Guidelines, {{was carried out in}} a brake manufacturing facility, by observing and analyzing each of the process steps-mixing, preforming, molding, oven curing, cutting, grinding, drilling, wear evaluation, chamfering, and branding and packaging. Additionally, studies on waste minimization through recycling of the waste brake lining dust into the virgin mix and the effect of this recycling on subsequent product performance quality were also carried out. The audit showed that there was generation of waste at just about every step of the process, as evidenced by weight loss calculations on the original mix entering the process. For example, in the cutting step this loss was about 30 percent, in grinding it ranged from 10. 64 percent to 13. 03 percent, in drilling from 2. 17 percent to 6. 8 percent, and in chamfering from 0. 49 percent to 1. 07 percent; in the case of cutting this included both cutting residues and fines while {{in the rest of the}} cases these were only fines. Next, in evaluating the recycling of the fines, recycling 5 percent to 10 percent of the lining waste dust into the virgin mix retained the specific gravity of the brake lining samples well within the specification requirement range of 2. 12 to 2. 32. Additionally, <b>inertia</b> <b>dynamometer</b> tests were carried out on the linings produced from the 5 percent and 10 percent recycling mix, with the virgin mix as the control. The performance characteristics studied were effectiveness, fade, post-burnish effectiveness, post-fade effectiveness, and speed spread. Both the 5 percent and 10 percent recycled ones performed as good as the control one, although the S percent one exhibited lower green effectiveness and greater speed spread. Finally, based on an analysis of waste management and disposal costs, and in order also to minimize waste generation, a few simple process changes are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Wheelchair {{propulsion}} is {{an important}} part of daily living for many people with spinal cord injuries (SCI's). The aim of this project was to establish the validity of using a new approach for measuring wheelchair propulsion ability. The variation in methods observed by subject's hands in contacting and propelling their wheelchair, namely, using the push rims only; wedging the hands between push rims and tyre and grasping both push rims and tyres, highlighted that earlier studies using instrumented push rims (including the SMART) for people with tetraplegia would not provide a true indication of propulsion ability for the participants in this study. As a result, a new <b>inertia</b> <b>dynamometer</b> was built and calibrated for measuring wheelchair propulsion ability. Kinetic and kinematic models were developed to calculate wheelchair propulsion parameters such as power output, wheelchair velocity and arm motion patterns. After testing 22 subjects with different SCI levels, the results indicated that arm function was a more important factor in wheelchair propulsion, in terms of power output, than trunk stability and strength. More importantly, people with C 5 /C 6 tetraplegia had a significantly reduced capability in terms of wheelchair propulsion compared with other subjects with a lower lesion (T 1 -T 8, T 9 -T 12 and L 1 -S 5). A further study for quantifying the contribution of triceps function on improving wheelchair propulsion for people with tetraplegia was performed by comparing kinetic and kinematics parameters in C 5 /C 6 tetraplegia subjects. Depending on the control of elbow extension, the subjects were divided into groups with: no active elbow extension, deltoid to triceps transfer surgery (TROIDS) to provide elbow extension, and incomplete C 5 /C 6 tetraplegia with retained active triceps function providing elbow extension. The results demonstrated that the restoration of triceps following TROIDS surgery not only allows active elbow extension, but also increased the amplitude and strength as well as the speed of arm movement. Finally, the results also point to TROIDS allowing a more pronounced and natural push phase and an improved arm movement pattern during both propulsion and recovery phase under normal and extreme conditions...|$|E
40|$|Block braking is a {{commonly}} used braking system for freight wagons {{and other types}} of railway vehicles. One or several brake blocks are pressed against the tread (running surface) of the wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The kinetic energy of the running train is then transformed into heat, which is partitioned between block(s) and wheel and is conducted from block to block holder and from wheel to rail and also dissipated into the surroundings by convection and radiation. During the last decade, one aspect of block braking has become an environmental issue: the high rolling noise levels generated by trains with block braked wheels. A roughness (corrugation, waviness) develops on the wheel tread during the sliding contact between block and wheel, and this tread roughness (out-of-roundness) induces vibrations and noise when the train rolls. The roughness level strongly depends on the properties of the brake block material. Here cast iron blocks generate higher roughness levels than do composite and sinter blocks. In Europe, cast iron is presently the most commonly used brake block material on freight wagons, but composite and sinter materials are now gradually being introduced. In {{the first part of the}} present thesis, the thermomechanical interaction between brake block and wheel tread is studied to search for the mechanisms behind the growth of wheel roughness. The evolution of hot spots, i e areas on the wheel tread with significantly higher temperature than the rest of the tread, is believed to be a key phenomenon that can explain the differences between the different block materials. Results from full-scale tread braking experiments with forged wheels in an <b>inertia</b> <b>dynamometer</b> are reported. A numerical model for studying the thermoelastic contact between brake block and wheel tread demonstrates the principal phenomena. Also, results from field measurements of wheel roughness are presented. The tendency of cast iron brake blocks to generate high roughness levels on wheel treads has propelled a general shift away from cast iron to other materials which do not give disturbing roughness levels. However, this change of block material will affect the heat partitioning between wheel and block. Excessive heating of the wheel may cause damage and may result in problems with axial deflection of the wheel rim (change of wheelset gauge). High tensile stresses in the wheel rim after its cooling down can lead to initiation and growth of transverse cracks in the wheel rim. In the second part of the present thesis, a thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and block temperatures, including the cooling influence from the rail. Brake rig tests have been performed for drag braking at constant brake power for blocks made of cast iron and sinter and composite materials. Results on the influence of block configuration, brake power and brake speed on wheel and block temperatures are reported. Rolling contact heat transfer from wheel to rail is studied in the brake rig using a so-called rail-wheel in contact with the braked wheel, along with results from field tests. The model has been calibrated by using data from the experiments and can be employed to calculate temperatures and the heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail. The rail chill is found to have a considerable influence on the wheel temperature for long brake cycles. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can thus be calculated...|$|E
