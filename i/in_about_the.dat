5|$|Fenwick's {{beliefs are}} similar to Trollope's own. In his early life, the novelist was a {{supporter}} of the Tractarians. However, beginning <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mid-1860s, his sympathies tended increasingly toward the Broad church. He defended Bishop Colenso, expressed doubt about the literal truth of the Old Testament, and questioned the doctrine of eternal punishment contained in the Athanasian Creed.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{same time it}} takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been possible. <b>In</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E

5|$|Melbourne {{is a town}} in South Derbyshire {{close to}} the River Trent, which may have {{originated}} as buildings associated with the royal manor {{to the south of}} the nearby settlement at Kings Newton. Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date; there is an old tradition that the manor was originally established <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> year 900, during the reign of Alfred the Great, but there is no evidence for this. As recorded in the Domesday Book, the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King Edward the Confessor prior to the Norman Conquest. The property then passed into the hands of William I of England. After creating the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133, Henry I gave the manor for life to Æthelwold, the first bishop. Some time later, the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall. When Bishop Æthelwold died in about 1156, the manor reverted to the crown.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{arrived in}} Ceredigion in 1073–1074, {{and from the}} early twelfth century Norman {{political}} and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's. <b>In</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> year 1106, Ithel and Madoc, who were in alliance with King Henry I, ravaged all the county of Cardigan, as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, {{with the exception of}} Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanddewi Brefi. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its sanctuary, from which several of Owain ab Madoc’s men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, scarcely a generation after Rhygyfarch was writing his Life of St David, the clas had declined in its spiritual and pastoral life, and its political importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.|$|E
5|$|The see, if such {{it may be}} called, {{appears to}} have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into {{existence}} {{in the years after}} Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, <b>in</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> year 603, though this is an unreliable source. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops – Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present – to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion, possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives tell how the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saint’s foundation as its endowment.|$|E
