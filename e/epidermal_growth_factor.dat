5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues {{by a host}} cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown to}} activate the <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E

25|$|Tyrosine kinases play a {{particularly}} {{important role in}} cancer, and several agents that block their activity are now used as anti-cancer drugs, such as Imatinib or Gleevec. Among his contributions are the findings that cell surface receptors with tyrosine kinase activity signal across membrane by forming dimers when they bind to their growth factor activators. He discovered this in studies of the <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor (EGFR).

40|$|BackgroundMore {{than even}} before, the {{efficacy}} of <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> (EGFRs) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non–small-cell lung cancer patients carrying EGFR wild-type tumors has been under investigation. EGFR wild-type patients represent a large and heterogeneous group of patients. In this setting, {{the role played by}} high polysomy of chromosome 7 still remains controversial. Indeed, previous reports did not discriminate between chromosome 7 high polysomy and EGFR amplification and/or did not investigate the concurrent presence of EGFR and KRas mutations. MethodsWe retrospectively collected data from 163 patients analyzed for EGFR status (mutation, amplification, chromosome 7 trysomy, and polysomy), in addition to KRas mutation, between 2000 and 2010 in our institute. Erlotinib was administered to 73 of them. Objective responses and progression-free survivals to erlotinib were evaluated. ResultsHigh polysomy of chromosome 7 characterized 17 % (28 of 163) of EGFR/KRas wild-type tumors, independently of smoking status. In this group, 13 patients received erlotinib at progression. The treatment led one complete and four partial responses, and five stable diseases. Two patients progressed. One patient was lost to follow-up. The mean time to progression was 9 months. ConclusionAmong the EGFR wild-type population, when analyzed separately, high polysomy of chromosome 7 was the only molecular feature conferring clear signs of sensitivity to erlotinib. Therefore, the evaluation of high polysomy of chromosome 7 could become a helpful tool to predict for the benefit from <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> tyrosine kinase inhibitors in selected cases...|$|R
2500|$|Binding of FGF to FGFR phosphorylates {{the idle}} kinase and {{activates}} the RTK pathway.

[...] Ligands that bind to RTKs include fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> and stem cell factor. [...] This dimerizes the transmembrane receptor to another RTK receptor, which causes the autophosphorylation and subsequent conformational change of the homodimerized receptor. [...] This conformational change activates the dormant kinase of each RTK on the tyrosine residue. [...] Due {{to the fact that}} the receptor spans across the membrane from the extracellular environment, through the lipid bilayer, and into the cytoplasm, the binding of the receptor to the ligand also causes the trans phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor.|$|R
25|$|At {{least four}} {{different}} GPCR-linked proteins {{are known to}} respond to steroid hormones. G Protein-Coupled Receptor 30 (GPR30) binds estrogen, Membrane Progestin Receptor (mPR) binds progesterone, G Protein-Coupled Receptor Family C Group 6 Member A (GPRC6A) binds androgens, and Thyroid Hormone and Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) binds Thyroid hormone (though not technically steroid hormones, thyroid hormones can be grouped here because their receptors belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily). As {{an example of the}} effects of these GPCR-linked proteins consider GPR30.

In later years, she applied these methods to study a number of molecular relationships, such as the catalytic chain and bovine cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the src gene product of Rous avian and Moloney murine sarcoma viruses; antithrombin-III, alpha-antitrypsin, and ovalbumin; <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> and the light chain of coagulation factor X; and apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-I and C-III.|$|E

25|$|IGFBP-3 exerts {{antiproliferative}} {{effects in}} many cell types by blocking {{the ability of}} IGF-1 and IGF-2 to activate the IGF1R (which stimulates cell proliferation). For example, in esophageal epithelial cells, responsiveness to IGF-1 stimulation is suppressed by secreted IGFBP-3 and restored when IGFBP-3 is downregulated by <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor.</b> IGFBP-3 can also inhibit cell function by mechanisms that are independent of effects on IGF1R signaling, even in cells that entirely lack IGF1R. IGF (or IGF1R) independent effects are commonly studied using mutant forms of IGFBP-3 with decreased IGF binding affinity. Thus, IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in differentiating chondrocyte precursor cells is seen equally with a non-IGF binding IGFBP-3 mutant, demonstrating that the mechanism does not involve IGF binding. IGF1R-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 may involve the induction of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad and may be mediated by ceramides (pro-apoptotic lipids), or potentiate ceramide action IGFBP-3 interaction with nuclear hormone receptors may also lead to inhibition of cell proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Oral mucosa heals {{faster than}} skin, {{suggesting}} that saliva may have properties that aid wound healing. Saliva contains cell-derived tissue factor, and many compounds that are antibacterial or promote healing. Salivary tissue factor, associated with microvesicles shed from {{cells in the}} mouth, promotes wound healing through the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. The enzymes lysozyme and peroxidase, defensins, cystatins and an antibody, IgA, are all antibacterial. Thrombospondin and some other components are antiviral. A protease inhibitor, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, is present in saliva and is both antibacterial and antiviral, and a promoter of wound healing. Nitrates that are naturally found in saliva break down into nitric oxide on contact with skin, which will inhibit bacterial growth. Saliva contains growth factors such as <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor,</b> VEGF, TGF-β1, leptin, IGF-I, lysophosphatidic acid, hyaluronan and NGF, which all promote healing, although levels of EGF and NGF in humans are much lower than those in rats. In humans, histatins may play a larger role. As well as being growth factors, IGF-I and TGF-α induce antimicrobial peptides. Saliva also contains an analgesic, opiorphin. Licking will also tend to debride the wound and remove gross contamination from the affected area.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) have the {{capability}} to self-renew and to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages. Many culture methods have been developed for directing NSC differentiation; however, the creation of biomaterials for directing NSC differentiation is seen as a more clinically relevant and usable technology. One approach to develop a biomaterial for directing NSC differentiation is to combine extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors. A very recent study by Nakajima, Ishimuro et al. examined the effects of different molecular pairs consisting of a growth factor and an ECM component on the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes and neuronal cells. The ECM components investigated were laminin-1 and fibronectin, which are natural ECM components, and ProNectin F plus (Pro-F) and ProNectin L (Pro-L), which are artificial ECM components, and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The neurotrophic factors used were <b>epidermal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (EGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The pair combinations were immobilized onto matrix cell arrays, on which the NSCs were cultured. After 2 days in culture, the cells were stained with antibodies against nestin, β-tubulin III, and GFAP, which are markers for NSCs, neuronal cells, and astrocytes, respectively. The results provide valuable information on advantageous combinations of ECM components and growth factors as a practical method for developing a biomaterial for directing differentiation of NSCs.|$|E

After transformation in E. coli HB 101 (recA 13), the resulting heteroduplex plasmid served as the template in plasmid replication. Two different plasmid progenies bearing either the human or mouse EGF-coding sequence were identified by colony hybridization using the appropriate probes.
