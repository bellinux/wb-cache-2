40|$|In {{this paper}} we show that, similar to NYSE/AMEX stocks, NASDAQ stocks exhibit {{significant}} <b>ex</b> <b>date</b> returns for reverse stock splits. Although the 10 -day cumulative return after the <b>ex</b> <b>date</b> {{is close to}} - 10 %, this does not violate market efficiency, because the average bid-ask spread for the reverse split stock is at least double this return. We also document that these large negative returns are mostly due to {{a drop in the}} ask price while bid prices barely change at all. Furthermore, the <b>ex</b> <b>date</b> returns are negatively related to trading volume. These results suggest that there is abnormal selling and a significant buildup of market makers' inventories near the <b>ex</b> <b>date.</b> To reduce the inventory buildup, market makers lower ask prices to induce buying by investors, resulting in the observed negative returns. Lowering bid prices, an alternative strategy for reducing inventories, is not attractive to market makers due to competitive factors and the reduction of commissions associated with a smaller number of transactions. Notably, selling investors have no incentives to sell their stocks early to avoid the observed negative <b>ex</b> <b>date</b> return, since this return is largely an ask price phenomenon and does not represent realized returns to sellers.

Although prior studies focus on ex post determinants of equity carve-out and initial public offering returns, our study is the first to explore ex ante predictors of equity carve-out returns. We use three primary variables: filing range adjustments, the percentage of the offering used to retire subsidiary debt or to pay dividends, and the CBOE Volatility Index (VXO) to predict initial returns. We show that 11 - 35 % of the variation in market-adjusted equity carve-out returns can be predicted using public information known prior to the offer date.

40|$|This article {{shows that}} some of the wealth gains from {{financial}} decisions involving changes in security form occur on predictable ex dates. For a sample of 113 spinoffs during 1964 to 1990, we document an average excess return of 3. 0 percent on ex dates, roughly the same magnitude as the average announcement-date return. We conjecture that the spinoff ex-date return arises because the parent and subsidiary stocks attract different investors who prefer to buy the separated shares after the <b>ex</b> <b>date.</b> We also document that, on average, the target shareholders in stock-for-stock mergers earn an excess return of 1. 5 percent on merger ex dates.

40|$|The {{increases}} in volatility after stock splits have long puzzled researchers. The usual suspects of discreteness and bid-ask spread {{do not provide}} a complete explanation. We provide new clues to solve this mystery by examining the trading of when-issued shares that are available before the split. When-issued trading permits noise traders to compete with a more homogenous set of traders, decreasing the volatility of the stock before the split. Following the split, these noise traders reunite in one market and volatility increases. Thus, the higher volatility after the <b>ex</b> <b>date</b> of a stock split {{is a function of}} the introduction of when-issued trading, the new lower price level after the split date, and the increased activity of small-volume traders around a stock split. 2004 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two essays examining the roles of corporate governance and investor disagreement, respectively, in the performance and stock market valuations of firms. In the first chapter, I demonstrate {{that the relationship between}} corporate governance and firm performance varies with industry performance cycles. Firms with strong shareholder rights capture higher profits than poorly-governed firms in the same industry during highly profitable periods for the industry, but both groups have similar profits during weaker industry conditions. Analyst forecasts indicate that the pattern is expected, suggesting that the higher valuations of well-governed firms are due to this higher expected productivity in good times. Consistent with such expectations and with an updating of valuations as anticipated industry conditions change, positive abnormal stock returns to good governance are concentrated in periods of high industry returns, and are at least partially reversed during industry downturns. My results provide an alternative to learning and static risk theories in explaining the apparent abnormal returns to governance and their disappearance after 2001. In Chapter 2, I consider the impact of heterogeneous shareholder beliefs on stock prices, focusing on the context of corporate spin-offs and mergers. I extend theoretical work by Miller (1977) and Jarrow (1980) to show that when investors disagree about the prospects of different businesses and {{at least some of them}} are restricted from short-selling, the market price of an unseparable bundle of two enterprises will often be lower from the sum of the prices at which they would trade as standalone entities. Empirically, I construct a novel measure of observed disagreement that is informed by the theory and is less open to alternative interpretations than existing disagreement proxies. Consistent with the theory, I find that higher disagreement about the two components being either separated or joined is related to a positive return in the case of spin-offs and a negative return in stock mergers. Importantly, since I focus on returns on the <b>ex</b> <b>date</b> of these transactions, on which no new business information is released, these findings are unrelated to the expected business impact of the transactions. by Tara Kumari Bhandari.

The integrated primary production {{in the water column}} was as high as 197 mmolC/(m(2). d) in the Chukchi shelf and was 3. 8 mmolC/(m(2). d) in the Canada Basin. These rates are higher than those reported previously. The ratios of bacterial production to primary production In the study region were higher than 0. 5, indicating that microbial activity is not depressed but important in cold Arctic waters. Th- 234 /U- 238 disequilibria were evident at the station in the Canada Basin. The presence of significant Th- 234 deficiency suggested that scavenging and removal processes are also important to biogeochemical cycles of trace elements in the Arctic Ocean. Particulate organic carbon export flux was estimated to be 1. 0 mmolC/(m(2). d). Measurements of sediment excess Pb- 210 profile in the Chukchi shelf allowed us to estimate the amount of organic carbon buried in the bottom sediment, which ranged from 25 to 35 mmolC/(m(2). d) and represented about 59 %- 82 % of the mean primary production in the euphotic zone.

50|$|The ex voto of Daochos was the sculpted ex voto of the tetrarch of Thessaly Daochos II to the god Apollo, {{which had}} been placed in the Treasury of the Thessalians to the {{northeast}} of the temple of Apollo in Delphi. The <b>ex</b> voto <b>dates</b> probably between 339 and 334 B.C., in the time when Daochos II was hieromnemon of Pharsalus in the Delphic Amphictyony. Other dates have, however, been proposed. Initially it was thought that the ex voto stood free. However, recent studies concluded that the monument was probably situated within the Treasury of the Thessalians, built around 361 B.C. by Agelaus. The ex voto had the form of a sculpted complex comprising nine figures: eight members of the family of Daochos and one of a god, possibly of Apollo. All figures were accompanied by inscriptions which facilitated their identification. Only the god's figure does not bear an inscription. The figures presented are those of Acnonius, Agias, Telemachus, Agelaus, Daochus I, Sisyphus I, Daochus II and Sisyphus II. The presence of Agias in this group led the scholars to attribute the entire complex to the workshop of Lysippus, as the latter had created a statue of the Thessalian leader in Pharsalus.|$|R

40|$|Suppose each of n men and n {{women is}} located {{at a point in}} a metric space. A woman ranks the men in order of their {{distance}} to her from closest to farthest, breaking ties at random. The men rank the women similarly. An interesting problem is to use these ranking lists and find a stable matching in the sense of Gale and Shapley. This problem formulation naturally models preferences in several real world applications; for example, dating sites, room renting/letting, ride hailing and labor markets. Two key questions that arise in this setting are: (a) When is the stable matching unique without resorting to tie breaks? (b) If X is the distance between a randomly chosen stable pair, what is the distribution of X and what is <b>E(X)</b> ? We study <b>dating</b> sites and ride hailing as prototypical examples of stable matchings in discrete and continuous metric spaces, respectively. In the dating site model, each person is assigned to a point on the k-dimensional hypercube based on their answers to a set of binary k questions. We consider two different metrics on the hypercube: Hamming and Weighted Hamming. Under both metrics, there are exponentially many stable matchings when k = n. There is a unique stable matching, with high probability, under the Hamming distance when k = Î©(n^ 6), and under the Weighted Hamming distance when k > (2 +Ïµ) n for some Ïµ> 0. In the ride hailing model, passengers and cabs are modeled as points on the line and matched based on Euclidean distance.
