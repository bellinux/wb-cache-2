40|$|The {{first part}} of the {{dissertation}} is related to a study of the failure mechanisms of <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welds.</b> Cost savings can be gained by minimizing the weld length. However, improperly sized welds can result in the loss of structural integrity of the welded components. The necking/shear failure modes for the mid-sections of <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welds</b> in lap-shear specimens of HSLA steel are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed with the geometric characteristics of the heat affected zones (HAZ) designed to match the micrographs of the cross sections for the welds. The distributions of the void volume fraction near the welds shown from the finite element analyses are consistent with the failure modes observed in the experiments. Further finite element analyses showed that the geometric characteristics of the HAZ are key factors for the resulting failure location. The mode I and mode II stress intensity factor (SIF) solutions for <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welds</b> in lap-shear specimens are investigated by the analytical solutions and by finite element analyses. The computational results indicate that the SIF solutions for realistic welds are lower than the analytical solutions for idealized weld geometry. Further finite element analyses were carried out in order to obtain the computational SIF solutions for the realistic weld geometries with dissimilar sheet thicknesses. Finally, three-dimensional computational results indicate that the distributions of the SIF solutions for discontinuous welds are different from those for continuous welds. In the second part, a computational model is developed for simulations of representative volume element specimens of lithium-ion battery modules under in-plane constrained compression tests. The model allows for computational efficiency while simulating the overall mechanical response of battery modules and the deformation patterns of the heat dissipater. The model is based on the properties of the heat dissipater, the foam, and the macro behavior of the cell components. The computational results compare fairly well with the experimental results. Further finite element analyses showed the increase in the initial nominal buckling stress under dynamic loading conditions...|$|R

5|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E

Use of dissimilar currents facilitates effective utilisation of heat. The two-stage arcing in twin-wire welding facilitates slow heating and cooling that leads to weld metal and heat affected zone softening. A combination of polygonal ferrite, pearlite and bainite with varying compositions is observed across the weldment.

5|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

Microstructural characterization of the welds revealed that electromagnetic stirring (EMS) increases the content of austenite in both weld center and high temperature heat affected zone (HTHAZ). It induced a grain refining effect during freezing of the ferritic matrix which in turn enabled more sites for nucleation of austenite. This mechanism of solidification was reflected {{in an increase in}} the mechanical strength of the welds. Besides, the extent of the HTHAZ was reduced and its microhardness increased when applying the external magnetic field.

Studies of inclusion composition using energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the transmission electron microscope were also performed. It was found that increasing oxygen content of the weld metal (due to increased oxygen in the shielding gas) led to increased non-metallic inclusion size and volume fraction; which in turn, led to both decreasing strength and toughness. The strength was lowered because increasing oxygen in the shielding gas led to increased 'consumption' of strengthening alloys such as carbon, manganese and silicon.

This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> {{began to be}} understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It {{was not until the}} 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a bare electrode wire and direct current, and used arc voltage to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E

The FE model predicts the deformation of the weld, heat-affected zone and parent plate based on the combined effects of elastic softening, plastic softening and creep.

Recently low-cost open-source <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>weld</b> (GMAW) RepRap 3 D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current.

5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E

40|$|During welding, {{residual}} stresses build-up {{created by the}} steep thermal gradient that occurs in the weld zone from localized heating and cooling, and phase transformations appearing in low-alloyed structural steel is inevitable. Welding of rather simple test plates do not cover the actual structural effects, which {{have to be considered}} during real component welding. However, the resulting welding-induced residual stress state is highly influenced by the structural characteristics, i. e. restraint conditions, of the welded construction.

40|$|Conventional {{assessment}} of welded joint impact toughness, {{as defined in}} relevant standards for welding procedure qualification is based on testing of real specimens taken from base metal, weld metal, and heat affected zone.

In addition, from general welding metallurgy knowledge {{it is well known}} that most weakened microstructure of welded joint, e. g. within heat affected zone is coarse-grained zone where maximum temperatures reach around 1300 °C.
