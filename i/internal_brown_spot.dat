40|$|The {{behavior}} of the Irish potato variety "Eigenheimer" in the State of São Paulo has been studied. This variety grows well under the soil and climatic conditions present in potato areas of this state. Eigenheimer is an early maturing variety and a good yielder. The tubers sprout readily in storage, permitting two plantings in a year to be made with same seed. It is susceptible to virus diseases, early and late blight, bacterial wilt, common scab, and root-knot nematode. It shows a tendency to develop second growth, and under rainy and hot weather is subject to <b>internal</b> <b>brown</b> <b>spot.</b> The tubers of Eigenheimer are deep-eyed, and {{a large percentage of}} the crop consists of average and small-sized tubers. Trie marketing value of the Eigenheimer potato equals that of Konsuragis, Parana Ouro, and Voran, being higher than that of white-fleshed varieties, but lower than the value of Bintje and Eersteling...|$|E
40|$|Potato tubers {{are low in}} calcium due {{to limited}} calcium {{transport}} in the xylem and immobility of calcium in the phloem. Low tuber calcium content results in the occurrence of necrotic cells in the medullary tissues, which is a physiological disorder known as <b>internal</b> <b>brown</b> <b>spot</b> (IBS). A high incidence of IBS results in reduced tuber quality and market value. The objective {{of the study was}} to apply additional calcium to the potato crop using different calcium sources (gypsiferous mine water, gypsum and calcium rich water) to determine the impact on tuber yield and quality. Commercial field trials were conducted at Kleinkopje mine on the Mpumalanga Highveld from August 2001 to January 2002 and from September 2002 to January 2003. The response of the potato cultivar Up-to-date to irrigation with gypsiferous mine water as a calcium source was investigated. At Kleinkopje there was no control field (irrigated with normal water) for direct comparison. Another field trial was established at University of Pretoria Experimental Farm where gypsum at four levels was broadcast and incorporated prior to planting. Pot trials were conducted under controlled conditions because calcium uptake is not affected only by the amount of calcium applied or the location of the calcium application. Factors that affect calcium uptake such as temperature and humidity also play a role. Two pot experiments were conducted under controlled conditions from July to October 2002 and from October 2002 to January 2003. In these experiments, the effect of applying increasing calcium concentrations in calcium rich water at high (27 / 17 oC) and low (22 / 14 oC) controlled temperatures and humidities (35 % and 85 %) on tuber calcium content and quality were investigated. The parameters measured included growth analysis, leaf and tuber chemical analysis, tuber yield and quality. For the field trials soil sampling was done at the beginning and at the end of the cropping season for chemical analysis. Irrigation with gypsiferous mine water did not have a negative impact on overall potato growth. Higher levels of calcium (in irrigation water or gypsum) also did not have a negative effect on other nutrient levels. Irrigating potato plants with gypsiferous mine water resulted in high tuber yields of 52 t/ha in 2001 and 62 t/ha in 2002 seasons, which are good yields for Mpumalanga. Applying higher gypsum levels as a preplant broadcast resulted in high tuber yields (52 t/ha), which is a good yield for Hatfield. Application of gypsum as a preplant broadcast and irrigation with gypsiferous mine water resulted in good quality tubers (SG > 1. 075 and chip colour > 45). This implies that gypsiferous mine water can possibly be used for irrigation of potatoes as a calcium source. The calcium nutrition of the potato tubers was not affected by the amount of calcium applied to the plants, calcium uptake or distribution within the plant only. Environmental conditions (temperature and humidity), which affect these functions also played a role. It has been discovered that lowering the temperature (22 / 14 oC) and low humidity (35 %) had beneficial effects on the tuber yield. Maintaining plants at low temperature (22 / 14 oC) and high humidity (85 %) could improve the tuber quality. However, high humidity (85 %) and high temperature (27 / 17 oC) improved calcium uptake by the tubers. Dissertation (MSc (Agric) Agronomy) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|É comum observar-se, em diferentes variedades de batatinha (Solanum tuberosum L.), principalmente quando cultivadas no chamado "período das águas", setembro-fevereiro, a presença de manchas ferruginosas no {{interior}} dos tubérculos, vulgarmente conhecidas pela denominação de "chocolate". Com a finalidade de constatar qual a região da batatinha onde 4 elas se localizam, e de correlacionar a presença das manchas aos característicos externo* tais como aspereza da película, presença de brotos novos necrosados e, ainda, com o tamanho e forma dos tubérculos, foram feitas observações em diversas variedades e em clones criados no Instituto Agronômico.

The following results were obtained : a) the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> appears to be closely related to the variety and weather conditions during the growing season; varieties such as Konsuragis and Ultimus give high percentages of <b>internal</b> <b>brown</b> <b>spots</b> when grown in the socalled rainy season (September to February).

40|$|Neste artigo são apresentados os resultados de 10 experiências de adubação da batatinha (Solanum tuberosum L.), com doses crescentes de fósforo (30, 60, 90, 120, 180 e 240 kg/ha de P 2 O 5) na presença de nitrogênio e potássio. Essas experiências foram conduzidas entre os anos de 1943 e 1947, sendo duas em vasos, na Estação Experimental Central, Campinas, e oito no campo, em diferentes áreas de quatro localidades do Estado de São Paulo. O efeito do fósforo foi geralmente muito bom, alcançando + 42 % em média de todas as doses e das oito experiências de campo. Na média geral a produção aumentou em ritmo acelerado até quando se usou a dose de 120 kg/ha; com as doses seguintes continuou aumentando, mas em ritmo cada vez mais moderado, de sorte que a partir de 180 kg/ha permaneceu pràticamente no mesmo nível. Distinguindo as experiências feitas em solos ainda não adubados das conduzidas em áreas já adubadas com fósforo nas culturas anteriores, nas primeiras a produção cresceu quase linearmente com as doses experimentais dêsse nutriente, enquanto nas últimas ela tendeu a estabilizar-se quando essas doses foram superiores a 120 kg/ha. Estimativa sumária indicou que, considerando a média de tôdas as experiências, as doses mais lucrativas de P 2 O 5 seriam de 120 - 150 kg/ha; nos solos ainda não adubados elas seriam superiores a 150 kg/ha, baixando para 100 - 120 kg/ha nos já adubados. A adubação fosfatada aumentou o tamanho dos tubèrculos e seu teor de fósforo, mas não lhes alterou o teor de fécula e a capacidade de conservação; não influiu, também, na incidência de manchas internas ("chocolate"). This paper {{reports the}} results {{obtained}} in two pot and eight field experiments with potatoes, which were conducted from 1943 to 1947 and designed to study the effect of increasing rotes of superphosphate (30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 kilograms of P 2 O 5 per hectare) {{in the presence of}} nitrogen ond potash (ammonium sulphate and sulphate of potassium). The pot tests were conducted in the Central Experiment Station, Campinas, and the field trials were carried out on different areas of four localities of the State of São Paulo. The responses to phosphorus were generally very good and the average of all the rates of the field experiments reached + 42 %. In the average the yields increosed rapidly when the doses of P 2 O 5 were raised up to 120 kilograms per hectare, continued increasing, but more and more slowly, till the 180 kilograms dose, and kept practically unchanged with higher doses. Distinguishing the experiments localized on soils fertilized with phosphorus in the previous crops from those conducted on soils which were never fertilized, in the former group the tendency was far the yields to keep unchanged with doses higher than 120 kilograms, while in the latter the yields increased even when the highest experimental rate was used. According to the current prices and the general average of the eight field experiments, the most profitable rates af P 2 Or, application would vary from 120 to 150 kilograms per hectare; for the soils previously fertilized with phosphorus the applications should be of about 100 - 120 kilograms whereas over 150 kilograms could be used profitably in the never fertilized soils. The phosphorus fertilization increased the size of the tubers and their phosphorus content, but did not modify the density, the capacity of conservation and the starch content of them, nor did it influence the incidence of <b>internal</b> <b>brown</b> <b>spots...</b>|$|R

No significant difference in the primary metabolites was observed between the different levels of the applied preharvest applications. Early during storage, fruit developed browning, with the severity increasing with storage duration. This was correlated with a group of primary metabolites that showed either an increase (e. g., alanine, galactose, mannitol, sorbitol, xylose) or a decrease (e. g., malate, sucrose) in concentration with time. Radial distribution of the metabolites in the fruit tissue was also observed; some metabolites (e. g., galactose, mannitol) were higher in concentration in the inner cortex, while the concentrations of other metabolites (e. g., mannose, sucrose) were higher in the outer cortex. status: publishe...|$|R

Enzymatic activities were measured on fruit protein extracts and PPO and POD isoforms separated on mini-gels (PhastSystem). Only PPO activity was significantly enhanced in the presence of IB. Up to six PPO isoforms were identified in the susceptible varieties. PPO was barely detectable in the nonsusceptible variety MD 2 and in controls. The number of PPO isoforms and the total PPO activity after chilling are varietal characteristics. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
