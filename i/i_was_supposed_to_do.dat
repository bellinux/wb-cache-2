[...] On September 7, 2010, United States women's national team head coach Pia Sundhage named a 30-player roster for two matches against China in October. The roster would then be narrowed down to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament. The players would take part in a training camp before the two matches starting on September 20. Although Harris was not one of the four goalkeepers on this preliminary roster, she was called into camp on September 23 to replace Hope Solo, who was recovering from a shoulder surgery. She was then named to the 24-player roster for the team's second match against China on October 6 in Philadelphia, although she did not dress for the match.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 35). Moodle is actually an open source web application for producing internet-based courses and websites. It is a Course Management System (CMS). Moodle is written in PHP. It runs on nearly every available server platform, {{and can be used}} by anyone with a Web browser. Moodle uses sound pedagogical principles to help educators create an online community which will be virtual but will give the feelings of real. It is a free and Open Source software package. The software can be customized into user’s use. Moodle is basically implemented in university course, a secondary school class, a professional association or company doing training. The challenge of my project was to learn different features of Moodle – how to use them efficiently and use of them properly. Secondly, how to install Moodle in a machine – to teach people the whole Moodle setup procedure. Lastly, to provide the teachers the overall guidelines of using Moodle without any difficulty.

30|$|Another {{example is}} Saskia, a 35 -year-old Dutch woman who {{developed}} a burnout and lost her job. “The stress, the constant ‘I {{have to do}} this, I have to do that’.. Everything for my career. So there you are at 34 with a burnout. I couldn’t work anymore.. My friends.. I had always worked, all my friends were from work. I lost them too. I was alone, could hardly pay the mortgage. So I went to buy stuff, food, lots of Chinese food, for like 4 people. Debts, debts.. Just to think that those friendships were not real, they dropped me like a hot brick when I lost my job. None of them call me. People only care if you have money, if you are successful. They ran {{as soon as they}} knew. Well, it was all a lie. All that stress and hard work for nothing, I don’t buy nothing for it now.” Interesting in this example is how previous experiences which used to feel meaningful, lost their meaning and purpose. All her hard work resulted in developing a burnout, losing her job and friends. “I always did what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> get good grades, get a good job, work hard.. It got me nowhere. Now I don’t know who to listen to anymore.” In this last excerpt Saskia positions herself as a passive actor in her own life story, doing what she is supposed to, not as the author of her own life story.|$|E
40|$|Although Mathematics {{is seen as}} one of {{the most}} {{important}} knowledge and school subject, it is believed that math teaching in school is very much of abstract nature and does not promote critical and analytical thinking skills. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a research about problem solving approaches in afghan schools, in Kabul city. So three points were very important to know: teachers’ points of view about mathematic knowledge and problem solving approaches, teachers practice while they teach problems in their classes, and mathematics examples and their solutions in text books. I made three tools: questionnaire, structured observation and table for analyzing the books and I use them relatively for each aforementioned purpose. Views of 100 teachers (from 16 schools in Kabul, half female and half male teachers) through questionnaire; observing math teaching of five teachers teaching in classrooms (out of the 100); and identifying problem solving approaches in math text book of grade 7 were the main data. It was found that most of the teachers think that mathematic is a way that promotes students’ problem solving ability and their critical thinking beyond mathematics. While observing teachers’ classes it was seen that they teach mathematics as an abstract [...] On the other hand, they used problem solving approaches in a very weak level. Moreover the newly revised books contain examples that were solved directly by implementing the formula and most of the examples were mathematics examples not in other subject. Generally one can say that the teachers know about the value of mathematics to some extent, but they do not implement in their teaching. It means that they teach and follow what they see in the book and they do not use other material beside text book. Finally, the main reason behind the problems that could be seen in teaching and learning mathematics is in teaching methods and in the examples on the books. In spite of differences between teaching practices and views on math, it is promising that teachers’ express about importance of mathematics as well as of problem solving approaches to math teaching. These findings require further studies revealing the roots of the real problems of math teaching and learning...|$|E
