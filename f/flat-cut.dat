40|$|Multiple cultivations {{lead to a}} {{repeated}} physical damage of the thistle. Each time it regrows, it uses further nutrients until it is weakened and a new crop will out-compete it. This method is also effective against other root-spreading weeds such as couch grass and bindweeds. •	After harvesting grains, perform stubble cultivation with a skim plough or a completely <b>flat-cutting</b> wing share cultivator {{at a depth of}} 7 - 10 cm. •	After the thistle plants have re-emerged (maximum 10 cm), repeat the cultivation 1 - 2 times while increasing the working depth. •	Sow a dense, fast-growing catch crop such as vetch or fodder radish after the stubble cultivation to further weaken the thistles. This method only works on dry soils and in dry weather; in wet conditions, it can lead to an increase in thistles...|$|R
50|$|The gennaker {{has been}} around for several decades now, and as the name suggests, it is a hybrid between a genoa and an {{asymmetrical}} spinnaker. A brand name of North Sails, the gennaker started as a cruising sail based on the Code 0 spinnakers used on racing boats. Gennakers and similar code 0 variants offered by other makers are even larger than genoas (200% overlaps are not uncommon), and they have a much greater camber for generating larger amounts of lift when reaching. <b>Flat-cut</b> gennakers can be effective for angles as low as 60-70 degrees. Spinnakers perform much better when running because the main sail blocks the wind of gennaker above 135-150 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The indexed {{shifting}} of a bicycle derailleur {{needs to be}} exact. A typical 7-speed shifter changes the cable length by either 2.9 mm (Shimano 2:1) or 4.5 mm (SRAM 1:1) for each shift, and any length errors accumulate {{with the number of}} shifts. To this end, the housing needs to behave {{as if it were a}} solid tube, so it, and its end-pieces have to be compressionless. Currently, the most commonly used compressionless housing for gear shifting has longitudinally spaced steel wires. The <b>flat-cut</b> ends of such housing are tight-terminated with end caps or ferrules, and the ends caps are sized to fit either into a fixture on the frame, or as a loose fitting in the end of a barrel adjuster.|$|E
5000|$|The head can be handmade, cast or die struck, {{and it is}} {{made from}} some type of {{precious}} metal, such as gold, silver and platinum. Heads used to prong set a gemstone {{come in a variety}} of sizes and shapes, depending on the shape of the gemstone, the size of the gemstone, or whether or not the gemstone is faceted or cabochon shaped. Common shapes of heads used in stone setting include round, oval, emerald cut, princess cut, marquise cut, pear shaped and trillian cut. V-shaped prongs are recommended for a marquise-cut or pear-shaped stone, while flat prongs are recommended for a <b>flat-cut</b> emerald. [...] A prong setting holds the gem securely while allowing the gem to be struck with more light and from more angles, increasing the brilliance of the gemstone.|$|E
40|$|Objective. Compare {{the initial}} {{stability}} at the fusion site of ankle arthrodesis fixed with {{two and three}} screws. Design. Finite element models of ankle arthrodesis were developed from computed tomography images. Two-screw constructs were augmented with a third screw in different orientations and Subjected to loads likely to affect the ankle postoperatively. Background More stable fixation seems to increase the chance of fusion, as it minimises the motion between the tibiotalar interfaces. Methods. Non-linear elastic finite element analyses were performed in external torsion and dorsiflexion. The micromotions at the tibiotalar interface were computed to compare the two- and three-screw fixation in intact and <b>flat-cut</b> arthrodesis. Results. Adding a third screw reduced the micromotions at the fusion site. Inserting the third screw anteriorly predicted lower peak micromotions than inserting the screw posteriorly, except for the intact arthrodesis tested in dorsiflexion. Three-screw intact arthrodesis predicted lower peak micromotions than <b>flat-cut</b> arthrodesis. Conclusions. Better stability was predicted for three-screw ankle arthrodesis. In <b>flat-cut</b> arthrodesis, a third screw inserted anteriorly performed better than a posterior screw. In intact arthrodesis, a posterior screw seemed a better option when flexion stability was the main concern. Even with three-screw fixation, {{the configuration of the}} first two-crossed screws may still be important to improve the stability at the fusion site. Relevance The optimal number and placement of screws in ankle arthrodesis has yet to be determined. The differences in stability predicted between various screw configurations and Surface preparation techniques presented here may be the difference between success and failure. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Nanosecond, megavolt-per-meter {{electric}} pulses cause permeabilization {{of cells}} to small molecules, {{programmed cell death}} (apoptosis) in tumor cells, and are under evaluation {{as a treatment for}} skin cancer. We use nanoelectroporation and fluorescence imaging to construct two-dimensional maps of the electric field associated with delivery of 15 ns, 10 kV pulses to monolayers of the human prostate cancer cell line PC 3 from three different electrode configurations: single-needle, five-needle, and <b>flat-cut</b> coaxial cable. Influx of the normally impermeant fluorescent dye YO-PRO- 1 serves as a sensitive indicator of membrane permeabilization. The level of fluorescence emission after pulse exposure is proportional to the applied electric field strength. Spatial electric field distributions were compared in a plane normal to the center axis and 15 - 20 μm from the tip of the center electrode. Measurement results agree well with models for the three electrode arrangements evaluated in this study. This live-cell method for measuring a nanosecond pulsed electric field distribution provides an operationally meaningful calibration of electrode designs for biological applications and permits visualization of the relative sensitivities of different cell types to nanoelectropulse stimulation.

40|$|Background: Despite uniform {{operating}} techniques, {{lack of fusion}} still occurs after ankle arthrodesis. Differences in {{the biological}} healing potential may be a factor but the mechanical performance of the arthrodesis construct because of varying bone quality also may be important. Internal compression techniques are preferred because of higher union rates, shorter fusion times, and fewer complications. A three-screw configuration {{has been shown to}} be more stable than a two-screw configuration, but it is not obvious when it should be used. Methods: Three-dimensional finite element models of intact and <b>flat-cut</b> ankle arthrodeses were built, using two and three screws in different configurations. Poor bone quality was simulated by decreasing Young’s modulus of the bone. The constructs were loaded in torsion and dorsiflexion, and micromotions at the fusion site were measured. Results: Bone quality had a marked effect on the stability at the arthrodesis site. Inserting two screws at 30 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the tibia in an intact arthrodesis seemed the best option, especially as bone quality worsened. The addition of a third screw increased the stability at the arthrodesis site. Conclusions: Overall, intact joint surfaces and three-screw fixation, with the lateral and medial screws inserted produced the most stable arthrodesis constructs when bone quality was poor. Clinical Relevance. Ankle arthrodeses are technically demanding because of the shape and small size of the talus. Preoperative planning is an absolute necessity to determine placement and number of screws. This study shows that poor bone quality decreases the stability of the arthrodesis constructs, suggesting that an attempt should be made to create the most stable three-screw configuration. Finite element models can be used as an effective preoperative tool for planning screw number and placemen...|$|E
