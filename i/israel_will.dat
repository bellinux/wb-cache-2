50|$|Cantora Records {{was formed}} in 2005 by Jesse <b>Israel</b> and <b>Will</b> Griggs, then sophomores and {{roommates}} at NYU, and Nick Panama.

Prior {{to the creation of the}} label, Jesse <b>Israel</b> and <b>Will</b> Griggs approached Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden and offered to manage their band, then known as The Management. Nick Panama, having heard The Management's music through a mutual friend of the band, contacted Jesse <b>Israel</b> and <b>Will</b> Griggs and shortly thereafter the three music enthusiasts formed Cantora Records, each contributing $800 in starting capital. The Management changed their name to MGMT to avoid conflict with a U.K.-based band of the same name, and MGMT's Time to Pretend was issued under the Cantora Records name in order to coincide with their '05 tour with fellow psychedelic -pop band Of Montreal.|$|R
5000|$|The two-state {{solution}} also enjoys majority support in Israeli polls {{although there has}} been some erosion to its prospects over time.

25|$|Critics of the {{proposals}} argue that making unilateral demands on <b>Israel</b> <b>will</b> not promote negotiation and a just peace. Furthermore, disinvestment, it is claimed, would hurt Palestinians more than any other, as all of the Israeli factories located beyond the Green Line employ Palestinian workers, providing 70,000 jobs for Palestinians.|$|E

25|$|In {{an op-ed}} in Haaretz, Jamie Levin {{suggests}} {{that the success of}} the Iron Dome system will likely increase demands to field additional systems across Israel. Budget shortfalls mean that <b>Israel</b> <b>will</b> be forced to weigh spending on missile defenses against other expenditures. Such funds, he argues, will likely come from programs intended to help the most vulnerable sectors of society, such as social welfare.|$|E
25|$|In {{the text}} of the psalm, {{specifically}} verses 2 through 5, the speaker makes the assumption that individuals who plot against the nation of Israel must inherently be enemies of God. He also ascribes to them the intention of the complete extinction of the people of Israel, as that is the meaning of verse 4, which indicates that the name of <b>Israel</b> <b>will</b> be obliterated or remembered no more.|$|E

5000|$|Trump has {{previously}} {{said that he}} would not take sides in any Israeli-Palestinian agreement in order to be a neutral negotiator in the peace talks, although he also added that he was [...] "totally pro-Israel." [...] In December 2015, Trump told the Associated Press that an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord would depend very much upon Israel, remarking: [...] "I have a real question {{as to whether or not}} both sides want to” come to a peace accord. [...] "A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal — whether or not <b>Israel's</b> <b>willing</b> to sacrifice certain things." ...|$|R

25|$|The Book of Revelation (7:4–8), {{mentions}} that {{people from the}} twelve tribes of <b>Israel</b> <b>will</b> be sealed. The selection of the twelve tribes {{does not include the}} names of Ephraim and Dan, although their names were used for the twelve tribes that settled in the Promised Land. It has been suggested that this could be because of their pagan practices. This made Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome and a few Millennialists propose that the Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, Alberto Gori was {{appointed}} Custodian of the Holy Land, an office he would occupy until 1949, when he {{was appointed}} Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, an office he held until 1970. In Gori's reports to the Vatican in the 1940s, he was critical of Jewish and later Israeli forces, whom he accused of destruction of holy places. Despite repeated Israeli assurances that <b>Israel</b> <b>will</b> guarantee freedom of religion and safeguard the Holy Places of all religions, Pius XII issued several encyclicals expressing concerns about the holy places as well as access.|$|E
25|$|A further {{concern is}} whether, {{as a result}} of this {{security}} argument, <b>Israel</b> <b>will</b> in fact allow the Palestinian community to emerge as a viable and sovereign political unit, a viable and contiguous state. There are also various economic and political restrictions placed on Palestinian people, activities, and institutions which have had a detrimental effect on the Palestinian economy and quality of life. Israel has said repeatedly that these restrictions are necessary due to security concerns, and in order to counteract ongoing efforts which promote terrorism which incite opposition to Israel's existence and rights as a country. The key obstacle therefore remains the Israeli demand for security versus Palestinian claims for rights and statehood.|$|E
25|$|In Palestine, the station's {{influence}} is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates {{that in the}} West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance {{is that it has}} itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with <b>Israel</b> <b>will</b> fundamentally shape how it is viewed—and, more importantly, whether it is accepted—by the Palestinian public.|$|E
