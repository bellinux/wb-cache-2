5|$|In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{heir to the}} thrones of Austria-Hungary, {{was assassinated}} by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden {{deterioration}} in relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. Austria-Hungary {{was supported by the}} German Empire, whilst Serbia had the backing of the Russian Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> under the Dual Alliance.|$|E

Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E

5|$|A {{major change}} in the Army's {{organization}} in the Pacific occurred on 15 May 1972, {{in conjunction with the}} return of Okinawa to Japanese control after twenty-seven years of administration by the United States. Under the complex reorganization that accompanied reversion, Headquarters, IX U.S. Army Corps, was transferred from Okinawa and collocated with Headquarters, U.S. Army Japan, to form Headquarters, U.S. Army, Japan/IX Corps, at Camp Zama, Japan. There, <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> included administrative oversight of US forces as well as conducting training and exercises with US and other units in the region. On Okinawa, Headquarters, U.S. Army, Ryukyu Islands, and Headquarters, 2d Logistical Command, were inactivated.|$|E
5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> {{divided between}} Southern Area, Northern Area, {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern Area.|$|E

5|$|However, on 10 September 1942, Northcott was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff. Formerly, the Army had been {{controlled by the}} Military Board. This ceased to function on 30 July 1942, with <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> being assumed by the Commander-in-Chief, General Blamey. The Adjutant General, Major General Victor Stantke, the Quartermaster General, Major General James Cannan and the Master-General of the Ordnance, Major General Leslie, who would formerly have been members of the board, now came under the Lieutenant General Administration (LGA), Lieutenant General Henry Wynter. This left the CGS with responsibility for the day-to-day running of the Army. His job also involved liaison with Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and he frequently had to represent Blamey in meetings with the Minister for the Army, Frank Forde.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had {{produced}} the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, {{which found that}} the CIA had failed in <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in both the coordination and production of intelligence. In response, the U.S. National Security Council accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the report. It remained to implement them. In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, {{there was a major}} intelligence failure. The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise, and it raised fears of a third world war.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Justice is {{responsible}} for handling legal matters for the government. <b>Its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> include providing legal advice, criminal prosecution, civil representation, legal and policy drafting and reform and international legal co-operation between different jurisdictions.

As protector of public interest, the department may apply for judicial reviews and may intervene in any cases involving the greater public interest. The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government when exercising its control over criminal prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Western Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in January 1941, and controlled RAAF units located in Western Australia. Headquartered at Perth, Western Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. Its aircraft conducted anti-submarine operations throughout the war, and attacked targets in the Dutch East Indies during the Borneo campaign in 1945. Western Area Command continued to operate following the end of the war, before <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were subsumed in 1954 by the RAAF's new functional command-and-control system; the headquarters was disbanded two years later.|$|E
5|$|No.114 MCRU {{deployed}} to Malaya in 1958, becoming operational at RAAF Base Butterworth on 19August. It took over responsibility for aerial surveillance and ground-controlled interception from the Royal Air Force's No.487 Signals Unit on 1December. From Butterworth, No.114 MCRU directed the Sabre fighters of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons and the Canberra bombers of No.2 Squadron {{in the last}} years of the Malayan Emergency. It also sent controllers on attachment to Ubon Air Base in Thailand, where No.79 Squadron was based from 1962. On 3September 1964, the unit went on to a 24-hour operational footing to support the Sidewinder-armed Sabres of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia, though no combat ensued. Konfrontasi having been declared over in August 1966, No.114 MCRU transferred <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to RAF Western Hill on 22September, and disbanded at Butterworth on 31October.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a benefactor {{during the}} period of reconstruction. He became {{frustrated}} that, during a time when the Hospital was so clearly in need of financial assistance, the trustees of his Irish munificence were choosing to procrastinate in their remittances of the annual grant. By the mid-1670s he had determined to use the powers granted to him {{under the terms of the}} Royal Charter in order to divert surplus funds from the Trust to the Hospital, and by 1681 relations between Smith and the trustees were so strained that both the governments in London and in Dublin were involved in attempts to determine who had responsibility both for the administration and collection of income and for the distribution thereof. One such involved person was Sir John Temple, the Solicitor-General for Ireland, who asserted that anomalies between the stipulations of 1667 and the Charter of 1669 showed that the revenue should stay in Ireland, and also that there was in fact no surplus available in any event because the Trust had not at that time met with all of <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in Ireland under the terms of the Charter.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF {{moved to}} rectify the {{situation}} by re-forming No.2OTU on 1March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deHavilland Vampire jets. Cresswell took command of No.2 OTU on 21May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No.2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight. The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, {{in concert with the}} Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. Training courses on the Sabre began on 1January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and <b>its</b> <b>responsibilities</b> passed to No.3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.|$|E
