Simply by thinking the appropriate thought, the BBI allows the human to control the rat's tail. The human wears an <b>EEG-based</b> brain-to-computer interface (BCI), while the anesthetised rat {{is equipped with a}} focused ultrasound (FUS) computer-to-brain interface (CBI). FUS is a technology that allows the researchers to excite a specific region of neurons in the rat's brain using an ultrasound signal (350 kHz ultrasound frequency, tone burst duration of 0.5 ms, pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz, given for 300 ms duration). The main advantage of FUS is that, unlike most brain-stimulation techniques, it is non-invasive. Whenever the human looks at a specific pattern (strobe light flicker) on a computer screen, the BCI communicates a command to the rat's CBI, which causes ultrasound to be beamed into the region of the rat's motor cortex responsible for tail movement. The researchers report that the human BCI has an accuracy of 94%, and that it generally takes around 1.5 s from the human looking at the screen to movement of the rat's tail.|$|E

It takes its roots in study of human well-being in architecture, human factors study in engineering and manufacturing including neuroergonomics. In traditional human factors studies and/or well-being study, mental workload, stress, and emotion are obtained through questionnaires that are administered upon completion of some task and/or the whole experiment. Recent advances in BCI research allow for using Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain state recognition algorithms to assess the interaction between brain and human performance. We propose and develop an <b>EEG-based</b> system CogniMeter to monitor and analyze human factors measurements of newly designed software/hardware systems and/or working places.

40|$|Introduction and aims: {{the gold}} {{standard}} for sleep staging is the in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG), followed by manual scoring. A wide range of limitations of this approach has been reported, ranging from high costs to low compliance. The market of the so-called “quantified self” lists an increasing number of tracking devices, which also offer the opportunity to measure sleep parameters. Still, the validation of these devices is limited. Methods: in 20 young healthy subjects, we recorded 24 hrs of portable EEG data combined with by a low-cost commercially available accelerometric recordings (Fitbit Ultra). A validation procedure based on a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) has been employed in order to optimize actigraphy-based versus <b>EEG-based</b> vigilance state scoring. Results: The ANN approach extracted an algorithm leading to high accuracy (0. 939 +- 0. 03), sensitivity (0. 936 +- 0. 07) and specificity (0. 944 +- 0. 03) in the estimation of 5 -minute sleep epochs, for the comparison of <b>EEG-based</b> and actigraphy-based scoring. The training phase reached saturation after 4 subjects. The estimation of standard sleep parameters (TST, WASO, Sleep Onset) showed no statistical difference between the automatic ANN-actigraphy-based scoring and the standard <b>EEG-based</b> one. Conclusion: The high concordance between ANN-actigraphy-based scoring and the standard manual <b>EEG-based</b> one, as well as the estimation of sleep parameters, makes low-cost actigraphy a viable strategy for collecting objective sleep-wake data. Finally, we propose a validation procedure that could be employed for testing future devices as well as existing ones, requiring relative long (24 hrs) simultaneous portable EEG and actigraphic recordings, in a relative small sample (n= 4) ...|$|E
30|$|Dyslexia is a {{disability}} that causes difficulties {{in reading and}} writing despite average intelligence. This hidden disability often goes undetected since dyslexics are normal and healthy in every other way. Electroencephalography (EEG) {{is one of the}} upcoming methods being researched for identifying unique brain activation patterns in dyslexics. The aims of this paper are to examine pros and cons of existing <b>EEG-based</b> pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia and recommend optimisations through the findings to assist future research. A critical analysis of the literature is conducted focusing on each framework’s (1) data collection, (2) pre-processing, (3) analysis and (4) classification methods. A wide range of inputs as well as classification approaches has been experimented for the improvement in <b>EEG-based</b> pattern classification frameworks. It was uncovered that incorporating reading- and writing-related tasks to experiments used in data collection may help improve these frameworks instead of using only simple tasks, and those unwanted artefacts caused by body movements in the EEG signals during reading and writing activities could be minimised using artefact subspace reconstruction. Further, support vector machine is identified as a promising classifier to be used in <b>EEG-based</b> pattern classification frameworks for dyslexia.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} 3 decades, {{interest}} {{has increased in}} brain-computer interface (BCI) technology {{as a tool for}} assisting, augmenting, and rehabilitating sensorimotor functions in clinical populations. Initially designed as an assistive device for partial or total body impairments, BCI systems have since been explored as a possible adjuvant therapy in the rehabilitation of patients who have had a stroke. In particular, BCI systems incorporating a robotic manipulanda to passively manipulate affected limbs have been studied. These systems can use a range of invasive (ie, intracranial implanted electrodes) or noninvasive neurophysiologic recording techniques (ie, electroencephalography [EEG], near-infrared spectroscopy,and magnetoencephalography) to establish communication links between the brain and the BCI system. Trials are most commonly performed on <b>EEG-based</b> BCI in comparison with the other techniques because of its high temporal resolution, relatively low setup costs, portability, and noninvasive nature. <b>EEG-based</b> BCI detects event-related desynchronization/synchronization in sensorimotor oscillatory rhythms associated with motor imagery (MI), which in turn drives the BCI. Previous evidence suggests that the process of MI preferentially activates sensorimotor regions similar to actual task performance and that repeated practice of MI can induce plasticity changes in the brain. It is therefore postulated that the combination of MI and BCI may augment rehabilitation gains in patients who have had a stroke by activating corticomotor networks via MI and providing sensory feedbackfrom the affected limb using end-effector robots. In this review we examine the current literature surrounding the feasibility of <b>EEG-based</b> MI-BCI systems in stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|The use {{of human}} brain {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) signals for automatic person identi cation {{has been investigated}} for a decade. It {{has been found that}} the performance of an <b>EEG-based</b> person identication system highly depends on what feature to be extracted from multi-channel EEG signals. Linear methods such as Power Spectral Density and Autoregressive Model have been used to extract EEG features. However these methods assumed that EEG signals are stationary. In fact, EEG signals are complex, non-linear, non-stationary, and random in nature. In addition, other factors such as brain condition or human characteristics may have impacts on the performance, however these factors have not been investigated and evaluated in previous studies. It has been found in the literature that entropy is used to measure the randomness of non-linear time series data. Entropy is also used to measure the level of chaos of braincomputer interface systems. Therefore, this thesis proposes to study the role of entropy in non-linear analysis of EEG signals to discover new features for <b>EEG-based</b> person identi- cation. Five dierent entropy methods including Shannon Entropy, Approximate Entropy, Sample Entropy, Spectral Entropy, and Conditional Entropy have been proposed to extract entropy features that are used to evaluate the performance of <b>EEG-based</b> person identication systems and the impacts of epilepsy, alcohol, age and gender characteristics on these systems. Experiments were performed on the Australian EEG and Alcoholism datasets. Experimental results have shown that, in most cases, the proposed entropy features yield very fast person identication, yet with compatible accuracy because the feature dimension is low. In real life security operation, timely response is critical. The experimental results have also shown that epilepsy, alcohol, age and gender characteristics have impacts on the <b>EEG-based</b> person identication systems...|$|E
