5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite his reluctance, Scheider {{pledged to}} do the best job that he could, wanting to make Brody believable. However, the {{atmosphere}} was tense on the set, and he often argued with Szwarc. On one occasion, Scheider complained (in front of extras) that Szwarc was wasting time with technical issues and the extras while ignoring the principal actors. A meeting was called with the two, David Brown and Verna Fields, in which Scheider and Szwarc were encouraged to settle their differences. The discussion became heated and a physical fight broke out, which Brown and Fields broke up. The rift was also articulated in written correspondence. In a letter to Szwarc, Scheider wrote that [...] "working with Jeannot Szwarc is knowing he will never say he is sorry or ever admitting he overlooked something. Well, <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> shit for me!" [...] He requested an apology from the director for not consulting him. Szwarc's reply focused upon completing the film to the [...] "best possible" [...] standard: ...|$|E
500|$|The opening segment, {{which shows}} Kang and Kodos {{attempting}} to entertain {{an audience of}} aliens, was [...] "born out of [...] love" [...] of comedy teams like Martin and Lewis and the Smothers Brothers. The plot of [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] {{is based on the}} 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer. At the beginning of the segment, the Simpsons are seen escaping from a group of vampires. Holding a package of Super Sugar Crisp cereal, Homer starts singing a jingle about the cereal. Super Sugar Crisp is a reference to the breakfast cereal Golden Crisp, while the jingle Homer sings references [...] "Can't get <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> Golden Crisp", a jingle sung by Golden Crisp's mascot Sugar Bear during advertisements for the cereal. According to Scully, the series' staff had a lot of trouble clearing the song for the episode. [...] "Apparently, they didn't want the tune [...] used in this context" [...] he said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Please don't, Mr. Delaford, I've had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> all <b>that.</b> Please go, {{and take}} my best wishes, {{as long as you}} don't come here, for I know all about you.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Satiation/Deprivation: The {{effectiveness}} of a positive or [...] "appetitive" [...] stimulus will be reduced if the individual has received <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> stimulus to satisfy its appetite. The opposite effect will occur if the individual becomes deprived of that stimulus: the {{effectiveness of}} a consequence will then increase. If someone is not hungry, food will not be an effective reinforcer for behavior.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{was even}} less kind. [...] Although {{reviewer}} Mark Kamine noted that [...] "Keenan gets off some decent one-liners" [...] and that references to Los Angeles landmarks were [...] "made sparingly {{and used to}} good effect", he felt the book engaged in [...] "incessant name-dropping," [...] {{that many of the}} jokes were too topical, and that Keenan's humor was too blunt. [...] "here's no need for canned laughter either. We get <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> elsewhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lucy blushed deeply. 'For Heaven's sake, no, Mr. Mac-Morlan, do not {{let that}} be; Charles Hazlewood has had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> {{mischief}} about <b>that</b> already.' ...|$|R

5000|$|On No Depression, Grant Britt said, [...] "This is {{a fitting}} epitaph, but still not his final statement. The latest chapter of his {{continuing}} roots saga called Step Back {{was set to}} come out in September featuring a dazzling array of guitarists including Eric Clapton, Billy Gibbons, Joe Bonamassa, Leslie West, and Dr. John. But his is not a tragic ending. Johnny Winter went out still {{at the top of his}} powers after doing yet another successful show, giving his fans what they wanted but could never get <b>enough</b> <b>of.</b> <b>That's</b> a legacy any man would be proud to leave behind." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, by George. I've had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> You're {{wide awake}} enough to understand, Lucy, that a fellow {{situated}} as I am, over head and ears in debt, and heir {{to an old}} title, should struggle to keep the things together. Families and names don't matter much, I suppose; but, after all, one does care for them. But I've had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> As for Cousin Emily, you know, Lucy, I never loved any woman but you in my life." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{is shown}} that as time progresses, he falls deeper {{in love with}} her; in the {{beginning}} of their partnership, he treats Lydia as a pawn (he uses her as bait without her consent to lure his enemy out into the open, although notably he also attempts to protect her by ordering Raven to trail her). At the time, Lydia mused that she's in an extremely ambiguous position, in <b>that</b> she is <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> an outsider <b>that</b> Edgar treats her as a pawn, but <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a comrade <b>that</b> Edgar feels an obligation to protect her.|$|R

60|$|CORPUS EVANGELICORUM {{had always}} been against Reichs Ban: a few Dissentients, or Half-Dissentients excepted,--as Mecklenburg wholly and with a will; foolish Anspach wholly; and the Anhalts haggling some dissent, and {{retracting}} it (why, I never knew);--for which Mecklenburg and the Anhalts, lying within clutch of one, had to repent bitterly in the years coming! <b>Enough</b> <b>of</b> all <b>that.</b>|$|R

50|$|The program {{worked so}} well and had <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> an impact, <b>that</b> it {{convinced}} James Cameron that CGI could create a character in his next film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day; Autodesk did advertisement with this.|$|R
