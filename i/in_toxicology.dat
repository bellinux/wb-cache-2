5|$|Toxicology testing, {{also known}} as safety testing, is {{conducted}} by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, {{on behalf of a}} wide variety of customers. According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe <b>in</b> <b>toxicology</b> tests; which are about 10% of all procedures. According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.|$|E
5|$|Non-human {{primates}} (NHPs) {{are used}} <b>in</b> <b>toxicology</b> tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They {{are caught in}} the wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees are used in the US. As of 2015, there are approximately 730 chimpanzees in U.S. laboratories.|$|E
40|$|A minimal {{approach}} to risk assessment <b>in</b> reproductive <b>toxicology</b> involves four components: hazard identification, hazard characterization, exposure characterization, and risk characterization. In practice, risk assessment <b>in</b> reproductive <b>toxicology</b> {{has been reduced}} to arbitrary safety factors or mathematical models of the dose-response relationship. These approaches obscure biological differences across species rather than using this important and frequently accessible information. Two approaches that are formally capable of using biologically relevant information (pharmacokinetics and expert system shells) are explored as aids to risk assessment <b>in</b> reproductive <b>toxicology...</b>|$|R

25|$|Historically, aquatic {{toxicology}} toxicity {{tests have}} focused on water-based approaches where concentration of a toxicant is determined by its concentration in the water. Although tissue residue use and concepts have existed for over 100 years due to interest in narcosis and anesthesia, it was not widely used <b>in</b> <b>toxicology.</b> The first known study of tissue residue in environmental toxicology was reported in 1912 by White and Thomas who investigated the effects of copper exposure to fish using whole-body copper concentrations.|$|E

2500|$|In {{reference}} to the coded notations within the actual torture logs, Berdella confessed {{that many of the}} abbreviated entries were simply shorthand terms for methods of abuse he had inflicted upon his victims, whereas others would describe either their reactions to these ongoing acts of abuse and torture, or his initial observations upon viewing them when he entered the room where he had kept them restrained. The entry reading [...] "CP", for example, had referred to the injections of chlorpromazine he had injected into his victims to assist in his restraining them, whereas entries reading [...] "DC" [...] would refer to the swabbing of their eyes with drain cleaner or the injection of the substance into their vocal cords. Entries reading [...] "EK" [...] or [...] "EKG" [...] had referred to the method of torture administered to his captives with electrical shots, whereas several other entries would also read the location Berdella had administered the abuse or torture to his victims. For example, at one point in relation to victim Walter James Ferris, Berdella had written an entry reading: [...] "2 1/2 ket nk + shoulder" [...] to indicate he had injected 2.2 cubic centimeters of ketamine into his victim's neck and shoulder. Other entries such as [...] "gag loose, no resist in retie" [...] or [...] "very delayed breathing, snoring" [...] were more self-explanatory. (Investigators had consulted a specialist <b>in</b> <b>toxicology</b> in their investigation into Berdella following his arrest. This individual had stated that, judging by the notes he had written upon victim Robert Sheldon, the accumulation of chlorpromazine injected into this victim had been toxic.) ...|$|E
