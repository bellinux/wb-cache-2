40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} {{performance}} test results are provided for a horizontal-application three-lobe bearing evaluated {{over the following}} range of static-load orientations (all taken from {{the leading edge of}} the loaded pad) : 0 ?, 20 ?, 30 ?, 40 ?, 60 ?, 80 ?, 90 ?, and 100 ?. This bearing has the following specifications: 100 ? pad arc angle, 0. 52 preload, 70 % offset, 101. 74 mm (4. 0057 in) minimum bore diameter, 0. 116 mm (7. 55 mils) radial pad clearance, and 76. 3 mm (3 in) axial length. The static and dynamic test results are evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the bearing to changes in the static load direction. The two questions the study aims to answer are: (1) ?Is an offset three-lobe bearing a good choice when the radial static load vector represents an unknown variable?? and (2) ?Can an offset three-lobe bearing be oriented advantageously with a known load direction?? Both the static and dynamic test results are compared to predictions obtained from a fixed-arc bearing Reynolds equation solver. Predictions using both the measured <b>hot</b> <b>clearance</b> and measured cold clearance as inputs are compared to the measured data. Dynamic tests show that the horizontal-application three-lobe bearing is sensitive to load orientation at low speeds and high loads. Whirl-frequency ratios (WFR) at 6750 rpm with loads of 1149 kPa, 1723 kPa, and 2298 kPa are equal to zero for loads oriented towards {{the leading edge of the}} pad, and between 0. 35 and 0. 5 for loads oriented towards the trailing edge of the pad. This same general trend can be seen for WFR values at 9000 rpm and 10800 rpm. The horizontal-application three-lobe bearing is not sensitive to load orientation at high speeds and light loads. At 13200 rpm, measured WFRs are between 0. 3 and 0. 7 at all loads and for all load orientations. Measured WFR at the no-load condition are between 0. 45 and 0. 7 for all cases. Stiffness orthotropy was found to vary significantly with load orientation. At 6750 rpm and 2298 kPa, the bearing is most orthotropic when the static load orientation is 30 ? and 40 ?, with K_(yy) being larger than K_(xx) by approximately 800 MN/m. At 13200 rpm and 2298 kPa, the bearing is most orthotropic for the 40 ? and 100 ? load orientations, with K_(yy) being larger than K_(xx) by approximately 800 MN/m. Overall, it is concluded that the three-lobe bearing is not a good choice when the load direction is unknown, as the bearing can have different rotordynamic coefficients with different load orientations. Also, at high speeds, the three-lobe bearing cannot be oriented advantageously with a known load direction to enhance stability, as the WFR of the three-lobe bearing tested is largely independent of load direction. However, the three-lobe bearing can be oriented advantageously to split/change a critical speed, since the direct stiffness and stiffness orthotropy change with load direction. Additionally, dynamic performance test results are provided for a vertical-application (nominally unloaded) three-lobe bearing. The vertical-application bearing has the following specifications: 100 ? pad arc angle, 0. 64 preload, 100 % offset, 101. 74 mm (4. 0057 in) nominal diameter, 0. 116 mm (5. 27 mils) radial pad clearance, 76. 3 mm (3 in) axial length, and 100 ? static load orientation from the leading edge of the loaded pad. The performance of this bearing is evaluated to determine: (1) whether a fully (100 %) offset three-lobe bearing configuration is more stable in terms of the WFR than a standard plain journal bearing and (2) whether a fully offset three-lobe bearing provides a larger direct stiffness (centering force) than a standard fixed-arc bearing. Dynamic tests show that the vertical-application three-lobe bearing does not improve stability over conventional plain journal bearings. The measured WFRs for the vertical-application bearing are approximately 0. 4 - 0. 5 for nearly all test cases. Predicted WFRs are 0. 46 at all test points. The vertical-application bearing dimensionless direct stiffness coefficients are compared to those for the horizontal-application bearing. The equivalent stiffness for the vertical-application bearing is larger than that of the horizontal-application bearing by a factor of 1. 33 at 6750 rpm and a factor of 1. 25 at 9000 rpm. Thus, the vertical-application bearing does impart a larger centering force to the journal relative to the horizontal-application bearing when the journal is not carrying a radial static load...|$|E
40|$|Measured and {{predicted}} static and dynamic load characteristics are provided for a three-pad, rocker-pivot, tilting-pad journal bearing in the load-between-pad orientation. The bearing has the following characteristics: 3 pads,. 50 pad pivot offset, 0. 6 L/D ratio, 60. 69 mm (2. 4 in) pad axial length, and 0. 0762 mm (0. 003 in) radial clearance. Three interchangeable pad configurations were tested with pad thicknesses of 8. 5 mm (0. 33 in), 10 mm (0. 39 in), and 11. 5 mm (. 45 in). Tests {{were performed on}} a test bearing floating about a rigid rotor design with unit loads ranging from 172 to 1, 724 kPa (25 to 250 psi) and speeds from 6 to 12 krpm. Cold and hot clearances were taken to measure the nominal and operating, respectively, radial bearing clearance. The cold clearance was taken at room temperature while the <b>hot</b> <b>clearance</b> was taken for each operating speed immediately after the rig was shut down. The hot bearing clearance shows a 23 ? 34 % decrease in radial bearing clearance. As the operating speed increased, the operating temperature in the bearing increased. The increase in operating temperatures caused the bearing and pads to expand and reduced the radial bearing clearance. Static load tests were performed once the test rig reached steady-state conditions. The maximum measured eccentricity ratio was over one for each pad configuration. As pad flexibility increased, the static eccentricity ratio decreased. The eccentricity ratio predictions agreed well with the measured results in the loaded direction. The measured attitude angles were as high as approximately 10 ?. The attitude angles remained fairly constant at low rotational speeds for tp = 8. 5 mm and tp = 10 mm and decreased as unit load increased for tp = 11. 5 mm. XL_TPJB? predicted attitude angles that had a smaller magnitude than the measured results for all rotational speed and unit load conditions and were negative. The temperatures did not vary greatly across pad configurations. The predictions agreed well with the measured values at low speeds and low unit loads. As the operating speed and unit load increased, the predictions were lower than the measured values. Pad flexibility was characterized as {{the change in the}} pad?s bending stiffness or the change in pad thickness. A finite-element model (FEM) was created in SolidWorks? to predict the structural bending stiffness of each pad configuration. Once the pivot was fixed in the FEM, a uniform pressure distribution was applied to the rotor-side surface of the pad. Results from the finite-element analysis (FEA) show an increase in pad flexibility as the thickness of the pad decreased. Dynamic load tests were performed for all nominal test conditions over a range of excitation frequencies to obtain complex dynamic-stiffness coefficients as a function of excitation frequency. The real and imaginary parts of dynamic-stiffness were fitted with quadratic and linear models, respectively, with respect to excitation frequency. A constant coefficient [K][C][M] model produced frequency-independent rotordynamic coefficients. For the load-between-pad configuration, the dynamic-stiffness coefficients show significant bearing orthotropy, especially as the unit load increased. In general, the dynamic-stiffness was larger in the non-loading direction {{than it was in the}} loading direction. Negative virtual mass coefficients were commonly obtained for all pad configuration. To examine the effect of pad flexibility on the rotordynamic coefficients, the measured results were compared across each pad configuration. The measured results show that the increase in pad flexibility decreased the direct damping coefficients by 12 - 20 % and, on average, decreased the cross-coupled damping coefficients by approximately 10 %. On average, the measured results show a slight increase in the stiffness coefficients as pad flexibility increased. The direct stiffness coefficients varied from an increase of 12 % at low unit loads and a decrease of 3 % at high unit loads. The cross-coupled stiffness coefficients change by 0 to 12 % as pad flexibility increased. In general, the direct virtual mass coefficients decreased by approximately 29 % as pad flexibility increased. The average change for the cross-coupled coefficients is an increase in Mxy and Myx by 2 % as pad flexibility increased. XL_TPJB? was used to predict the performance of the tilting-pad bearing tested in this work. XL_TPJB? accounts for pad and pivot flexibility. The predictions using XL_TPJB? agreed well with the measured values for direct stiffness coefficients. For a given pad set, the predictions agreed well with the measured results for one operating speed case and were either lower or higher than the measured results for the remaining speed cases for Cxx. The predicted values were generally higher than the measured values for Cyy at low unit loads and were lower than measured values at high unit loads. The measured values had a smaller magnitude than the predictions for the direct virtual-mass coefficients at lower speeds. At higher speeds, the predictions had a lower magnitude than the measured direct virtual-mass coefficients. All cross-coupled-coefficient predictions were nearly zero and, the measured values were typically non-zero and negative. A non-dimensional pad flexibility parameter ?flex was used to relate the pad flexibility of multiple bearings of different sizes. The parameter related the average deflection across the pad surface to the pad?s arc length. XL_TPJB? was used to predict the percent change in direct damping coefficients for a rigid pad, flexible pivot and flexible pad, flexible pivot for a surface speed of 54 m/s and a unit load of 783 kPa. The results show the pads tested in this thesis are extremely flexible compared to pads used in industry. Results show that the pad?s structural bending stiffness or flexibility is important when predicting the bearing?s dynamic performance. Damping is consistently over-predicting when excluding pad flexibility, and this could have a significant impact in predicting the bearing?s stability characteristics. In general, all codes should account for pad flexibility, as well as pivot flexibility, to properly predict the performance of a tilting-pad journal bearing...|$|E
25|$|In gas {{turbines}} and auxiliary power units. Ref. Figures 4.1–4.2 In their simple form, modern {{gas turbines}} {{operate on the}} Brayton cycle. (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied {{to all of the}} centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing. This need arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected <b>hot</b> running <b>clearance</b> of the impeller.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the probability of mechanical trimming using hot half-trimming in actual hot stamping process. Hot half-trimmed part can be inaccurately positioned on mechanical trimming die by relatively low accuracy of automatic transferring system or manual way, leading to the change of clearance in mechanical trimming. Taking into account this position error, a suitable operation window for trimming of flat and inclined part was constructed by FE-simulation and then was verified by experiment. It was determined from the operation window that effective mechanical trimming for both flat and inclined part can be performed successfully with hot half-trimming depth of 1. 0 [*]mm in <b>hot</b> half-trimming and <b>clearance</b> between 0. 1 [*]mm and 0. 124 [*]mm in subsequent mechanical trimming, without regard to position error...|$|R

40|$|Engine {{components}} are commonly {{exposed to air}} temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit {{in order to increase}} the overall engine performance and to maximise the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent the overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of the component life, an internal flow system must be designed to cool the critical engine parts and to protect them. As the coolant flow is bled from the compressor and not used for the combustion an important goal is to minimise the amount of coolant in order to optimise the overall engine performance. Predicting the metal temperatures is of paramount importance as they are a major factor in determining the component stresses and lives. In addition, as modern engines operate in ever harsher conditions due to efficiency requirements, the ability to predict thermo-mechanical displacements becomes very relevant: on the one hand, to prevent damage of components due to excessive rubbing, on the other hand, to understand how much air is flowing internally within the secondary air system for cooling and sealing purposes, not only in the design condition but throughout the engine life-span. In order to achieve this aero-engine manufacturers aim to use more and more accurate numerical techniques requiring multi-physics models, including thermo-mechanical finite elements and CFD models, which can be coupled in order to investigate small variations in temperatures and displacements. This thesis shows a practical application and extension of a numerical methodology for predicting conjugate heat transfer. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modeling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. Previous work based on the same rig showed diffculties in matching predictions to thermocouple measurements near the rim seal gap. In this investigation, further use is made of existing measurements of <b>hot</b> running seal <b>clearances</b> in the rig. The structural deflections are applied to the existing model to evaluate the impact in flow interactions and heat transfer. Furthermore, for one test case unsteady CFD simulations are conducted in order {{to take into account the}} flow unsteadiness in the heat transfer predictions near the rim. In addition to a baseline test case without net ingestion, a case simulating engine deterioration with net ingestion is validated against the available test data, also taking into account cold and <b>hot</b> running seal <b>clearances.</b> Furthermore an additional geometry with a stationary deflector plate is modelled and validated for the same flow cases. Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the deflector plate the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency. Therefore, the deflector plate geometry is embedded in a CFD-based automated optimisation loop to further reduce the amount of cooling air. The optimisation strategy concentrates on a flexible design parameterisation of the cavity geometry with deflector plate and its implementation in an automatic 3 D meshing system with respect of finally executing an automated design optimisation. Special consideration is given to the flexibility of the parameterisation method in order to reduce design variables to a minimum while also increasing the design space flexibility & generality. The parameterised geometry is optimised using a metamodel-assisted approach based on regressing Kriging in order to identify the optimum position and orientation of the deflector plate inside the cavity. The outcome of the optimisation is validated using the benchmarked FEA-CFD coupling methodology...|$|R
