50|$|Following {{several years}} of negotiations, the EU agreed to two <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> {{agreements}} in 1997. The Agreement on International <b>Humane</b> <b>Trapping</b> Standards (AIHTS) was reached with the EU, Canada and Russia; a separate agreement was reached between the EU and United States due to US regulatory requirements. Both Agreements incorporate the same standards. The EU Council ratified them in 1998.|$|E
50|$|The Agreement on International <b>Humane</b> <b>Trapping</b> Standards (AIHTS) {{establishes}} the required standards for {{approval and certification}} of animal trapping devices.|$|E
5000|$|Assemble <b>trapping</b> supplies, {{including}} <b>humane</b> <b>traps,</b> {{newspapers and}} other useful materials.|$|R
50|$|Mom Jo and Mom Lara are Ukiah's adoptive lesbian mothers. Mom Jo {{found him}} in a <b>humane</b> <b>trap</b> when she was {{studying}} wolves in Oregon for a master's degree and the two brought him home to Pittsburgh. Mom Lara had brain cancer, but was cured when she got some of Ukiah's half-alien blood. They also have a biological daughter, Callie.|$|R
5000|$|Other common {{defensive}} measures include {{cat litter}} and blood meal, to repel the mole, or smoking its burrow. Devices are also sold to trap the mole in its burrow, when one sees the [...] "mole hill" [...] moving and therefore {{knows where the}} animal is, and then stabbing it. <b>Humane</b> <b>traps</b> that capture the mole alive {{so it may be}} transported elsewhere are also options.|$|R
5000|$|As the Agreement on International <b>Humane</b> <b>Trapping</b> Standards is {{a dynamic}} treaty, it {{provides}} opportunity for continuing the improvement of animal welfare related to trapping as new technology and scientific knowledge emerges ...|$|E
5000|$|Since autumn 2007, only {{certified}} traps {{are legally}} permitted for trapping the species {{listed in the}} Agreement on International <b>Humane</b> <b>Trapping</b> Standards. Local or regional jurisdictions may have additional regulatory requirements exceeding the AIHTS.Restraining Traps - The use, on land, of conventional steel-jaw leghold restraining traps for the following species is now prohibited: ...|$|E
50|$|The FIC manages Canada’s {{humane trap}} {{research}} and testing program through the Alberta Research Centre and {{in accordance with}} The Agreement on International <b>Humane</b> <b>Trapping</b> Standards (AIHTS). As a voice for the Canadian fur sector the Institute provides information to the media, the public and governments pertaining to the economic, social, cultural, animal welfare and environmental issues surrounding today's fur trade.|$|E
40|$|ISO, the International Organization for Standardization, {{formed a}} {{technical}} committee in 1987 {{to develop an}} international standard for <b>humane</b> <b>traps.</b> This effort began {{with the establishment of}} international Working Groups charged with preparing standards for killing and restraining traps. Capture efficiency, humaneness, injury thresholds, selectivity, testing, and safety are addressed in the standards. A final draft standard could be voted on by ISO member countries by mid- 1995...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Humane</b> animal <b>trapping</b> uses woven or {{welded wire}} mesh cages (chicken wire or {{hardware}} cloth) to trap wild animals like raccoons and skunks in populated areas.|$|R
50|$|The entire FIS area, {{where this}} occurred, was searched {{and efforts to}} {{immediately}} locate “Jack” were unsuccessful. Subsequent efforts to locate Jack have also been unsuccessful. Some of the efforts taken by AA to locate Jack include: posting photos of Jack in key areas around JFK and local businesses, consulting with the Mayor’s Alliance Society to set up <b>humane</b> <b>traps</b> on the airport property, consulting with the port authority and wildlife management representatives, hiring a professional “pet tracker” and issuing a “Pet Amber Alert”.|$|R
5000|$|Under the AIHTS, {{the parties}} (currently, Canada, EU and Russia) {{guarantee}} not to impose trade restrictions on fur products from listed species from other signatory countries. The Agreement establishes procedures for settling disagreements {{and does not}} affect the right to resort to WTO (World Trade Organization). The Agreement on International <b>Humane</b> <b>Trapping</b> Standards applies to listed species (total of 19) regardless of the reason for trapping, including: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{committee}} is mandated to inform Canada’s Aboriginal trappers of important {{developments in the}} fur sector, particularly relating to international <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> standards and results of the trap research and testing program. The committee also facilitates communications and promotes joint programs between Aboriginal trappers and provincial and territorial wildlife agencies. Aboriginal organizations, governments and industry are kept informed of issues of concern to Aboriginal communities, trappers and the fur trade.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, {{following}} extensive {{pressure from}} the anti-fur lobby, the European Union (EU) passed Regulation 3254/91, which bans the import of wild fur products derived from 13 species into the EU from any country, unless {{the use of the}} leghold trap is prohibited in said country, or trapping methods used in that country meet internationally agreed <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> standards. EU Regulation 3254/91 remains in place in the EU today [...]|$|E
50|$|Horace, a ginger piebald (white {{with brown}} markings) stray, was {{wandering}} the site's boundary {{when he caught}} Brisbin’s attention. Brisbin, who had seen many rural dogs chained {{to the back of}} porches and doghouses, assumed this was just a normal stray. Many of these dogs roamed the woods and would turn up in <b>humane</b> <b>traps,</b> and Brisbin began to wonder how many more of these were in the wild. On a hunch, he went to the pound and was surprised by the resemblance the dog had to dingos.|$|R
5000|$|Ukiah Oregon is {{the main}} {{character}} of the series, a Pittsburgh-based private investigator. He was raised by wolves {{near the town of}} Ukiah, Oregon (where he gets his name) until Mom Jo caught him in a <b>humane</b> <b>trap</b> and took him home to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In Alien Taste he discovers that he is a half-alien [...] "breeder" [...] discovered to help the Ontongard invade Earth. In Tainted Trail he learns that he {{was a part of the}} original breeder named Magic Boy, who was murdered and dismembered in 1933.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{public concern}} about {{injuries}} caused by foothold traps {{has resulted in}} a considerable amount of research for more <b>humane</b> <b>traps.</b> Much of this research effort has focused on evaluating the Victor No. 3 Soft-Catch trap manufactured by Woodstream Corporation, Lititz, Pennsylvania (Linhart and Dasch 1992). Research has concentrated on two major areas: (1) efficiency and selectivity of different trap types and modifications used for capturing coyotes (Canis latrans) and (2) reducing animal injuries associated with trapping (Phillips and Mullis 1991). The Soft-Catch trap has been shown to reduce foot injury sustained by most captured furbearers (Tullar 1984, Olsen et al. 1986, Linhart et al. 1988, Olsen et al. 1988, Onderka et al. 1990) ...|$|R
50|$|By {{monitoring}} {{and participating in}} international activities on trapping, fur ranching, fur use and trade the committee is able to apprise and advise its members and stakeholders. This includes, but is not limited to, monitoring policies and activities of international organizations and governments affecting wildlife management or international trade, and participating in international forums, such as IUCN and CITES.The committee is also charged with managing the implementation in Canada of the 1997 Agreement on International <b>Humane</b> <b>Trapping</b> Standards (AIHTS) and provides a Canadian representative to the Joint Management Committee {{for the implementation of}} the AIHTS.|$|E
50|$|In a multi-agency {{effort that}} {{includes}} the City of San Diego Park and Recreation Department, the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game and the Wildlife Services Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, professionals from the wildlife program carry out the <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> of predators that are attracted to the Least Tern nesting sites. This includes skunks and opossums, as well as feral cats and dogs, believed to be former pets who were abandoned by their owners. Sites are located on North Fiesta Island, Mariner’s Point, Stoney Point, and a small island called “Government Island” used by the Federal Aviation Agency and houses a VORTAC station.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the implications that The European Economic Community 2 ̆ 7 s recent Wild Fur Regulation (WFR) {{might have on}} the U. S. wildlife damage control program. Beginning Jan. 1, 1995, the regulation will ban fur imports originating from countries which fail to (1) stop foothold trapping, and (2) adopt international <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> standards. Countries which pledge to adopt <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> standards will be granted a one-year extension {{to comply with the}} WFR. Because the European community is an important market for American furs, the regulation will affect the trapping of many American fur-bearing species, including raccoon, beaver, bobcat, muskrat, coyote, otter, badger, lynx, marten sable, and ermine...|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the current}} threats to the {{biodiversity}} of the site are natural in origin. [...] A perennial problem is the invasive Japanese knotweed, which shades out local plant species with its dense growth. [...] Removing it is time-consuming as the herbicide used to control {{it has to be}} injected straight into the root system, to prevent it reaching other flora. [...] Alder trees are also at risk at the reserve, this time from a fungal disease caused by Phytophthora alni. [...] Being water-borne, this infection could spread to all the alders on the site. [...] Another natural threat is that of the introduced [...] Harlequin ladybird which was first identified at the site in June 2008 and is a severe threat to the native seven-spot ladybird population as it is such an effective aphid predator. Mink are occasional visitors to the reserve, although <b>humane</b> <b>traps</b> are used in an attempt to control them. [...] Mink are a serious threat to ground-nesting birds, and since they are strong swimmers, the nests on the East Marsh islands are vulnerable to them.|$|R

40|$|Youth fur harvest {{programs}} in Kansas {{have been developed}} as one phase of an overall series of youth education projects on ecology and the environment. Currently, the series includes Ecology, Acres for Wildlife, Kansas Mammals, Birds Around You, Reptiles and Amphibians, Fur Harvest, and Fishing. Basically, the fur harvester project was developed because, although many {{young people in the}} state are interested in trapping, few good sources of information or instruction were available to most young trappers. Because many objectionable trapping abuses are unintentionally caused by young or inexperienced trappers, it was hoped that this project would encourage ethical and <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> and would result in an improved understanding of wildlife and the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of laws at both {{national and international}} level dealing with the welfare of wild animals has been slow. In 1994 the European Community agreed a Regulations banning the use of leg-hold traps but import bans were postponed following the threat of legal challenge by the US and Canada under GATT and WTO. The subsequent legal and policy history reveals important insights into the developments of international environmental standards where difficult ethical issues arise. The International Standards Organisation's attempts to devise agreed standards for <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> were frustrated by a consensus based approach and fundamental disagreement between interested parties. Their work was eventually confined to standards concerning trap testing methodology, thus avoiding difficult moral judgements and uncertainties. Eventually, negotiations between the European Community, Canada, the US, and the Russian Federation led in 1998 to two international agreements. These are the first such agreements to deal expressly with the welfare of wild animals, but can still be criticised as being over-concerned with the facilitation of trade...|$|E
50|$|Children and {{education}} {{are very much}} {{at the heart of}} what the Friends of Bilbrook do and they try to include the local schools wherever possible. Pupils from Lane Green and Bilbrook Middle Schools regularly visit the jubilee Wood for outdoor education sessions including pond dipping, tree recognition, bug hunts and pooh stick competitions. The school children were also present during the opening of <b>humane</b> mammal <b>traps</b> as part of a small mammal survey undertaken by South Staffordshire College at Rodbaston.|$|R
40|$|The {{foothold}} trap is {{an important}} tool {{that is used by}} the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal Damage Control (ADC) program to capture coyotes (Canis latrans) that are causing livestock depredations. In FY 1990 and FY 1991 the ADC program trapped 17, 732 and 15, 805 coyotes, respectively (USDA 1991; 1992). Foothold traps can cause trauma and injury to feet and legs (Englund 1982; Linhart et al. 1986; Olsen et al. 1986, 1988; Onderka et al. 1990, Tullar 1984) and Onderka et al. (1990) observed oral injuries such as broken teeth, and tongue and gum lacerations in captured animals. The ADC program and other organizations such as the U. S. Technical Advisory Group for <b>Humane</b> <b>Trap</b> Standards (Linhart 1990), are investigating means of reducing injuries to animals caught in traps. Two approaches to reduce injuries, trap modification and the use of a tranquilizer, have been investigated and previously tested in the field. Most of the studies have focused upon trap modifications. Several studies have evaluated the padded jaw trap (Linhart et al. 1986; 1988; Linhart and Dasch 1992; Olsen et al. 1986; Onderka et al. 1990; Tullar 1984). These studies show that padded foothold traps reduce, but do not eliminate injury to captured animals...|$|R
50|$|The Japanese Animal Welfare Society (JAWS) UK can {{be traced}} to an {{organization}} founded in Tokyo in 1945 by British expatriates. Its original aim was to improve the welfare of dogs used for experiments, whose were kept in poor conditions and used in unregulated, in vivo tests. Officially founded in the UK, JAWS UK continued to assist efforts to help these dogs and other animals, eventually helping to found a JAWS based in Japan. Its current activities include funding vital animal welfare equipment such as veterinary drugs and <b>humane</b> cat <b>traps,</b> providing general funds for local animal welfare groups, and promoting the Five Freedoms for Japanese animals.|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} national random digit {{dial telephone}} interview was conducted between September and November 2010. There were 1, 015 households that had owned {{a dog or}} cat within the past five years. Of these 817 households owned dogs and 506 owned cats. Fourteen percent of dogs (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 11 – 16 %) and 15 % (95 % CI: 12 – 18 %) of cats {{were lost in the}} past five years. No owner demographic variables were associated with losing a pet. Ninety three percent (95 % CI: 86 – 97 %) of dogs and 75 % (95 % CI: 64 – 85 %) of cats were recovered. For dogs, searching the neighborhood and returning on their own were the most common methods of finding the dog; 14 % were found through an identification tag. For cats, returning on their own was most common. Dogs were more likely than cats to be lost more than once. Cats were less likely than dogs to have any type of identification. Knowledge of the successful methods of finding dogs and cats can provide invaluable help for owners of lost pets. Since 25 % of lost cats were not found, other methods of reuniting cats and their owners are needed. Collars and ID tags or <b>humane</b> <b>trapping</b> could be valuable approaches...|$|E
50|$|Supporters of cage traps {{say that}} they are the most <b>humane</b> form of <b>trapping,</b> and in some {{countries}} are the only method of trapping allowed. Cage traps are used by animal control officers to catch unwanted animals and move them to another location without harm, as well as by gamekeepers to catch birds and animals they consider to be pests.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951, it {{was illegal}} for {{non-profit}} tax-exempt organizations to engage in lobbying activities. “We couldn’t do any substantial amount of lobbying and keep our tax-exempt status,” explained Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) founder Christine Stevens, who {{is referred to as}} the [...] "Mother of the Animal Protection Movement." [...] Her solution was to form an organization that did not require a tax-exempt status, one that would inform senators, representatives and the public about animal issues. The Society for Animal Protective Legislation (SAPL) became the first organization founded in the United States specifically to lobby on behalf of animals. If legislators wanted to know more about issues pertaining to <b>humane</b> slaughter, leghold <b>traps</b> or endangered species, they contacted SAPL. Because of changes in tax laws, in 2003, SAPL merged with the Animal Welfare Institute, bringing together two of the oldest and leading animal protection organizations in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|When John Edgerley sailed for England in 1842 he {{had taken}} back a {{collection}} of New Zealand plants for Kew Gardens. In return the director of Kew, Sir William Hooker, undertook to provide him {{with a wide range}} of flowering shrubs (six casefuls) for setting up his nursery on this land in Epsom. Edgerley requested the following plants: “Rhododendrons, camellias, arbutus or strawberry tree, laurustine, Portugal laurel, common laurel, azaleas, a plant or two of lilac, wisteria sinensis, tree paeonia, with a few plants of fuchsias - corymbiflora if you can spare it, ribes sanguinea, magonlia grandiflora, deutzia scabra, box for hedging, with a few good roses, white moss if you can spare it, ajuga japonica, cedar of Lebanon, jasminum…acorns, chestnuts, hawthorn berries or any other seed you thought would germinate, also a small collection of good flower seeds with fir cones” [...] Although roses, flowering seeds and annuals had been imported by early missionaries, their planting concentrated on practical plants such as fruit trees, shelter trees and crops. Certainly this was the first importation of rhododendrums, camellias, azaleas, lilac and wisteria into New Zealand [...] He married Sarah Newnham at Upper Arley on 27, December, 1842 and they travelled on the Tyne arriving at Hobart August 1843 then coming on to Auckland. It was possible that he leased some land immediately in the Epsom/Newmarket area as in the police census of 1844, he was living in a raupo hut in that location. John Edgerley brought a collection of items out with him including a set of blasting tools, candle snuffers, a tinder box and a <b>humane</b> man <b>trap,</b> these items are now in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|R
