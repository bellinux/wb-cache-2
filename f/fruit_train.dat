40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} the viticultural performance of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah wine cultivars on dry-hot climate conditions in the Southeast Region of Turkey. Vine yield components (bud survival (%), cluster number/vine (n), cluster number/shoot ratio (n), cluster weight (g), yield/vine (kg) and berry weight (g), fruit composition as Brix (soluble solids %), and pH and titratable acidity (TA g/l) were measured during two growing seasons between the years 2009 and 2010. The maximum mean bud survival rate (0. 96 %) was measured in the Cabernet Sauvignon grape cultivar in 2009, and the minimum rate (0. 77 %) was measured in the Syrah grape cultivar in 2010.

Texture {{parameters}} are important factors for characterizing the sensory quality of raw almonds; nevertheless there is scarce literature that explores sensory differences among cultivars. The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize quality attributes of different raw almond cultivars. Materials and methods. The almond cultivars 'Nonpareil', 'Mission', 'Supernova', `Tuono', 'Ferragnes' and 'Marcona' were used to characterize their industrial and sensory quality attributes. A panel of 14 assessors with previous experience in testing stone <b>fruit</b> was specifically <b>trained</b> on descriptive analysis for determining quality and particularly texture of raw almonds. Results and discussion. A direct relationship was observed between kernel yield and shell fracture resistance; the American cultivars 'Nonpareil', and 'Mission' showed more minor shell fracture resistance than the European. `Tuono' stood out for being tasty, crunchy and hard, whereas 'Marcona' was noted for its color intensity, crispness and hardness; but it lacked taste. 'Supernova' was described as tasty. Conclusion. A 5 -h training period proved to be adequate for characterizing raw almond cultivars.

5000|$|Many {{species of}} fruit, e.g., fig, filbert, olive, and pomegranate, are {{commonly}} grown {{on their own}} roots, as {{there may be no}} great advantages to using a special rootstock, or suitable rootstocks may not be readily available. However, even for fruit trees that usually are grown grafted on a rootstock, there can be advantages in growing them on their own roots instead, particularly in the traditional coppicing systems advocated in both sustainable agriculture and permaculture. Disadvantages of using own-root trees can include excessive size and excessive production of wood (thus very long times until the start of <b>fruit</b> production), although <b>training</b> branches horizontally and limiting pruning to summer only may help encourage fruit production at an earlier age.

40|$|Description and {{modelisation}} {{of growth}} and development of appletree (Malus x domestica Borkh.). I. Most probable structure of young tree. Based on the observation of all or, at least, {{a large number of}} shoots growing on unpruned apple trees, cv. Cox's Orange Pippin and Jonagold grafted on EM 9, an original codification system has been conceived. It allows to locate and identify quickly and unequivocally any shoot or growth. From a comprehensive collection of such codified observations, the most probable structure of young one to five year old trees has been established, with the amount and characters of the different observed shoot types. Both varieties display very similar gross structures, despite minor differences in form, flowering mode and productivity. The development of the trees occurs in two phases. The first one builds up a frame composed by the trunk and several storied sets of branches. Flowering is rather strictly alternate during this phase. The second one consists in the reinforcement of the branches by axillary growth, but even more by sympodial branching due to increasing and repeated terminal flowering. This basic structure provides a reference to appreciate changes in tree development brought about by rootstock, <b>fruit</b> load or <b>training</b> practices...|$|R
