The telephone rings, and after looking at the phone, she finds the chair empty again.

40|$|Summary-Normal {{sleepers}} {{were instructed}} either to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> {{as quickly as}} they could or to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> whenever they desired, under a high mental load (listening to John Philip Sousa marches) or a low mental load (listening to sleep-conducive new age music). Under low load, participants trying to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> quickly did so faster than those attempting only to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> whenever they desired. Under high load, however, and consistent with the ironic process theory of mental control (Wegner, D. M [...] 1994, Psychological Review, 101, 34 - 52), sleep onset latency was greater for participants attempting to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> quickly than for those not attempting to do so.

5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote <b>falling</b> <b>asleep,</b> so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> may induce frustration that further prevents <b>falling</b> <b>asleep,</b> so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|R
40|$|Driver {{surveys are}} {{indispensable}} {{sources of information}} when estimating the role of sleepiness in crash causation. The {{purpose of the study}} was to (1) identify the prevalence of driving while sleepy among Finnish drivers, (2) determine the circumstances of such instances, and (3) identify risk factors and risk groups. Survey data were collected from a representative sample of active Finnish drivers (N = 1121). One-fifth of the drivers (19. 5 %) reported having <b>fallen</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel during their driving career, with 15. 9 % reporting having been close to <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> or having difficulty staying awake when driving during the previous twelve months. Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were found to be associated with both types of sleepiness-related driving instances, while sleep quality was associated only with the latter. Compared to women, men more often reported <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel; the differences were somewhat smaller with respect to fighting sleep while driving during the previous twelve months. The reported discrepancy in sleepiness-related instances (high prevalence of fighting sleep while driving during the previous twelve months and lower proportion of actually <b>falling</b> <b>asleep)</b> identifies young men (⩽ 25 years) as one of the main target groups for safety campaigns. Approximately three-quarters of drivers who had <b>fallen</b> <b>asleep</b> while driving reported taking action against <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> before it actually happened. Furthermore, almost all drivers who had <b>fallen</b> <b>asleep</b> while driving offered at least one logical reason that could have contributed to their <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> These data indicate some degree of awareness about driving while sleepy and of the potential pre-trip factors that could lead to sleepiness while driving, and supports the notion that <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel does not come as a (complete) surprise to the driver...|$|R

When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout <b>falls</b> <b>asleep</b> during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E

50|$|A person, then, who fears (i.e. {{experiences}} anticipatory anxiety over) {{not getting}} a good night's sleep may try too hard (that is, hyper-intend) to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> and this would hinder their ability to do so. A logotherapist would recommend, then, that the person go to bed and intentionally try not to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b> This would relieve the anticipatory anxiety which kept the person awake in the first place, thus allowing them to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> in an acceptable amount of time.|$|R

5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting meat in his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into a pile. The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It remains on the screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then <b>falls</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E

5|$|From January to October 1890, Morris serialised his novel, News from Nowhere, in Commonweal, {{resulting}} in improved circulation for the paper. In March 1891 {{it was published}} in book form, before being translated into French, Italian, and German by 1898 and becoming a classic among Europe's socialist community. Combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction, the book tells the tale of a contemporary socialist, William Guest, who <b>falls</b> <b>asleep</b> and awakes in the mid-20th century, discovering a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems; it was a depiction of Morris' ideal socialist society.|$|E

5|$|Petersen {{has claimed}} in an {{interview}} that one of the film's scenes forced the crew to adopt a guerrilla filmmaking approach. The scene in which Petersen's character Will Graham <b>falls</b> <b>asleep</b> while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use of an airplane during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets for the crew on a flight from Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as hand luggage, to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane's passengers and crew mollified with Manhunter crew jackets.|$|E
