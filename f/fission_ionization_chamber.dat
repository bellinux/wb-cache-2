The time-of-flight technique {{was used to measure}} the cross-section ratio as a function of neutron energy from 0. 001 to 30 MeV. The continuous energy spectrum of the neutron source allowed us to cover the entire energy range in one measurement. Pulse height distributions were also measured as functions of energy over broad energy bands. These data were used to estimate the energy variation in the efficiency to be less than 0. 75 percent. The threshold cross-section method normalized the ratio independent of other cross-section measurements to 1. 268 +- 0. 022 in the interval 1. 75 to 4. 00 MeV. The ratio was also taken to thermal neutron energy where it was normalized to evaluated thermal fission cross sections and the resulting ratio in the 1. 75 - to 4. 00 -MeV interval was 1. 242 +- 0. 021. Corrected for the impurities in the $sup 241 $Pu sample, the average of these two values resulted in a $sup 241 $Pu:$sup 235 $U fission cross-section ratio of 1. 251 +- 0. 016 for the normalization interval.

40|$|For {{efficient}} {{exploitation of}} research reactors, {{it is important}} to discern neutron flux distribution inside the reactor with the best possible precision. For this reason, <b>fission</b> and <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> are used to measure the neutron field. In these arrays, the sequences of the neutron interaction points in the fission chamber can correctly be identified in order to obtain true neutron energies emitted by nuclei of interest. However, together with the neutrons, gamma-rays are also emitted from nuclei and thereby affect neutron spectra. The originality of this study consists in the application of tensor based blind source separation methods to extract independent components from signals recorded at the fission chamber preamplifierâs output. The objective is to achieve software neutron-gamma discrimination using Nonnegative Tensor Factorization tools. For reasons of nuclear safety, we first simulate the neutron flux inside the TRIGA Mark II Reactor using Monte Carlo methods under Geant 4 platform linked to Garfield++.

40|$|The neutron {{time-of-flight}} facility n_TOF at CERN, {{fully operational}} since 2002, combines a high instantaneous neutron flux with high energy resolution. The wide energy range {{and the high}} neutron flux per time-of-flight burst result in a much enhanced signal to background ratio for neutron capture of radioactive isotopes and makes this facility well suited for the measurement of high quality neutron-induced reaction cross-sections. Neutrons are created by spallation reactions induced by a pulsed 20 GeV/c proton beam impinging on a lead target. A 5 cm water slab surrounding the lead target serves as a coolant {{and at the same}} time as a moderator of the spallation neutron spectrum, providing a wide energy spectrum from 0. 1 eV to about 250 MeV. By the end of 2005, a first phase of data taking has been successfully terminated. Fission and capture experiments have been performed on a variety of isotopes of interest for nuclear astrophysics, advanced nuclear technologies and for basic nuclear physics. The instrumentation developed for this facility consists of parallel plate avalanche counter and <b>fission</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> detectors for the fission experiments and of low mass C 6 D 6 detectors and a 4 pi BaF 2 total absorption calorimeter for capture experiments. A new data acquisition system, based on sampling of the detector signals, has been developed to cope with the high count rates and to minimize the effective dead time to only a few tens of nanosecond. A second phase of data taking is planned to start in 2007, after an upgrade of the spallation target. On the longer term, the construction of a flight path at 20 in resulting in an increased neutron flux of about a factor of 100 opens new possibilities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In 2010 a {{proposal}} (Modernizing the Fission Basis) {{was prepared to}} 'resolve long standing differences between LANL and LLNL associated with the correct fission basis for analysis of nuclear test data'. Collaboration between LANL/LLNL/TUNL has been formed to implement this program by performing high precision measurements of neutron induced fission product yields {{as a function of}} incident neutron energy. This new program benefits from successful previous efforts utilizing mono-energetic neutrons undertaken by this collaboration. The first preliminary experiment in this new program was performed between July 24 - 31, 2011 at TUNL and had 2 main objectives: (1) demonstrating the capability to measure characteristic {gamma}-rays from specific fission products; (2) studying background effects from room scattered neutrons. In addition, a new dual <b>fission</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> has been designed and manufactured. The production design of the chamber is shown in the picture below. The first feasibility experiment to test this chamber is scheduled at the TUNL Tandem Laboratory from September 19 - 25, 2011. The dual fission chamber design will allow simultaneous exposure of absolute fission fragment emission rate detectors and the thick fission activation foils, positioned between the two chambers. This document formalizes the earlier experimental report demonstrating the experimental capability to make accurate (< 2 %) precision gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements of the excitation function of high fission product yields of the 239 Pu(n,f) reaction (induced by quasimonoenergetic neutrons). A second experiment (9 / 2011) introduced an compact double-sided fission chamber into the experimental arrangement, and so the relative number of incident neutrons striking the sample foil at each bombarding energy is limited only by statistics. (The number of incident neutrons often limits the experimental accuracy.) Fission chamber operation was so exceptional that 2 more chambers have been fabricated; thus fission foils of different isotopes may be left in place with sample changes. The scope of the measurements is both greatly expanded and the results become vetted. Experiment 2 is not reported here. A continuing experiment has been proposed for February 2012...|$|E
