5|$|Increased {{experimental}} precision {{combined with}} vastly improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields. In 1936 Alexander Oparin (1894–1980) demonstrated a possible {{mechanism for the}} synthesis of organic matter from inorganic molecules. In the 1960s <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that the Earth's earliest life-forms treated as plants, the cyanobacteria known as stromatolites, dated back some 3.5 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Introduced to UBS by Khashoggi in 1982, Khan {{enabled the}} arms dealer to launder funds held in American {{accounts}} through UBS Geneva.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> {{that many}} Ontario {{highways}} no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and {{should therefore be}} maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998 (downloading), removing {{a significant percentage of}} the provincial highway network.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} seeing a parachute drifting {{away from the}} falling F-100F, leading to the hope that a pilot had ejected, but when the parachute was located <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to be a drag parachute that {{is meant to be}} deployed on landing to help slow the fighter down.|$|E
5|$|A 1993 study {{commissioned}} by the United States Army to investigate racial discrimination in the awarding of medals. During the investigation <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that one Veteran American Jew and Holocaust survivor, Tibor Rubin, had {{been the subject of}} discrimination due to his religion and should have received the Medal of Honor. In 2005, 55 years later, President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Honor to Rubin in a ceremony at the White House, for his actions in 1950 during the Korean War.|$|E

50|$|The minimum {{covering}} {{circle of}} a set S can <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> by at most three points in S which lie on the boundary of the circle. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> by only two points, then the line segment joining those two points must be a diameter of the minimum circle. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> by three points, then the triangle consisting of those three points is not obtuse.|$|R
5|$|An {{area known}} as the Marius Hills was {{considered}} for Apollo 15, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> by mission planners that a landing {{on the edge of}} Mare Imbrium at the Hadley-Apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a seismometer at Hadley-Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, would create a more optimal configuration for seismic study.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains {{impacted}} the same area for more than a week, resulting in severe flooding. Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. Following an assessment of the damage, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino.|$|E
5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly {{believed}} that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{maiden flight}} in March 1958, {{evaluation}} of the RP-77D by the U.S. Army took place throughout the remainder of that year, nearly 40 test flights being conducted. Although the test results were generally satisfactory, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that {{the performance of the}} aircraft was an insufficient improvement over existing types in service to have the aircraft ordered into production, and the project was cancelled, along with the improved RP-86, a dedicated reconnaissance variant.|$|E

5|$|Grissom {{was sent}} to the Lovelace Clinic and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to undergo {{extensive}} physical examinations and to submit to a battery of psychological tests. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space. On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts.|$|E
5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, {{to vote in the}} royal election.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> {{that the}} rhesus monkey kidney cells used {{to prepare the}} {{poliovirus}} vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, {{it has not been}} determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E

After further investigation in 2001, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> that the North Shore Towers {{was one of}} four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Saleh engaged several NDS agents infiltrating the Pakistani {{tribal areas}} {{to search for}} bin Laden and other al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders.

In 2006, Saleh was {{presented}} with evidence that bin Laden was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles from the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan. He shared the intelligence with former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who angrily brushed off the claim, taking no action.|$|E
