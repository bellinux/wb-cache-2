25|$|The Government {{addressed}} the claim by instructing Radio New Zealand and Television New Zealand to broadcast more Māori programmes, and funding {{the establishment of}} Māori-owned and Māori-controlled radio stations. Twenty one iwi radio stations were started between 1989 and 1994. These were initially funded by NZ on Air from 1990, with six percent of broadcasting fees allocated to Māori broadcasting. A call for Māori to have greater control of funding led {{to the establishment of}} a separate Te Mangai Paho <b>funding</b> <b>agency</b> in 1995, and this agency became funded through taxation. The establishment of these stations allowed the Government to justify the sale of Radio New Zealand's commercial Newstalk ZB and ZM stations to the privately owned Australian Radio Network partnership in 1996, after the sale was challenged in the High Court and Court of Appeal.|$|E

In the September 2015 AET Board meeting, the CEO Ian Comfort was cited explaining the situation by {{saying that he had}} not even been aware of the crucial deadline for reporting to the Education <b>Funding</b> <b>Agency,</b> and that was why the paperwork was not submitted that would have enabled the Financial Notice to Improve, to be lifted.
