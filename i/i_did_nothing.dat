500|$|Lowell {{attended}} Harvard College {{beginning at}} age 15 in 1834, {{though he was}} not a good student and often got into trouble. In his sophomore year, he was absent from required chapel attendance 14 times and from classes 56 times. In his last year there, he wrote, [...] "During Freshman year, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing,</b> during Sophomore year <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing,</b> during Junior year <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing,</b> and during Senior year I have thus far done nothing in the way of college studies." [...] In his senior year, {{he became one of the}} editors of Harvardiana literary magazine, to which he contributed prose and poetry that he admitted was of low quality. As he said later, [...] "I was as great an ass as ever brayed & thought it singing." [...] During his undergraduate years, Lowell was a member of Hasty Pudding and served both as Secretary and Poet.|$|E

500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song is Beck's {{innovative}} guitar playing. Shadwick comments it [...] "suited Beck's taste for shaping and sculpting guitar sounds through the control and manipulation of sustain and, on occasion, feedback". Beck recalled he began incorporating feedback into his guitar solos after he realised that he could control it, adding [...] "I started finding the resonant points on the neck where it came in best. [...] I loved {{it because it was}} a most peculiar sound that contrasted wildly with a plucked string, this round trombone-like noise coming from nowhere. [...] In addition to feedback, Beck's uses a musical scale and bent notes variously described as Eastern, Indian, or raga sounding. [...] Critics and biographers have called the solo [...] "monumental fuzz-drenched", [...] "explosively warped", and [...] "climaxed with a solitary, gigantic burst of feedback". [...] For many, the song represents the Yardbirds' creative peak, including Beck. [...] He commented, [...] "'Shapes of Things' was the pinnacle of the Yardbirds" [...] and added [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> else, that was the best single".|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to Colorado Springs, O'Hare, {{who did not}} skate in the 1000m, filed a formal complaint. The complaint was founded on Ohno's seemingly deliberate attempt to stop Biondo {{from being able to}} pass Smith. [...] Because of that blocking move on Biondo, Smith finished in second place and Davis finished first. [...] For three days, Ohno, Smith, and Davis stood before an arbitration panel of the United States Olympic Committee. [...] During the hearing, Davis was never accused of being at fault and Smith made the statement: [...] "Any allegation that there was a fix, conspiracy or understanding between Apolo and me, or anyone else, to let Shani win the race is completely false. Shani is a great athlete, skated a great race, and deserves to be on the team." [...] The final verdict was that O'Hare's claims went unproven, all three were absolved of guilt, and the claim was dismissed. [...] After the dismissal, Ohno stated, [...] "I am thrilled that the arbitration process has officially vindicated me... As I've said since the moment of these accusations, they were untrue and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong".|$|E

I personally was not involved in accounting at the company. I'm very confident that the company did things right. We had a rather elaborate control function, both internal and external, and to my knowledge that was undertaken correctly." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 28, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell {{announced}} the upholding of Brady's four game suspension. Brady gave permission to the NFLPA {{to appeal the}} suspension in federal court. Goodell cited Brady's destruction of his cell phone as {{a critical factor in}} his decision to uphold Brady's suspension. The NFL also filed papers in federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodell's decision. On July 29 Brady released a statement on his Facebook page that criticized [...] Goodell's decision to uphold the suspension, saying in part [...] "I am very disappointed by the NFL's decision to uphold the 4 game suspension against me. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong, and no one in the Patriots organization did either... I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players without a fight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hitchcock {{returned}} to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short films in French for the British Ministry of Information: Bon Voyage and Aventure Malgache. The two British propaganda films made for the Free French were the only films that Hitchcock made in the French language, and they [...] "feature typical Hitchcockian touches". On his motivation for making the films, Hitchcock stated: [...] "I {{felt the need to}} make a little contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and over-age for military service. I knew that if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing,</b> I'd regret {{it for the rest of}} my life." [...] From late June to late July 1945, Hitchcock served as [...] "treatment advisor" [...] on a Holocaust documentary which used footage provided by the Allied Forces. It was produced by Sidney Bernstein of the British Ministry of Information, and was assembled in London. Bernstein brought his future 1948–49 production partner Hitchcock on board as a consultant for the film editing process for the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{was arrested}} {{with a young}} protégé, Oliver Wilson, while {{attempting}} to draw in victims for a local bunco game in Broadway on April 21, 1885. Police had received reports {{that there had been}} bunco men operating in the district as county merchants arriving in the city to make their annual spring purchases. When police officers arrived at the scene, they [...] "saw them accost a number of persons, shake hands with them, and act in the manner of [...] "bunco steerers". They were tried at the Jefferson Market Police Court the following day on a charge of disorderly conduct. Lewis explained away the charges by pointing out that he did not collect a crowd, obstruct the sidewalk, use profane or improper language or any other cause which legally defined [...] "disorderly conduct". He also denied having [...] "accosted strangers" [...] stating to the judge [...] "I am not in the habit of accosting strangers. I spoke to and shook hands with several friends. That is the way, I believe, that gentlemen greet one another in the street. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to justify this arrest". One of these men, Lewis claimed, had asked him directions to the Astor Library at which time he was arrested. Despite his defense, he and Wilson were both fined $10. Though both men were well-dressed and [...] "wore what appeared to be gold-mounted chains" [...] neither had watches or any collateral to pay for their release. 23 Apr 1885 ...|$|E
