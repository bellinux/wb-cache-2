40|$|A criticial {{evaluation}} {{was made}} of the <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> diazo and two solvent-partition methods for the determination of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in human and rat bile. The <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> diazo reagent, which reacts only with conjugated bilirubin in serum, also diazotized a variable proportion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile and thus overestimated the concentration of monoconjugates. With the Weber-Schalm and modified Folsch solvent-partition methods applied to human or rat bile, 4 [...] 9 % of added 14 C-labelled unconjugated bilirubin partitioned with the conjugated bilirubin in the upper phase, and 4 [...] 9 % of added 14 C-labelled conjugated bilirubin partitioned into the lower phase. With dog bile, the spill-over of 14 C-labelled bilirubin into the lower phase was 9 [...] 11 %. Analysis of azopigments from the Weber-Schalm partition confirmed that over two-thirds of the bilirubin in the lower phase represents monoconjugates, principally the less-polar monoxylosides and monoglucosides. These solvent-partition methods thus overestimate the concentration of unconjugated bilirubin in bile...|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} reaction of bilirubin with the diazonium salts of <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> or of aniline yields two isomeric azopigments. These can be separated by t. l. c. as their methyl esters. The mass spectra of {{each pair of}} azopigments are very similar, showing that they are isomers. Proton-magnetic-resonance spectrometric studies show that they differ in {{the positions of the}} substituents on the pyrrolenone end ring; in one compound the methyl and vinyl groups are interposed compared with the other compound. These azo compounds were used as reference standards for determination of the site of conjugation in bilirubin monoglucuronide prepared enzymically. Analysis showed that conjugation occurs at the carboxyethyl side chain of both sides of the bilirubin molecule. During the preparation of the <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> reference compounds a series of minor azopigments were isolated by t. l. c. Analysis of the mass spectra of many of these showed that three side reactions can occur: (1) methylation of the imide carbonyl group; (2) addition of methanol or water to the vinyl substituent; (3) transmethylation of the ethoxycarbonyl group...|$|E

40|$|Copolymers of aniline with {{anthranilic acid}} and two esters, <b>ethyl</b> and methyl <b>anthranilate,</b> were {{prepared}} through chemical synthesis {{using a variety}} of acids as the dopant. All polymers and copolymers were characterized by UV-Vis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies, as well as scanning electron microscopy. The data support the formation of variable amounts of phenazine-like structures due to ortho-coupling polymerization that competes with the para-coupling mode for the construction of the polymer backbone. The electrical conductivity and the solubility in a diversity of solvents were determined and correlated with the spectral data. The copolymers of aniline with anthranilic esters are more soluble than the corresponding polyanilines. In addition, the conductivity of the copolymer with methyl anthranilate doped with trifluoroacetic acid is of the same order of magnitude as that observed for the regular polyanilines.

40|$|Procedures for the synthesis, {{separation}} and determination of {{structure of the}} bilirubin-IX isomers are described. 1. The four biliverdin-IX isomers were prepared by oxidative cleavage of haemin and were separated as their dimethyl esters. The individual esters were reduced with NaBH 4, and the bilirubin esters obtained were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis yielding the corresponding bilirubin-IX isomers. 2. The bilirubin-IX isomers were structurally characterized (a) at the tetrapyrrolic stage by mass spectrometry of their trimethylsilyl derivatives and (b) by formation and structural analysis of their dipyrrolic <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> azo derivatives. 3. The absorption spectrum of bilirubin-IX alpha differed strikingly from the spectra of the other isomers. The presence of a pronounced shoulder around 453 nm in the spectrum of bilirubin-IXbeta allows easy differentiation from bilirubin-IXdelta. Methylation of the carboxyl groups largely eliminates the spectral differences between the IXalpha- and non-alpha isomers. 4. The bilirubin-IX isomers are conveniently separated by t. l. c. Detection and unequivocal identification is possible on a micro-scale by (a) t. l. c. with respect to reference compounds and (b) subsequent formation and t. l. c. of the more stable <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> azopigments. 5.

Here, extracted unconjugated bilirubin, bilirubin monomethyl esters, bilirubin dimethyl ester, and internal standard are separated on a reversed-phase column within 15 min, detected in the effluent at 436 nm, and quantified from their peak areas. Carotenoids do not interfere. Within-day and day-to-day CVs range from 5 to 13 %. The smallest concentrations of monoconjugated and diconjugated pigments that are detectable and measurable are about 10 and 20 nmol/L, respectively.

In both behavioral situations we compared the effect to the well-documented repellent N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). MDA, EA, and DEET inhibited Aedes aegypti from flying towards skin odor while BA had no such effect. Conversely, MDA had no effect on oviposition while EA, BA, and DEET deterred oviposition, with the strongest effect observed for BA. Thus, we confirm that EA and DEET are generally repellent, while MDA is repellent only in a host-seeking context, and BA is deterrent only in an oviposition context.

40|$|We {{describe}} a facile and sensitive reverse-phase h. p. l. c. method for analytical separation of biliary bile pigments and direct quantification of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and its monoglucuronide (BMG) and diglucuronide (BDG) conjugates in bile. The method can be 'scaled up' for preparative isolation of pure BDG and BMG from pigment-enriched biles. We employed an Altex ultrasphere ODS {{column in the}} preparative steps and a Waters mu-Bondapak C 18 column in the separatory and analytical procedures. Bile pigments were eluted with ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4. 5, and a 20 min linear gradient of 60 - 100 % (v/v) methanol at a flow rate of 2. 0 ml/min for the preparative separations and 1. 0 ml/min for the analytical separations. Bile pigments were eluted in order of decreasing polarity (glucuronide greater than glucose greater than xylose conjugates greater than UCB) and were chemically identified by t. l. c. of their respective <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> azo derivatives. Quantification of UCB {{was carried out by}} using a standard curve relating a range of h. p. l. c. integrated peak areas to concentrations of pure crystalline UCB. A pure crystalline <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> azo derivative of UCB (AZO. UCB) was employed as a single h. p. l. c. reference standard for quantification of BMG and BDG. We demonstrate that: separation and quantification of biliary bile pigments are rapid (approximately 25 min); bile pigment concentrations ranging from 1 - 500 microM can be determined 'on line' by using 5 microliters of bile without sample pretreatment; bilirubin conjugates can be obtained preparatively in milligram quantities without degradation or contamination by other components of bile. H. p. l. c. analyses of a series of mammalian biles show that biliary UCB concentrations generally range from 1 to 17 microM. These values are considerably lower than those estimated previously by t. l. c. BMG is the predominant, if not exclusive, bilirubin conjugate in the biles of a number of rodents (guinea pig, hamster, mouse, prairie dog) that are experimental models of both pigment and cholesterol gallstone formation.

40|$|An unknown {{bilirubin}} conjugate {{was detected}} by HPLC analysis in the bile of yellowtail, Seriola quinqueradiata. The retention time of this unknown conjugate was identical with that of authentic ditaurobilirubin, a bilirubin conjugated with 2 mol of taurine. The retention times of the <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> diazo derivatives of both bilirubin conjugates were the same. The azo derivatives of this unknown conjugate were purified by Amberlite XAD- 2 treatment and preparative TLC and hydrolyzed with 6 N HC 1 at 105 °C for 12 h. The hydrolyzates obtained were analyzed with an amino acid analyzer. The ninhydrin-positive substance in the hydrolyzates was purified by column chromatography and analyzed by TLC and mass spectrometry. The results of these analyses indicated that this ninhydrin-positive substance was taurine. Therefore, this unknown bilirubin conjugate was identified as ditaurobilirubin. In mammals, the bilirubin produced from endog-enous heme undergoes further metabolic modi-fication to glycosyl ester before being eventually excreted in the bile (7, 2). Chowdhury et al.

Extracted pigment was submitted to thin-layer chromatography, and the separated bilirubins were either immediately eluted and determined spectrophotometrically or individually converted to <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> azo derivatives for thin-layer chromatographic analysis of each isolated pigment band. Bilirubins in duodenal bile of eight healthy adults comprised 1. 5 +/- 1. 3 % unconjugated bilirubin-IX alpha, 69 +/- 6 % bilirubin diglucuronide, and 16 +/- 4 % bilirubin monoglucuronides. Mixed diconjugates containing one glucuronosyl moiety and either one xylosyl or one glucosyl group amounted to 10 +/- 3 %. Most samples (6 of 8) contained trace amounts (0. 6 +/- 0. 6 %) of unconjugated bilirubin-IX beta, in agreement with nearly exclusive cleavage of heme at the alpha-meso position. The composition of the bilirubins in bile was normal in 6 patients with cholesterol gallstones, 4 with chronic hepatitis, and 3 with hemolysis. In duodenal bile of individuals with Gilbert's syndrome (n = 10), the concentration of bilirubin conjugates was comparable to that in healthy adults, but the proportion of bilirubin diglucuronides (52 +/- 8 %) was decreased.

40|$|Neutral solvent {{systems were}} {{developed}} to isolate the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta isomers of biliverdin IX dimethyl ester by TLC. The individual free acids of biliverdin IX were obtained by saponification of the corresponding dimethyl esters. The bilirubin IX isomers were prepared by reducing the corresponding biliverdin IX isomers with NaBH 3 CN. Starting from a pure biliverdin IX dimethyl ester, the corresponding free acid of biliverdin IX or bilirubin IX was available within 3 - 4 h. Preparation of spectrally pure bile pigment required final TLC on acid-cleaned neutral TLC plates. The absorption spectra of the free acids and dimethyl esters of biliverdin IX in methanol showed a broad band at about 650 nm and a sharp band at about 375 nm. The long-wave-length band was extremely sensitive {{to the presence of}} strong acid. A 10 -fold molar excess of HCl caused a 35 - to 50 -nm shift of the absorption maximum to longer wavelengths and near doubling of the maximum absorption. The molar absorption coefficients of biliverdins were identical for each free acid and dimethyl ester pair. In each case, Beer's law was followed in both methanol and acidified methanol. Methanol also proved to be a suitable solvent for spectroscopic determination of the non-alpha isomers of bilirubin IX.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Because {{meconium}} accumulates continuously in {{the fetal}} intestine, {{analysis of the}} postnatally excreted material could yield important information of intrauterine metabolism and maturation. Therefore, {{a study of the}} bilirubin pigments in meconium and in the first neonatal stools was carried out. METHODS: Meconium and stools from 37 neonates of various gestational ages were collected carefully, and stored at - 20 degrees C, protected by aluminium foil. Samples were defrosted, vortex mixed with an equal amount of dimethyl sulfoxide, centrifuged, and submitted to analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography using newly developed methods to identify and to quantitate the bilirubin-IXalpha, -IXbeta, -IXgamma, and -IXdelta isomers. In addition, samples were also submitted to diazo coupling with <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate.</b> Total coproporphyrins and zinc coproporphyrin were assayed for comparison. RESULTS: Unconjugated bilirubin-IXalpha and -IXbeta were detected in meconium but not the -IXgamma or the -IXbeta isomer. Bilirubin-IXbeta was the predominant pigment and comprised 63 % to 96 % of the unconjugated bilirubins in the first sample of meconium excreted. Its amount decreased rapidly during the first 5 days in full-term newborns, but this occurred more slowly in preterm neonates, especially in those with a gestational age less than 30 weeks. The decrease of bilirubin-IXbeta over time correlated with that of coproporphyrin. CONCLUSIONS: Bilirubin-IXbeta is the prevailing bile pigment in the first excreted sample of meconium. It gradually decreases after birth and can be considered a biochemical marker of meconium, like zinc coproporphyrin. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an extremely rapid and efficient reverse-phase h. p. l. c. method for the measurement of bilirubin and its conjugates in human bile and in model bile systems. Our method {{involves the use of}} a Perkin-Elmer 3 mu C 18 column and a methanol/sodium acetate/aq. ammonium acetate buffer system. Three isomers of bilirubin diglucuronide (BDG), two isomers of bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG), three isomers of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and minor conjugates containing glucose and xylose were separated in 12 min. Initial quantification of BDG and BMG was based {{on the use of the}} <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> azo derivative of bilirubin (AZO UCB); however, the standard curves for BDG, BMG and UCB were similar enough to permit quantification to be later based on the UCB standard curve only, thereby simplifying the quantification process. Routine direct injection of 6 or 10 microliter of crude undiluted or diluted (1 : 1) bile sample was sufficient for analysis. The method was helpful in diagnosing biliary-tract obstruction in a newborn and a partial deficiency state of bilirubin conjugation (Crigler-Najjar syndrome) in a 10 -year-old male. When the method was applied to biles of patients both with and without gallstones, levels of UCB were less than 2 % of total pigment, consistent with previous reports. Because of its speed and efficiency, this method has the potential for a broad range of applications including enzymic, kinetic and bile sample analyses...|$|E

Extraction and t. l. c. of the tetrapyrrolic pigments showed 13 major yellow diazo-positive bands. Four of them, accounting for 59 % of total diazo-positive material, were identified as unconjugated bilirubin-IXα, -IXβ, -IXγ and -IXδ. A fifth band (16 %) was characterized as a mixture of two isomeric monohydroxyl derivatives and another band (8 %) as a dihydroxyl derivative of bilirubin-IXα. 3. Although unconjugated bilirubin-IXα constitutes one-third of total diazo-positive material in bile of our strain of Gunn rats, the daily amount excreted represented only about 3 – 4 % of daily bilirubin production. 4.

40|$|Structures {{have been}} {{determined}} for bilirubin-IXα conjugates in freshly collected bile of normal rats, dogs and man and in post-obstructive bile {{of man and}} rats. The originally secreted conjugate has been characterized as azopigment (I), i. e. a 1 -O-acyl-β-d-glucopyranuronic acid glycoside. Conversion of the acetylated methyl ester of azopigment (I) into methyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl- 1 -bromo- 1 -deoxy-β-d-glucopyranuronate (V) indicates the pyranose ring structure for the carbohydrate and a C- 1 attachment for the bilirubin-IXα acyl group. Alternative procedures for deconjugation of azopigment (I) and its derivatives are also described. In post-obstructive bile, the 1 -O-acylglucuronide is converted into 2 -, 3 - and 4 -O-acylglucuronides via sequential intramolecular migrations of the bilirubin acyl group. The following approach was utilized. (1) The tetrapyrrole conjugates were cleaved to dipyrrolic aniline and <b>ethyl</b> <b>anthranilate</b> azopigments, and the azopigments were separated as the acids or methyl esters. (2) The isomeric methyl esters were characterized by mass spectral analysis of the acetates and silyl ethers. (3) The free glycosidic function was demonstrated by 1 -oxime and 1 -methoxime derivative formation. (4) The position of the dipyrrolic O-acyl group was determined for the methyl esters by protecting the free hydroxyl groups of the glucuronic acid moieties as the acetals formed with ethyl vinyl ether and by further conversion of the carbohydrates into partially methylated alditol acetates.
