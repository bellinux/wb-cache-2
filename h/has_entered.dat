5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one <b>has</b> <b>entered</b> a stable orbit.|$|E

5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem <b>has</b> <b>entered</b> the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|In King Arthur and King Cornwall, the Green Knight again {{features}} as Bredbeddle, and {{is depicted as}} one of Arthur's knights.

When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and strike off its master's head.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary <b>has</b> <b>entered</b> the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E

Jenner admits {{he is the only}} researcher that stayed behind, many of the others having left for their families or committed suicide. A drunk Shane approaches Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) about her callous attitude towards him with Rick's return and attempts to rape her, but backs off when she scratches his neck.|$|E
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein.
