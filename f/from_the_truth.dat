5|$|The {{explanation}} for the green and red colours {{that make up the}} background field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings are far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E
5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E

5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little could be further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in a society controlled by men.|$|E

With the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 to Saladin it was Western Europe that immediately posed a threat to the Empire. A new Crusade was declared by the recently elected Pope Gregory VIII.|$|E

25|$|At Hines Corners, {{there is}} a plaque commemorating the {{founding}} of the original Village of Hine's Corners by David and Merritt Hine. The plaque was placed there on August 9, 1925, by descendants of the Hine family. Interestingly, it states that the Hines founded the community in 1811, while historical sources (all of which were published before the erection of the plaque) put the founding date at either 1831 or 1840 instead. However, these sources also offer a possible solution: both note that the younger Hine came from Connecticut (or Massachusetts) in 1811 (or 1810), and say that he came first to the nearby Village of Ararat in Ararat Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. It is possible that family lore may have diverged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in the intervening century between Hine's Corners' founding and the plaque's erection.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} among the general public that most Jews went to their deaths passively. Nothing could be further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Jewish resistance to the Nazis comprised not only their armed struggle but also spiritual and cultural opposition which gave the Jews dignity despite the inhumane conditions {{of life in the}} ghettos. Many forms of resistance were present, even though the elders were terrified by the prospect of mass retaliation against the women and children in the case of anti-Nazi revolt. As the German authorities undertook to liquidate the ghettos, armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. The uprisings erupted in 5 major cities, 45 provincial towns, 5 major concentration and extermination camps, as well as in at least 18 forced labor camps. Notably, the only rebellions in Nazi camps were Jewish.|$|E

25|$|Now {{what is an}} atom? Conventionally an atom {{is either}} a {{constant}} (0 or 1) or a variable x'i where 0 ≤ i < n. For the proof technique here it is convenient to define atoms instead to be n-ary operations n'f'i, which although treated here as atoms nevertheless mean the same as ordinary terms of the exact form n'f'i(x0,...,x'n-1) (exact in that the variables must listed in the order shown without repetition or omission). This is not a restriction because atoms of this form include all the ordinary atoms, namely the constants 0 and 1, which arise here as the n-ary operations n'f0 and n'f−1 for each n (abbreviating 22n−1 to −1), and the variables x0,...,x'n-1 {{as can be seen}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> tables where x0 appears as both the unary operation 1f2 and the binary operation 2f10 while x1 appears as 2f12.|$|E
