We are led to look to a beginning in which the particles of matter were in a diffuse chaotic state, but endowed with the power of gravitation; and we are led to look to an end in which the whole Universe will be one equally heated inert mass, and from which everything like life, or motion, or beauty, will have utterly gone away." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of an elastic circular wedge on a ¯exible foundation embedded into a half-space is investigated {{in the frequency}} domain for incident pane SH-waves. The problem is solved by expansion of the motion in all three media (wedge, foundation and half-space) in cylindrical wave functions (Fourier-Bessel series). The structural model is simple, but accounts for both <b>differential</b> <b>motions</b> of the base and {{for the effects of}} soil-structure interaction. Usually, structural models in earthquake engineering consider either <b>differential</b> ground <b>motion,</b> but ignore soil-structure interaction, or consider soil-structure interaction, but for a rigid foundation, thus ignoring <b>differential</b> ground <b>motion.</b> The purpose of the study is to ®nd how stiff the foundation should be relative to the soil so that the rigid foundation assumption in soil-structure interaction models is valid. The shortest wavelength of the incident waves considered in this study is one equal to the width of the base of the wedge. It is concluded that, for this model, a foundation with same mass density as the soil but 50 times larger shear modulus behaves as `rigid'. For ratio of shear moduli less than 16, the rigid foundation assumption is not valid. Considering <b>differential</b> <b>motions</b> is important because of additional stresses in structures that are not predicted by ®xed-base and rigid foundation models. q 2001 Elsevie...|$|R

50|$|The DPS employs two linear {{actuators}} and a central pivoting armature {{that holds the}} iris. The two parallel {{linear actuators}} have coordinated motion {{in such a way}} as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The linear actuators consist of a moving coil and fixed magnetic yoke assembly, very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive. By incorporating miniature, high-resolution optical encoders, the entire scanner mechanism control system becomes digital.|$|E
5000|$|The {{controls}} {{of a conventional}} 2-line/"U-Control" [...] system consist of lead-out cables, a bellcrank, push rods and control horns. These are connected so that <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> of the lines rotates the bellcrank, causing a pushrod to move either forward or aft. The pushrod {{is connected to the}} control surface with a control horn that moves the elevator (and flaps, if used) up and down. The pilot holds a handle to which the lines are attached. Tilting the handle with the fingers, wrist, and/or elbow motion causes the differential movement in the lines. By convention, tilting the hand so the top is closer to the pilot than the bottom results in [...] "up" [...] elevator, much like pulling back on a full-scale airplane control stick. Also by convention, most airplanes are flown nominally counter-clockwise as viewed from above, with the leadout cables exiting the left wing. This is not universal and some pilots fly in the opposite direction. Flying clockwise has a slight advantage in some situations because most engines run so that the torque will roll the airplane away from the pilot, increasing line tension in upright level flight.|$|E
50|$|The viscous type is {{generally}} simpler because {{it relies on}} hydrodynamic friction from fluids with high viscosity. Silicone-based oils are often used. Here, a cylindrical chamber of fluid filled {{with a stack of}} perforated discs rotates with the normal motion of the output shafts. The inside surface of the chamber is coupled to one of the driveshafts, and the outside coupled to the differential carrier. Half of the discs are connected to the inner, the other half to the outer, alternating inner/outer in the stack. <b>Differential</b> <b>motion</b> forces the interleaved discs to move through the fluid against each other. In some viscous couplings when speed is maintained the fluid will accumulate heat due to friction. This heat will cause the fluid to expand, and expand the coupler causing the discs to be pulled together resulting in a non-viscous plate to plate friction and a dramatic drop in speed difference. This is known as the hump phenomenon and it allows the side of the coupler to gently lock. In contrast to the mechanical type, the limiting action is much softer and more proportional to the slip, and so is easier to cope with for the average driver. New Process Gear used a viscous coupling of the Ferguson style in several of their transfer cases including those used in the AMC Eagle.|$|E

40|$|Purpose—To {{report a}} tissue feature-based image {{registration}} strategy with explicit {{inclusion of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>motions</b> of thoracic structures. Methods and Materials—The proposed technique started with auto-identification {{of a number of}} corresponding points with distinct tissue features. The tissue feature points were found by using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) method. The control point pairs were then sorted into different “colors ” according to the organs they reside and used to model the involved organs individually. A thin-plate spline (TPS) method was used to register a structure characterized by the control points with a given “color”. The proposed technique was applied to study a digital phantom case, three lung and three liver cancer patients. Results—For the phantom case, a comparison with the conventional TPS method showed that the registration accuracy was markedly improved when the <b>differential</b> <b>motions</b> of the lung and chest wall were taken into account. On average, the registration error and the standard deviation (SD) of the 15 points against the known ground truth are reduced from 3. 0 mm to 0. 5 mm and from 1. 5 mm to 0. 2 mm, respectively, when the new method was used. Similar level of improvement was achieved for the clinical cases. Conclusions—The segmented deformable approach provides a natural and logical solution to model the discontinuous organ motions and greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of deformable registration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDifferential {{motions of}} ground {{supports}} of stiff structures with large plan dimensions and separate foundations under earthquakes were studied by researchers {{during the last}} few decades. Such a type of structural response was previously underestimated. The importance of studying such a response comes up from the fact that usually the structures affected are of strategic importance such as bridges. During their expected life, structures may experience vibrations excited by ground waves of short wavelengths during near-source earthquakes, or during amplified earthquake signals, during explosions, or during vibrations induced from nearby strong vibration sources. This is the case when the <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> of supports becomes considerable. This paper aims to review the effects of seismic signal variations along the structures dimensions with emphasis on Egypt as a case study. The paper shows some patterns of the damage imposed by such <b>differential</b> <b>motion.</b> A replication of the <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> in the longitudinal direction is applied on a frame bridge model. The resulting straining actions show the necessity for considering the <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> of supports in the design of special structures in Egypt.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{consolidation}} (UC) is {{a process}} whereby metal foils can be metallurgically bonded at or near room temperature. The UC process works by inducing high-speed <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> (~ 20 kHz) between a newly deposited layer and a substrate (which consists of a base plate and any previously deposited layers of material). This <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> causes plastic deformation at the interface, which breaks up surface oxides and deforms surface asperities, bringing clean metal surfaces into intimate contact, where bonding occurs. If the substrate is not stiff enough to resist deflection during ultrasonic excitation of newly deposited layers, then it deflects along with the newly deposited layer, resulting in no <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> and lack of bonding. Geometric issues which control substrate stiffness and deflection were investigated at Utah State University by building a number of free-standing rib structures with varying dimensions and orientations. Each structure was built to a height where lack of bonding between the previously deposited layers and the newly deposited layer caused the building process to fail, a height to width ratio (H/W) of approximately 1 : 1. The parts were then cut, polished, and viewed under a microscope. An ANSYS model was created to investigate analytically {{the cause of this}} failure. It appears build failure is due to excessive deflection of the ribs around a 1 : 1 H/W, resulting in insufficient <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> and deformation to achieve bonding. Preliminary results show, when the H/W reaches 1 : 1, the von Mises stress is found to be tensile along portions of the bonding interface, which eliminates the compressive frictional forces necessary for plastic deformation and formation of a metallurgical bond. These tensile stresses are shown to be concentrated at regions near the edges of the newly deposited foil layer. 1...|$|E
40|$|Macroseismic {{observations}} during various {{historical and}} recent earthquakes consistently show {{an increase of}} damage on narrow stripes located along strong lateral discontinuities, i. e., along contacts between two materials with very different rigidities. This paper presents a series of numerical investiga-tions into this issue. The model consists of a semi-infinite planar, soft layer embedded in a stiffer bedrock, and impinged upon by vertically incident plane SH waves. Computations {{are based on a}} finite-difference scheme including anelastic attenuation. Two basic phenomena are observed on such simple lateral discontinuities: the well-known 1 D (vertical) resonance, and an efficient wave diffraction from the discontinuity towards the softer side. They induce frequency-dependent amplification and a significant <b>differential</b> <b>motion.</b> A pa-rameter study considering various impedance contrast and damping values shows that the amplification is primarily controlled by the impedance contrast, and to a lesser degree by sediment damping. The amplitude exhibits a slight maximum near the discontinuity, but always remains comparable (within 30 %) to the 1 D value. <b>Differential</b> <b>motion</b> is also controlled by the impedance contrast. It always exhibits a sharp peak in the immediate vicinity of the discontinuity, the level of which does not depend on sediment damping, and reaches significant values even for moderate incident motion. It is concluded that reported observations of increased damage near such geological struc-tures are very likely connected with effects of <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> on structures...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} task in vision is to detect objects moving within a stationary scene. During normal viewing this {{is complicated by}} the presence of eye movements that continually scan the image across the retina, even during fixation. To detect moving objects, the brain must distinguish local motion within the scene from the global retinal image drift due to fixational eye movements. We have found that this process begins in the retina: a subset of retinal ganglion cells responds to motion in the receptive field centre, but only if the wider surround moves with a different trajectory. This selectivity for <b>differential</b> <b>motion</b> is independent of direction, and can be explained by a model of retinal circuitry that invokes pooling over nonlinear interneurons.
