50|$|<b>Flat-sawing</b> {{produces}} the least wood waste and fastest sawing, but produces boards {{which are more}} susceptible to cupping and shrinkage, and which have a distinctive grain which may be aesthetically undesirable for some uses. Quarter sawing produces smaller boards than flat sawing, but has a straighter grain, which in addition to being visually pleasing, makes the lumber more stable.|$|R
50|$|In <b>flat-sawing</b> the log {{is passed}} through the blade cutting off plank after plank without {{changing}} {{the orientation of the}} blade or log. The resulting planks have different annual ring orientations when viewed from the end. The relative angle that form the rings and the surface go from almost zero degrees in the external planks to almost ninety degrees {{at the core of the}} log.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the grain, quartersawn wood (particularly oak) will also often display a pattern of medullary rays, seen as subtle wavy ribbon-like patterns across the straight grain. Medullary rays grow in a radial fashion in the living tree, so while <b>flat-sawing</b> would cut across the rays, quarter-sawing puts them {{on the face of}} the board. This ray pattern has made quartersawn wood especially desirable for furniture and decorative panelling.|$|R
50|$|Red oak {{wood grain}} is so open that smoke can be blown through it from end-grain to end-grain on a <b>flat-sawn</b> board. For this reason, it {{is subject to}} {{moisture}} infiltration and is unsuitable for outdoor uses such as boatbuilding or exterior trim.|$|E
50|$|When {{boards are}} {{cut from a}} log they are usually rip cut along the length (axis) of the log. This {{can be done in}} three ways: plain-sawing (most common, also known as <b>flat-sawn,</b> bastard-sawn, through and through, and tangent-sawn), quarter-sawing (less common), or rift sawing (rare).|$|E
50|$|The lamella is {{the face}} layer of the wood that is visible when installed. Typically, it is a sawn piece of timber. The timber can be cut in three {{different}} styles: <b>flat-sawn,</b> quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. Keep in mind that each cut will give the board a different final appearance.|$|E
50|$|Flat-grain clapboards are cut {{tangent to}} the annual growth rings of the tree. As this {{technique}} was common {{in most parts of}} the British Isles, it was carried by immigrants to their colonies in the Americas and in Australia and New Zealand. <b>Flat-sawn</b> wood cups more and does not hold paint as well as radially sawn wood.|$|E
50|$|Solid wood {{flooring}} is milled {{from a single}} piece of timber that is kiln or air dried before sawing. Depending on the desired look of the floor, the timber can be cut in three ways: <b>flat-sawn,</b> quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. The timber is cut to the desired dimensions and either packed unfinished for a site-finished installation or finished at the factory. The moisture content at time of manufacturing is carefully controlled to ensure the product does not warp during transport and storage.|$|E
5000|$|Quilt or quilted maple {{refers to}} a type of [...] "figure" [...] in maple wood. It is seen on the {{tangential}} plane (<b>flat-sawn)</b> and looks like a wavy [...] "quilted" [...] pattern, often similar to ripples on water. The quilted figure is only found in the Western Big Leaf species of maple. It is a distortion of the grain pattern itself. Prized for its beauty, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of musical instruments, especially guitars. Quilted maple is an end grain figure that shows a circular pattern on flat sawn material. There are many terms that describe the shape and pattern of quilted maple, such as watered, popcorn, tubular, sausage, bubble wrap, and angle step.|$|E
40|$|Earlywood, {{formed at}} the {{beginning}} of the growth period each year in temperate regions, has tracheids that are thinner-walled and larger in diameter than those laid down later in the season, the latewood. As a consequence, the permeability to moisture movement differs, particularly as some of the pits in the latewood tracheids may close or aspirate. Boards sawn from a log will have the orientation of the growth rings (representing seasonal accumulation of woody material) at various angles to the long dimension of the boards. The extreme cases, known as <b>flat-sawn</b> and quarter-sawn, respectively, represent the situations where the growth rings lie parallel to the long dimension or at right angles to it. Tests were undertaken on the drying behaviour of both <b>flat-sawn</b> and quarter- sawn, 50 mm-thick sapwood boards of Pinus radiata dried under so-called high-temperature conditions, 120 / 70 °C, with an air velocity over the boards of 5 m s- 1 in a single-board drying tunnel. Moisture-content profiles were determined by slicing samples after various stages of drying. In the wet core, the moisture distribution was uniform with quarter-board boards, but showed "peakiness" corresponding to the latewood zones in <b>flat-sawn</b> boards. With either orientation, there is a thin dry layer below fibre saturation at the surface, which in the case of <b>flat-sawn</b> boards is one growth-ring-wide. Quarter-sawn boards dry more slowly than <b>flat-sawn</b> boards due to different drying mechanisms, and these differences in drying behaviour is also reflected in differences in strain development as the wood tries to shrink in conformity with the local moisture conten...|$|E

It should be noted, however, that the PCR model was useful within the limited conditions of this study in which the samples were cut from the <b>flat-sawn</b> lumbers and did not cover the entire range of wood properties, for example, no sample with ARO over 65 º was included in the PCR model. Therefore, samples from quarter-sawn as well as <b>flat-sawn</b> lumbers should be examined to confirm that the findings obtained from the PCR analysis can be generalized to the entire range of wood properties.|$|E

The objectives {{of this study}} were to determine acoustical parameters e. g. logarithmic decrement, sound absorption, sound velocity as well as density and wood stiffness; and to evaluate the potential of those species for acoustical purposes. Sonokeling (Dalbergia latifolia), Mahoni (Swietenia mahagony), Acacia (Acacia mangium) and Manii wood (Maesopsis eminii) were selected in this research. Three different cutting plane patterns of sawn timber (quarter-sawn, <b>flat-sawn,</b> and plain-sawn) were converted into small specimens. The methods for determining acoustical properties were longitudinal vibration testing and time of flight of ultrasonic wave method. The result showed no significant difference (α= 0. 05) of acoustical properties in logarithmic decrement, sound absorption, and ultrasonic velocity means on quarter-sawn, <b>flat-sawn,</b> and plain-sawn for all wood species tested.

30|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the dielectric anisotropy caused by wood structure at a representative MMW frequency of 100  GHz. For this purpose, the dielectric parameters were obtained for <b>flat-sawn</b> specimens of softwood and ring- and diffuse-porous hardwood species of different thicknesses at 0 and 11  % moisture content (MC), and the relation between the parameters and wood density was examined using a dielectric mixture model in consideration of the dielectric isotropy/anisotropy of wood substance and the formulation of the pore alignment.|$|E

30|$|To {{evaluate}} the dielectric anisotropy caused by wood structure at a millimeter wave frequency of 100  GHz, the dielectric parameters for <b>flat-sawn</b> specimens of nine wood species at 0 and 11  % moisture content (MC) were measured using a free space method devised {{for reducing the}} multiple reflections under an electric field of millimeter waves parallel to longitudinal and tangential directions of wood, and those in radial direction were estimated using a conventional approximation theory. The dielectric parameters in the tangential and radial directions were almost identical and constantly smaller {{than those in the}} longitudinal direction. All the dielectric parameters increased with wood density and were larger at 11 than 0  % MC. The dielectric parameters in the longitudinal and transverse directions and the dielectric anisotropy between them were well fitted to the regression lines based on a dielectric mixture model composed of pores and dielectric isotropic wood substance, and a parallel capacitor and Lichtenecker’s exponential formulas were employed to represent the dielectric parameters of the mixture in the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively. It was concluded that the dielectric anisotropy at 100  GHz is caused by the pore alignment and that the dielectric parameters are almost unaffected by anatomical structures, such as the rays. It was also confirmed that the free space method was effective for the measurement of the dielectric parameters for the <b>flat-sawn</b> specimens.|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to clarify the effect of pore conformation on the dielectric anisotropy of wood. The relative permittivity along the longitudinal and tangential axes of oven-dry <b>flat-sawn</b> specimens prepared from 12 different wood species was measured at a frequency of 0.15  THz using a transmission measurement system for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Additionally, the relative permittivity was calculated by solving the eigenvalue problems for wood specimens by regarding them as 2 D photonic crystals. Ultimately, the dielectric anisotropy of wood {{was obtained from the}} measured and calculated relative permittivities. The relations of two kinds of anisotropy to wood density were compared and analyzed based on the pore arrangement observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).|$|E

These findings can be quantitatively explained by using propagation theory and the dielectric properties of wood.|$|E

30|$|To {{clarify the}} effect of pore {{conformation}} on the dielectric anisotropy of wood, the relative permittivity along the longitudinal and tangential axes of <b>flat-sawn</b> oven-dry specimens of 12 different wood species was measured using terahertz time-domain transmission spectroscopy and compared with the values calculated using the eigenvalue problem for two-dimensional photonic crystals. The measured dielectric anisotropy, which is {{the ratio of the}} relative permittivity along longitudinal axis to that along the tangential axis, was well explained by the calculated value. It was concluded that the ratio of tangential to radial widths of wood pores affects the relative permittivity along the tangential axis, and that the dielectric anisotropy decreased with an increase in the ratio. This discussion can also be applied to the relative permittivity in frequencies below 0.15  THz. These findings show promise as a new method for evaluating the porous structure of wood.|$|E
30|$|To {{examine the}} {{applicability}} of an effective medium theory to the evaluation of wood density in the terahertz frequency range, the complex permittivity along the longitudinal axis of <b>flat-sawn</b> oven-dry specimens of 11 wood species was measured in a frequency range of 0.15 – 1.2  THz using a transmission measurement system for THz-TDS. The effective medium theory explained the density dependence of relative permittivity for the entire frequency range, but did not explain that of the dielectric loss for a higher frequency range. This indicates that the terahertz waves are more scattered at higher frequencies. It was concluded from the dielectric loss spectrum of wood substance that a frequency of approximately 0.23  THz is preferable for the NDE, since a high gain of the detected signals was obtained. A quantitative evaluation {{of the effect of}} the scattering on the dielectric loss should be examined in the future.|$|E
30|$|The {{use of an}} {{effective}} medium theory is important when accurately measuring wood density using millimeter and terahertz wave techniques. To confirm the applicability of this theory to the evaluation of wood density, the relative permittivity and dielectric loss of oven-dry <b>flat-sawn</b> specimens of 11 different wood species were measured in a frequency range of 0.15 – 1.2  THz using a transmission measurement system for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. A mixture model based on the effective medium theory well explained the density dependence of relative permittivity over the entire frequency range, while it did not fully explain that of dielectric loss, especially for higher frequencies. This indicates that wood scatters the terahertz wave with a wavelength close to the transverse sectional dimensions of the pores in wood {{in the same way}} as Mie scattering. It was found from the dielectric loss spectrum of wood substance that the frequency around 0.23  THz was preferable for the nondestructive evaluation of wood.|$|E
30|$|In {{our other}} paper, which was {{submitted}} to the Journal of Wood Science and is currently under review, the effect of pores on wood dielectric anisotropy was examined {{with the assumption that}} the effective medium theory is applicable to the relative permittivity of oven-dry wood obtained by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) at 0.15  THz. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the applicability of the effective medium theory to the density evaluation of wood over a frequency range of 0.15 – 1.2  THz. The complex permittivity along the longitudinal axis of <b>flat-sawn</b> oven-dry specimens of 11 different wood species was measured using a THz-TDS transmission measurement system. The fitness of a mixture model based on the effective medium theory to the measured relative permittivity and dielectric loss was examined, and the relationships of the averages and standard deviations of the dielectric parameters of wood substance to the frequency were also examined.|$|E
40|$|Compression rolling {{improved}} the permeability of Nothofagus fusca (Hook f.) Oerst (red beech) and increased its preservative uptake {{by up to}} a factor of six (compared to unrolled controls), without having a substantial effect on the drying rate. Hot-water soaking improved drying, particularly in the radial direction, but {{had little effect on}} the permeability. A combination of both treat-ments conferred no additional benefits over those found for the two individual treatments. Microscopic observation revealed the probable causes of these results. After compression rolling, the vessel structure (especially tyloses, perforation plates, and vessel to vessel pits) frequently showed deformation, rupture, collapse, and other signs of damage. Thus pathways within the vascular system were reopened for fluid flow. On the other hand, hot-water soaking did not affect the vessel structure substantially, but there was a relocation and partial removal of the extractives encrusting the ray parenchyma cell walls and pit membranes, with a resultant increase in drying rate, which for <b>flat-sawn</b> boards was twice that of unsoaked controls...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} test roofs clad with radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) {{shingles}} {{that had been}} pressure-treated with various water-borne preservative formula-tions were installed at a Forest Research Institute test site in Rotorua in 1977. A further series of test roofs installed in 1978 included radiata pine shingles pressure-treated with a commercial light organic solvent preservative. Evaluation of selected radiata pine shingle test roofs in early 1984 showed that, although preservative leaching had occurred from shingles treated with an alkyl ammonium compound, a copper-chrome-arsenic preservative, and a light organic solvent preservative, the shingles appeared sound when examined microscopically. Slight lichen growth was evident on some shingles. In contrast, untreated radiata pine shingles displayed marked fungal infection, early stages of decay, and plentiful mould and lichen growth. Untreated western red cedar (Thuja plicata D. Don) shingles, which were used as a reference point from which to judge radiata pine shingles, showed lichen and mould growth after 7 years' exposure. Checking and cupping of western red cedar shingles were attributable {{in part to the}} inclusion of some <b>flat-sawn</b> material...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{temperature}} evolution through {{tension wood}} and normal wood in poplar (Populus nigra) under a convective drying condition was investigated. <b>Flat-sawn</b> boards with green dimensions 80 � 40 � 25 mm were dried at constant dry-bulb temperature of 60 �C and relative humidity (RH) of 50 % {{to a final}} moisture content of about 8 %. They were coated on four surfaces using aluminum foil bonded with polyurethane (PU) glue to confine moisture movement along the board thickness. The measurement of board temperature was carried out at 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, 10 and 12. 5 mm along the board thickness every 20 minutes by means of 1 mm-thermocouples. The pattern of temperature profile was observed to be almost similar for both tension wood and normal wood. However, a slightly steeper temperature gradient occurred in the normal wood compared to the tension wood. In both types of woods, the surface temperature rose progressively from the initial value to the dry-bulb temperature but the core temperature remained at an almost constant value as the wet-bulb temperature even {{at the end of}} drying...|$|E
30|$|A {{digital image}} {{correlation}} (DIC) method {{was applied to}} measure strain which arose and remained beneath the finished surface in slow-speed orthogonal cutting of hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa), to evaluate the damage in the subsurface cell layers. While the quarter-sawn surface was cut parallel to the grain, the side surface, <b>flat-sawn</b> surface, was captured by a high-speed camera. The images were analyzed to calculate strain in a region of 0.67  ×  0.22  mm allocated beneath the finished surface. Almost no strain normal to the cutting direction was detected for the depth of cut and cutting angles, 0.05  mm and smaller than 60 °, respectively. For the depths of cut and cutting angles, larger than 0.1  mm and smaller than 60 °, respectively, the fore-split induced tensile strain normal to the cutting direction, although it hardly remained after the cutting. The compression strain normal to the cutting direction clearly remained for the cutting angles larger than 70 °, regardless of the depths of cut employed in this study. The subsurface damage assumed from the residual strain distribution corresponded to {{the appearance of the}} subsurface layer in the X-ray computed tomography (CT) images. It was also revealed, and the DIC program could not always measure excessively large strain correctly.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of Acacia melanoxylon R. Br. (Australian blackwood) boards 25 mm and 50 mm thick was assessed {{in terms of}} drying time, shrinkage, collapse, and degrade from warping and cheeking after either air drying, dehumidification drying, conventional kiln drying, or high temperature kiln drying. Even kiln drying at a dry bulb temperature of 70 °C, wet bulb 60 °C, did not cause undue surface checking. The major problem encountered was the extreme variability of drying rate; quarter-sawn heartwood took twice as long to dry as <b>flat-sawn</b> heartwood. Accelerated drying methods increased this difference {{and for this reason}} it is recommended that all material, particularly 50 mm and thicker, be air dried to about 30 % moisture content before kiln drying. Air drying of 25 -mm boards can be achieved in 12 - 20 weeks in Rotorua with final kiln drying taking 4 - 5 days. Blackwood is a medium density hardwood which has a low shrinkage with only a slight tendency to collapse when dried at elevated temperatures. Prelimin-ary air drying will minimise collapse, making final reconditioning unnecessary. Spring and twist were a problem in the material studied but this could largely be attributed to poor tree form. Warp should be low to minimal in material from silvicultural ^ tended trees...|$|E
40|$|The {{permeability}} of softwoods can {{be enhanced}} by selective bacterial attack of the pit membranes. In this paper, green <b>flat-sawn</b> Pinus radiata sapwood boards were sprinkled for various exposure times with a nutrient solution containing a mixed bacterial population. The timber samples were subsequently dried and the tangential absorption of water was measured using neutron radiography to track the movement of moisture within the wood. There was {{a significant increase in}} water absorption after only two days of bacterial exposure, and the quantity of water absorption nearly doubled after a fortnight of bacterial exposure. These measurements showed that dried timber that has had a greater extent of bacterial exposure in the green condition has more void space available to store and conduct water. Scanning electron micrographs showed that bacteria had colonised the pits near the surface of the wood after only two days bacterial exposure. There was also clear evidence of damage to the margo-fibrils and tori of the pit membranes, which was attributed to enzymatic degradation by the bacteria. This study confirms the conclusions drawn by other investigators that bacteria degrade the pits in the green sapwood, so that many of the pathways for moisture flow remain unblocked once the wood is drie...|$|E
