Ebsary was selected in every match in her first three seasons, but in that time, scored only 136 runs at a batting average of 8.50 and took 13 wickets from 24 matches. The following year, Ebsary raised her career average above 10 for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> was selected in the Australian Under-23 team.
