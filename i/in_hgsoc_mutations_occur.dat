40|$|The {{degree of}} {{differentiation}} in human cancers generally reflects the degree of malignancy, with the most undifferentiated cancer being also the highest grade and the most aggressive. High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC) are poorly differentiated and fast-growing malignancies. The molecular mechanisms underlying the poor differentiation of HGSOC has not been completely characterized. Evidence suggests that miRNA, miR are dysregulated <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC.</b> Therefore, we focused on those miRNAs {{that are relevant to}} tumor differentiation. Expression profiling of miRNAs <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC,</b> indicated miR- 106 a and its family members were significantly upregulated. Upregulation of miR- 106 a was further validated by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and miRNA in situ hybridization in a large cohort of HGSOC specimens. Overexpression of miR- 106 a in benign and malignant ovarian cells significantly increased the cellular proliferation rate and expanded the side-population fraction. In particular, SKOV 3 cells with miR- 106 a overexpression had significantly higher tumor initial/stem cell population (CD 24 - and CD 133 -positive cells) than control SKOV 3 cells. Among many miR- 106 a predicated target genes, p 130 (RBL 2), an retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor family member, was not only confirmed as a specific target of miR- 106 a but also related to tumor growth and differentiation. The importance of mir- 106 a and RBL 2 was further demonstrated in vivo, in which, SKOV 3 cells overexpressing miR- 106 a formed poorly differentiated carcinomas and had reduced RBL 2 levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study of miR- 106 a mediating proliferation and tumor differentiation <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC.</b> Implications:The current study suggests that the RB tumor suppressor pathway is a critical regulator of growth and differentiation <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC.</b> Mol Cancer Res; 11 (11); 1314 – 25. 2013 AACR...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Nua kinase 1 (NUAK 1) was {{identified}} in multigene signatures of survival and suboptimal debulking in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). This study investigates the individual clinical and biologic contributions of NUAK 1 <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC</b> patients and cell lines. Methods: Public transcript expression, clinical, and outcome data {{were used to}} interrogate the relationship between NUAK 1 and clinicopathologic factors and patient outcomes including progression-free survival (PFS) and molecular subtypes using logistic and Cox modeling. Analysis of NUAK 1 transcript expression was performed in primary tumors from 34 HGSOC patients with < or ≥ 2 years PFS. The impact of silencing NUAK 1 by RNA interference on the migratory potential and chemosensitivity of SOC cells was assessed in vitro. Results: Elevated NUAK 1 transcript expression was associated with worse PFS (hazard ratio= 1. 134), advanced stage (odds ratio, OR= 1. 7), any residual disease (OR= 1. 58), and mesenchymal disease subtype (OR= 7. 79 ± 5. 89). Elevated NUAK 1 transcript expression was observed <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC</b> patients with < vs. ≥ 2 years PFS (p< 0. 045). RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated silencing of NUAK 1 expression attenuated migration of OV 90 and E 3 <b>HGSOC</b> cells <b>in</b> vitro, but did not modulate sensitivity to cisplatin or paclitaxel. Conclusions. Elevated NUAK 1 was associated with poor survival as well as advanced stage, residual disease after cytoreductive surgery and mesenchymal molecular subtype. NUAK 1 impacted migration, but not chemosensitivity in vitro.

40|$|Background: Altered {{metabolism}} is {{a well-established}} trait in many cancers, {{and is an}} emerging hallmark of cancer. Recent resurgence of cancer metabolism studies has identified dysregulated metabolic pathways that produce novel oncometabolites in various cancers. However, large scale studies of dysregualted high grade serous epithelial ovarian cancers (HGSOC) are unknown. Materials and Methods: Following IRB approval, metabolic profiling of 101 HGSOC patients and 15 normal ovaries were obtained using GC/LC mass spectrometry from 2 U. S. academic centers to identify highly up-regulated metabolites. Samples from a cohort of 135 and 208 patients from a single institution were evaluated for gene expression and protein expression of NAT 8 L, respectively. Gene expression of NAT 8 L and clinical outcomes were further investigated from publicly available databases from the cancer genomics atlas (TCGA) using www. cbioportal. org, and two previously published melanoma gene expression profiles. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and gene expression array were evaluated in HeyA 8 ovarian cancer cell lines to investigate the protein and gene expression changes associated with NAT 8 L siRNA. In vitro and in vivo v experiments of NAT 8 L siRNA were investigated to evaluate its effects on cancer proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and invasion/migration. Results: A total of 313 metabolites were identified between these two groups, of which 172 were significantly altered (p HeyA 8 and A 2780 cell lines showed that NAT 8 L siRNA significantly increased total apoptosis compared to control (NT) siRNA by 38. 53 % (p Genomic analysis of HEYA 8 cells transfected with NAT 8 L siRNA compared to NT siRNA showed 1961 significantly different gene expression data (p Conclusion: HGSOC metabolic profiling revealed highly altered metabolism compared to the normal ovary.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} whole exome sequencing data in germline DNA from 412 {{high grade}} serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project and identified 5, 517 genes harboring a predicted deleterious germline coding mutation {{in at least}} one HGSOC case. Gene-set enrichment analysis showed enrichment for genes involved in DNA repair (p = 1. 8 × 10 - 3). Twelve DNA repair genes - APEX 1, APLF, ATX, EME 1, FANCL, FANCM, MAD 2 L 2, PARP 2, PARP 3, POLN, RAD 54 L and SMUG 1 - were prioritized for targeted sequencing in up to 3, 107 HGSOC cases, 1, 491 cases of other epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) subtypes and 3, 368 unaffected controls of European origin. We estimated mutation prevalence for each gene and tested for associations with disease risk. Mutations were identified in both cases and controls in all genes except MAD 2 L 2, where we found no evidence of mutations in controls. In FANCM we observed a higher <b>mutation</b> frequency <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC</b> cases compared to controls (29 / 3, 107 cases, 0. 96 percent; 13 / 3, 368 controls, 0. 38 percent; P= 0. 008) with little evidence for association with other subtypes (6 / 1, 491, 0. 40 percent; P= 0. 82). The relative risk of HGSOC associated with deleterious FANCM mutations was estimated to be 2. 5 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 5. 0; P= 0. 006). In summary, whole exome sequencing of EOC cases with large-scale replication in case-control studies has identified FANCM as a likely novel susceptibility gene for <b>HGSOC,</b> with <b>mutations</b> associated with a moderate increase in risk. These data may have clinical implications for risk prediction and prevention approaches for high-grade serous ovarian cancer in the future and a significant impact on reducing disease mortality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{high-grade}} serous {{ovarian cancer}} (HGSOC), intrinsic and/or acquired resistance against platinum-containing chemotherapy {{is a major}} obstacle for successful treatment. A low frequency of somatic mutations but frequent epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC</b> tumors, presents the cancer epigenome as a relevant target for innovative therapy. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) supposedly are good preclinical models for identifying novel drug targets. However, the representativeness of global methylation status of HGSOC PDXs compared to their original tumors has not been evaluated so far. Aims {{of this study were}} to explore how representative HGSOC PDXs are of their corresponding patient tumor methylome and to evaluate the effect of epigenetic therapy and cisplatin on putative epigenetically regulated genes and their related pathways in PDXs. Methods Genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylome of HGSOC patients with their corresponding PDXs, from different generations, was performed using Infinium 450  K methylation arrays. Furthermore, we analyzed global methylome changes after treatment of HGSOC PDXs with the FDA approved demethylating agent decitabine and cisplatin. Findings were validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing with subsequent pathway analysis. Publicly available datasets comprising HGSOC patients were used to analyze the prognostic value of the identified genes. Results Only 0. 6 – 1. 0  % of all analyzed CpGs (388, 696 CpGs) changed significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) during propagation, showing that HGSOC PDXs were epigenetically stable. Treatment of F 3 PDXs with decitabine caused a significant reduction in methylation in 10. 6  % of CpG sites in comparison to untreated PDXs (p[*]<[*] 0. 01, false discovery rate < 10  %). Cisplatin treatment had a marginal effect on the PDX methylome. Pathway analysis of decitabine-treated PDX tumors revealed several putative epigenetically regulated pathways (e. g., the Src family kinase pathway). In particular, the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) gene was successfully validated for epigenetic regulation in different PDX models and ovarian cancer cell lines. Low CSK methylation and high CSK expression were both significantly associated (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) with improved progression-free survival and overall survival <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC</b> patients. Conclusions HGSOC PDXs resemble the global epigenome of patients over many generations and can be modulated by epigenetic drugs. Novel epigenetically regulated genes such as CSK and related pathways were identified <b>in</b> <b>HGSOC.</b> Our observations encourage future application of PDXs for cancer epigenome studies...|$|R
