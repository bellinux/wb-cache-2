In total, there were five drafts. The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly. Little Gidding was intended to conclude the Four Quartets series, summarising Eliot's views <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> series of poems.|$|E

25|$|The {{prophage}} is duplicated {{with every}} subsequent cell {{division of the}} host. The phage genes <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> dormant state code for proteins that repress expression of other phage genes (such as the structural and lysis genes) {{in order to prevent}} entry into the lytic cycle. These repressive proteins are broken down when the host cell is under stress, resulting in the expression of the repressed phage genes. Stress can be from starvation, poisons (like antibiotics), or other factors that can damage or destroy the host. In response to stress, the activated prophage is excised from the DNA of the host cell by one of the newly expressed gene products and enters its lytic pathway.|$|E

25|$|The {{equations}} used {{to model}} the option are often expressed as partial differential equations (see for example Black–Scholes equation). Once <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> form, a finite difference model can be derived, and the valuation obtained. A number of implementations of finite difference methods exist for option valuation, including: explicit finite difference, implicit finite difference and the Crank-Nicholson method. A trinomial tree option pricing model can {{be shown to be}} a simplified application of the explicit finite difference method. Although the finite difference approach is mathematically sophisticated, it is particularly useful where changes are assumed over time in model inputs– for example dividend yield, risk free rate, or volatility, or some combination of these– that are not tractable in closed form.|$|E
500|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is based on}} the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. [...] For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (as 252=21×12 and 105=21×5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and [...] 252−105=147. Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal. [...] When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers. [...] By reversing the steps, the GCD can be expressed as a sum of the two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or negative integer, e.g., 21 = 5 × 105 + (−2) × 252. The fact that the GCD can always be <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way is known as Bézout's identity.|$|E
500|$|Anekantavada is the {{principle}} of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects. Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone. Anekantavada describes {{the world as a}} multifaceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time, place, nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. What is true from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone, because absolute truth is the sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe. Because it is rooted in these doctrines, Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual, community, nation, or species. [...] It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples, and for other life-forms. [...] This perception leads to the doctrine of syadvada or sevenfold predication stating the truth from different viewpoints. Anekantvada is the doctrine and Syadvada is its expression. [...] According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism (ekanta) in philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|Plant viruses {{need to be}} {{transmitted}} by a vector, most often insects such as leafhoppers. One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen insect vector of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the insect vector feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the haemolymph and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and circulative. Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas circulative can not. Circulative viruses are protected inside aphids by the chaperone protein symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for transmission by insects. In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the coat protein and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the coat protein, and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E
