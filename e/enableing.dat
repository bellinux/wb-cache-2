This resulted in more advanced ICs and SoCs becoming publically available, eliminating the need for in-house ASICs, thus <b>enableing</b> smaller actors to enter the markets. This thesis explores the possibilities of developing a low power, hand-held device on a very limited budget and strict time scale. This thesis report also covers all the steps taken in the development procedure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Generating “intelligent ” {{behavior}} in multiagent systems {{is certainly a}} difficult task, especially under real-time requirements. Various agent architectures {{have been developed to}} provide methodologies for modeling and controlling such behavior. In prior publications we introduced the concepts of the double pass architecture that overcomes some typical drawbacks of classical approches 1. By further elaborating its ideas and implementation as well as by using it in a real application (robotic soccer) we now gained more knowledge about the architecture itsself and behavior modeling in multiagent systems in general. In this paper we will briefly describe the current state of work and some of the results from this year’s RoboCup. Our main objective is to introduce some conceptual extensions that are currently under investigation and that will hopefully <b>enableing</b> even more powerful planning capabilities. ...|$|E

The metrics summarise the predicted changes in floristic species under different nitrogen deposition scenarios.

The "Call" aimed at <b>enableing</b> the calculation of country-specific indicators for assessing changes in biodiversity driven by atmospheric deposition.

40|$|Land ice masses {{interact}} with the geosystem in manifold ways. The flow of ice is controlled by processes occurring at their surface, base and by the spatial variation of rheological properties within the ice. Numerical models are routinely employed to understand and reproduce the flow of ice and the interaction with other spheres. However, models substantially rely {{on a number of}} simplyfing assumptions. Despite - partly also because of - the increasing sophistication of models in-situ observations are necessary to reduce the number and fix values of free parameters controlling flow. The most direct way to obtain in-situ properties within the ice is drilling ice cores. However, this is a labour intensive expensive task, which only provides information for a single point, albeit in very high resolution. Active geophysical methods, in contrast, are employed from above the ice surface, thus <b>enableing</b> to cover larger areas in a comparably short amount of time. Laterally imaging the layer architecture of ice sheets yields complementary information to the direct evidence of physical properties otherwise solely provided by ice cores. This talk gives an overview {{of the state of the}} art applied geophysics in glaciology, with an emphasis on active seismic and electromagnetic sounding methods. It is shown how these methods provide insights into the distribution of physical properties, stratigraphy and structure. Moreover, they provide detailed insights into subglacial conditions, from which paleo conditions of ice interacting with the ocean and underlying strata can be retrieved...|$|E

A total of 280 males and females from various population groups were recruited for the study. Subjects were categorized into different subgroups depending on their gender, ethnicity, competitiveness in sport, sport type practised and previous knee problems. These subgroups enabled a more individual specific DIB measurement. A high frequency ultrasound examination ofboth knees ofall recruits were performed. The deep infrapatellar bursa was located by slightly flexing the knee and applying not to much pressure with the probe whilst scanning. Three measurements, antero-posterio (AP), cranio-caudal (CC) and width measurements, were recorded ofeach individuals left and right deep infrapatellar bursa (DIB). The results ofthe DIB measurements were compared to results from a ultrasound study perfonned in Gennany and a favourable comparison could be made. MRI studies of the DIB performed in Turkey and Switzerland differed greatly from those of this study and Germany. This study could serve as a valuable source ofreference to sonographer, radiologist and orthopaedic surgeons when investigating the deep infrapatellar bursa. A statistical significant difference was shown for males having a larger DIB than female, for competitive sports people having a larger Dill than non-competitive sports people and also inactive people; and rugby players (as a sport type) have larger DIBs than cricketers, runners, soccer players and cyclists. Another surprising factor was the amazing ultrasound detection rate of the deep infrapatellar bursa, which allows for future easy and confident assessing of the DIB by ultrasound...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Previous {{research}} on counterfactual thoughts about prevention suggests that {{people tend to}} focus on <b>enabling</b> rather than causing agents. However, research has also demonstrated that people have a preference for mutating controllable events. We explore whether counterfactual thinking about enablers is distinct from ‘undoing’ controllable events. We presented participants with scenarios in which a cause and an <b>enabler</b> contribute to a negative outcome. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups in which we systematically manipulated the controllability of the cause and the <b>enabler.</b> Participants generated counterfactuals which focused on the cause or the <b>enabler</b> and completed blame ratings for the cause and the <b>enabler.</b> The results indicate that participants had a preference for mutating the <b>enabling</b> relation, apart from in one condition where the cause was controllable and the <b>enabler</b> was uncontrollable. Participants tended to assign more blame to the cause than the <b>enabler,</b> regardless of controllability. The findings are discussed in the context of previous {{research on}} causal and counterfactual thinking. Ye...|$|R
