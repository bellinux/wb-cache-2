5000|$|For {{electronics}} work, special diagonal cutters {{that are}} ground flush {{to the apex}} of the cutting edge {{on one side of the}} jaws are often used. These flush-cutting pliers allow wires to be trimmed flush or nearly flush to a solder joint, avoiding the sharp tip left by symmetrical diagonal cutters. It is common for this type of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutter</b> to be referred to by another name, such as [...] "flush cutter" [...] to distinguish it from symmetrical cutters.|$|E
5000|$|Diagonal pliers (or wire <b>cutters</b> or <b>diagonal</b> {{cutting pliers}} or <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutters</b> or side cutting pliers) are pliers {{intended}} for the cutting of wire (they are generally not used to grab or turn anything). The plane defined by the cutting edges of the jaws intersects the joint rivet at an angle or [...] "on a diagonal", hence the name.|$|R

The EVA will occur as a planned excursion, to complete a mission objective, or on a contingency basis as support for the mission or to effect repairs to the Orbiter or its payload. Configurations for {{the placement of the}} airlock for EVA with and without Spacelab payloads are discussed, along with the various EVA tasks which could be expected as necessary for mission completion. Handholds have been placed in strategic positions on the RMS and along the payload doors, and a safety tether has been incorporated with line extension out to 25 ft. Off-the-shelf tools such as needlenose pliers, forceps, <b>diagonal</b> <b>cutters,</b> etc. are carried as standard {{equipment for the}} repair of malfunctioning equipment and doorlatches. Finally, attention is given to EVA lighting, communication, life-support, and work station restraint systems...|$|R
