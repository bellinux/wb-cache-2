2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of delirium tremens are nightmares, agitation, global confusion, disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, fever, high blood pressure, heavy sweating, and {{other signs of}} autonomic hyperactivity (fast heart rate and high blood pressure). These symptoms may appear suddenly, but typically develop {{two to three days}} after the stopping of heavy drinking, being worst on the fourth or fifth day. Also, these [...] "symptoms are characteristically worse at night". In general, DT is considered the most severe manifestation of alcohol withdrawal and occurs 3–10 days following the last drink. Other common symptoms include intense perceptual disturbance such as visions of insects, snakes, or rats. These may be hallucinations, or illusions related to the environment, e.g., patterns on the wallpaper or in the peripheral vision that the patient falsely perceives as a resemblance to the morphology of an insect, and are also associated with tactile hallucinations such as sensations of something crawling on the subject—a phenomenon known as <b>formication.</b> Delirium tremens usually includes extremely intense feelings of [...] "impending doom". Severe anxiety and feelings of imminent death are common DT symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Formication</b> is {{the medical}} {{term for a}} {{sensation}} that exactly resembles that of small insects crawling on (or under) the skin. It is one specific form {{of a set of}} sensations known as paresthesias, which also include the more common prickling, tingling sensation known as [...] "pins and needles". <b>Formication</b> is a well documented symptom, which has numerous possible causes. The word is derived from formica, the Latin word for ant.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} of {{ioflupane}} (123I) are headache, vertigo, increased appetite and <b>formication.</b> Less than 1% of patients experience pain at the injection site.|$|E

50|$|Cocaine has {{a similar}} {{potential}} to induce temporary psychosis {{with more than half}} of cocaine abusers reporting at least some psychotic symptoms at some point. Typical symptoms of sufferers include paranoid delusions that they are being followed and that their drug use is being watched, accompanied by hallucinations that support the delusional beliefs.

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} a linkage between {{dopamine}} and the urge to pick. Drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine that are dopamine agonist, which increase the pharmacological effects of dopamine, {{have been shown to}} cause uncontrollable picking in users. These drugs can create the sensation of <b>formication,</b> which feels like something is crawling on or under the skin. Additionally, drugs such as naltrexone have shown some benefit in reducing picking behavior. Thus, excoriation disorder could result from a dysfunction in the dopamine reward functions.|$|E
5000|$|Secondary organic {{delusional}} parasitosis {{occurs when}} {{the state of the}} patient is caused by a medical illness or substance (medical or recreational) use. In the DSM-IV this corresponds with [...] "psychotic disorder due to general medical condition". Physical illnesses that can underlie secondary organic delusional parasitosis include: hypothyroidism, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, neurological disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency, and diabetes mellitus. Any illness or medication for which <b>formication</b> is a symptom or side effect can become a trigger or underlying cause of delusional parasitosis.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{physiological}} {{factors which}} can cause <b>formication</b> and thus can sometimes lead to this condition include: menopause (i.e. hormone withdrawal); allergies, and drug abuse, including {{but not limited to}} cocaine and methamphetamine (as in amphetamine psychosis). It appears that many of these physiological factors, as well as environmental factors such as airborne irritants, are capable of inducing a [...] "crawling" [...] sensation in otherwise healthy individuals; however, some people become fixated on the sensation and its possible meaning, and this fixation may then develop into delusional parasitosis.|$|E
50|$|Gustatory, {{olfactory}} {{and thermal}} sensations in hypnagogia {{have all been}} reported, as well as tactile sensations (including those kinds classed as paresthesia or <b>formication).</b> Sometimes there is synesthesia; many people report seeing {{a flash of light}} or some other visual image in response to a real sound. Proprioceptive effects may be noticed, with numbness and changes in perceived body size and proportions, feelings of floating or bobbing, and out-of-body experiences. Perhaps the most common experience of this kind is the falling sensation, and associated hypnic jerk, encountered by many people, at least occasionally, while drifting off to sleep.|$|E

50|$|During the Tang period, Chinese alchemists {{divided into}} two schools of thought about elixir poisoning. The first {{altogether}} ignored the poison danger and considered the unpleasant symptoms after taking an elixir as signs of its efficacacy. The c. 6th century Taiqing shibi ji 太清石壁記 (Records of the Rock Chamber) described away the side effects and recommended methods of bringing relief. After taking an elixir, if your face and body itch as though insects were crawling over them, if your hands and feet swell dropsically, if you cannot stand the smell of food and bring it up after you have eaten it, if you feel as though {{you were going to}} be sick most of the time, if you experience weakness in the four limbs, if you have to go often to the latrine, or if your head or stomach violently ache—do not be alarmed or disturbed. All these effects are merely proofs that the elixir you are taking is successfully dispelling your latent disorders. (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 283) Many of these symptoms are characteristic of metallic poisoning: <b>formication,</b> edema, and weakness of the extremities, later leading to infected boils and ulcers, nausea, vomiting, gastric and abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headaches (Needham and Lu 1974: 283). For relieving the side-effects when the elixir takes effect, the Taiqing shibi ji recommends that one should take hot and cold baths, and drink a mixture of scallion, soy sauce, and wine. If that does not bring relief, then one should combine and boil a hornets' nest, spurge, Solomon's Seal, and Ephedra into a medicine and take one dose (Needham and Ho 1970: 331).|$|E

40|$|Pruritus and psyche are {{intricately}} and reciprocally related, with psychophysiological {{evidence and}} psychopathological explanations helping {{us to understand}} their complex association. Their interaction may be conceptualized and classified into 3 groups: pruritic diseases with psychiatric sequelae, pruritic diseases aggravated by psychosocial factors, and psychiatric disorders causing pruritus. Management of chronic pruritus is directed at treating the underlying causes and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to address the dermatologic, somatosensory, cognitive, and emotional aspects. Pharmcotherapeutic agents that are useful for chronic pruritus with comorbid depression and/or anxiety comprise selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and doxepin), and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin); the role of neurokinin receptor- 1 antagonists awaits verification.

40|$|Foxy is the colloquial {{name for}} the {{hallucinogen}} 5 -ethoxy-diisopropyltryptamine (5 -MeO-DIPT). A non-fatality involving a 23 -year-old Caucasian man who ingested a capsule containing 5 -MeO-DIPT is described. He presented to the Emergency Department, not with visual nor auditory hallucinations but with sensory hallucinations, that of <b>formication</b> and paranoia. He was observed and given supportive care for 4 h, then discharged without any known sequelae. Blood and urine were collected for laboratory analyses. Foxy and its metabolites were identified in urine by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The concentrations of 5 -MeO-DIPT in the serum and urine were 0. 14 and 1. 6 mg/mL, respectively.

40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{test the}} {{construct}} validity of the 11 items of the Kupperman index (KI), which has been pioneering in its attempt to quantify climacteric symptoms. Methods: Unidimensional confirmatory factor analysis of the 11 graded items (hot flashes, paresthesia, insomnia, nervousness, melancholia, vertigo, weakness, arthralgia or myalgia, headache, palpitations, and <b>formication),</b> using a four-point scale (0, none; 4, severe), was used to evaluate the KI in a sample consisting of 84 women with a mean (SD) age of 54. 34 (4. 00) years who have been in menopause for a mean (SD) of 4. 36 (2. 53) years. Results: the KI returned poor results on unidimensional model testing (root-mean-square error adjustment, 0. 109; 90 % CI, 0. 075 - 0. 142; comparative fit index, 0. 871; Tucker Lewis index, 0. 838; weighted root-mean-square residual, 0. 971; chi(2) (44) = 87. 599; P < 0. 001), indicating that the set of items does not properly evaluate the underlying phenomena (climacteric symptoms). Conclusions: Our study verifies the poor fit of the KI and provides psychometric evidence that KI items warrant revision and/or that the concept underlying climacteric symptoms should be revisited.

40|$|Women suffer methamphetamine (meth) {{addiction}} {{at a rate}} {{much higher}} than rates for addiction to other drugs. Female meth users are susceptible and predisposed to gender-related risks: high rates of unprotected vaginal and anal sex, sex-work, and sexual coercion. Precursors for addiction (e. g., abuse, body dysphasia) put females {{in a difficult position}} for recovery and highlight the need for gender-specific research and treatment. Methamphetamine (a synthetically derived stimulant) creates psychological and physical dependency that affects every neuron of the brain and damages the body immediately. Women ingest meth for initial effects that allay social pressures: feeling euphoric, connecting with others during ―parties,‖ losing weight, boosting energy, and feeling ―normal‖ despite tumultuous living conditions. Meth‘s aphrodisiac properties improve sexual relations, at least until addiction sets in, at which time relationships frequently become exploitive or abusive. Eventually, meth‘s positive effects turn negative, resulting in poor psychological and physical health. Meth addicts experience hallucinations, insomnia, and deteriorating relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. Physically, they suffer gauntness, deterioration of teeth and gums, and skin <b>formication.</b> They often undergo abuse to sustain their addictions. This study analyzes quantitative data from the National Household Survey to frame the reflective ethnographic portion‘s interactive interviewing and introduces a new tool, the Life Time Line, to clarify and correlate life events. The ethnographic results, based on extensive life history interviews with five women in recovery from methaddiction, concur with national trends and detail themes that could inform prevention and treatment programs. Recurrent themes are: dysfunctional parental relationships (including being ―adulterized‖) and chaotic childhood; a full range of abuse by parents, family, and husbands or boyfriends; introduction to drugs by males; body image dysphasia; and feelings of normalcy on drugs or self-medication in the face of unbearable living conditions or mental illness. This study emphasizes recovery. The ethnographies reveal that each woman had an epiphany, at least partially facilitated by a recovering addict; participated fully in a 12 -step program such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA); became dedicated to the acquisition of a college education, including graduate school; and attend AA or NA to maintain sobriety...|$|E
40|$|Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and has a dismal 50 % survival rate. Treatment for HNSCC is expensive and aggressive; surviving patients are left with significant physical impairment and emotional burden. Despite limited therapeutic options and poor survival, no novel effective therapy has been developed in 50 years. Perineural invasion (PNI) is a prognostic factor of poor survival in multiple cancers, including HNSCC, prostate and pancreatic cancers. If PNI is detected in HNSCC, the survival rate drops to 20 %. Despite this alarming statistic, PNI {{is one of the}} least studied cancer phenotypes. Long-thought to be a passive process, new evidence demonstrates that PNI is an active process where tumor cells must degrade multiple layers of perineural sheath to spread. PNI leads to sensory disturbances including numbness, <b>formication</b> and cancer-associated pain. The nerve-tumor crosstalk necessary to promote PNI is understudied {{due to the lack of}} appropriate models that allow observation of nerve-tumor interactions. Due to this deficit in investigations no anti-PNI therapies are available. In this study, we present a novel in vivo model of PNI to characterize interactions between nerves and tumors. This model uses the chicken chorioallantoic membrane in vivo platform with a grafted human HNSCC cell line adjacent to an implanted rat dorsal root ganglion. Mechanistic studies indicate that the neuropeptide galanin (GAL) mediates nerve-tumor crosstalk via activation of galanin receptor 2 (GALR 2), a G-protein coupled receptor. Nerves initiate PNI via release of GAL, which induces GALR 2 on cancer cells. Through a novel signaling mechanism of tumor progression, activated GALR 2 induces nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 2 (NFATc 2) -mediated transcription of GAL and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX 2) in cancer. Prostaglandin E 2, a conversion product of COX 2, promotes invasion of cancer cells and in a feedback loop, GAL promotes tumor neuritogenesis. Clinical data show that expression of proteins involved in this cascade are correlated with poor survival. Importantly, the GALR 2 inhibitor M 871 blocks PNI in the CAM in vivo model. This study provides evidence of the dynamic interaction between nerve and cancer cells that facilitates PNI...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out in 42 year old male, whose stools were {{negative}} for hookworm eggs and did not produce larvae by kawara culture method, to study the ability of hookworm larvae to gain entrance into human body by the skin. 145 larvae of Necator americanus {{were placed on the}} dorsal surface of the left hand, and 108 larvae of Ancylostoma duodenale on the dorsal surface of the right hand. After the larvae had been left free to act on the skin for, one hour, the skin was rinsed with water and the numbers of larvae collected in the water were counted. By deducting the numbers of the larvae retrieved from the water from those initially placed on the skin, 117 larvae of N. americanus and 65 larvae of A. duodenole were estimated to have penetrated. The results were summarized as following. 1. In 17 minutes after the larvae of N. americanus were placed in contact with the skin, there occurred <b>formication</b> and slightly painful itching at the site of infection. The latter gradually grew in intensity and, after reaching the highest level on the fourth day, tended to subside thereafter, disappearing completely on the fifteenth day. 2. In 1 hour after the larvae of N. americanus were placed in contact with the skin, there appeared a round red patch, 6 × 5 mm. in size, at the site of infection. It grew in size and the condition was the most marked on the fourth day. Since then, it gradually decreased in size and was reduced to a pink papule as large as a millet on the fifteenth day. On the twentysecond day there only remained a pink spot, and by the thirtieth day an entirely normal state had been restored to the skin at the site of infection. 3. Systemic symptoms consisted of malaise and chills appearing on the third day of infection and lasting only a few hours. 4. There were neither subjective symptoms nor macroscopical changes in the skin with which the larvae of A. duodenale were placed in contact. 5. It was not until the sixtieth day of infection that the stools produced the larvae of N. americanus on culture by Kawara method. They were negative for A. duodenale on culture by the same method. Subsequent tests were. only positive for N. americanus. 6. Though 117 larvae of N. americanus were estimated to have entered the body, the number of worms expelled were 12 in total (3 males and 9 females). The ratio of the number of worms expelled to the number of larvae that entered the body was 12 : 117, or 10. 2 per cent. No worms of A. duodenale were expelled...|$|E
