40|$|The {{principle}} of load balancing is {{to distribute the}} data load more evenly over the network {{in order to increase}} the network performance and efficiency. With dynamic load balancing the routing is undated at certain intervals. This thesis was developed to evaluate load balancing methods in the IP-network of TeliaSonera. Load balancing using short path routing, bottleneck load balancing and load balancing using MPLS have been evaluated. Short path routing is a <b>flow</b> <b>sharing</b> technique that allows routing on paths other than the shortest one. Load balancing using short path routing is achieved by dynamic updates of the link weights. Bottleneck is in its nature a dynamic load balancing algorithm. Unlike load balancing using short path routing it updates the <b>flow</b> <b>sharing,</b> not the metrics. The algorithm uses information about current <b>flow</b> <b>sharing</b> and link loads to detect bottlenecks within the network. The information is used to calculate new <b>flow</b> <b>sharing</b> parameters. When using MPLS, one or more complete routing paths (LSPs) are defined at each edge LSR before sending any traffic. MPLS brings the ability to perform <b>flow</b> <b>sharing</b> by defining the paths to be used and how the outgoing data load is to be shared among these. The model has been built from data about the network supplied by TeliaSonera. The model consists of a topology part, a traffic part, a routing part and cost part. The traffic model consists of a OD demand matrix. The OD demand matrix has been estimated from collected link loads. This was done with estimation models; the gravity model and an optimisation model. The algorithms have been analysed at several scenarios; normal network, core node failure, core link failure and DWDM system failure. A cost function, where the cost increases as the link load increases has been used to evaluate the algorithms. The signalling requirements for implementation of the load balancing algorithm have also been investigated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>flow</b> <b>sharing</b> {{problem is}} a class of {{techniques}} {{that can be used}} to find the optimal flow in a capacitated network, which realizes an equitable distribution of flows. This paper extends the integer <b>flow</b> <b>sharing</b> problem by considering fuzzy capacities and fuzzy weights such that the flux received at each sink node and the flow value through each arc are restricted to be multiples of some block unit. Fuzzy capacity describes the flexibility of the upper limit of flow value through each arc. Fuzzy weight represents the degree of satisfaction of the flux to a sink node. Our model has the two following criteria: to maximize the minimal degree of satisfaction among all of the fuzzy capacity constraints and to maximize the minimal degree of satisfaction among the fluxes to all of the sink nodes. Because an optimal flow pattern that simultaneously maximizes the two objectives is usually not feasible, we define non-domination in this setting and propose a pseudo-polynomial algorithm that finds some non-dominated flow patterns. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate how our algorithm works...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—When the {{flows in}} natural or man made channel {{sections}} exceed the main channel depth, the adjoining floodplains become inundated and carry {{part of the}} river discharge. Due to different hydraulic conditions prevailing in the river and floodplain of a compound channel, the mean velocity in the main channel and in the floodplain are different. This leads to the transfer of momentum between the main channel water {{and that of the}} floodplain making the flow structure more complex. Results of some experiments concerning the overbank flow distribution in a compound channel are presented. <b>Flow</b> <b>sharing</b> in river channels is strongly dependant on the interaction between flow in the main channel and that in the floodplain. The influence of the geometry on velocity and flow distribution and different functional relationships are obtained. Dimensionless parameters are used to form equations representing the over bank <b>flow</b> <b>sharing</b> in the subsections. The equations agree well with experimental discharge data and other published data. Using the proposed method, the error between the measured and calculated discharge distribution for the a compound sections is found to be the minimum when compared with that using other investigators.

40|$|The {{transmission}} control protocol (TCP) is the major trans- port layer protocol in the Internet today. TCP and its vari- ants have the drawback of not knowing the explicit rate <b>share</b> of <b>flows</b> at bottleneck links. The Rate Control Proto- col (RCP) is a major clean slate congestion control protocol which has been recently proposed to address these draw- backs. RCP tries to get explicit knowledge of <b>flow</b> <b>shares</b> at bottleneck links. However, RCP under or over estimates the number of active flows which it needs to obtain the <b>flow</b> fair rate <b>share.</b> This causes under or over utilization of bot- tleneck link capacity. This in turn can result in very high queue length and packet drops which translate into a high average file completion time (AFCT). In this paper we present the design and analysis of a Network congestion Control Protocol (NCP). NCP can give <b>flows</b> their fair <b>share</b> rates and hence resulting in the minimum AFCT.

40|$|This work studies an {{innovative}} working hydraulic system design for mobile applications, {{referred to as}} flow control. The fundamental difference compared to load-sensing systems is that the pump is controlled based on the operator’s command signals rather than feedback signals from the loads. This control approach enables higher energy efficiency since the pressure difference between pump and load is given by the system resistance rather than a prescribed pump pressure margin. Furthermore, load-sensing systems suffer from poor dynamic characteristics since the pump is operated in a closed-loop control mode. This might result in an oscillatory behaviour. Flow control systems have no stability issues attached to the load pressure feedback since there is none. This allows the pump to be {{designed to meet the}} response requirements without considering system stability. Pressure compensators are key components in flow control systems. This study addresses the flow matching problem which occurs when using traditional compensators in combination with a flow-controlled pump. <b>Flow</b> <b>sharing</b> pressure compensators solve this problem since the pump flow will be distributed between all active functions.
