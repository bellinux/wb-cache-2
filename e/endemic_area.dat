5|$|Relapses {{were first}} noted in 1897 by William S. Thayer, who recounted the {{experiences}} of a physician who relapsed 21 months after leaving an <b>endemic</b> <b>area.</b> He proposed {{the existence of a}} tissue stage. Relapses were confirmed by Patrick Manson, who allowed infected Anopheles mosquitoes to feed on his eldest son. The younger Manson then described a relapse nine months after his apparent cure with quinine.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an <b>endemic</b> <b>area.</b> Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E

50|$|The best {{strategies}} for preventing accidental infection of humans {{is to educate}} those living in <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> to only consume fully cooked meat. The inability of the parasite to complete its life cycle within humans means that transmission can easily be contained by adequate preparation of meat from intermediate hosts. This is especially useful {{because of the difficulty}} and lack of feasibility inherent in eliminating all intermediate hosts of gnathostomiasis. So instead, individuals in <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> should avoid eating raw and undercooked meat in <b>endemic</b> <b>areas,</b> but this may be difficult in these areas. This is due to preference for dishes containing raw fish in these <b>endemic</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

25|$|In Europe, human fasciolosis occur {{mainly in}} France, Spain, Portugal, {{and the former}} USSR. France is {{considered}} an important human <b>endemic</b> <b>area.</b> A total of 5863 cases of human fasciolosis were recorded from nine French hospitals from 1970 to 1982. Concerning the former Soviet Union, almost all reported cases were from the Tajik Republic. Several papers referred to human fasciolosis in Turkey. Recently, serological survey of human fasciolosis was performed {{in some parts of}} Turkey. The prevalence of the disease was serologically found to be 3.01% in Antalya Province, and between 0.9 and 6.1% in Isparta Province, Mediterranean region of Turkey. In other European countries, fasciolosis is sporadic and the occurrence of the disease is usually combined with travelling to endemic areas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Buruli ulcer is usually {{based on the}} characteristic appearance of the ulcer in an <b>endemic</b> <b>area.</b> If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, then PCR using the IS2404 target is helpful, {{but this is not}} specific for M. ulcerans. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain is only 40–80% sensitive, and culture is 20–60% sensitive. [...] Simultaneous use of multiple methods may be necessary to make the diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|C. immitis is a dimorphic {{saprophytic}} fungus {{that grows}} as a mycelium {{in the soil}} and produces a spherule form in the host organism. It resides in the soil {{in certain parts of}} the southwestern United States, most notably in California and Arizona. It is also commonly found in northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. C. immitis is dormant during long dry spells, then develops as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when it rains. [...] The spores, known as arthroconidia, are swept into the air by disruption of the soil, such as during construction, farming, or an earthquake. Windstorms may also cause epidemics far from endemic areas. [...] In December 1977 a windstorm in an <b>endemic</b> <b>area</b> around Arvin, CA led to several hundred cases, including deaths, in non-endemic areas hundreds of miles away.|$|E

40|$|Tungro is an {{important}} disease of rice, constraining to the rice production in Indonesia. Tungro {{is caused by the}} infection of two different viruses namely tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and tungro spherical virus (RTSV). Both viruses are only transmitted by green leafhoppers, especially Nephotettix virescens in a semipersistent manner. The variation of tungro viruses from different areas had been reported, and there is a specific relationship between resistance variety and tungro virus isolate. It is important therefore, to study the virulences and the genetic diversities of tungro viruses derived from the <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> in Indonesia. This study was aimed to identify the virulence and the molecular diversity of tungro viruses from <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> in Indonesia. Susceptible variety TN 1 was used in the study. Surveys and collection of the infected plants and green leafhoppers were conducted in some tungro <b>endemic</b> <b>areas,</b> including: West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, Bali and West Nusa Tenggara. Artificial virus transmission using test tube method was used in the virulence test. Green leafhoppers caught from the field were used as vector transmitters. The virulence of tungro viruses was determined based on diseases indexes (DI). Results showed that the virulence of tungro viruses varied among region in the <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> in Indonesia. The Central Java virus isolate was the most virulence; however, not all isolates from <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> in the island of Java were more virulent than those from outside of Java. The presence of RTBV and RTSV was detected in the infected TN 1 plants. The existences of molecular diversities of tungro viruses from the <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> were observed. The relationship between combination of DNA bands of RTBV and RTSV with the virulence in <b>endemic</b> <b>areas</b> outside of Java was more complex than it was in West Java and Central Java. The molecular diversities of tungro viruses were not correlated with the geographic difference of the <b>endemic</b> <b>areas,</b> nor with the virulences...|$|R
2500|$|Mammomonogamus is a genus of {{parasitic}} nematodes of {{the family}} Syngamidae that parasitise the respiratory tracts of cattle, sheep, goats, deer, cats, orangutans, and elephants. The nematodes can also infect humans and cause the disease called mammomonogamiasis. Several known species [...] fall under the Mammomonogamus genus, but the most common species found to infest humans is M. laryngeus. Infection in humans is very rare, with only about 100 reported cases worldwide, and {{is assumed to be}} largely accidental. Cases have been reported from the Caribbean, China, Korea, Thailand, and Philippines. The worm usually inhabits the upper-respiratory region in the trachea, bronchus, or larynx, and can elicit chronic coughing and asthma-like symptoms. One interesting case from Thailand reported finding worms in the patient's duodenum, suggesting M. laryngeus can also be a gastrointestinal parasite. More research is needed because the life cycle is not completely known. Diagnosis is made by recovering the worms on bronchoscopy or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Due to the scant amount of information available on this parasite in literature, increased awareness is necessary, especially in endemic areas near M. laryngeus’ reservoir hosts, for clinicians, the local population in the <b>endemic</b> <b>area,</b> and traveling tourists, to effectively recognize and prevent mammomonogamiasis.|$|E

50|$|Because M. ulcerans {{infection}} {{is associated with}} nonspecific clinical manifestations and indolent course, {{it is important to}} consider every nodule or ulcer in an <b>endemic</b> <b>area</b> as a suspected M. ulcerans infection until proven otherwise. A nodule is firm and painless. In the absence of superinfection(s) an ulcer is painless or minimally painful, has the characteristic undermined edge and a whitish-yellow necrotic base. Previous residence in an <b>endemic</b> <b>area</b> should raise the suspicion of M. ulcerans infection.|$|E
