5|$|The {{first major}} change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's {{doctrine}} on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God</b> {{and not by}} doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied {{with the results of}} the study, he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God</b> as a healer.|$|E

5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God</b> is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E

25|$|Adventists {{do not see}} the Sabbath as a works-based doctrine, {{but rather}} righteousness comes solely through <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christ alone. The Sabbath commandment is seen as an act of <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> ideal for the believer, {{although}} its significance may not be seen by non-believers.|$|R

5|$|As an {{illiterate}} child, she {{had been}} told Bible stories by her mother. The particular variety of her early Christian belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God.</b> She rejected {{the teachings of the}} New Testament that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing visions and vivid dreams, she interpreted them as revelations from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.|$|E
5|$|His loss {{of faith}} in human {{relationships}} is mirrored in his loss of <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God.</b> During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E
5|$|Legree {{begins to}} hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and {{resolves}} to crush his new slave's <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God.</b> Despite Legree's cruelty, however, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves {{as best he}} can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.|$|E

50|$|Brother Juniper {{works for}} six years on his book about the bridge collapse, trying various {{mathematical}} formulas to measure spiritual traits, with no results beyond conventionally pious generalizations. He compiles his huge book of interviews with complete <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> goodness and justice, but a council pronounces his work heresy, and the book and Brother Juniper are burned in the town square.|$|R
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God,</b> he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Tom Loker {{returns to the}} story. Loker has changed {{as the result of}} being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also {{obtained}} their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God</b> is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.|$|E
5|$|Samar {{notices that}} Meera often prays at church. After {{a night of}} wild street dancing, they begin to fall in love. Samar helps Meera face her past, taking her to visit her estranged mother and foster reconciliation. Meera decides to confess to her father about Samar and break her engagement, but when Samar has a {{motorbike}} accident, Meera, believing she {{is the cause of}} his bad luck, prays to God to save his life, swearing never to see him again. Samar recovers and Meera reveals the vow she made. Angry, he leaves her and London altogether, challenging God to keep him alive as he risks his life every day. He believes his death {{is the only way to}} make Meera lose her <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God.</b> He goes to India and enlists in the army, becoming a bomb-disposal expert.|$|E
50|$|On {{the spiritual}} level, Conan's Cimmerian deity Crom in this version {{is not a}} remote, unseen <b>god</b> as <b>in</b> {{previous}} storylines, but an accessible deity who at times provides Conan direct divine assistance, and Conan is outright devout in his worship of Crom (while in previous incarnations, Conan has little <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>gods,</b> and believes that Crom simply observes as men struggle).|$|R
50|$|When {{approached}} by Ang Katotohanan, Nicolas Zamora accepted the leadership against {{the advice and}} importuning of the Americans. After some preparation, the group established the Iglesia Evangelica Metodista en las Islas Filipinas on 28 February 1909. Their vision and motivation was <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God’s</b> providence, and belief that the Filipino was capable of erecting a self-sustaining, autonomous, and self-propagating evangelical church.|$|R
5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, have <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>gods,</b> feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|R
5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God</b> can co-exist.|$|E

Upon hearing this Hrafnkell remarks: I think it is folly to have <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>gods,</b> and he never {{performs}} another sacrifice. His manner improves and he becomes much gentler with his subordinates. In this way, he gains popularity and loyalty.|$|R

Buddhism came to him and changed his life.He lost <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> existence but still retained <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> reincarnation. Later he moved towards Marxist Socialism and rejected the concepts of reincarnation and afterlife also. The two volumes of Darshan-Digdarshan, the collected history of World's Philosophy give an indication of his philosophy when we find the second volume much dedicated to Dharmakirti's Pramana Vartika. This he discovered in Tibetan translation from Tibet.|$|R

50|$|The Japanese {{persecution}} of Chinese folk religion {{led to an}} increase of skepticism and loss of faith among the Chinese. As {{a result of this}} loss of <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>gods,</b> Japanese police reported a general decline in public morals.

5000|$|The {{dispute in}} {{question}} in Christian theology is between those of <b>faith</b> (<b>in</b> <b>God's</b> promises: the covenant, the Messiah), and [...] "the wicked", meaning everybody opposed {{to those of}} faith. Paul was positing {{that the people of}} such faith are vindicated when Messiah returns, being declared [...] "righteous" [...] (or in other words, vindicated for their stance), which is exactly the meaning of the Biblical term [...] "justified", in N. T. Wright's view.|$|R
2500|$|Long {{before the}} NTSB issued its final report, Western media began to {{speculate}} {{about the meaning of}} the recorded cockpit conversations and about possible motives – including suicide and terrorism – behind Al-Batouti's actions on the flight. The speculation, in part, was based on leaks from an unnamed federal law enforcement official that the crew member in the co-pilot's seat was recorded as saying, [...] "I made my decision now.

25|$|By prayer one {{acknowledges}} God's {{power and}} goodness, and one's own neediness and dependence. It is therefore {{an act of}} the virtue of religion implying the deepest reverence for God and habituating a person to look to him for everything. Prayer presupposes <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God</b> and hope in his goodness. By both, God, to whom one prays, moves the individual to prayer.|$|E
25|$|A second {{covenant}}, {{called the}} covenant of grace, {{is said to}} have been made immediately following Adam and Eve's sin. In it, God graciously offers salvation from death on condition of <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God.</b> This covenant is administered in different ways throughout the Old and New Testaments, but retains the substance of being free of a requirement of perfect obedience.|$|E
5000|$|People came to {{feel that}} the [...] "impersonal order of regularities" [...] was a more mature {{standpoint}} than the <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> a personal <b>God.</b> The new cosmic imaginary of a universe vast in time and space also argued against [...] "a personal God or benign purpose."

2500|$|It is {{received}} by having <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> promise {{to fill the}} believer and in yielding the entire being to Christ. Certain conditions, if present in a believer's life, could cause delay in receiving Spirit baptism, such as [...] "weak faith, unholy living, imperfect consecration, and egocentric motives". In the absence of these, Pentecostals teach that seekers should maintain a persistent <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the knowledge that God will fulfill his promise. For Pentecostals, there is no prescribed manner in which a believer will be filled with the Spirit. It could be expected or unexpected, during public or private prayer.|$|R
5000|$|The Bible {{refers to}} divine {{retribution}} as, in most cases, being delayed or [...] "treasured up" [...] {{to a future}} time. Sight of God's supernatural works and retribution would mitigate against <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>God's</b> Word. William Lane Craig says, <b>in</b> Paul’s view, <b>God’s</b> properties, His eternal power and deity, are clearly revealed in creation, so that people who fail to believe in an eternal, powerful Creator {{of the world are}} without excuse. Indeed, Paul says that they actually do know that God exists, but they suppress this truth because of their unrighteousness.|$|R
