This study evaluated the <b>haemodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> of MVR with LVAD support {{and the influence of}} inflow cannulation site and LVAD speed modulation. Left atrial (LAC) and ventricular (LVC) cannulation was evaluated in a mock circulation loop with no, mild, moderate and severe MVR with constant speed and speed modulation (± 600 RPM) modes. The use of an LVAD relieved pulmonary congestion during severe MVR, by reducing left atrial pressure from 20. 5 to 10. 8 (LAC) and 11. 5 (LVC) mmHg. However, LAC resulted in decreased left ventricular stroke work (− 0. 08 J), ejection fraction (− 7. 9 %) and higher MVR volume (+ 12. 7 mL) and pump speed (+ 100 RPM) compared to LVC. This suggests that LVC, in addition to reducing MVR severity, also improves ventricular washout over LAC. LVAD speed modulation in synchrony with ventricular systole reduced MVR volume and increased ejection fraction with LAC and LVC, thus demonstrating the potential benefits of this mode, despite a reduction in cardiac output...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Occlusive {{arterial}} {{disease is}} usually irregular with both symmetric (concentric) and asymmetric (eccentric) stenoses. Knowledge {{of the effect}} of stenosis geometry on stenosis haemodynamics is necessary to correctly interpret tests that measure stenosis severity anatomically. The independent <b>haemodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> of stenosis asymmetry has not been described. Design: In vitro flow-rig measurement of the steady pressure/flow behaviour of rigid, 20 mm long, square-ended symmetric and asymmetric stenoses in a 6. 7 -mm diameter tube using a blood analogue (40 % glycerol). Results: All stenoses, irrespective of geometry, had a linear resistance (R) to flow (Q) relationship such that R=k 1 + k 2 Q where k 1 and k 2 are constants (corr> 0. 99, p< 0. 05). Asymmetry was found to have a significant <b>haemodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> if the stenosis severity is expressed as a diameter reduction but no effect if stenosis severity is expressed as an area reduction. The maximum flow for an inflow pressure of 90 mmHg (Q 90) fell from 2050 to 280 ml/min as stenosis area reduction increased from 80 % to 96 %. Conclusions: Arterial stenoses exhibit flow-dependent resistance irrespective of their geometry. The effect of stenosis asymmetry can only be ignored if anatomical severity is expressed as a percentage area reduction. A clinically useful measure of stenosis severity is the maximum flow for a given inflow pressure...|$|E

Left ventricular ejection fraction hardly increased and contractility did not vary. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure decreased, owing to a decrease in left ventricular wall stiffness.

Computational fluid dynamics was performed to simulate realistic physiological conditions that reveal the in vivo cardiac haemodynamics.

Results: Our results showed that the highest velocity and PSG were found in the type of plaque configuration which involved all of the three left coronary branches. Plaques located in the left circumflex branch resulted in highly significant changes of the velocity, WSS and PSG (p < 0. 001) when compared to the other types of plaque configurations.

Twenty hypertensive patients completed the double-blind crossover randomized study. Each 6 -week active treatment period was both preceded and followed by 2 weeks of placebo treatment such that the total duration of the study was 18 weeks. Despite comparable efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures by approximately 10 % of the basal value, the two drugs differed in their systemic and <b>haemodynamic</b> <b>effects.</b> Celiprolol significantly decreased forearm peripheral resistance and total peripheral resistance.

Differences in the systemic and regional <b>haemodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> of the two drugs could account for the different blood pressure response seen in some patients.
