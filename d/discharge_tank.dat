40|$|An airbag is {{composed}} of a housing assembly, door assembly, cushion assembly, and an inflator. The inflator {{is an essential part}} that generates gas for the airbag. When an airbag is activated, it effectively absorbs the crash energy of the passenger by inflating a cushion. In the present study, tank tests were performed with newly synthesized propellants with various compositions, and the results are compared with the numerical results. In the simulation of the inflator, a zonal model has been adopted which consisted of four zones of flow regions: combustion chamber, filter, gas plenum, and <b>discharge</b> <b>tank.</b> Each zone was described by the conservation equations with specified constitutive relations for gas. The pressure and temperature of each zone of the inflator were calculated and analyzed, and the results were compared with the tank test data. The similarity of the pressure curve and closed bomb calculation show that the modeled results are well correlated with the experimental data. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} study investigates {{the performance of}} an updraft gasifier for a water pump powered by a small engine. The main components of the system are a 0. 0793 m 3 updraft gasifier, a cooling coil tube, a 0. 050 m 3 gas tank and a gas mixer. The proposed gasifier system is modified to prevent corrosion by covering {{the inside of the}} steel gasifier cover with fireproof cement. A HONDA GX 120 gasoline engine and a water pump (MOKRO MK 39 model) are used. Dried wood (5 kg), charcoal (5 kg) and gasoline are fuels in the experiments. The experiments are to identify a suitable fuel used with and without the gasifier in terms of the shortest time required to pump 5 -liter water from a suction tank to a <b>discharge</b> <b>tank</b> with a water head of 13 m. The engine speed to drive the water pump is maintained at approximately 2500 rpm. The engine speeds, the lengths of time to pump out 5 -liter water and the fuel consumption are observed and documented. The flow rates of the dried wood, charcoal and gasoline under study are respectively 0. 000134 ± 2. 4 x 10 - 6, 0. 000130 ± 4. 21 x 10 - 7 and 0. 00017 ± 4. 22 x 10 - 7 m 3 /s, while their respective power of fluid flow are 17. 1 ± 0. 35, 16. 7 ± 0. 54 and 22. 01 ± 0. 05 W.

40|$|Depleting {{fossil fuel}} supplies, {{environmental}} pollution, {{and global warming}} demand a new energy carrier for future transportation systems, and hydrogen has been recognized as a promising candidate. On-board hydrogen storage, among other challenges, must be addressed before a hydrogen economy could be realized. Sodium borohydride hydrogen storage systems {{have been identified as}} a potential candidate to meet the storage challenge. ^ Calorimetery measurements have been conducted to clarify the inconsistency in the heat of reaction data of sodium borohydride hydrolysis reported in prior literature. The heat of reaction was measured to be 210 ± 11 kJ/mol NaBH 4, significantly less than the often cited value of 300 kJ/mol NaBH 4. Reaction kinetics of sodium borohydride hydrolysis on ruthenium catalyst at different temperatures has also been measured, and a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model has been developed. The newly developed kinetic model captures zero-order kinetic behavior at low temperatures and first-order kinetic behavior at high temperatures. ^ A 1 kWe sodium borohydride system was designed and fabricated. Its behavior at the system level was tested under different flow rates, concentrations, inlet temperatures and operating pressures. Higher flow rates and higher operating pressures decrease chemical conversion, while higher concentrations increase chemical conversion. The temperature profile was found to be a strong indicator of chemical conversion inside the reactor. A one-dimensional homogeneous reactor model has been developed based on experimental data, and its predictions match measured data very well. ^ Discharged products from 15 % NaBH 4 or higher concentrations crystallize upon cooling to room temperature and become a solid that {{would be very difficult to}} remove from the <b>discharge</b> <b>tank.</b> Considering the practical challenges of keeping the discharged products warm and preventing crystallization, this work concludes that 10 to 15 % NaBH 4 may be the highest concentration that could be used for practical hydrolysis. Such solutions would have gravimetric densities of 2. 1 to 3. 1 wt% hydrogen, falling short of the DOE target of 6 wt% for 2010. ...|$|E

FentonThis {{project was}} done to {{determine}} the effectiveness of different methods of mitigating the effects of an ammonia release through a pressure relief device in an ammonia refrigeration system. Several methods were considered, and five were selected for further study. The methods chosen for further study were <b>discharge</b> into a <b>tank</b> containing standing water, discharge into the atmosphere, discharge into a flare, discharge into a wet scrubber, and an emergency pressure control system. <b>Discharge</b> into a <b>tank</b> containing standing water {{is the most common}} method in existence today but several people in the ammonia refrigeration industry have questioned its reliability. The methods were compared based on a quantitative risk analysis, combining failure rates of each system with ammonia dispersion modeling and the monetized health effects of a system’s failure to contain an ammonia release. It was determined that the release height had a greater influence on the downwind cost impact than any other variable, including weather conditions and release from multiple sources. The <b>discharge</b> into a <b>tank</b> containing standing water was determined to have the lowest failure rate, while the flare system was found to be the most effective in terms of relative overall release consequent cost. The emergency pressure control system is now required by the codes, and any of the other mitigation systems would be very effective when used in conjunction with the emergency pressure control system...|$|R
