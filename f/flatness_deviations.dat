40|$|At {{present time}} there is not {{information}} {{about the influence of}} rigidity of hardened steel parts on the parameters of flatness deviations: EFEmax, EFEa, EFEq, which are called correspondingly greatest, arithmetic average and quadratic average. To model the variable rigidity of workpieces, an arrangement with the frame structure was used. It allowed to simulate the variable compliance of parts with constant sizes in the direction of longitudinal feed of grinding machine. Searching for models of multiple dispersion analysis was carried out using the D-optimal plan of experiment. They predicted that in rough grinding all parameters of <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> increase with the growth of the part rigidity. In the subsequent grinding stages, the increase of part rigidity is accompanied by the favorable decrease of the <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations.</b> The compliance of low-rigid parts in the finishing stage of grinding should be reduced using additional technological devices...|$|E

40|$|In {{the cold}} strip rolling process, tension plays a great {{role in the}} {{stability}} of rolling, reduction of rolling force and power consumption, coordination of thickness control, and improvement of flatness quality. The correcting and attenuating effect of tension on <b>flatness</b> <b>deviation</b> is gradually revealed, but quantitative analysis of their inherent effect is still insufficient. Thus, a roll-strip-tension coupling model with both accuracy and efficiency was established to analyze the influence of tension on <b>flatness</b> <b>deviation.</b> In the model, a strip plastic deformation model based on a 3 -dimensional differential method was corrected by a strip transverse flow factor obtained by an finite element method simulation model and was consequently combined with a rolls elastic deformation model based on the influence function method and the tension calculation module. By the coupling model, the mechanism of the self-correction effect of front tension and the attenuation effect of back tension on <b>flatness</b> <b>deviation</b> was further discussed, and the calculation results of the corresponding correction coefficient and attenuation coefficient were obtained. The present paper brings more insight into the effect of tension on flatness, and lays a foundation for the optimization of the shape control model in the cold rolling process with tension...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of distortion relevant-factors in an overall process chain {{in order to}} describe the distortion behaviour of a regarded component {{is an important step}} in the method Distortion Engineering. In this context, the application of design of experiments (DoE) assures a systematic procedure during both experiment and distortion analysis. The distortion behaviour of the examined thin-walled bearing rings was characterised by harmonic analysis in explicit consideration of the direction of the respective shape changes. The change in roundness deviation due to heat treatment is controlled by a variation of the clamping system during machining. Based on the experimental results and additional finite element analysis, this effect is explained by local plastic deformation due to stress relief during heating of the non-uniform machining residual stress state. The variation of the supporting pattern during heat treatment induces a change in roundness and <b>flatness</b> <b>deviation,</b> respectively. The alteration in <b>flatness</b> <b>deviation</b> is also influenced by the heating rate. The distortion mechanism that is responsible for these effects could not be identified in this work.

40|$|Direct {{wafer bonding}} has been {{identified}} as an en-abling technology for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). As the complexity of devices increase and the bonding of multiple patterned wafers is required, {{there is a need to}} understand the factors that lead to bonding failure. Bonding relies on short-ranged surface forces, thus <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> of the wafers may prevent bonding. Bonding success is determined by whether or not the surface forces are sufficient to overcome the <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> and deform the wafers to a common shape. A general bonding criterion based on this fact is developed by comparing the strain energy required to deform the wafers to the surface energy that is dissipated as the bond is formed. The bonding criterion is used to examine the case of bonding bowed wafers with etch patterns on the bonding surface. An analytical expression for the bonding criterion is developed using plate theory for the case of bowed wafers. Then, the criterion is implemented using finite element analysis, to demonstrate its use and to validate the analytical model. The results indicate that wafer thickness and curvature are important in determining bonding success and that the bonding criterion is independent of wafer diameter. Results also demonstrate that shallow etched patterns can make bonding more difficult while deep features, which penetrate through an appreciable thickness of the wafer, may facilitate bonding. Design implications of the model results are discussed in detail. Preliminary results from experiments designed to validate the model, agree with the trends seen in the model, but further work is required to achieve quantitative correlation.

40|$|Direct wafer bonding, {{also known}} as fusion bonding, {{has emerged as a}} key process in the {{manufacture}} of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The use of wafer bonding increases design flexibility, allows integration of dissimilar materials, and permits wafer-level packaging. While direct wafer bonding processes are becoming more prevalent in the fabrication of MEMS devices, failure during the bonding process is often a problem and is not completely understood. A modeling framework, based on the mechanics of the bonding process, has been on the mechanics of the bonding process, has been developed to correlate bonding failure to wafer geometry, surface condition, and etch patterns. The modeling approach is based on an energy balance between the reduction in surface energy as the bond is formed and the strain energy that is stored in the wafers as they conform to each other. The model allows the effect of <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations,</b> wafer geometry (i. e. thickness, diameter), wafer mounting, and etched features on the bonding process to be shown. Modeling results demonstrate that wafer bow, wafer thickness, and certain types of etch patterns are critical factors in controlling bonding success. Bonding experiments, in which specific <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> and etch patterns have been introduced on wafers prior to bonding, have been carried out and compared to the modeling results. The understanding of the process gained through the modeling can be used to set tolerances on wafers, assist in mask layout, and guide the design of bonding equipment to ensure success in direct wafer bonding processes...|$|E
40|$|Wafer-level, {{thermocompression bonding}} is a {{promising}} technique for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) packaging. The {{process is a}} form of solid-state joining and requires the simultaneous application of temperature and pressure to wafers patterned with metallic thin films in order to bring the mating surfaces into atomic proximity. The quality of the resulting bond is critically dependent on the interaction between <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> that range from wafer bow to surface roughness, the thin film properties and the process parameters and tooling used to achieve the bonds. Hitherto there has been limited modeling applied to understand the relative contributions of these effects. This thesis addresses the above issue through the development of a mechanics-based framework that allows the effect of <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> to be assessed for typical geometries and process conditions. The strain energy release rate associated with the elastic deformation required to overcome wafer bow is calculated. A contact yield criterion is used to examine the pressure and temperature conditions required to flatten surface roughness asperities in order to achieve bonding over the full apparent area. The results are compared to experimental data of bond yield and toughness obtained from four-point bend delamination testing, microscopic observations and measurements on the fractured surfaces. Conclusions from the modeling and experiments indicate that wafer bow has negligible effect on determining the variability of bond quality and that the well-bonded area is increased with increasing bonding pressure.

Measurement uncertainty is a crucial parameter for making the right decisions, and not taking into account this parameter can, therefore, sometimes lead to aberrant decisions. The determination of the uncertainty measurement on CMM is a complex task for the variety of influencing factors.

40|$|Overlay {{accuracy}} {{is known as}} one of the most important subjects for ULSI device production. Significant contributions such as alignment accuracy and mask distortions are well known. By breaking the 100 nm range on overlay accuracy a number of influences have to take into account, which were usually be neglected for relaxed design rules. One of these influences to the overlay is directly related to wafer distortions induced by <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> of wafer chucks. This impact was characterized by investigating the elastic behaviour of 4 wafers (525 mym thick), fixed on a wafer chuck. Induced elastical deformation due to flatness error of the chuck causes strains and elongations in the wafer surface and therefore wafer distortions. The results obtained by exposure experiments and calculations show that even a point size defect has a 30 mm spreading. Therefore the induced distortions arrives about 100 nm in case of a 3 mym flatness irregularity.

40|$|In {{form and}} {{roughness}} measurements, often surfaces are measured which are approximately straight, round, or smooth. Measuring such surfaces often gives measurement results in which noise plays a role. This noise may give an offset in measurement parameter as the noise makes the parameter, e. g. the <b>flatness</b> <b>deviation</b> of the Ra-value, deviate away from zero. In this {{paper we propose}} a method to correct for this noise bias for the roughness parameter Rq which is equivalent to the standard deviation. By considering the decrease in Rq once an average over multiple measurements is made, an unbiased value for Rq is estimated by extrapolating the value to an infinite amount of measurements. It is shown that using this method for two profile measurements only, the true measurand is approached better than with averaging dozens of measurements. This principle is extended to obtain a complete 'noise-corrected' profile by considering the power spectrum and the change of each Fourier component with averaging. As for each Fourier component few estimations are available, the method only has advantages when many measurements are taken. Combining the two methods and considering the statistical significance of each Fourier component enables a further reduction.

In three-dimensional measurement, the preferred tool of control is currently the coordinate measuring machine CMM, the evaluation of flatness defect of a part is a very common task in this area, and the decisions made based on the measurement result may be outliers when the uncertainty of measurement result is not taken into account.

40|$|Wave front sensing allows {{determination}} of topography and flatness of reflecting surfaces. As {{there is no}} contact to the surface, the method enables a contamination free and non-destructive surface analysis which meets the requirements of semiconductor and optical industries. This paper demonstrates that the sensor is suitable for defect estimation on the studied surface without topography reconstruction, where defect is considered as a dimple or a mound on the wafer surface. Based on the development, {{it is possible to}} reduce the evaluation time for the measurements by the reduction of both processing time for topography calculation and the number of acquired images. The method judges whether the surface of the studied sample is defect-free. That is a key for fast and reliable inspection. The Makyoh image shows the light distribution of the beam reflected from the surface. The images of bare wafers show unevenly alternate bright and dark areas. These areas appear due to the focusing and defocusing of the wave front and are caused by the local surface defects. The intensity changes are qualitatively interpreted {{with the help of the}} geometrical optics, and the maximum curvature of the defects on the studied surface is roughly estimated. Furthermore, the measurements of the sample rotated underneath the fixed sensor prove that the intensity changes are the result of the surface shape and not due to the aberration in the optical system.

To underpin areal surface manufacturing, a traceable measurement infrastructure is necessary. In this thesis a practical realisation of areal surface traceability is presented, which includes the development of: a primary in-strument, methodologies for using the primary instrument to calibrate material measure-ment standards used as standard transfer artefacts, and the process of transferring this traceability to industrial users of stylus and optical instruments. The design of the primary instrument and its complex measurement uncertainty model are described, including detailed analysis of the input parameters of the uncertainty model and their effect on the co-ordinate measurements of the instrument. The development of the process of transferring the areal traceability to industrial users lead to a set of metrological characteristics applicable to all areal surface topography measuring instruments. The set of metrological characteristics, now included into international stand-ards, comprise of: measurement noise, <b>flatness</b> <b>deviation,</b> amplification, linearity and squareness, and resolution.

We resolve this complication by performing PCA CCD-by-CCD, and interpolating the basis functions using conventional polynomials. We demonstrate that this PSF correction scheme reduces the residual PSF ellipticity correlation below 10 ^- 7 over the cosmologically interesting scale. From a null test using HST/UDF galaxy images without input shear, we verify that the amplitude of the galaxy ellipticity correlation function, after the PSF correction, is consistent with the shot noise set by the finite number of objects. Therefore, we conclude that the current optical design and specification for the accuracy in the focal plane assembly are sufficient to enable the control of the PSF systematics required for weak-lensing science with the LSST.

If for a processing accuracy control it is sufficient to obtain the flatness deviation, as the maximum adjoining surface deviation, {{the choice of the}} adjoining surface as a zero reference datum deviation leads to considerable difficulties in creating devices and in particular devices for measuring size and shape variations. The flat surface is characterized by mutual arrangement of its points and can be represented by equation in the selected coordinate system. The objective of this work is to provide analytical construction of the vector field F, which describes the real surface with an appropriate approximation upon modelling the face milling of the flat surfaces of body parts in conditions of anisotropic rigidity of technological system. To determine the numerical value of shape and size deviation characteristics the average surfaces can serve a basis for the zero reference values of vectors.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} dynamic behaviour of structural joints which are both loaded, and excited, normal to the joint interface. Since the forces on joints are transmitted through their interface, the surface texture of joints was carefully examined. A computerised surface measuring system was developed and computer programs were written. Surface flatness was functionally defined, measured and quantised into a form suitable for the theoretical calculation of the joint stiffness. Dynamic stiffness and damping were measured at various preloads for a range of joints with different surface textures. Dry clean and lubricated joints were tested and the results indicated an increase in damping for the lubricated joints of between 30 to 100 times. A theoretical model for the computation of the stiffness of dry clean joints was built. The model is based on the theory that the elastic recovery of joints is due to the recovery of the material behind the loaded asperities. It takes into account, in a quantitative manner, the <b>flatness</b> <b>deviations</b> present on the surfaces of the joint. The theoretical results were found to be in good agreement with those measured experimentally. It was also found that theoretical assessment of the joint stiffness could be carried out using a different model based on the recovery of loaded asperities into a spherical form. Stepwise procedures are given in order to design a joint having a particular stiffness. A theoretical model for the loss factor of dry clean joints was built.
