In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually <b>fix</b> <b>wood</b> planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|R

50|$|The Enchanted Valley Chalet is a 2-1/2 story hewn-log {{structure}} with a gabled roof covered in cedar shakes. The exterior walls are entirely constructed of silver fir logs hewn {{on three sides}} and notched at the corners with dovetail diagonal-cut joints. The first story logs are 10” in diameter, and the upper story logs are 8” in diameter. Originally, the smaller logs were cut from the tops of larger logs to conserve materials. Several logs on the northeast and northwest walls were replaced in 1980 and 2010. The southwest façade has a front porch and overhang roof supported by log poles. It has been replaced several times and was reconstructed to its original configuration in 2010. The chalet has roof has a 12/12 pitch covered with 36” cedar shakes with a 24” exposure to the weather. The roof is framed with round log rafters, collar ties, and split cedar purlins. The original shakes were split from trees on site, but these were replaced in 1981 and 2010.The roof features a gable dormer on the northwest side. Windows on all exterior walls are of four different types including: 3-over-1 and 6-over-1, double-hung sash windows; wood sash sliders, and four light <b>fixed</b> <b>wood</b> sashes.

50|$|The Teflon {{bushings}} {{were intended}} to lessen friction problems that might occur because of seasonal humidity changes, but they themselves caused excessive friction.

5000|$|Targes are {{generally}} round shields between 18 in and 21 in (45-55 cm) in diameter. The {{inside of the}} targe was formed from two very thin layers of flat wooden boards, with the grain of each layer {{at right angles to}} the other. They were fixed together with small wooden pegs, forming plywood. The front was covered with a tough cowhide, which was often decorated with embossed Celtic style patterns. This was <b>fixed</b> to the <b>wood</b> with many brass, or in some cases, silver, nails, and occasionally brass plates were also fixed to the face for strength and decoration.

Recently, many countries intend to bound or limit the use of chromium salts. Therefore, experts looking for other suitable compounds to fix copper and amines seem to be suitable substitutes for chromium. We report about our investigations of interactions between copper(II) octanoate and ethanolamine (C 2 H 7 NO, 2 -aminoethanole) and wood or its components.

30|$|Wood ash, {{in other}} words the {{combustion}} residue of wood fuels, is mainly composed of inorganic components with unburned carbon. The first motivation of our study is to examine whether the wood ash could be put back into timbers again within the space of wood cells {{for the purpose of}} making the wood-inorganic mineral composites. In the previous studies, several wood-inorganic compound complexes have been developed with chemical agents to enhance the fire and decay resistances of the wood [5 – 8]. We, therefore, intend to produce a new composite material by combining the wood ash within woods. However, the ash does not fit in so easily with woods because it has high alkaline and hence causes striking discoloration of the combined woods. So in this study, the wood ash was preliminarily converted into hydroxyapatite (HAp; Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2) solution by a reaction with phosphoric acid, and then it was penetrated and <b>fixed</b> into <b>woods</b> to make the HAp-wood composites.|$|R
40|$|Boron {{compounds}} {{are used}} as wood preservatives as they are both fungicide and insecticide, relatively inexpensive and environmentally acceptable. Nevertheless, {{in the field of}} wood protection, borates are only used for indoor non-exposed applications or in association with other biocides, due to their main disadvantage of being readily leachable from treated wood. To overcome this problem, boric acid was <b>fixed</b> into <b>wood</b> with condensed tannins and hexamine through a non-formaldehyde emission polymer network. Treated mixtures were tested with different proportions of mimosa tannins and hexamine, with and without co-added boric acid. The treated beech samples were leached and tested according to European Standard EN 113 against Pycnoporus sanguineus in tropical conditions. The systems had minimal boron depletion and good fungal decay efficacy, meeting the efficacy requirements of EN 113. Thus, these associations could be envisaged to treat timber with insufficient natural durability for above ground outdoor use, and for a long service-life of the wooden commodities.
