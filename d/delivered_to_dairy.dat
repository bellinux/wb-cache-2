40|$|In modern dairy farms, {{optimization}} {{of feeding}} {{is critical to}} maintain animal health, lower impact and maximise profitability. However, large feed and forage variability reduce consistency of composition of diet <b>delivered</b> <b>to</b> <b>dairy</b> cows. A feeding management plan must implement a program of feed sampling and analysis (St-Pierre and Cobanov, 2007), that ensure small variation of nutrients in diets. Traditional reference wet chemistry methods are accurate, but expensive, they can be implemented at specialized labs with relative long time of response. As {{an alternative to the}} traditional methods, near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) has received an increasing attention, with a large use in many commercial and private labs. Proficiency programs (like the National Forage Testing Association) have proven that NIR can be accurate in respect to reference method in the quantification of organic feed nutrients. The paper will highlight the advantages of the use of NIR in feeding program in term of precision feeding and animal performance. It will also evaluate the challenges of on-site analysis for dairy farm as well as for biogas plants. The paper will also briefly cover the alternative methods for the determination of mineral nutrients with rapid and non-destructive methods, like x-ray fluorescence (XRF) ...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} was to analyze {{the main trends in}} the milking {{livestock}} and milk production in Romania during the period 20072 - 012 and to establish the forecast for the 2013 - 2015 horizon, based on the empirical data provided by the National Institute of Statistics and Eurostat. The methods used in this study were: the fixed basis index, average change method, and comparison method. While the number of dairy cows declined by 30 %, accounting for 1, 265 thou heads in 2012, the number of female sheep and goats increased by 45 % reaching 8, 726 thou heads. The farm size is very small, 1 - 2 cows/farm for 59 % holdings, 3 - 9 cows/farm for 38 % holdings and over 10 cows for only 3 % farms and the extensive technology is the most practiced one. Milk production declined by 20 %, accounting for 44, 172 thou hl in 2012, of which 86 % is produced by cows. Milk production value contributes by 32 % to agricultural production value. Cow milk yield is small, only 3, 417 kg/cow in 2012 and in decline. Only about 22 % of milk is <b>delivered</b> <b>to</b> <b>dairies</b> and the remaining is consumed on farm and directly sold in the market because of the low milk farm gate price and milk quality. The producer's price is the lowest in the EU, accounting for Euro 29. 84 / 100 milk kg. As a conclusion, to rehabilitate the sector of milk producing, the farmers' associative forms are required to join the capital and financial resources, to apply for EU funding to modernize the farms, to produce a higher production and assure a high profitability and competitiveness...|$|R

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{phasing out}} the use of {{antimicrobials}} 23 Danish organic dairy producers from the same organic dairy company participated in Stable School farmer groups from February 2004 to March 2005 {{in order to go}} through a common learning and development process towards their common goal. Data on production and herd health were evaluated from two years before to three years after the start of the Stable Schools. For comparison, data was collected from the remaining 35 herds <b>delivering</b> <b>to</b> the same <b>dairy</b> company, 118 organic <b>dairy</b> herds <b>delivering</b> <b>to</b> other <b>dairies</b> and 115 conventional herds. On average, the project herds were smaller with lower production and had half the incidence rate of mastitis treatment than the organic herds from other dairies {{before the start of the}} project. The incidence rate of mastitis treatments was reduced considerably from 20 treatments per 100 cow years to 10 treatments per 100 cow years after the project period. Somatic cell count (SCC) and scores for acute and chronic intramammary infections did not change significantly during the study period, and milk production increased at the same rate as in the other herd groups. The incidence rate of mastitis treatments or the reduction of the incidence rate could be related to the herd SCC or the prevalence of blind quarters. The incidence rates of locomotive disorders and reproductive disorders were lower in the project herds compared with herds from other dairies before the project start, and the differences increased during the project period though the reduction of the incidence rates in the project herds was not statistically significant. It is concluded that the farmers participating in the Stable Schools managed to reduce the use of antimicrobials in their herds also after the project period without apparent negative effects on production and udder and herd health...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{production}} in Brazil is widespread {{all over the}} country in properties that feature a form of subsistence production, without any technique, up to properties with advanced technology.

30|$|While {{farmers who}} stopped practising forest grazing {{generally}} chose to replace their mountain cattle with {{larger and more}} productive lowland cattle, those who continued with forest grazing generally did not. The main reason was that farmers who kept up the tradition of forest pasturing remained dependent on the mountain cattle breed's adaptiveness to its environment. Other reasons listed by the farmers interviewed were that mountain cattle milk is more suitable for home-made cheese production owing to its higher fat content, while lowland cattle is ideal as drinking milk and suits those farmers <b>delivering</b> milk <b>to</b> commercial <b>dairies.</b> Some simply argued that mountain cows are more beautiful, more trustworthy or have gentler ways or a more independent and intriguing mind.

40|$|The Murang'a District is {{situated}} in central Kenya and is a highland area with a high potential for dairy production. This study was carried out to evaluate the performance of smallholder dairy farms by analysing available data and by simulation modelling. Eighteen case farms were selected non-randomly {{on the basis of}} differences in reported milk production, based on the amount of milk <b>delivered</b> <b>to</b> a <b>dairy</b> society. Data of these smallholder dairy farms were collected by means of a questionnaire and included all farm resources and enterprises. The Technology Impact Evaluation Simulator (TIES), a Monte Carlo computer simulation model, provides a method for evaluating the financial and economic impacts of technology changes on a whole-farm basis, and explicitly incorporates risk. The simulation of each case farm in the Murang'a District with TIES gave an indication of the variation in economic performance of these farms. A sensitivity analysis on the economic terms pointed out the key indicators for successful farm performance. The smallholder dairy farms investigated differed in farm performance—itself strongly influenced by the performance of the dairy enterprise of the farm. Milk production and calving interval were the main indicators describing the performance of the dairy enterprise and, through that, overall farm performance. Both milk production and calving interval were influenced by the amount of concentrates fed—suggesting that feeding concentrates is an important indicator of high farm performance. The influence of health-services costs on farm performance was not significant. Off-farm income also influenced overall farm performance; farms heavily dependent on off-farm income were often inefficient in their dairy enterprise...|$|R

40|$|IFPRI in {{collaboration}} with the Laiterie du Berger (milk factory in Richard Toll, Senegal), the GRET (international NGO), University Gaston Berger (UGB) in Saint Louis, Senegal and the Cellule de Lutte contre la Malnutrition (CLM) conducted an impact evaluation of a dairy value chain program in Senegal. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess if a dairy value chain could be used to distribute a micronutrient-fortified yoghurt (MNFY), to improve hemoglobin concentration and decrease anemia prevalence among preschool children at the individual level, in a remote area in Northern Senegal. Delivery of the MNFY was conditional on regular delivery of milk <b>to</b> the <b>dairy</b> cooperative supplying the MNFY and collecting milk from milk producing households. A cluster randomized control trial was used to compare children 24 to 59 months of age at baseline from households who received the MNFY coupled to a behavior change communication campaign (BCC) focusing on anemia prevention, to children from a control group (receiving BCC only) after one year. Randomization was at the level of the family concession (households from extended family). Households eligible were those having a child of the target age at baseline and willing <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> milk <b>to</b> the <b>dairy</b> factory. The intervention started in February 2013 and lasted one year. A baseline survey was conducted in January 2013, two follow-up surveys in April and September 2013 and an endline survey in January 2014. Data were collected with questionnaires at the household, maternal and child level, during the baseline and endline surveys. The household questionnaire collected household-level information on socioeconomic characteristics, household composition and on household food insecurity.
