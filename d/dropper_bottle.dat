Smaller drop volumes are produced by ethanol, hydrocortisone butyrate 1 % in ethanol, cocamidopropyl betaine 1 % aq., and propylene glycol 30 % aq. Filter paper saturation volumes using distilled water are 16 - 19 muL in standard Finn Chambers and 29 - 35 muL in IQ Chambers. Ethanol saturation volumes are slightly lower. Previously recommended volumes of application for aqueous allergens of 15 muL for standard Finn Chambers and 25 muL for IQ Chambers (slightly below the filter paper saturation points) are appropriate. Selection of <b>dropper</b> <b>bottles</b> should consider drop volume reproducibility, differing drop volumes for different allergens, and the patch test chamber system being used...|$|R
2500|$|Opium {{tincture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent oral formulations of morphine available by prescription.

40|$|XIDATION OF ORGANIC MATERIAL as a {{preliminary}} to determination of iodine, whether by wet or dry methods, entails loss of iodine if in-sufficient organic matter is present during the reaction (1, 2, 3). In blood serum, the organic content suffices {{to prevent this}} loss when the amount of iodine in the specimen is in the range found in physiological or patho-logical sera, 0 - 30 pg. / 100 ml., as has been repeatedly shown in recovery experiments (4, 5, 6, 7). When the iodine content of serum exceeds 500 ig. / 100 ml., as is sometimes the case after administration of iodinated radiopaque media, or other contact with iodinated medication, iodine may be volatilized in the ashing stage of the analysis, to be reabsorbed in other tubes. Such cross-contamination invalidates the entire series of tests, with loss of analyst’s time and delay of reports. To avoid delays caused {{by the presence of}} such cross-contaminators, a simple method of screening them out in advance was desirable. In connection with the quantitative dry-ashing procedure in use in this laboratory (7), the cross-contaminator exclusion test described below has proven satisfactory. It requires only 1 drop of serum, and adds no more than 30 minutes of operating time to a series of 20 - 40 PBI deter-minations.

50|$|There are {{two main}} strands of the modern approach. One {{is based on the}} idea that many of the {{experiments}} associated with general chemistry (acids and bases, oxidation and reduction, electrochemistry, etc.) can be carried out in equipment much simpler (injection <b>bottles,</b> <b>dropper</b> <b>bottles,</b> syringes, wellplates, plastic pipettes) and therefore cheaper than the traditional glassware in a laboratory, thus enabling the expansion of the laboratory experiences of students in large classes and to introduce laboratory work into institutions too poorly equipped for standard-type work. Pioneering development in this area was carried out by Egerton C. Grey (1928), Mahmoud K. El-Marsafy (1989) in Egypt, Stephen Thompson in the US and others. A further application of these ideas was the devising by Bradley of the Radmaste kits in South Africa, designed to make effective chemical experiments possible in developing countries in schools that lack the technical services (electricity, running water) taken for granted in many places.The other strand is the introduction of this approach into synthetic work, mainly in organic chemistry. Here the crucial breakthrough was achieved by Mayo, Pike and Butcher and by Williamson who demonstrated that inexperienced students were able to carry out organic syntheses on a few tens of milligrams, a skill previously thought to require years of training and experience. These approaches were accompanied by the introduction of some specialised equipment, which was subsequently simplified by Breuer without great loss of versatility.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we devised {{a method to}} create smaller eye drops of the {{glaucoma}} medication timolol maleate by altering the dropper tip design and changing the physical properties of the formulation. Most ocular diseases are treated with topical application of eye drops. After instillation of an eye drop, typically, less than 5 % of the applied drug penetrates the cornea and reaches the intraocular tissues; the major fraction of the instilled drug is absorbed and enters the systemic circulation. Ophthalmic solutions are available in multidose or single-dose glass/plastic <b>dropper</b> <b>bottles</b> that deliver drops with a volume that ranges from 25 μL to 70 μL (average 40 μL). Because of the low capacity of the precorneal area, the optimal drop volume is about 20 μL; with larger volumes there is the risk of adverse systemic effects due to absorption of the drug via the nasal mucosa. Thus, both from the biopharmaceutical and economic point of view, drops of only 5 - 15 mL volume should be instilled into the eye. In this present work we devised a method {{to reduce the size}} of the drop by inserting a glass capillary tube into the dropper tip and by changing the physical properties of the formulation (by altering the concentration of Tween 80 ™, i. e., 0. 05 % and 0. 1 % of Tween 80 ™). We measured the drop sizes of the different timolol eye drop formulations available in the market and estimated the yearly cost of the medications. Our timolol maleate formulation with 0. 1 % concentration of Tween 80 ™ delivered through the dropper tip with the inserted glass capillary was shown to be better than the other formulations available in the market in terms of ability to deliver smaller drops, meaning that each bottle would last longer and that the yearly cost of treatment would be lower...|$|R

The weight of the eye drops were compared with the drop weight of water and the model solutions 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % benzalkonium chloride. Direct correlation proportion was found out between the surface tension and the weight of the drops. When the dispensing angle decreased from 90 ř to 45 řthe weight of the drops significantly decreased too. When the dropper tip was wetted the effective circuit of the dropper tip produced larger drops increasing variability of drop weigth together with the amout of applied drugs.

Methods: Eye <b>dropper</b> <b>bottle</b> models, solution models (filtrate water/surfactant solution) and a dispensing time measuring apparatus were prepared to measure the dispensing time. Results: With filtrate water and pressure thrust load of 0. 3 MPa, the dispensing time significantly increased from 1. 1 &plusmn; 0. 5 seconds to 4. 6 &plusmn; 1. 1 seconds depending on the decrease of inner aperture diameters from 0. 4 mm to 0. 2 mm (P &lt; 0. 0001). When using the bottle models with inner aperture diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger, the dispensing time became constant. The dispensing time using surfactant solution showed the same tendency as above. When pressure thrust load was large (0. 07 MPa), the solution flew out continuously with inner aperture diameters of 0. 4 mm or larger and the dispensing time could not be measured. The inner aperture diameter most strongly explained the variation of the dispensing time in both the content solutions in the multiple linear regression analysis (filtrate water: 46 %, R 2 = 0. 462, surfactant solution: 56 %, R 2 = 0. 563). Conclusions: Among content solutions and container structures, the dispensing time was mostly influenced by the diameter of the inner aperture of bottles.

40|$|Nebulized {{bronchodilator}} {{solutions are}} available in the United States as both nonsterile and sterile-filled products. Sulfites, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), or chlorobutanol are added to nonsterile products to prevent bacterial growth. Bronchoconstriction from inhaled BAC is cumulative, prolonged, and correlates directly with basal airway responsiveness. The multi-dose <b>dropper</b> <b>bottle</b> of albuterol sulfate solution contains 50  μg BAC per/ 2. 5 mg of albuterol, which may be below or at the lower limit of the threshold dose for bronchoconstriction. However, with repeated albuterol nebulization, the effect can be additive and cumulative, often exceeding the bronchoconstriction threshold. We report a case of a 17 years old patient, who received 32 mg of BAC via nebulization over a period of 3. 5 days that probably caused persistent bronchospasm evidenced by failure to improve clinically and to increase peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) from 125 L/min (27 % of predicted value) to 300 L/min (68 % of predicted value) within 2 hours of withdrawing BAC. The patient's respiratory status and PEFR improved dramatically once the nebulization solution was switched to BAC free lev-albuterol solution.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of an eye drop combining osmoprotectants, carboxymethylcellulose and hyaluronic acid (O/CMC/HA) in reducing symptomatic, moderate to severe dry eye, compared with HA. Methods: In this investigator-masked, randomised study, patients instilled 1 – 2 drops/eye of O/CMC/HA or HA (2 – 6 times/day) for 3 months. Primary endpoint: mean change in Global Ocular Staining Score (GOSS) from baseline at day 35. Noninferiority of O/CMC/HA was tested in the per-protocol population; if achieved, superiority was tested in the intent-to-treat population. Secondary efficacy endpoints: mean change from baseline in GOSS, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Schirmer score, tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal/conjunctival staining, conjunctival hyperaemia, symptoms, and patient/investigator assessments. Results: Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (n= 40 each). O/CMC/HA was noninferior (and not superior) to HA based on similar GOSS reductions from baseline at day 35 and month 3 in both groups (P= 0. 778, day 35, per-protocol population). Overall, O/CMC/HA and HA provided similar reductions in OSDI, Schirmer score, TBUT, corneal staining and hyperaemia from baseline at 35 days (P≥ 0. 155). More patients reported less severe stinging/burning, sandiness/grittiness, and painful/sore eyes at month 3 with O/CMC/HA (P≤ 0. 039), and more rated the <b>dropper</b> <b>bottle</b> easy to use (87. 5 %), compared with HA (46. 2 %; P= 0. 002). Other patient and investigator assessments were similar between groups. O/CMC/HA and HA were well tolerated.

40|$|M. Tech. Verrucae vulgaris, {{commonly}} known as warts are benign growths due to infection with papillomaviruses, which occur mainly on the hands and feet (Gawkrodger, 2002). Verrucae are caused by a virus, the human papillomavirus (HPV) (Fitzpatrick and Aeling, 2001). Verrucae are a common skin problem, which account for approximately 5 %- 10 % of the skin conditions seen in patients in many countries. The peak incidence ranging {{between the ages of}} 12 and 16, rarely being found in infants and the elderly (Gibbs and Degreef, 1997). Thuja occidentalis is a common homoeopathic remedy that has historically been used for the treatment of wart-like excrescences on cutaneous surfaces of the skin (Vermeulen, 1994). Based on homoeopathic principles, the toxicological symptoms of this remedy gives the therapeutic indications for which it is prescribed. Ricini oleum, {{commonly known}} as castor oil, for which there is an unknown mode of action, has been recommended for various cutaneous complaints, when applied externally (Grieves and Leyel, 1998). To date insufficient research has been conducted to confirm the effects of Thuja occidentalis and Ricini oleum on verrucae vulgaris. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of homoeopathically prepared, externally applied, Thuja occcidentalis 6 cH and Ricini oleum 6 cH, in the treatment of common warts, verrucae vulgaris. The study was a contextual, placebo controlled, double-blind research study. Forty-five participants ranging from 5 to 60 years old were recruited for this study. Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected (Appendix A). Suitable participants completed a consent form, explaining all aspects of the study (Appendix B). Participants were required to complete a participant profile form, as well as an initial subjective questionnaire after which they were randomly placed into one of three treatment groups (Appendix C). Each participant was given a 25 ml amber glass <b>dropper</b> <b>bottle,</b> which contained either Thuja occidentalis 6 cH, Ricini oleum 6 cH or the placebo. The placebo group was shared with another researcher conducting a similar study. The solutions were administered topically; two drops twice daily v and treatment lasted for ten days. A maximum of two verrucae were treated throughout the study and these lesions were kept covered at all times with a waterproof elastoplaster. Changes in symptoms were documented according to a questionnaire (Appendix D). The verrucae being treated were evaluated on three occasions; one day prior to commencement of the clinical trial, on day five of the trial, as well as on day ten. Each assessment involved photographs and physical measurements of the verrucae, as well as a subjective questionnaire, that the participant was requested to complete. The results were statistically analysed in terms of change in length, width and height of the verrucae. Results for the categorical responses were cross-tabulated with the respective treatments and chi-square tests were performed to compare efficacy of treatments. For the measured responses, the Friedman two-way analysis of verrucae was used to compare the responses to each treatment i. e. before, during and after each treatment. Based on the outcomes of this study, it was revealed that all three treatment groups responded with significant results, in terms of a decrease in overall size of the verrucae lesions. Two of the experimental groups, namely the Thuja occidentalis 6 cH and the Ricini oleum 6 cH groups, illustrated an overall decrease in size of verrucae from the start to the end of the clinical trial. The placebo group yielded the smallest decrease in overall size of verrucae, during this study. None of the participants noticed a change in their emotional status or physical status, while participating in the clinical trial. The duration of the trial was not sufficiently long enough. In addition, further research into this topic is required to assess whether the observations that were made in this study would result in eventual cure of the condition...|$|E
