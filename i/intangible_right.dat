5000|$|Since {{at least}} 1941, {{particularly}} in the 1970s and 1980s, and prior to 1987, the courts had interpreted the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes as criminalizing not only schemes to defraud victims of money and property, but also schemes to defraud victims of intangible rights such as the [...] "honest services" [...] of a public official. In 1987, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in McNally v.

40|$|Conceptualising {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} over genetically modified vs. non-genetically modified crops {{in the frame}} of property rights, one can see that economic valorisation dynamics and aspirations are working on both sides, within two differently evolving agri-food paradigms, with biotechnology companies propagating intellectual property rights on seeds and crops within a productivist strategy, and with retailer chains, non-governmental organisations and farmer associations claiming generic names and labels as public property rights on identity-preserved crops within a consumerist strategy. The analysis shows that the direction and strength of the dynamics is highly dependent on the physical intricacies and social relations implicated in these two types of intangible property.

5000|$|Justice White {{wrote the}} opinion of the Court, holding that the federal mail fraud statute only {{protected}} money and property, not the public's <b>intangible</b> <b>right</b> to honest government:Rather than construe the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials, we read 1341 as limited in scope to the protection of property rights. If Congress desires to go further, it must speak more clearly than it has.The law, passed in 1872 during a postal law recodification, originally only criminalized [...] "any scheme or artifice to defraud." [...] In March 1909, Congress added another clause, reading [...] "or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises." [...] In McNally, the Court therefore concluded that Congress intended the mail fraud statute's scope to be limited to protecting money and property, citing its ruling in United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., which stated that [...] "when choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite. We should not derive criminal outlawry from some ambiguous implication." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held in United States v. Frost {{that private}} {{individuals}} could be also convicted of honest services fraud. Two professors at the University of Tennessee Space Institute, Walter Frost and Robert Eugene Turner, were also {{president and vice}} president, respectively, of FWG Associates, a private atmospheric science research firm. Frost and Turner gave FWG reports to two of their students, one a doctoral candidate employed by the Department of the Army and one a master's degree candidate employed by NASA, allowing them to plagiarize {{an overwhelming majority of}} the reports for their respective dissertations. They also allowed another doctoral candidate, employed by NASA, to submit a dissertation which was mostly written by one of their employees at FWG. Their aim was to secure federal contracts with the agencies employing these students. All three students received their degrees, facilitated by Frost and Turner. In addition to many other charges, Frost and Turner were convicted of three counts of mail fraud for defrauding the University of Tennessee of their honest services as employees. On appeal, Frost and Turner argued that § 1346 did not apply to them because they were not public servants. The court disagreed, ruling that [...] "private individuals, such as Frost and Turner, may commit mail fraud by breaching a fiduciary duty and thereby depriving the person or entity to which the duty is owed of the <b>intangible</b> <b>right</b> to the honest services of that individual." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, {{like the}} Fourth Circuit in Vinyard, noted the {{existence}} of the two tests, but unlike the Fourth Circuit, it opted to use the [...] "materiality" [...] test (describing it as [...] "arising out of fundamental principles of the law of fraud" [...] and critiquing the alternative as [...] "designed simply to limit the scope" [...] of the law). It applied this test to the case at hand, United States v. Rybicki. The defendants were two personal injury lawyers, Thomas Rybicki and Fredric Grae, in the state of New York; both were convicted of twenty counts of mail fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy. The fraud charges pertained to a scheme to make illegal payments to insurance claims adjusters with the intent of inducing the adjusters to expedite the settlement of certain claims; Rybicki and Grae made such payments in at least twenty cases. As the acceptance of such payments by the adjusters was against the insurance companies' policies, Rybicki and Grae had defrauded those insurance companies of the honest services of their employees. Such was the basis for the successful fraud prosecution. The court affirmed the conviction, determining that all of the necessary elements for the crime of honest services fraud to have occurred were present, including material misrepresentation. The court defined the crime thus:The phrase [...] "scheme or artifice defraud by depriving another of the <b>intangible</b> <b>right</b> of honest services," [...] in the private sector context, means a scheme or artifice to use the mails or wires to enable an officer or employee of a private entity (or a person in a relationship that gives rise to a duty of loyalty comparable to that owed by employees to employers) purporting to act for and in the interests of his or her employer (or of the other person to whom the duty of loyalty is owed) secretly to act in his or her or the defendant's own interests instead, accompanied by a material misrepresentation made or omission of information disclosed to the employer or other person.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the law of}} bribery {{may look}} profoundly underinclusive, the push to expand it usually should be resisted. This Article traces the history of two {{competing}} concepts of bribery—the “intent to influence” concept (a concept initially applied only to gifts given to judges) and the “illegal contract” concept. It argues that, when applied to officials other than unelected judges, “intent to influence” is now an untenable standard. This standard cannot be taken literally. This Article defends the Supreme Court’s refusal to treat campaign contributions as bribes {{in the absence of}} an “explicit” quid pro quo and its refusal to read a statute criminalizing deprivations of “the <b>intangible</b> <b>right</b> of honest services” as scuttling the quid pro quo requirement. While recognizing that the “stream of benefits” metaphor can be compatible with this requirement, it cautions against allowing the requirement to degenerate into a “one hand washes the other” or “favoritism” standard. This Article maintains that specific, ex ante regulations of the sort commonly found in ethical codes and campaign finance regulations provide a better way to limit corruption than bribery laws, but it warns that even these regulations should not prohibit all practices that may be the functional equivalent of bribery. This Article concludes by speculating about whether the efforts of federal prosecutors to reduce corruption over the past sixty years have given us better government...|$|E
40|$|Public officials, as well {{as public}} employees, owe the public the {{fiduciary}} duty of providing their honest services. The mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. § 1341, proscribes using the mails to carry out “any scheme or artifice to defraud. ” It further defines, in § 1346, “any scheme or artifice to defraud” to include “a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the <b>intangible</b> <b>right</b> of honest services. ” In passing these statutes, Congress never defined the terms “scheme or artifice,” “intangible right” or “honest services. ” Because of this failure, the appellate courts have adopted limiting principles to prevent minor breaches of fiduciary duties from becoming federal crimes. The Seventh Circuit adopted the limiting principle “misuse of office for private gain” in United States v. Bloom. Recently, the court refined the Bloom standard in United States v. Thompson holding that “neither an increase in salary for doing what one 2 ̆ 7 s superiors deem a good job, nor an addition to one 2 ̆ 7 s peace of mind, is a ‘private benefit. ’” This holding conflicts with previous case law from the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, concluding that one’s job or the prospect of future employment can be a private gain under Bloom. Because the Seventh Circuit appears to have distinguished Thompson from the cases in the Northern District of Illinois rather than overruling them, the court may have inadvertently created a loophole through which public employees can engage in “subtle schemes” and not be punished under § 1346. This Note concludes that the Seventh Circuit could have distinguished Thompson from the Northern District cases {{on the grounds that}} a “scheme,” as defined in its normal usage, existed is those cases, but did not exist in Thompson. The Note further argues that had the court made a threshold determination of whether or not a “scheme” existed in Thompson, it would not have had to reach the private gain issue, thereby preventing the problems raised after Thompson...|$|E
