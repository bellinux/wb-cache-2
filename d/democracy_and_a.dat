5|$|Canada is {{a federal}} {{parliamentary}} <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It {{is one of the}} world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has {{had a significant impact on}} its economy and culture.|$|E
5|$|Organised prehistoric {{cultures}} began developing {{on current}} Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period. Its ancient history saw {{the presence of}} the Thracians, Greeks, Persians, Celts, Romans, Goths, Alans and Huns. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages. With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 {{led to the formation of}} the Third Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> market-based economy.|$|E

25|$|In New England, Town {{meetings}} are often used, especially in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, {{with a local}} direct <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> state government which is representative.

25|$|Although {{responsible}} {{government had}} existed in Canada since 1848, Britain continued to set its foreign and defence policies {{until the end}} of the First World War. The passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 recognized that Canada had become co-equal with the United Kingdom. After the Constitution was patriated in 1982, the final vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament were removed. Canada currently consists of ten provinces and three territories and is a parliamentary <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state.|$|E
25|$|Peter H. Russell, a {{professor}} emeritus {{of political science at}} the University of Toronto, suggested that if Harper had sought a dissolution, the governor general would have had to consider carefully the reasonableness of the request. In Russell's view, the viceroy's primary concern is to protect parliamentary <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dissolution of parliament would have necessitated an election only two months after the preceding one; repeated short term elections are not healthy for the system. In such a case, with a reasonably viable coalition available, Jean might then refuse Harper's advice to dissolve parliament (forcing him to resign under constitutional precedent), and invite Dion to form a government.|$|E
25|$|Modern Romania {{was formed}} in 1859 through a {{personal}} union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. During World War II, Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, fighting {{side by side with}} the Wehrmacht until 1944, when it joined the Allied powers and faced occupation by the Red Army forces. Romania lost several territories, of which Northern Transylvania was regained after the war. Following the war, Romania became a socialist republic and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a transition towards <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> capitalist market economy.|$|E

25|$|In Stockholm Paasikivi strove for Swedish defence guarantees, {{alternatively}} {{a defensive}} alliance or a defensive union between Finland and Sweden. Since the Civil War, {{relations between the}} Swedes and Finns had been frosty. The revolutionary turmoil {{at the end of}} World War I had led to Parliamentarism in Sweden, increased Swedish <b>democracy,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dominant role for the Swedish Social Democrats. In Finland, however, the result had been a disastrous Civil War and a total defeat for Socialism. At the same time that Paasikivi arrived in Stockholm, it became known that Finnish President Svinhufvud retained his aversion to parliamentarism; and (after pressure from Paasikivi's National Coalition Party) had declined to appoint a cabinet with Social Democrats as Ministers. This didn't improve Paasikivi's reputation among the Swedish Social Democrats dominating the government, who were sufficiently suspicious due to his association with Finland's Monarchist orientation in 1918, and the failed Lapua coup in 1932.|$|E
25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E

He used the station to advertise a new political party, the Beehive Democratic Society Party, and stood in the 1998 parliamentary election. According to the Asia Times, his campaign only won him [...] "a reputation as an eccentric, spouting Buddhist philosophy, pleas for <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> personal campaign for attention." [...] After failing to be elected, Sonando dissolved his party, but continued broadcasting on Beehive Radio as an independent journalist.|$|E

Rose, who had long been on bad terms with several of his former bandmates, wrote that the ceremony [...] "doesn't appear to be somewhere I'm actually wanted or respected." [...] He subsequently joined his band in residencies at The Joint in Las Vegas in 2012 and 2014, as part of the Appetite for Democracy Tour celebrating the anniversaries of Appetite for Destruction and Chinese Democracy.

500|$|Ratsiraka's dwindling {{popularity}} in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established {{under the leadership of}} Albert Zafy (1993–96), who {{went on to win the}} 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the Third Republic (1992–2010). The new Madagascar constitution established a multi-party <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. [...] The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade. Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, Norbert Ratsirahonana, was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.|$|E

A staunch right winger and free market advocate, she became a bitter opponent of the labour movement and Livingstone. Following the electoral defeat, Livingstone told Socialist Organiser that the blame lay solely with the [...] "Labour government's policies" [...] and the anti-democratic attitude of Callaghan and the Parliamentary Labour Party, calling for greater party <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> turn towards a socialist platform. This was a popular message among many Labour activists amassed under the SCLV.

The head of the [...] "Bennite left", Benn became [...] "an inspiration and a prophet" [...] to Livingstone; the two became the best known left-wingers in Labour.|$|E
