The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first from the full dilution tunnel and the second from the partial <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> and the partial <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (<b>full</b> <b>flow,</b> partial flow and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the <b>full</b> <b>flow</b> dilution tunnel.

40|$|AbstractGreenhouse Gas (GHG) {{emissions}} are {{a growing problem}} in the United States (US). Methane (CH 4) is a potent GHG produced by several stages of the natural gas sector. Current scrutiny focuses on the natural gas boom associated with unconventional shale gas; however, focus should still be given to conventional wells and outdated equipment. In an attempt to quantify these emissions, researchers modified an off-road utility terrain vehicle (UTV) to include a <b>Full</b> <b>Flow</b> Sampling <b>system</b> (FFS) for methane quantification. GHG emissions were measured from non-producing and remote low throughput natural gas components in the Marcellus region. Site audits were conducted at eleven locations and leaks were identified and quantified at seven locations including at a low throughput conventional gas and oil well, two out-of-service gathering compressors, a conventional natural gas well, a coalbed methane well, and two conventional and operating gathering compressors. No leaks were detected at the four remaining sites, {{all of which were}} coal bed methane wells.

40|$|Numerical {{methods are}} necessary, and are {{extremely}} important, in developing {{an understanding of}} the dynamics of multiphase flow of fluids in porous media applications to maximize hydrocarbon recovery as well as to simulate contaminant transport of soluble or insoluble species in groundwater contamination problems. This work deals with a problem very common in water-flooding process in petroleum reservoir to motivate the proposed modeling: the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluid phases. The system of equations which describe this type of flow is a coupled, highly nonlinear system of time-dependent partial differential equations. The equation for the invading fluid (e. g., water phase) is a convectiondominated, degenerate parabolic partial differential equation whose solutions typically exhibit sharp moving fronts (e. g., moving internal layers with strong gradients) and {{it is very difficult to}} approximate numerically. We propose a two-stage numerical method to describe the injection problem for a model of two-phase (water-oil) flow in a porous rock, taking into account both gravity and hysteresis effects for solving transport flow problems in porous media. Indeed, we also investigate the Riemann problem for the one-dimensional, purely hyperbolic system, associated to the full differential model problem at hand. Thus, the use of accurate numerical methods in conjunction with one-dimensional semi-analytical Riemann solutions might provide valuable insight into the qualitative solution behavior of the <b>full</b> nonlinear governing <b>flow</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
