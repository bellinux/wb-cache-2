5|$|Burton's death left Metallica's {{future in}} doubt. The three {{remaining}} members decided Burton would {{want them to}} carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam,</b> auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.|$|E

On their 1997 album High the song titles were designed with the font types/logos of famous bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Kiss, Van Halen, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Misfits, etc. {{to pay homage to}} those whom came before and inspired the band while it was coming up the ranks. The music was more experimental than before, and the album also featured the Lard cover song Fork Boy. Music video was released, Monster to follow-up.|$|R
5|$|One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian {{travel to}} the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the {{birthday}} of Prince Eric on a ship. Ariel instantly becomes enamored with Eric. A violent storm arrives, with {{a bolt of lightning}} striking the ship, engulfing it in flames and eventually destroying it, tossing Eric overboard. She rescues Eric and brings him to shore. Ariel sings to Eric, but immediately leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows {{to find a way to}} join him and his world. When Triton discovers Ariel's love for Eric, Triton confronts her in the grotto and destroys most of the artifacts with his trident. After Triton leaves, two eels named <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam</b> convince Ariel to visit Ursula, a sea witch.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Vanessa is {{actually}} Ursula in disguise, Scuttle informs Ariel of Ursula's plan to marry Eric while Sebastian informs Triton about Ursula's actions. Assisted by her friends, Ariel stops Eric's wedding to Ursula, destroying the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck and restoring Ariel's voice. Realizing that Ariel is {{the girl who}} saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets, and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid before Ursula kidnaps her. Triton furiously confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. Ursula tricks Triton into taking Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton {{is transformed into a}} polyp. Ursula steps forward as the new queen, but before she can use the trident, Eric intervenes with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to attack Eric, but inadvertently kills <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam</b> in the process. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions.|$|E

25|$|Noted {{producer}} Jim Diamond played bass from 1997 until 2004 {{and during}} that time Diamond also recorded and co-produced the Dirtbombs output with Mick Collins at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit. Troy Gregory (formerly of <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam,</b> Prong, and lead singer of The Witches and Troy Gregory & The Stepsisters) played bass from June 2004 to September 5, 2008, also constituting one of the longest runs of any Dirtbombs member: the four-year line-up of Collins, Pantano, Blackwell, Melina, and Gregory is the longest lasting Dirtbombs line-up to date.

25|$|In October, 2008, {{the band}} updated their website {{for the first}} time in several years. As part of the update, the band {{announced}} that they would embark on a European mini-tour in the summer of 2009. The reunited band, consisting of Chris Milnes, John Milnes, Dan Nastasi, Dave Neabore and Kevin Powers, made a United States appearance at Mexicali Live in Teaneck, New Jersey, on April 11, 2009, performing to a sold out crowd. In July, 2009, the band performed at the Rock for People and With Full Force festivals. The band made a second trip to Europe in late August to play a handful of festival dates with bands such as Municipal Waste, Gorefest, <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam,</b> Sodom and Martyr, before ending the tour with a string of dates with Superbutt. The European tour dates featured the lineup of Chris Milnes, Dan Nastasi, Mark DeBacker and Kevin Powers performing songs voted on, via the internet, by their fans. The band returned to Mexicali Live on December 11 to perform their final show of 2009. The show was a release party for Live At Mexicali 2009, a DVD and CD recording of the show held at the same location, the previous April.

50|$|Perhaps Wapping's {{greatest}} {{attraction is}} the Thames foreshore itself, and the venerable public houses that face onto it. A {{number of the}} 'watermen's stairs', such as Wapping Old Stairs and Pelican Stairs (by the Prospect of Whitby) give public access to a littoral zone (for the Thames is tidal at this point) littered with <b>flotsam,</b> <b>jetsam</b> <b>and</b> fragments of old dock installations. Understandably it is popular with amateur archaeologists and treasure hunters - it is surprisingly easy for even a casual visitor {{to pick up a}} centuries-old shard of pottery here.|$|R
500|$|Burton's {{body was}} cremated and the ashes {{scattered}} at the Maxwell Ranch. At the ceremony, the song [...] "Orion" [...] was played. The lyrics [...] "...cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home" [...] from [...] "To Live Is to Die" [...] are written on Burton's memorial stone. Shortly after Burton's death, Jason Newsted from <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam</b> became Metallica's new bassist, {{a position he}} held until his resignation in 2001. The role has since been filled by producer and studio musician Bob Rock and by the former bassist of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne, Robert Trujillo.|$|E
500|$|Korn began touring in the Sick of It All Tour, {{beginning}} on January 21, 1995, and ending in March 1995. Following the Sick of It All Tour, Korn joined the Danzig 4 Tour, including Danzig and Marilyn Manson. The tour lasted 3 months and was preceded {{with the group}} touring with Megadeth, where they played to crowds of thirty-five-hundred to five thousand. They toured with Megadeth, Fear Factory, and <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam.</b> All of this happened {{in the summer of}} 1995. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis introduced the bagpipes [...] while performing live (however many people there did not like this).|$|E
500|$|Throughout his career, {{musician}} Jason Newsted {{has made}} over 250 recordings, encompassing studio albums, live material {{and work for}} film soundtracks, cover albums and charity releases. Although {{he began his career}} as a member of the thrash metal group <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam,</b> Newsted's work has primarily been with the band Metallica, with whom he played bass guitar between 1987 and 2001. During Newsted's tenure with the band, they produced four studio albums—1988's ...And Justice for All, 1991's Metallica, 1996's Load and 1997's Reload—as well as several supplementary releases. However, Newsted faced difficulty integrating with the group, and found little opportunity to add his music input; having only been given writing credit for only three Metallica songs during his tenure.|$|E

500|$|Megadeth toured {{heavily in}} support of Youthanasia. They started the tour in November 1994, with live {{performances}} in South America. The tour continued in 1995, {{with a number of}} opening acts such as Korn, <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam</b> and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: [...] "So far, the audiences have been really good {{and it seems to me}} that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been". The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.|$|E
500|$|The tour, however, was {{notable for}} several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar {{technician}} John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European {{leg of the}} Damage, Inc. Tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. After the September 26 performance in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled over on a stretch of icy road the following morning. Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver maintained that he hit a patch of black ice, but Hetfield disputed that. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted. The band returned to San Francisco and hired <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam</b> bassist Jason Newsted to replace Burton. Many of the songs that appeared on the band's next album, ...And Justice for All, were composed while Burton was still alive.|$|E
500|$|Similar to Voodoo and On the Corner, New Amerykah Part One {{emphasizes}} {{sound and}} mood over choruses and verses. The album is unified by a musical theme, with songs sequenced together and typified by ominous musical elements, minor-key melodies, and atmospheric beats. Songs {{on the album}} also incorporate experimental hip hop backing tracks and other hip hop elements in a surrealistic manner. The majority of the beats are dark, blunted, and hazy, and have been noted by music writers as conveying an urban soundscape and feeling of paranoia. Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald said the songs often have [...] "the feel of a seance". Most of them were either produced or co-written by members of Sa-Ra, who were known for their sonically dissonant music, characterized by eccentric chord placements and off-time beats. Sasha Frere-Jones believed the record [...] "isn't so much hip-hop {{as it is a}} reorganization of the historical <b>flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>jetsam</b> that were recycled and turned into hip-hop." ...|$|E

Within these three days, Ariel must receive the [...] "kiss of true love" [...] from Eric. If Ariel gets Eric to kiss her, she will remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and be captured by Ursula. Ariel accepts, and is given human legs to emerge to the land above. Eric finds Ariel {{on the beach and}} takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, {{and at the end of}} the second day, they almost kiss, but are disrupted by <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam.</b> Furious at their narrow escape, Ursula sets a trap for Eric and Ariel: she disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and hypnotizes Eric with her singing voice.|$|E
500|$|Rasmussen's {{first task}} was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's {{drumming}} were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars and a third for anything else. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield [...] "wasn't really interested in singing" [...] but instead [...] "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Jason Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound {{and the lack of}} discussion {{with the rest of the}} team. Newsted had a different experience with his previous band, <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam,</b> describing their style as [...] "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall". He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with only the assistant engineer present. Newsted noted that his parts were at the same audio frequency as Hetfield's guitar parts, and this created a [...] " [...] for the same frequency". Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the misrepresentation of bass of the record.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is known}} for his bass solo which {{included}} parts of [...] "My Friend of Misery" [...] (which Newsted had originally written as an instrumental) and bass parts from his former band, <b>Flotsam</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jetsam.</b>|$|E
