5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's <b>hard</b> <b>palate.</b> Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the <b>hard</b> <b>palate.</b>|$|E
5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E
40|$|Polymorphous low-grade {{adenocarcinoma}} (PLGA) is a neo-plasm {{that occurs}} {{frequently in the}} mucosa of the soft and <b>hard</b> <b>palates,</b> in the buccal mucosa and in the upper lip and is very rare within the nasopharynx. We present a case of PLGA, which presented as a nasal polyp. Key Words: Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, minor salivary gland neoplasm, nasal poly...|$|R
50|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{inflammatory}} papillary hyperplasia is unknown, {{but it is}} thought to be a reactive, inflammatory lesion in response to irritation from an upper dental prosthesis. Nonetheless, it may also occur on the <b>hard</b> <b>palates</b> of patients who are chronic mouth-breathers. Sometimes, this disease can be found in conjunction with another denture-related disease, an epulis fissuratum.|$|R

5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and <b>hard</b> <b>palate.</b> The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} an {{important}} accessory organ in the digestive system. The tongue is used for crushing food against the <b>hard</b> <b>palate,</b> during mastication and manipulation of food for softening prior to swallowing. The epithelium on the tongue’s upper, or dorsal surface is keratinised. Consequently, the tongue can grind against the <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> without being itself damaged or irritated.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} Bactrian camel, the {{dromedary}} has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a <b>harder</b> <b>palate</b> and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids {{of the genus}} Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|R
5|$|Their skulls {{are fairly}} narrow and elongated, with small braincases. Their canine teeth are {{relatively}} long. Sexual dimorphism {{of the skull}} is more pronounced than in corsac foxes, with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and <b>hard</b> <b>palates,</b> as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles, less crowded premolars, more slender canine teeth, and concave rather than convex profiles.|$|R
40|$|The {{records of}} 207 cats with {{high-rise}} syndrome {{over a period}} of 11 years were reviewed. Cats fell from the height of the 2 nd to the 8 th floor and their mean age was 1. 2 years.

25|$|The <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> {{is formed}} by the palatine process of the maxilla and {{horizontal}} plate of palatine bone. It forms a partition between the nasal passages and the mouth. On the anterior portion of {{the roof of the}} <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> are the plicae, irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the larynx. This partition is continued deeper into the mouth by a fleshy extension called the soft palate.|$|E

40|$|Idiopathic CD 4 + Lymphocytopenia {{is a rare}} {{combined}} immunodeficiency disease, characterized by low CD 4 + T-cell count and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections, autoimmunity and malignancies after exclusion of secondary forms of CD 4 lymphocytopenia. Here we present a 13 -year old boy who was referred to our center because of destructive ulceration of soft and <b>hard</b> <b>palates</b> with extension to nose and maxillary sinus starting at 6 months of age. He {{had a history of}} recurrent otitis media, chronic diarrhea, arthritis and herpetic lesions of eyes and mouth since the age of 5 years. Laboratory studies revealed very low number of CD 4 + T-cells (< 100 cells/mm 3). Secondary causes of CD 4 lymphocytopenia, including HIV infection, were ruled out. Immunohistological studies of destructive lesions in oral and nasal cavity revealed angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. Unfortunately, the patient died in spite of treatment with a combination of irradiation and chemotherapy.

40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1780 – 1785 Objective Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{syndrome}} (OSAS) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients {{may be associated}} with the presence of upper airway obstruction caused by chronic infection and nasal polyposis that may also contribute to OSAS severity. Our objective was to identify the profile of findings in CF and OSAS patients by performing upper airway examinations. Methodology Observational, cross-sectional study involving 63 children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 14 with CF. All patients answered a questionnaire and underwent a standard otolaryngology examination, including an endoscopic nasal and nocturnal polysomnography. OSAS diagnosis was confirmed if the obstructive apnea index was ≥ 1. Results OSAS was identified in 35 (55. 6 %) patients. The upper airway findings were evaluated using multiple correspondence factorial analysis. The OSAS group presented with overjet > 2 mm, enlarged pharyngeal pillars, palatine tonsils and pharyngeal tonsils hypertrophy, ogival <b>hard</b> <b>palates</b> and characteristics of chronic rhinosinusitis. Conclusion Bone and soft tissue structural alterations of the upper airway and chronic rhinosinusitis were associated with the OSAS group patients...|$|R
25|$|Cats mostly have ticks {{where they}} cannot reach to groom {{themselves}} - {{often on the}} back of the neck or between the shoulder blades, under the chin, on the head, or upper leg. Ticks can attach elsewhere, even the tail, <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> or inside the anus.|$|E
25|$|Cleft palate is a {{condition}} in which the two plates of the skull that form the <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> (roof of the mouth) are not completely joined. The soft palate is in these cases cleft as well. In most cases, cleft lip is also present. Cleft palate occurs in about one in 700 live births worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Submucous {{cleft palate}} (SMCP) can also occur, {{which is a}} cleft of the soft palate with a classic {{clinical}} triad of a bifid, or split, uvula which is found dangling {{in the back of}} the throat, a furrow along the midline of the soft palate, and a notch in the back margin of the <b>hard</b> <b>palate.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} {{reported}} herein, a buccal mucosal defect was reconstructed with BFP flap. The oral defect {{was covered by}} the BFP in the posterior maxilla, <b>hard</b> and soft <b>palate,</b> and retromolar region after teeth extraction, saucerization, and tumor excision [14, 15, 17].|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis is {{suspected}} by physical exam and history, in which, classically, the <b>hard</b> and soft <b>palate</b> of the midface are mobile {{with respect to}} the remainder of facial structures. This finding can be inconsistent due to the midfacial bleeding and swelling that typically accompany such injuries, and so confirmation is usually needed by radiograph or CT.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} {{most commonly}} {{is located at}} the junction of the <b>hard</b> and soft <b>palate.</b> However, the condition may arise anywhere minor salivary glands are located. It has also been occasionally reported to involve the major salivary glands. It may be present only on one side, or both sides. The lesion typically is 1-4 cm in diameter.|$|R
25|$|Palate cleft {{can occur}} as {{complete}} (soft and <b>hard</b> <b>palate,</b> possibly including {{a gap in}} the jaw) or incomplete (a 'hole' in the roof of the mouth, usually as a cleft soft palate). When cleft palate occurs, the uvula is usually split. It occurs due to the failure of fusion of the lateral palatine processes, the nasal septum, or the median palatine processes (formation of the secondary palate).|$|E
25|$|There are 800-1000 minor {{salivary glands}} located {{throughout}} the oral cavity within the submucosa {{of the oral}} mucosa in the tissue of the buccal, labial, and lingual mucosa, the soft palate, the lateral parts of the <b>hard</b> <b>palate,</b> and {{the floor of the}} mouth or between muscle fibers of the tongue. They are 1-2mm in diameter and unlike the major glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue, only surrounded by it. The gland has usually a number of acini connected in a tiny lobule. A minor salivary gland may have a common excretory duct with another gland, or may have its own excretory duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature (except for Von Ebner glands- see next section) and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands if there is dry mouth present (see further discussion). The minor salivary glands are innervated by the seventh cranial or facial nerve.|$|E
25|$|Retention is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture is prevented from moving vertically {{in the opposite direction}} of insertion. The better the topographical mimicry of the intaglio (interior) surface of the denture base {{to the surface of the}} underlying mucosa, the better the retention will be (in removable partial dentures, the clasps are a major provider of retention), as surface tension, suction and friction will aid in keeping the denture base from breaking intimate contact with the mucosal surface. It is important to note that the most critical element in the retentive design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve 'suction'. The border seal is composed of the edges of the anterior and lateral aspects and the posterior palatal seal. The posterior palatal seal design is accomplished by covering the entire <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> and extending not beyond the soft palate and ending 1–2mm from the vibrating line.|$|E

40|$|A 27 -year-old female {{presented}} to our {{hospital with a}} slow growing, <b>hard</b> and soft <b>palate</b> mass on the right that had been present for the several months. Physical examination showed a 2 cm, firm, well-circumscribed, painless mass {{on the right side}} of the palate. PNS computer tomographic imaging showed a 1. 5 × 1. 3 × 2 cm well-defined cystic mass {{on the right side of}} both the <b>hard</b> and soft <b>palate</b> without any underlying bone change. The lesion was completely excised under general anesthesia. In order to preserve the palatal mucosa, trapdoor approach for removal of the pleomorphic adenoma was done. This technique provided more comfortable healing of the operative site. Three years after surgery, there was no evidence of recurrence. If pleomorphic adenoma without bony and mucosal destruction exists, we suggest consideration of the trapdoor approach to protect the palatal mucosa.

500|$|An aphtha (plural aphthae) is a non {{specific}} term {{that refers to}} an ulcer of the mouth. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek word aphtha meaning [...] "eruption" [...] or [...] "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae, including Bednar's aphthae (infected, traumatic ulcers on the <b>hard</b> <b>palate</b> in infants), oral candidiasis, and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification, aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer, {{it has been suggested that}} the term [...] "aphthous ulcer" [...] is redundant, but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth, with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mucosal {{leishmaniasis}} (ML) is {{an important}} endemic disease and public-health problem in underdevel-oped countries because of its significant morbidity and mortality. Increases in ecological tourism have extended this problem to developed countries. This form of leishmaniasis, caused by reactivation after primary cutaneous lesion, has a natural history of progressive destruction of the nasal septa and soft and <b>hard</b> <b>palates,</b> causing facial disfiguration and leading to respiratory disturbances. Treatment of ML, based on several therapies, depends on use of toxic compounds, and few drugs have emerged over the past 40 years. Drug resistance has increased, and the cure rate is no better than 70 % in the largest studies. Despite these data, {{there has been no}} systematic review of therapies used to treat this important tropical disease. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the best drug management for treatment of ML in Latin America based on the best studies offered by the medical literature. The MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify articles related to ML and therapy. The studies were independently selected by 2 authors. Articles with sufficient data for cure and treatment failures, internal and external validity information, and> 4 patients in each treatment were included. Validation of this systematic review was based on guidelines to guarantee quality; 22 articles met our inclusion criteria. Stibogluconate achieved a 51 % cure rate (76 / 150 patients), and 88 % of patients treated with meglumine were cured (121 patients). Pentamidine and amphotericin were as effective as meglumine.

40|$|Mucosal {{leishmaniasis}} is {{the most}} difficult type to diagnose and treat successfully in the New World 1. Usually caused by Leishmania (viannia) braziliensis this parasite metastasises to the cartilaginous nasal septum and is limited to this site in two thirds of our patients. Multiple mucosal surface involvement occurs in the remainder. Here we report for the first time Eustachian tube blockage with middle ear infection in such a patient. The patient J. S. S. (LTB- 300) had cutaneous leishmaniasis at the age of seven and a year later developed epistaxis and nasal blockage, signs of mucosal disease. He was briefly reported at the age of 152 when he had septal perforation and partial nasal collapse and extensive granuloma of the mouth throat and laryny; severe multiple lesions for a boy of his age. L. v. braziliensis was isolated and characterised. We reported him as an example of cure with prolonged antimonial therapy (20 mg Sbv/ kilo per day continously for 62 days) but he subsequently relapsed. He has continued to have incurable persistent mucosal granuloma for fifteen years. These improve on treatment only to relapse. He has a strong cellular immune response. He forms part {{of a small group of}} such patients we will report in the near future. Recent evaluation before two maximal pentamidine courses using fibro optical instrumentation showed anterior nasal septal perforation, granuloma on both soft and <b>hard</b> <b>palates,</b> and epiglottial granuloma. The larynx while fibrosed appeared quiescent but his voice is still hoarse. Nasopharyngeal visualisation showed a blocked left pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube by granuloma.
