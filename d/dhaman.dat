50|$|<b>Dhamans,</b> though {{harmless}} to humans, are fast-moving, excitable snakes. In captivity individuals remain highly territorial and {{may continue}} to defend their turf aggressively, attempting to startle or strike at passing objects. <b>Dhamans</b> are diurnal and semiarboreal. They inhabit forest floors, wetlands, rice paddies, farmland, and suburban areas where they prey upon small reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Adults, unusually for a colubrid, prefer to subdue their prey by sitting on it rather than by constricting, using body weight to weaken prey.|$|R
