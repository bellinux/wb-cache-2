50|$|The Kidd antigen system (also {{known as}} <b>Jk</b> <b>antigen)</b> is {{present on the}} {{membranes}} of red blood cells and the kidney and helps determine a person's blood type. The <b>Jk</b> <b>antigen</b> is found on a protein responsible for urea transport in the red blood cells and the kidney. The gene encoding this protein is found on chromosome 18. Three Jk alleles are Jk(a), Jk(b)and Jk3. Jk (a) was discovered by Allen et al. in 1951 and is named after a patient (Mrs Kidd delivered a baby with a haemolytic disease of the newborn associated with an antibody directed against a new antigen Jka). Whereas Jk (b) was discovered by Plant et al. in 1953, individuals who lack the <b>Jk</b> <b>antigen</b> (Jk null) are unable to maximally concentrate their urine.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Jk</b> <b>antigen</b> is {{important}} in transfusion medicine. People with two Jk(a) antigens, for instance, may form antibodies against donated blood containing two Jk(b) antigens (and thus no Jk(a) antigens). This can lead to hemolytic anemia, in which the body destroys the transfused blood, leading to low red blood cell counts. Another disease associated with the <b>Jk</b> <b>antigen</b> is hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), in which a pregnant woman's body creates antibodies against the blood of her fetus, leading to destruction of the fetal blood cells. HDN associated with Jk antibodies is typically mild, though fatal cases have been reported.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{ability to}} {{generate}} red blood cells of a chosen blood group phenotype {{would be a major}} advance in transfusion when considering low- and highfrequency blood group antigens. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Cord blood CD 34 + cells undergoing erythroid differentiation in vitro were genetically manipulated with human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 -derived lentiviral vectors expressing hUT-B 1 cDNA (overexpression strategy) or bicistronic vectors expressing both enhanced green fluorescent protein and a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to silence SLC 14 A 1 (JK) gene that encodes hUT-B 1 protein (silencing strategy). Resulting cell populations were analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting and gel affinity column assay. RESULTS: When transduced with hUT-B 1 cDNA lentiviral vectors encoding JK*B and JK*A alleles, respectively, CD 34 + cell-derived erythroid populations from Jk(a+b-) and Jk(a-b+) donors exhibited a Jk(a+b+) phenotype different from the original phenotype. In concomitant tests, Jk(a+b+) donor cells transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying a shRNA designed to interfere with hUT-B 1 transcription showed a marked decrease in hUT-B 1 expression and were assessed as null for <b>Jk</b> <b>antigen</b> by a routine assay. CONCLUSION: In this work focusing on the Kidd blood group system that relies on expression of hUT-B 1 glycoprotein under the Jka or Jkb antigenic configurations, we demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitors could be genetically modified to exhibit a chosen Kidd phenotype. Beyond production of atypical Kidd phenotypes, this genetic strategy could allow generation of rare blood phenotypes from hematopoietic stem cells regardless of initial donor phenotype. Potential applications for genetically modified blood include production of control samples for immunohematologic testing and for resolution of antibody detection in multiply transfused patients...|$|E
40|$|The Kidd (JK) {{blood group}} system is {{clinically}} important in transfusion medicine. Alloantibodies to antigens {{in this system}} may be produced following blood transfusion or during pregnancy and can result in serious haemolytic transfusion reactions and haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). <b>JK</b> <b>antigens</b> on erythrocytes are carried by glycoproteins with the capacity to transport urea through cell membranes. cDNA complementary to mRNA transcribed at the JK locus was cloned in 1994. The molecular basis of the Jk(a) /Jk(b) blood group polymorphism was recently {{shown to be a}} single nucleotide substitution predicting an amino acid change (Asp 280 Asn) in an extracellular loop of the JK glycoprotein. After confirmation of the JK gene polymorphism we developed a rapid and robust technique for JK genotyping with allele-specific primers in a single-tube PCR. In addition, a 217 bp intron located at nucleotides 811 - 812 in the JK gene was found and sequenced. The genotyping test was validated with samples from 106 Caucasian Swedish and 13 Black South African random blood donors. Complete phenotype-genotype correlations were obtained. However, four Jk(a-b-) samples of Polynesian and Finnish origin typed as Jk(b) Jk(b). Potential use of the presented method can be predicted in clinical transfusion medicine including prenatal determination of the JK genotype in a fetus at risk for HDN caused by JK antibodies...|$|R
40|$|The Kidd {{blood group}} antigens, Jkª and Jkᵇ, {{are two of}} the main surface markers which are found on the {{membrane}} of red blood cells. The determination of whether a donor or a recipient has the Jkª and/or the Jkᵇ antigens is crucially important to have a successful transfusion without the development of adverse incompatibility-related reactions. In Malta, routine serological-based tests are applied with the purpose of differentiating between homozygous and heterozygous states for the <b>Jk</b> <b>antigens</b> respectively. Although these tests are highly specific and sensitive, there are particular clinical scenarios where haemagglutination assays are not suitable for determining the individual’s Kidd blood group status. Additionally, the alternative genotyping procedure has never been applied in Malta within the context of blood grouping. The current study was therefore carried out to determine whether a molecular-based technique such as Polymerase Chain Reaction – Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) is a suitable alternative procedure for distinguishing amongst the three different Kidd phenotypes. After extracting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from 50 blood samples obtained from serologically-tested healthy blood donors who expressed {{at least one of the}} Kidd antigens, PCR-RFLP analyses were carried out. The results of the latter were then compared with those previously obtained with haemagglutination and a complete match was observed between the two. Therefore, this PCR-RFLP method was confirmed as a suitable alternative laboratory technique that can be used to determine efficiently the Kidd blood group of both donors and recipients, in an accurate manner without subjectivity as encountered in the case of haemagglutination. This research further facilitates the introduction of molecular-based techniques in molecular blood transfusion. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Serological {{discrepancies}} in matching blood group antigens between donors and patients for blood transfusion {{may lead to}} alloimmunisation, especially in multiply transfused patients. Blood group genotyping (BGG) has contributed in reducing this issue. ABO, Fy and <b>Jk</b> <b>antigens</b> are among those to be causative for alloimmunisation through transfusion or pregnancy. The number of alleles of these clinically significant blood groups is ever increasing. Currently, all commercially available high-throughput BGG platforms are only based on pre-defined polymorphisms. Consequently, novel or rare alleles that might have clinical significance are not identified. Next generation sequencing (NGS) circumvents this issue by providing high-throughput comprehensive genotyping of blood group genes in discovery mode to find all existing and novel mutations. Accordingly, {{a large number of}} individuals can be genotyped in a single run. Here, we describe an NGS-based method coupled with long-range polymerase chain reaction (LR-PCR) for high-throughput, rapid and extensive genotyping of FY, JK and ABO blood group genes. The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGMTM) was used for sequencing the entire FY, JK and ABO blood group genes including flanking regions. Accordingly, high resolution genotyping was obtained. 53 genomic DNA samples were sequenced and genotyped for FY, 67 for JK and 47 for ABO. Sequencing data were aligned to the gene reference sequence derived from the human genome (hg 19) to analyse variants. Analysis was accomplished by software packages, such as Ion Torrent SuiteTM plugins. Sanger sequencing of cDNA and cDNA clones was used to confirm findings in the JK gene. The sequencing data had a coverage depth of more than 5000 x for FY, 700 x for JK and 600 x for ABO. NGS data matched with the serological phenotypes of FY alleles FY*A, FY*B and FY* 02 Null main polymorphisms, such as FY*A/FY*B (125 G>A) in exon 2 and (- 67 T>C) in the promotor region. JK variant analysis revealed that the JK* 01 W. 01 allele (130 G>A) is common (10 / 67 samples) with normal antigenicity. The previously described silencing polymorphism (810 G>A), leading to a purported JK*B null allele, restores a splice site and does not correlate with loss of Jkb antigenicity (10 / 67 samples). JK intron analysis revealed several new JK alleles described in this thesis. All 7 exons, introns and the flanking regions of the ABO gene were covered by only four amplicons. Several rare O alleles were found, such as O 73 and O 75, while one suggested novel O allele was characterised by a missense SNP 482 G>A (Arg 161 His) in exon 7. The ABO reference sequence from hg 19 appeared to resemble (O 01 and O 02) alleles. The intronic SNPs might be used to distinguish between alleles more accurately as a correlation of the intronic SNPs with the alleles was noted for the homozygous O alleles. It is predicted that NGS-based genotyping will replace not only microarray-based genotyping but also serology in the blood group typing of individuals, with great advancements in technology and molecular knowledge being expected in the near future.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinically}} important Kidd (<b>JK)</b> {{blood group}} <b>antigens</b> are {{carried by the}} urea transporter in red cells. The rare Jk(a-b-) phenotype {{can be caused by}} homozygosity at the JK locus for a silent allele, JK: This phenotype has been recorded in many ethnic groups, but it is most abundant among people originating from the Polynesian Islands and Finland. The molecular basis for Jk(a-b-) is unknown in these populations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples from individuals of Swedish, Polynesian, and Finnish origin were collected and characterized by routine JK blood group serology and JK genotyping. Genomic DNA covering the exons and intervening introns of the JK gene coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and fragments were directly sequenced. RESULTS: Exon and partial intron sequences in the coding region of the JK gene were determined. Finnish and Polynesian Jk alleles were analyzed; the only deviations from consensus were a splice-site mutation (G [...] >A) in Polynesians, causing skipping of exon 6, and a T 871 C substitution predicted to disrupt a potential N-glyco-sylation motif (NSS [...] >NSP) in Finns. Methods for rapid detection of silent Jk alleles were developed for clinical application. CONCLUSION: Polynesians and Finns have two different molecular alterations in their Jk alleles, both of which can now be determined by polymerase chain reaction...|$|R
