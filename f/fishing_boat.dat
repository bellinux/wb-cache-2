25|$|Artisan <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> {{are usually}} small {{traditional}} <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> appropriately {{designed for use}} on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities {{around the world have}} developed their own traditional types of <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the fisheries and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, Indonesia has reported about 700,000 <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> 25 percent of which are dugout canoes, and half of which are without motors. The Philippines have reported a similar number of small <b>fishing</b> <b>boats.</b> Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow main hull with two attached outriggers, commonly known as jukung in Indonesia and banca in the Philippines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] With our country's {{economic}} {{developments and}} the developments of fishery, near {{the coast of}} China, the number of <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> and merchant ships are becoming biger and biger.

5|$|Born on February 16, 1987, Bourdon was an {{only child}} raised by his mother, Suzanne Boucher, in the small French-speaking {{community}} of Shippagan, New Brunswick. When he was nine, he was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and needed to use a wheelchair, which he later overcame. As a teenager, he attended Marie-Esther Secondary, where he was a straight-A student. Growing up in a fishing town, he worked summers on his uncle's crab <b>fishing</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Farther south, in Guinea-Bissau, a {{storm surge}} flooded roads and low-lying establishments, such as offices and {{military}} barracks. The sea water submerged {{vast amounts of}} cropland in the Tombali Region, resulting in great losses of rice. Offshore, waves as high as 23feet (7m) capsized a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> with a crew of 19; twelve members were rescued, but the remaining seven disappeared at sea and were presumed dead.|$|E
50|$|Monitored {{industrial}} <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> limit <b>fishing</b> activities to—generally—5 nmi km {{from the}} coast of Chile. This leaves the 5 nm zone for “artisanal” or smaller <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> and limits excessive fishing effort being applied to inshore waters.|$|R

5|$|The {{northern}} Cook Islands were {{hardest hit}} by Percy as the storm left 640people homeless, of which 600 were in Pukapuka, and 40 were in Nassau. Of the buildings and houses destroyed or severely damaged, only ten were left standing. One person was rescued when his <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> stalled during the storm. Percy also damaged a solar power station, making it inoperable. Percy also battered the southern Cook Islands while weakening, although the damage there was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine <b>fishing</b> <b>boat,</b> the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens. Along with Ricketts and the four crew members mentioned in the book, Steinbeck was accompanied by his wife, Carol. Steinbeck hoped that the trip would help rescue their failing marriage, but it seems to have had the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur, large swells capsized a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> with seven people aboard on August25. Four were able to swim back to shore while the other three {{remained}} missing and were later presumed dead. Strong rain bands along the outer fringes of Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to parts of the state. Landslides blocked several roads near Los Cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines. Owing to the dangerous conditions, all schools Los Cabos were closed on August25.|$|E

5|$|On 2 May 1568, Mary {{escaped from}} Loch Leven Castle {{with the aid}} of George Douglas, brother of Sir William Douglas, the castle's owner. Managing to raise an army of 6,000 men, she met Moray's smaller forces at the Battle of Langside on 13 May. Defeated, she fled south; after {{spending}} the night at Dundrennan Abbey, she crossed the Solway Firth into England by <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> on 16 May. She landed at Workington in Cumberland in the north of England and stayed overnight at Workington Hall. On 18 May, local officials took her into protective custody at Carlisle Castle.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December, Tom Bawcock {{decided to}} brave the storms {{and went out}} in his <b>fishing</b> <b>boat.</b> Despite the stormy weather and the {{difficult}} seas, he managed to catch enough fish to feed the entire village. The entire catch (including seven types of fish) was baked into a pie, which had the fish heads poking through to prove that there were fish inside. Ever since then, the Tom Bawcock's Eve festival is held on 23 December in Mousehole. The celebration and memorial {{to the efforts of}} Tom Bawcock sees the villagers parading a huge stargazy pie during the evening with a procession of handmade lanterns, before eating the pie itself.|$|E
5|$|On the mainland, {{the largest}} daily {{rainfall}} total occurred on Sebampo, Sonora, which recorded 6.73in (171.0mm) of rain. Five fishermen drowned when their <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> sank in the Gulf of California, {{off the coast}} of Sonora. Also in that state, the University of Sonora suspended operations in its Navojoa campus. Two more people died when a tree fell on a car in Sinaloa. Heavy rainfall caused moderate to severe flash flooding in Sonora and Sinaloa, although damage was not as severe or as extensive as on the Baja California peninsula. Los Mochis, Sinaloa, reported sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h) on September 22.|$|E

5|$|The British commander, Captain George Martin, {{succeeded in}} chasing the Spanish vessels into the rocky Conil Bay, where they {{surrendered}} {{after a brief}} engagement in which the Spanish suffered significantly higher casualties than the British. One of the Spanish ships, the Santa Elena, was subsequently wrecked on the shore, while the other, the Ninfa, was captured and later recommissioned into the Royal Navy. The treasure carried on board the frigates, however, had been removed by a Spanish <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> before the battle and so did not fall into British hands.|$|E
5|$|The first St. John's dog {{was said}} to be brought to England in or around 1820, but the breed's {{reputation}} had already spread to England; there is a story that the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's dog on a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dottie was {{the ninth}} {{tropical}} cyclone and fourth named storm of the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season. The precursor to Dottie {{formed in the}} Gulf of Mexico on August 17 and organized into a tropical depression on August 18. The storm drifted towards the east, and, after peaking as a moderate tropical storm, it accelerated northeastward and made landfall on Florida. Upon re-emerging in the Atlantic, Dottie turned northward and moved ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. Damage from the storm was primarily insignificant and limited to gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides; however, a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> capsized in the Bahamas, resulting {{in the deaths of}} four people.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, the Archbishop of Toledo, Raymund, did attend. King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend. King Stephen of England refused permission {{for any of the}} English bishops to attend, except for the bishops of Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> to take him across the English Channel to attend the council.|$|E
5|$|As Utor was {{traversing}} the South China Sea, a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> became stranded near Langhua Reef in the Paracel Islands; {{the occupants}} were rescued by a rescue ship {{operated by the}} Hainan Maritime Bureau, though five were flown to hospitals for medical treatment. A total of 140sheds on the islands of Yongxing, Yayong, Zhaoshu, and Bei Dao were flattened by the passing typhoon, while a ship at harbor sank and five others ran aground. On the Qilian Yu island sub-group, 98fishermen on the islands were rescued by the Nanhai Rescue Bureau following days without clean water and food supplies. Utor had destroyed all of the islands' bunkhouses, resulting in requests for rescue.|$|E
5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a whaling vessel 80miles (130km) out at sea, {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate how many recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid, since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time.
