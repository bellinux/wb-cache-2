25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{career of}} the Finnish-built <b>barge</b> <b>carriers</b> is unclear.

Despite the names, it is uncertain if the ships were ever converted or otherwise used for offshore drilling. After the alleged plans for using the <b>barge</b> <b>carriers</b> to transport rolling stock from the United States to the Latin America fell through, the ships were laid up in Piraeus, Greece.|$|R

50|$|Studies {{showed that}} the costs of {{addressing}} these issues, along with the costs of operating the carrier ships and their lighters, were much higher than for the customary freighter ships or the ISO-compliant container ships that were beginning to conquer the transportation market.

25|$|Yulius Fuchik {{belonged to}} the {{distinct}} group of cargo ships known as <b>barge</b> <b>carriers</b> which offered, at the time, the highest theoretical loading and unloading rate of all cargo ships. The lighter aboard ship (LASH) system was based on unpowered barges, also known as lighters, that were loaded on board a larger vessel for transport between inland waterways separated by open seas. For this purpose, Yulius Fuchik had vast cargo decks and a large lifting platform in the stern.|$|R
50|$|The {{originally}} <b>barge</b> <b>carrier</b> {{was converted}} into a powership at the Sedef Shipyard in Tuzla, Istanbul. She was renamed Karadeniz Powership Zeynep Sultan (KPS11).

(FMO) and Cordiant Capital Inc./ICF International. She has a generation capacity of 125 MW on dual-fuel (HFO- and gas-fired).

50|$|The {{lighter aboard ship}} (LASH) system {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of loading barges (lighters) aboard a bigger vessel for transport. It was developed in response to a need to transport lighters, a type of unpowered barge, between inland waterways separated by open seas. Lighters are typically towed or pushed around harbors, canals or rivers and cannot be relocated under their own power. The carrier ships are known variously as LASH <b>carriers,</b> <b>barge</b> <b>carriers,</b> kangaroo ships or lighter transport ships.|$|R
