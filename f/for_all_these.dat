5|$|Cast iron {{was first}} {{produced}} in China during 5th century BC, but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period. The earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists {{in what is}} now modern Luhe County, Jiangsu in China. Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare, agriculture, and architecture. During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> processes, charcoal was required as fuel.|$|E
5|$|It {{is also an}} offence, {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area, {{to be found in}} possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person, in circumstances which raise the reasonable presumption referred to above. The penalty <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> offences is life imprisonment. However, in the latter situation, a person will not be convicted if he or she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{is not a}} true coral {{in class}} Anthozoa but is in class Hydrozoa, and is {{more closely related to}} {{jellyfish}} than stony corals. Because of the variability in growth habit that this coral exhibits, it {{has been the subject of}} much confusion as to its taxonomy, being described under a number of different names from different localities. In 1898, Hickson decided that the variations in morphology were due to environmental factors and that Millepora alcicornis was the valid name <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> species. This conclusion has since been questioned.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the helium-4 atom is {{identical}} with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another {{of any of these}} particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.|$|E
5|$|As Rana Bahadur Shah's {{bodyguard}} and advisor, Bhimsen Thapa also {{accompanied him}} to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu {{to serve as}} the regent. Since Rana Bahadur was willing to do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissidenting factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the terai. However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power. The Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters {{in the name of the}} ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.|$|E

25|$|But {{because of}} the {{specific}} nature of the land, crossed by several tributaries of the wadis, the urban development of the city stretched southwards.

Designs <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> were provided by the Colonial Architect, probably closely following plans sent from England.|$|E

In a spider, these silk types are produced in different glands; so the silk from a particular gland {{can be linked to}} its use by the spider.|$|E

25|$|The Orion was {{the last}} design using many {{identical}} elements from the Lockheed designs preceding it. It primarily used {{all the elements of}} the Altair, but included a forward top cockpit similar to the Vega, plus the NACA cowling introduced in the Air Express. Lockheed used the same basic fuselage mold and wing <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> wooden designs (the Explorer wing was unique), hence the close similarities between them. The Orion featured an enclosed cabin with seating for six passengers. The Orion received its Approved Type Certificate on May 6, 1931.|$|E
