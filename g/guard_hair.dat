5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, barrel-shaped {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur {{on the upper}} part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands {{can be found in the}} surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> differs little from over hair.|$|E
5|$|While other British and Northern European multi-horned sheep {{have a fine}} inner {{coat and}} a coarse, longer outer coat, Jacobs have a medium grade fleece and no outer coat. Lambs of the more {{primitive}} lines are born with a coat of <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> that is protective against rain and cold; this birth coat is shed at 36months.|$|E
25|$|Llamas {{have a fine}} undercoat, {{which can}} be used for {{handicrafts}} and garments. The coarser outer <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> is used for rugs, wall-hangings and lead ropes. The fiber comes in many different colors ranging from white or grey to reddish-brown, brown, dark brown and black.|$|E

50|$|Pinnipeds and {{polar bears}} have longer <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> forming {{the most visible}} fur; polar bears' <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are hollow.|$|R
25|$|Their fur {{consist of}} two layers; {{top layer of}} long <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> and a soft wooly undercoat. The <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are hollow and filled with air for better insulation, which also helps them stay afloat when swimming.|$|R
500|$|A {{sea otter}} has {{two types of}} fur, the underfur and the <b>guard</b> <b>hair.</b> [...] The shape of these {{different}} hair fibers connect to trap air between them. [...] This allows them to maintain their body heat without the blubber other sea mammals use.|$|E
500|$|The fur {{of mammals}} has many uses protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflage, {{with the primary}} usage being thermoregulation. The types of hair include definitive, which may be shed after {{reaching}} a certain length; vibrissae, which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers; pelage, which consists of guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair; spines, which are a type of stiff <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> used for defense in, for example, porcupines; bristles, which are long hairs usually used in visual signals, such as the mane of a lion; velli, often called [...] "down fur," [...] which insulates newborn mammals; and wool which is long, soft and often curly. Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation, as some tropical mammals, such as sloths, have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the musk ox has guard hairs measuring [...] {{as well as a}} dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of [...] Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach [...] in the summer, but the skin stays at [...] Aquatic mammals, conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry.|$|E
2500|$|Alpacas {{have been}} bred in South America for {{thousands}} of years. Vicu√±as were first domesticated and bred into alpacas by the ancient tribes of the Andean highlands of Peru, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia. Two-thousand-year-old Paracas textiles are thought to include alpaca fiber. Also known as [...] "The Fiber of the Gods", Alpaca was used to make clothing for royalty. In recent years, alpacas have also been exported to other countries. In countries such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand, breeders shear their animals annually, weigh the fleeces and test them for fineness. With the resulting knowledge, {{they are able to}} breed heavier-fleeced animals with finer fiber. Fleece weights vary, with the top stud males reaching annual shear weights up to [...] total fleece and [...] good quality fleece. The discrepancy in weight is because an alpaca has <b>guard</b> <b>hair,</b> which is often removed before spinning.|$|E
50|$|Mammals with {{well-developed}} {{down and}} <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> also usually have {{large numbers of}} awn hairs. These begin their growth much as <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> do, but change their mode of growth, usually when {{less than half the}} length of the hair has emerged. This portion of the hair is called awn. The rest of the growth is thin and wavy, much like down hair. In many species of mammals, the awn hairs comprise the bulk of the visible coat. The proximal part of the awn hair shares the function of the down hairs, whereas the distal part aids the water-shedding function of the <b>guard</b> <b>hairs,</b> though their thin basal portion prevents their being erected like true <b>guard</b> <b>hairs.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the <b>guard</b> {{and wool}} <b>hairs</b> in the Greek Goat (Capra prisca) was described and studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The diameter of wool hairs ranged from 10 - 12 mu m, whereas the <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> possessed diameters ranging from 45 - 130 mu m. The majority of <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> were medullated. The cuticle pattern of <b>guard</b> and wool <b>hairs</b> {{was of the}} non-annular type. The scale's number {{as well as the}} scale's configuration of <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> varied accordingly to their diameter. The morphological features of hairs compared with the existing data of other goat breeds. This information could be useful for hair identification of this mammalian species...|$|R
2500|$|Shelties have {{a double}} coat, {{which means that they}} have two layers of fur that make up their coat. The long, rough <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> lie on top of a thick, soft {{undercoat}}. [...] The <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are water-repellent, while the undercoat provides relief from both high and low temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|The first Devon was {{discovered}} by Beryl Cox in Buckfastleigh, Devon, UK, in 1960. The breed was initially thought to be linked with the Cornish Rex; however, test mating proved otherwise. Cats have three types of hair: <b>guard</b> <b>hair,</b> awn hair, and down hair. The Devon Rex's coat is unusual because there is little <b>guard</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E

50|$|Polecats {{were found}} in two major phenotypes a typic one and a dark fur one with no black mask. Colour {{mutations}} include albinos and erythrists. In typical erythristic individuals, the underfur is usually bright reddish. The <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> on the trunk are bright reddish or reddish brown. Black <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are absent on the lower body and head. In some rare cases, the <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are so light, they are almost indistinguishable from the pale-yellow underfur. In these cases, the whole animal is a very light golden-yellow colour.|$|R
50|$|The fur of Tibetan antelopes is distinctive, and {{consists}} of long <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> and a silky undercoat of shorter fibres. The individual <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are thicker than those of other goats, with unusually thin walls, and have a unique pattern of cuticular scales, said to resemble {{the shape of a}} benzene ring.|$|R

50|$|Camel hair {{of cloth}} made from pure camel hair or {{a blend of}} camel hair and another fiber. The outer {{protective}} fur (<b>guard</b> <b>hair)</b> is coarse and inflexible and can be woven into haircloth. <b>Guard</b> <b>hair</b> can be made soft and plush by blending it, especially with wool. The camel's pure undercoat is very soft, gathered when camels molt, and is frequently used for coats.|$|E
50|$|The fur is tawny on {{the belly}} (the {{origin of the}} species' common name), and black and tan {{speckled}} on the back. The fur body contains three types of hair: guard-awl hair, <b>guard</b> <b>hair,</b> and under hair. The <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> is the longest with the guard-awl and under hair following in decreasing length. Whiskers are located on the face and have been observed {{to play a role}} in maintaining body position while swimming.|$|E
50|$|The modern fur {{arrangement}} {{is known to}} have occurred as far back as docodonts, haramiyidans and eutriconodonts, with Castorocauda, Megaconus and Spinolestes preserving compound follicles with <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> and underfur.|$|E

50|$|A bear's fur {{consists}} of two types of hair: the underfur and the outer <b>guard</b> <b>hairs.</b> The underfur, which is soft and dense, serves primarily as an insulator. The outer <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are much thicker, longer and coarser, and while they also insulate, they primarily serve to protect the body from dirt, debris and insects, {{as well as to}} repel water.|$|R
50|$|The coat {{consists}} of a soft, extremely dense undercoat and straight, harsh outer <b>guard</b> <b>hairs.</b> The <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are one to two inches long, with the longer hair mainly in a ruff around the neck and {{on the backs of}} the thighs. The coat requires a thorough weekly brushing. Shedding is moderate most of the year, heavy during the twice-yearly shedding season.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern European breeds, the Komondor and Mioritic Shepherd, have {{a single}} coat {{consisting}} of relatively little <b>guard</b> <b>hair,</b> but mainly curly down hair as an adaptation to that environment. The Western European breeds, such as the Briard and the Spanish Water Dog, also {{have a single}} coat, however, it consists mainly of <b>guard</b> <b>hair.</b> The Alpine region geographically between them, home of the Bergamasco shepherd, appears to form a bridge between these two groups. The Bergamasco shepherd has a double coat in which both types of hair are present in almost equal proportions, although straighter and differently distributed.|$|E
50|$|The Giant Angora coat {{contains}} three fiber types for its texture. The underwool {{is to be}} {{the most}} dominant over the other two types of hair. It should be medium fine, soft, delicately waved and have a gentle shine. The Awn Fluff has a <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> tip and is a stronger, wavy wool. The Awn Fluff is found between the Underwool and Awn Hair. The Awn Hair, also known as <b>guard</b> <b>hair,</b> is the third type of fiber. The Awn Hair is a straight, strong hair that protrudes above the wool and must be present and evident.|$|E
5000|$|Faults --- in adults, <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> prominent, {{protruding}} from coat {{to the extent}} that it interferes with the soft lustrous feel. Fur c0arse and unyielding to touch. Complete absence of waves or curls, especially around head and neck.|$|E

5000|$|Most goats have soft {{insulating}} hairs {{near the}} skin and longer <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> on the surface. The desirable fibre for the textile industry is the former; it has several names including [...] "down", [...] "cashmere" [...] and [...] "pashmina". The <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are of little value as they are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye. Goats are typically shorn twice a year, with an average yield of about 10 lb.|$|R
50|$|This breed {{does not}} produce as much wool as other breeds of Angora rabbits. This trait is being {{improved}} upon by selective breeding. The wool should have a silky texture, high luster, with good <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> for ease of maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Most common coat {{colors are}} wolf gray, pale red and white. The gray coat {{can be of}} various shades from almost white to very dark gray, nearly black. The gray can be mixed with red {{producing}} array of brownish and red shades. Dogs with either coat color described above may have white patches in different proportions. Pale red and white dogs may have brown noses and lips. Dogs with either coat color have so-called [...] "zonary" [...] pattern of distribution of pigment in each <b>guard</b> <b>hair.</b> This means <b>guard</b> <b>hair</b> has alternating bands (zones) of white with black, brown or red color. Hairs with evenly distributed pigment indicate an admixture of other than Laika breed.|$|E
50|$|A {{sea otter}} has {{two types of}} fur, the underfur and the <b>guard</b> <b>hair.</b> The shape of these {{different}} hair fibers connect to trap air between them. This allows them to maintain their body heat without the blubber other sea mammals use.|$|E
50|$|The winter fur is {{soft and}} tall, with short, dense underfur and long, sparse <b>guard</b> <b>hairs.</b> The fur is {{generally}} shorter and not as thick {{as that of the}} European polecat. The <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are especially well developed on the lower back, though still sparser than those of the European polecat. Contrary to the former, the steppe polecat's <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> never completey cover the underfur. The base colour of the winter fur is very light yellowish or whitish-yellowish. The tips of the <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are blackish-brown or brown, forming a frosting effect over the yellow underfur. This frosting is stronger in the middle and lower back, where the <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are denser and longer. The <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> on the upper back, the flanks, between the shoulders and along the upper neck are extremely short, thus being lighter in colour than the posterior region. The head is piebald, with the eye region and the upper side of the nose being covered by a brownish mask. Behind the mask, a white band crosses the head from cheek to cheek. A small brownish area is usually located in front of each ear. The ears are completely white, while the throat is yellowish-white or almost white. Sometimes, the head is entirely white. The lower surface of the neck is dark blackish-brown or brown, while the chest and forelegs are black or blackish-brown. The abdomen is light, yellowish-straw in colour. The groin is the same colour of the forelimbs. The base of the tail is light in colour, while the tip is dark brown. The summer coat is shorter and coarser than the winter fur, and is not as dense and close-fitting, with a more strongly developed ochreous or reddish tone. The head is, overall, darker than in winter, with greater contrast between the dark and white tones.|$|R
40|$|The {{innervation}} of pelage, <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> and vibrissae hairs was {{studied in}} five species of marsupial mammals {{by means of}} electron microscopy for the first time. This study showed that members of different superfamilies in marsupial mammals displayed {{the same pattern of}} hair innervation. This also resembled the pattern seen in the placental mammals. All types of hairs had both longitudinal and transverse lanceolate nerve terminals. Pelage hairs did not have any Merkel cells. <b>Guard</b> <b>hairs</b> were very richly innervated and had free nerve endings, lanceolate nerve endings, many Merkel cells with their associated nerve endings and pilo-Ruffini nerve endings. Vibrissae hairs had free nerve endings, Merkel nerve endings and lamellated corpuscles, but pilo-Ruffini nerve endings were not seen in this investigation. Because of the profusion and variety of innervation in <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> of the marsupial mammals, these hairs may have a similar function to vibrissae hairs in placental mammals...|$|R
50|$|Wire-haired: Also called broken-coated. The harsh outer <b>guard</b> <b>hairs</b> are prominent, {{providing}} excellent {{weather protection}} for hunting dogs {{such as the}} Border Terrier or Wirehaired Pointing Griffon.|$|R
