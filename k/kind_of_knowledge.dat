Knowing the source and context of information can be extremely important in daily decision-making, so {{this is one way}} in which memory decline can affect the lives of the elderly. Therefore, reliance on political stereotypes is one way to use their knowledge about the sources when making judgments, and the use of metacognitive knowledge gains importance. This deficit may be related to declines in the ability to bind information together in memory during encoding and retrieve those associations at a later time.|$|E

500|$|This {{problem of}} {{explaining}} introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general {{in terms of}} third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap. There are several different views {{of the nature of}} this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. David Chalmers and the early Frank Jackson interpret the gap as ontological in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other. An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and Colin McGinn. According to them, the gap is epistemological in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently. For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants. Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous [...] "Qualia Question", which is: Does Red cause Redness? ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in the [...] "Ethics", Spinoza {{discusses}} {{his beliefs}} {{about what he}} considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can {{be known as the}} knowledge of things that could be “mutilated, confused, and without order.” [...] Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a “passive” state. This type of “passive mind” that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.|$|E

However, when reasoning about the distribution of environmental toxins, ecological knowledge should be recruited since such a toxin would plausibly spread through an ecosystem. In this chapter, we address the factors that influence the recruitment <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> in different contexts. We propose that different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> are differentially available across contexts.

2500|$|According to Gadamer, in {{contrast}} to the [...] "wealth of meaning" [...] that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant [...] "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of [...] "moral feeling" [...] that had been worked out in English philosophy". The moral imperative [...] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility". For Kant, the sensus communis only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from [...] "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it [...] "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".|$|E
2500|$|Auguste Comte was so {{impressed}} with his theory of positivism that he referred to it as [...] "the great discovery of the year 1822.” Comte's system is based on the principles of knowledge, as seen in 3 states. This law states any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> always begins in theological form. Here the knowledge can be explained by a superior supernatural power such as animism, spirits, or gods. It then passes to the metaphysical form where the knowledge is explained by abstract philosophical speculation. Finally, the knowledge becomes positive after being explained scientifically through observation, experiment, and comparison. The order of the laws was created in order of increasing difficulty. Comte's description of the development of society is parallel to Karl Marx's own theory historical progression from capitalism to communism. They both were influenced by various Utopian-socialist thinkers of the day and agreed that some form of communism would be the climax of societal development.|$|E

2500|$|The Jadids were Muslim modernist reformers {{within the}} Russian Empire {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th century. They {{normally}} referred to themselves by the Turkic terms Taraqqiparvarlar ('progressives'), Ziyalilar ('intellectuals'), or simply Yäşlär/Yoshlar ('youth').

A leading figure in the efforts to reform education was the Crimean Tatar Ismail Gasprinski who lived from 1851–1914.

2500|$|Another area of {{knowledge}} representation research {{was the problem}} of common sense reasoning. [...] One of the first realizations from trying to make software that can function with human natural language was that humans regularly draw on an extensive foundation {{of knowledge}} about the real world that we simply take for granted but that is not at all obvious to an artificial agent. [...] Basic principles of common sense physics, causality, intentions, etc. An example is the frame problem, that in an event driven logic there need to be axioms that state things maintain position from one moment to the next unless they are moved by some external force. In order to make a true artificial intelligence agent that can converse with humans using natural language and can process basic statements and questions about the world it is essential to represent this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> One of the most ambitious programs to tackle this problem was Doug Lenat's Cyc project. Cyc established its own Frame language and had large numbers of analysts document various areas of common sense reasoning in that language. The knowledge recorded in Cyc included common sense models of time, causality, physics, intentions, and many others.|$|E
2500|$|George Lakoff {{explained}} the inaccuracy of metonymic models, through which people {{jump to conclusions}} without sufficient elaboration, giving rise to prototype effects, in his book Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things. First of all, we commonly consider typical examples as the better examples of a category. For instance, {{in the category of}} fruits, apples and oranges are typical examples. It is common practice that we engage in reasoning by making inferences from typical to non-typical examples. As a matter of fact, an enormous amount of our knowledge about categories of things is organized in terms of typical cases. We constantly draw inferences on the basis of that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Second, salient examples, which are familiar and memorable, are unconsciously used in our understanding of things. For instance, if one's best friend is a vegetarian and they don't know any others well, they will tend to generalize from their best friend to other vegetarians. This is what Tversky and Kahneman referred to as the [...] "Conjunction fallacy". To understand this notion via Probability theory, think of two mutually unrelated events. The theory assumes that the likelihood of the co-occurrence of the two events is lower than that of the occurrence of either, ignoring the fact that the two events are actually unrelated to one another. To understand this with regards to Lavender linguistics, just because two individuals are both self-identified bisexual males {{does not necessarily mean that}} they must engage in the same linguistic patterns and social styles. The failure to capture this asymmetry between prototypical and non-prototypical cases results in ineffective study of Lavender linguistics. Typical and salient examples are just two kinds of metonymic models. Others include social stereotypes, ideal cases, paragons, generators, and submodels.|$|E
