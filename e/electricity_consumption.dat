40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the energy demands in dairy cow farming to define the energy intensity of different categories of farms by efficiency indicators, identifying the critical operations and suggesting technologies that could be appropriate for energy savings. The <b>electricity</b> <b>consumptions</b> {{of a set of}} fourteen dairy farms, ranging from 40 to 300 milking cows, were analysed for one year with reference to the main operations (milking, milk cooling, lighting, ventilation, manure handling) and the equipments used. The overall <b>electricity</b> <b>consumptions</b> accounted for 466 kWh/cow. yr, ranging from 314 to 630 kWh/cow. yr. Milk productions, which ranged between 270, 000 and 3, 030, 000 kg/yr per farm, required on average 5 kWh/ 100 kg. yr. The highest energy demands were associated to milk harvesting (refrigeration and milking procedures) which account for 41...|$|R

5|$|A 2008 study {{examined}} billing data in Indiana {{before and after}} it adopted DST in 2006, and concluded that DST increased overall residential <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> by 1% to 4%, due mostly to extra afternoon cooling and extra morning heating; the main increases came in the fall. A study estimated the overall annual cost of DST to Indiana households $9 million, with an additional $1.7–5.5 million for social costs due to increased pollution.|$|E
5|$|Copper's {{superior}} conductivity {{enhances the}} efficiency of electrical motors. This is important because motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%–46% of all global <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> and 69% of all electricity used by industry. Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases {{the efficiency of}} the motor. Copper motor rotors, a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives, are enabling general-purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency standards.|$|E

5|$|Setting {{national}} {{renewable energy}} targets {{can be an}} important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined {{as a percentage of the}} primary energy and/or electricity generation mix. For example, the European Union has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of 12 per cent of the total EU energy mix and 22 per cent of <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> by 2010. National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target. Other developed countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and some US States.|$|E
5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, {{can supply}} power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption.</b> This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E
5|$|The city's <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> {{is about}} 1,265kWh per capita {{but the actual}} demand is higher. In Delhi power {{distribution}} is managed by Tata Power Distribution and BSES Yamuna & Rajdhani since 2002. The Delhi Fire Service runs 43 fire stations that attend about 15,000 fire and rescue calls per year. The state-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and private enterprises such as Vodafone, Airtel, Idea Cellular, Reliance Infocomm, Aircel, Reliance Jio and Tata Docomo provide telephone and cell phone services to the city. Cellular coverage is available in GSM, CDMA, 3G and 4G.|$|E

5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption.</b> However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's energy {{infrastructure}} sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional, the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia, with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers {{are connected to}} electricity through the National Grid, with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11,000km of transmission lines operating at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolts. In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> was 116,087.51 GWh. Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China, India and Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{proposed}} a fiscal austerity program in early 2012, including the gradual removal of subsidies. The proposal {{turned out to}} be unpopular, and was not implemented. She opted instead to send a bill to Congress for the renationalization of YPF, privatized in 1993, blaming the Spanish company Repsol for the energy trade deficit. The bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by a 207-32 margin. It was criticized as an authoritarian move, as there was no negotiation with Repsol. As well, the Vaca Muerta oil field had been discovered by this time. However, YPF was unable to afford the costs to exploit the oil at the site, and the rights to drill at Vaca Muerta were sold to the Chevron Corporation. The costs of energy imports increased the trade deficit and the inflation rate, and power outages became frequent. Outages usually took place on the hottest days of the summer season, as the use of air conditioning increased <b>electricity</b> <b>consumption</b> to peak levels.|$|E
