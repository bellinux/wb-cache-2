40|$|In New Zealand, pasture-raised lamb is {{considered}} the highest quality sheep meat product while hogget is a <b>downgraded</b> <b>product</b> considered to be of poorer quality. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the difference in meat quality between sheep slaughtered at 5, 8 and 14 months-of-age. This study also aimed to develop an assay to measure collagen concentration and solubility and to compare shear force to collagen concentration and solubility for meat from sheep slaughtered at 5, 8 and 14 months. Sixty Romney crossbreed rams born in the spring of 2015 were allocated to one of three slaughter age groups: 5 -group (n= 20), 8 -months group (n= 20) and 14 - months group (n= 20). The ram lambs were grazed together on perennial ryegrass-based pasture. At slaughter, the loin (Longissimus lumborum) from {{the left side of the}} carcass was excised, chilled for 24 hours and then frozen. Shear force, pH, colour, driploss, myofibrillar fragmentation index, sarcomere length, soluble collagen, insoluble collagen and total collagen were measured on the loin. Longissimus lumborum muscle from the 5 -months group was darker (P= 0. 045) with higher pH (P< 0. 001) than 8 and 14 -months groups. Longissimus lumborum muscle from the 14 -months group was redder (P< 0. 001), yellower (P< 0. 001) with higher intramuscular fat (0. 003), shorter sarcomere length (P< 0. 001), lower collagen concentration (P= 0. 020) and lower soluble collagen in percentage (P= 0. 007) and in g/ 100 g fresh weight (P= 0. 008) than 5 and 8 -months groups. The peak shear force was lower at 14 months, intermediate at 5 months and greater at 8 months (P< 0. 001). Longissimus lumborum muscle from the 8 -months group had greater drip loss (P< 0. 01) than 5 -months group and 14 -months group. The results suggest that slaughtering sheep at 14 months could have benefits on eating quality due to an increase in intramuscular fat...|$|E

40|$|Proper {{setting of}} process {{conditions}} in the melt spinning setup {{is one way to}} yield uniform quality of spinline tension. The optimum setting to give uniform spinline tension is determined using experiment plans in the Taguchi method and significant process parameters are also identified. When the setting shifts from the optimum, the spinline tension becomes non-uniform and <b>downgrades</b> <b>product</b> quality. This study aims to diagnose single or double fault conditions of those significant process parameters based on the spinline tension signal. The critical procedures of fault diagnosis are feature extraction and classification. The tension signal is decomposed into a wavelet packet tree of four resolution levels. Four entropies from the best-basis wavelet packet tree and the lowest entropy at level four are selected as features. The back-propagation neural network acts as a classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that the features and classifier actually work well to identify the single and double fault conditions with high accuracy in melt spinning...|$|R

40|$|The TFT-LCD module {{factories}} {{are in charge}} of the last process of the TFT-LCD supply chain, i. e., assembling LCD panels (produced from the former process in the supply chain) as well as electronic components into TFT-LCD panels or the finished products using TFT-LCD panels. Since the variation of machine processes and production techniques at the former process of the supply chain results in a variety of qualities of LCD panels, the finished products assembled with those LCD panels of different qualities are also of different qualities, according to which they are classified into different grades. This paper models the material allocation system for a TFT-LCD module factory based on the make-to-stock (MTS) production, in which one of the main designs is to allow the flexibility that the finished products of higher grades are able to be downgraded to respond to the drastic variation of customer requirements for each grade of finished products. The system is modelled in detail by an integer programming approach that takes into account not only <b>downgraded</b> <b>products</b> but also the customer requirements for the quality qualification rate and the lower bound of non-dot-defect rate of products, to maximize the total profit of the product portfolio. The model is evaluated by conducting an experimental study for a numerical example, which turns out that the proposed system looks promising as it determines a feasible product portfolio that decreases both the inventory of LCD panels and the volume of unqualified products while maintaining a high profit...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} global {{problems}} is the rapidly growing overconsumption of our finite natural resources. To overcome this problem, new sustainable business ideas like product recovery are becoming increasingly important. The main goal of product recovery firms is to sustain the value of already used goods in some form. This thesis examines some current challenges in the acquisition process of businesses {{with a focus on}} product recovery. The first essay investigates how a recovery firm collects the used products from individual holders in an optimal way. To be profitable, the firm has to balance the effort of the product holders to return their products with the respective acquisition costs resulting from the implemented collection network and the acquisition fee. The key result is achieved by a comparison of two currently applied strategies and shows the additional benefit of having a pricing strategy which differentiates by the quality of the used product. The second essay examines the optimal quality grading strategies of a recovery firm and an individual product holder who decides on returning his used product. A product holder has an incentive to grade the used product as being better than it is because of the higher achievable acquisition price, whereas the firm can increase the profit margin by <b>downgrading</b> the <b>product.</b> In short, the firm has to balance the risk of a rejection against the additional gain by <b>downgrading</b> the <b>product</b> quality. Here, one key result is that our model-based grading strategy has a great improvement potential in comparison with a currently applied strategy of a recovery firm. The third essay analyses the decision of a recovery firm to accept offered batches of used products from the B 2 B market. As the capacity management of processing individual product returns is a challenging task because of high volatilities in the return volumes, a firm can smooth capacity utilization by acquiring B 2 B returns. The key finding is that time-dependent effects can have a strong impact on the profitability of this capacity lever...|$|R
50|$|Aspen tree wood {{has many}} {{commercial}} uses {{due to its}} soft yet strong and heat tolerant wood. Some of these uses include matches, building material where low flammability is key, packing paper, plywood, and animal bedding {{due to lack of}} irritant phenols in the wood. Because infected trees lose an average of 70% wood volume to the fungus after being infected, Phellinus tremulae causes a lot of economic damage. For example, plywood should be decay free without any discoloration as this <b>downgrades</b> the <b>product.</b> Phellinus tremulae creates decay and discoloration and therefore results in enormous amounts of waste at the mill. Harvesting aspens with trunk rot is more costly because decay-free trees can be scattered over vast areas in the forest and determining if a tree is infected can be challenging without first cutting down the tree. The high moisture content found in trees infected with Phellinus tremulae increases the shipping costs if dried as it would be with uninfected trees. In order to combat these increased shipping costs, 15% more drying time is required to reduce the moisture content.|$|R

40|$|Deformities in commercially raised {{fish are}} a common source of <b>downgrading</b> of <b>product</b> value. During the {{intensive}} rearing of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), opercular deformities are the most commonly observed type of deformation (affecting up to 80 % of the fisheries stock), sometimes showing a severe inward folding of the operculum. They are non-lethal malformations that appear during the larval stage but affect growth rate and morphology, with a significant economic loss as a consequence. In order to exploratory quantify and qualify these deformities, geometric morphometric analyses were performed on the external morphology from larvae with an age ranging from 50 to 69 days post-hatching (DPH), and on the cranial skeleton of 110 DPH old juveniles. The results showed several osteological cranial shifts and a striking left-right independency associated with deoperculation. Even though a significant size difference was observed at 65 DPH between normal and deoperculated specimens, allometries during the examined growth stages still appear to be very similar in normal and deoperculated specimens. At 69 DPH deoperculated specimens differed significantly from the normal specimens in their external morphology based on its shape variables, but {{the results suggest that}} discrimination is possible from earlier stages. Further analyses are needed, but the usefulness of this approach towards developing an early detection tool could be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - International {{marketing}} {{researchers have}} long been concerned with determining whether consumers are predisposed towards a preference for domestic products, as opposed to foreign products. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess such a domestic-country bias (DCB) in the German market. Design/methodology/approach - This study empirically investigates DCB across six countries and 14 product categories in the Germany market. By so doing, it replicates an earlier study conducted in the UK. Ordered logit analysis was employed as well as multidimensional unfolding to present results. Findings - As in the study conducted in the UK, there is in general a strong DCB in the German market. However, it differs largely across the 14 product categories. Results indicate that consumer preference rankings can best be explained by a combination of demographic variables and country-of-origin effects. Practical implications - Results indicate that domestic firms in Germany can well rely on a safeguarding effect when marketing their products. At the same time, managers from foreign countries cannot rely on consumer ethnocentrism as a reliable indicator of the inclination of consumers to <b>downgrade</b> their <b>products.</b> Originality/value - This study confirms some findings from the UK. However, results from Germany indicate that at least economic competitiveness of the country-of-origin plays a role in determining respondents' judgments.

40|$|In New Zealand, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 1. 7 million hectares of plantation forestry, with the primary tree species being Pinus radiata. The forestry industry and researchers in New Zealand are concentrated on finding an efficacious, economic, and environmentally sound method of preventing blue stain in P. radiata and other tree species. New Zealand relies on the exportation of wood and wood products, therefore {{it is not only}} crucial that blue stain is prevented to minimize the amount of <b>downgraded</b> wood <b>products</b> but also that the quarantine risk associated with blue stain fungi to export destinations is recognized. In order to address these concerns, a concentrated attempt to identify species of blue stain fungi present in New Zealand was undertaken starting in 1996 and lasting about 10 years. From this research, 13 known species of ophiostomatoid fungi and several unidentified species were isolated from various wood sources. Several were associated with the introduced bark beetles Hylastes after and Hylurgus ligniperda. The role of these beetles in vectoring fungi to logs was previously known, but recent research identified a role for H. after as a vector of these fungi to P. radiata seedlings during feeding attempts. The effects of New Zealand blue stain fungi on the structural integrity of P. radiata was evaluated, and it was concluded that these fungi only produce cosmetic, non-degradative defects in wood...|$|R
40|$|Carding is {{the first}} and only machine (in card process) which can {{eliminate}} neps, seed coat neps and the remaining impurities which cannot be eliminated by blowroom section. In case of carding machine the higher the production rate, the more sensitive the carding operation and the greater danger of negative influence onquality. So the optimization of speed is the prime factor today [1]. Excessive higher speed can lead to fiberdamage and higher neps generation which will <b>downgrade</b> the final <b>product.</b> Again lower speed will reduce production rate which is not acceptable. So {{we need to find out}} the optimum speed which results best for both production rate and quality. In carding machine actual carding action takes place between the cylinder and flats[1].

Flow curves showed a power law profile, characteristic of a shear-thinning behaviour. Moreover, stress/strain curves obtained at a constant biaxial extension rate showed a strain-hardening behaviour. Structural changes in the matrix during eye growth giving higher resistance towards deformation were indicated, and a schematisation of microstructure changes due to eye growth was postulated. Some threshold values were also identified during ripening, such as the biaxial yielding stress and strain; these were not impacted by cheese age or by the anisotropic organisation of the matrix. However, the yielding strain and Young's modulus increased with the biaxial extension rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to apply on-line continuous sensors in food processing, in particular in cheese and milk powder manufacture, in order to improve process control, for example, by achieving higher quality, increased yields, reduced losses and less <b>downgrading</b> of <b>product.</b> This project focused on technologies for monitoring rheologyrelated parameters. The main conclusions were as follows: * Seven systems for monitoring curd formation in cheesemaking were evaluated in the laboratory. * Two on-line systems for monitoring curd firmness (hot-wire and NIR reflectance) have been deployed in a commercial cheese plant with promising results. * Experimental results demonstrated that NIR reflectance / transmission probes have a potential for on-line application in cheesemaking. Despite the difference in scale, the commercial sensors compared well with the cheesemaker s observation of curd firming and look promising as an objective means of predicting curd cut time in an industrial cheese plan. * A detailed knowledge of the rheological variation in cheese curd has been developed and a means of investigating factors which influence the rheology of cheese curd (e. g. effect of heat treatment or fortification of cheesemilk) has been determined. * Technologies available for monitoring concentrate viscosity changes in the production of milk powder have been assembled at pilot scale, and initial trials have been encouraging.

The aims of this study are explore the effects of xenic and axenic rearing conditions on the seabass larvae and check whether the rearing condition has a different ef-fect as larvae grow older. The larvae of seabass larvae, Dicentrarchus labrax L. (Teleostea, Moronidae), were reared under xenic and axenic rearing conditions up to fourteenth day after hatching (DAH). The size and shape were analyses for specimens of three age groups: DAH zero, four and 12. The growth comparison was done based on length measurements. For specimens of DAH zero and four, the total length, gut length, predorsal fin length, yolk sac length and height were measured. For specimens of DAH 12 the total length, standard length, gut length, dorsal fin fold length and height, anal fin fold length and height, preanal fin fold length, predorsal fin fold length, eye diameter, head height, hind gut length and notochord diameter were measured. The average measurements for these metric variables were lower in axenic specimens than xenic ones suggesting better performance in xenic treat-ment. The variations in body shape were studied and quantified using geometric morphometrics. The results showed significant differences in shape between the xenic and axenic specimens at all age groups. Thus, the importance of lar-val rearing conditions in determining seabass shape and quality is evident. Key words/phrases: seabass, aquaculture, body deformity, geometric morphometric...|$|R
40|$|In most of {{industrial}} processes, the measurement {{are central to}} the process control and quality management. This become even truer when measurement data are used to develop and support PHM strategies. In this context, many software are installed in order to collect data for providing quality assessment at each step of the manufacturing process. However, measurement error or drift are not considered leading to <b>downgrading</b> / rejected <b>products</b> / suboptimal running conditions that comes from measurement drift not detected on time. In concrete, these lead to bigger penalty than losses of production due to stopping time for repairing sensors. Indeed, generally speaking, process data is the “raw material ” for many business processes, starting from process control strategy, PHM strategies to Business Intelligence. Thus being able to ensure data quality and reliability is of first importance. Towards this end, methods and tools are required to support online measurement monitoring, predictive diagnosis and reliability enhancement. In this paper, a dedicated approach developed in collaboration with ArcelorMittal Research is presented. It consists in the development of intelligent software that would enable sensor measurement validation taking into account process parameters and operational conditions. An illustrative case study is extracted from an ongoing application developed for the finishing line in ArcelorMittal plant at Florange in France.

40|$|The Murray Basin {{region of}} southeastern Australia {{represents}} {{the remains of}} a shallow inland sea and contains heavy mineral sand placer deposits typically comprising the primary economic minerals ilmenite (FeTiO 3), altered ilmenite, rutile (TiO 2), and zircon (ZrSiO 4). Rutile and zircon are easily separable from the bulk heavy mineral concentrate and are currently extracted from deposits. The ilmenite component remains largely unexploited due to its wide spectrum of chemical alteration (making a clean separation difficult) and the presence of impurity mineral grains; mainly, chrome spinel (general formula AB 2 O 4; A 2 + = divalent cation e. g. Fe, Mg, Mn; B 3 + = trivalent cation e. g. Cr, Al, Fe 3 +). The presence of even a minor amount of chromia (Cr 2 O 3 < 0. 05 %) in the ilmenite <b>product</b> <b>downgrades</b> its market value. While magnetic separation is usually an effective method to achieve a clean separation between ilmenite and chrome spinel, this procedure is not effective for the Murray Basin material as there is a considerable overlap in the magnetic susceptibility properties of both mineral phases [1]. Pownceby et al. [2] recently suggested a potential method for separating chrome spinels from ilmenite which involved changing the physical properties of the individual chrome spinel grains through a sulphidising roast treatment. The aim of the current work is to analyse the sulfidation treatment of chrome spinel as a new route for chrome spinel removal from the Murray Basin ilmenite concentrates. This study comprises two phases of investigation: (1) a systematic thermodynamic assessment of equilibrium reactions in the Fe-Cr-Ti-O-S system to evaluate the effect of composition, temperature, and partial pressures of sulfur and oxygen, and, (2) selected experimental investigations using natural ilmenite and chromite samples to test the findings from the thermodynamic calculations...|$|R
40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004 The steel {{industry}} is characterised by heavy fluctuations in product demand and fierce competition from players across the globe. It {{is for this}} reason, important for Highveld Steel {{to ensure that their}} strategic decisions are both effective {{and that there is a}} good fit between market conditions and strategies. In this report, the product diversity strategy of Highveld Steel regarding coiled products is evaluated against its efficiency in generating positive contribution margins towards company profitability. This was done by developing a model to quantify the real contribution margin of all coil products produced. In this model, processing time, <b>product</b> <b>downgrading</b> costs and the cost of production downtime due to production delays were quantified and a formula was derived to calculate the cumulative effect of all these variables on product cost. This formula was applied to historical yield information available for the past four years of production. From this, the real contribution of different product categories were calculated and used to identify products with negative or small contribution margins on the one side, as well as products with large contribution margins on the other. It was found that 15 % of all products produced by strip mill at present, have a negative contribution margin and should for that reason, not be produced. The information gathered from the application of the model was used to furnish recommendations on how Highveld's marketing and production departments should go about improving the contribution of coiled products to company profitability. It was proven empirically that Highveld could, in applying the recommendations furnished in this report, generate extra annual contribution on coil products of between 14 and 37 %. The strategy developed was recommended as an interim strategy and it was further recommended that the model developed should be continuously applied and used on a monthly basis to evaluate order acceptance strategies to ensure a good fit between these strategies and prevailing market conditions.

40|$|In Australia and New Zealand Pinus radiata D. Don wood {{quality is}} {{receiving}} increasing interest from tree breeders. This is {{partly due to}} declining resource wood quality associated with more advanced generation breeds leading to increased rejection and <b>product</b> <b>downgrading</b> in processing. While log segregation and wood grading at mill-door yields immediate benefits to processors the underlying cause is not addressed. The only long-term solution is to include wood quality in breeding programs. Wood quality traits are costly and difficult to measure. Marker-assisted selection offers a potential solution and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies have been undertaken with the aim of facilitating this. It is becoming increasingly clear that in widely outcrossing species with long generation times and very large genomes these approaches will not work. The identification of the underlying genetic sites, or tightly linked marker sites, would rectify this and in model species linkage-map based cloning has been used extensively. This approach is also not practical in species such as P. radiata. Association testing combined with a candidate-gene approach is therefore widely believed {{to be one of the}} only methods remaining. This approach uses a priori information to select and then test the phenotypic effects of variants within candidate-gene loci. Implementation of these studies relies heavily on the results of other investigations, especially those that generate DNA sequence information. Also required is detailed knowledge of the genetic population structure, the patterns of nucleotide diversity and the patterns of linkage disequilibrium. On a more practical level suitable populations need to be identified while the current methods for the collection and handling of samples for molecular investigations are limiting. The selection of candidate genes is also a non-trivial process. For candidate-gene association studies to be successful in P. radiata all these factors need to be addressed. This formed the main aim of this thesis. A multi-pronged approach was used. Firstly, at the population level, the genetic resources available for association studies were identified and the underlying genetic population structure of these resources and the patterns of nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium were investigated. Secondly, improved methods for the collection and isolation of genomic DNA were developed and thirdly, a small set of wood quality candidate-genes were selected and further characterised with the aim of identifying those with the most promise of harbouring causative variation for inclusion in future association studies. This was achieved by literature based review, linkage mapping onto wood property QTL maps and neutrality testing. Results include support for previous population genetic studies showing P. radiata to have a complex genetic structure compared to most pine species. This study also indicated significant levels of migration between the three mainland populations. Within the candidate-genes two, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and sucrose synthase, showed interesting patterns of population differentiation and/or nucleotide diversity while the results for one other gene, korrigan, did not agree with previous investigations.
