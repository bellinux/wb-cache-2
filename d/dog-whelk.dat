50|$|In Ireland, on {{the island}} of Inishkea North, Co. Mayo, archaeologists found a whelk-dyeing workshop, dated to the 7th century AD, {{complete}} with a small, presumed vat, and a pile of broken-open <b>dog-whelk</b> shells. Unfortunately, no such workshop is known from Britain for the Early Medieval period. However, a double-checked trace of bromine, indicating the presence of whelk-dye, has been found on one page of an Anglo-Saxon book known as the Barberini Gospels. This manuscript dates to the late 8th or early 9th century AD, and the whelk dye occurs as a background panel to white lettering at the beginning of St John’s gospel. Efforts have also been made to find whelk dye on surviving fragments of Anglo-Saxon textiles, but the chemical analyses so far carried out have proved negative for bromine.|$|E

40|$|The {{exposure}} {{of humans and}} wildhfe to exogenous chemicals is increasing annually, {{and it has been}} recognised for many years that some of these chemicals may be capable of disrupting the endocrine system, and causing detrimental effects. However {{little is known about the}} mechanisms behind these processes. Many endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC's) are reactive chemicals that exhibit multiple mechanisms of toxicity by acting at different sites within the body and there is increasing evidence to suggest that many of them have carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunotoxic, or neurotoxic potential (Choi et al., 2004). Tributyltin is one of best known EDC's and evidence is accumulating to suggest that this compound is genotoxic. It is unclear how this compound causes genetic toxicity. It was previously unclear whether the toxicity seen was caused directly by the compound itself, or by increasing the testosterone titres in exposed organisms. Evidence suggested that increased testosterone titres were the major cause of genetic damage (Tillmann et al., 2001). This study shows that all damage cannot be attributed to testosterone alone, and that TBT is capable of causing genetic toxicity by some other mechanism. To prove this, adult <b>dog-whelks</b> (Nucella lapillus) were exposed to testosterone, and TBT, with and without the presence of an androgen blocker, cyproterone acetate (CPA). Results showed a significant decrease in genetic damage with the inclusion of CPA in the testosterone exposures, but the extent of damage reduction was not seen when CPA was added to the TBT exposures. This shows that testosterone cannot be solely responsible for all the genetic damage seen in TBT exposed <b>dog-whelks.</b> A possible alternative mechanism by which TBT may be genotoxic is through the induction of endonucleases via disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis (Orrenius et al., 1992).

40|$|Candidate: Philip Lionel Pascoe Title: Chromosomal {{variation}} in Nucella lapillus (L.) and other muricid gastropods The Robertsonian polymorphism (numerical {{change in the}} chromosome complement by centric fusion or fission) in the <b>dog-whelk</b> (Nucella lapillus, Mollusca: Gastropoda) has been known and studied sporadically for almost 50 years. However, the possible causes, consequences and proposed correlations of this phenomenon remain enigmatic. Nucella lapillus (2 n = 26 to 36), has undergone a marked reduction in chromosome number from its ancestral form; most other muricid species have a diploid chromosome number in the range 2 n = 60 - 70. Correlations have been proposed between chromosome number (or karyotype) and habitat (wave exposure), and also directly or indirectly with allozymes, shell shape and physiology.

40|$|International audienceMost neogastropod species exhibit masculinization of {{the female}} when subject to {{tributyltin}} (TBT) pollution (a process known as 'imposex'). To date, the <b>dog-whelk</b> Nucella lapillus is seemingly unique in having a genetic deficiency (termed Dumpton syndrome or DS) that disrupts the development of normal male sex organs, its presence being readily recognizable by the underdevelopment, or non-development (aphally), of the penis, and incomplete formation (non-closure) of the vas deferens, causing a split prostate. In highly contaminated conditions, female carriers of DS can be identified by a lesser degree of masculinization (notably aphally) : they escape sterilization caused by the advanced stages of imposex. To date, DS has only been reported in areas with high TBT pollution which induces sterilization of normal females (i. e. non DS-affected females). DS is now, for the first time, observed at some locations where present TBT levels are low and some normal females lack penis development. In such conditions {{it is not possible}} to discriminate normal from DS-affected females using aphally. As DS-affected females must be discarded from the calculation of the imposex bioindicators to monitor TBT pollution, indirect tools such as molecular probe are now needed to further survey those areas where DS and TBT pollution may interact as, for example, in south-west Brittany...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} that indicates common environmental pollutants are capable of disrupting reproductive and developmental processes by interfering with the actions of endogenous hormones. Many reports of endocrine disruption describe changes in the normal development of organs and tissues that are consistent with genetic damage, and recent studies confirm that many chemicals classified to have hormone-modulating effects also possess carcinogenic and mutagenic potential. To date, however, there have been no conclusive examples linking genetic damage with perturbation of endocrine function and adverse effects in vivo.

A strong association was found between TBT body burden and the prevalence of abnormal growths, thereby providing compelling evidence to support the hypothesis that environmental chemicals that affect reproductive processes do so partly through DNA damage pathways.

40|$|Abstract This paper first {{reports the}} {{occurrence}} and fate of monobutyltin, dibutyltin, tributyltin, monophenyltin, diphenyltin and triphenyltin {{in drinking water}} from north China. The sum of the six organotins in raw water and drinking water ranged from 33. 3 to 476. 9 ng Sn L- 1 and from no detection to 142. 4 ng Sn L- 1, respectively. The highest concentration of triphenyltin in drinking water and raw water were 41. 3, 44. 6 ng Sn L- 1, and those for tri-butyltin were 32. 1, 37. 6 ng Sn L- 1, respectively, which were observed from April to July. Conventional treatment processes and advanced treatment processes could not remove organotins completely. Keywords Drinking water Tributyltin Triphenyltin Advanced treatment Organotin compounds, especially tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) have been proven to be highly toxic to aqueous life and disturb the cell energy metabolism (Fent 1996) and the endocrine especially for dogwhelk (Nucella lapillus; Gibbs et al. 1991 a). TBT and TPT pollution are known to induce various symptoms on the affected organisms, like failure of spat in oysters (Alzieu et al. 1986), impotence in neogastropods and gastropods (Bryan et al. 1988; Gibbs et al. 1991 b) and reduction of the <b>dog-whelk</b> population (Gibbs et al. 1991 a). Organotins are also hazardous to humans, and butyltin and phenyltin com-pounds are both immunotoxic to human NK (natural killer) cells under in vitro experiments (Whalen et al. 2000). The estimated tolerable daily intake (TDI) value for TBTO and TPT acetate is 0. 25 lg kg- 1 body weight as prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO 1999) and 0. 4 lg per kg body weight as prescribed by the German Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veteri-nary Medicine (BGVV 2000), respectively. Organotins {{are some of the}} most widely used organo-metallic compounds, and their world output has multiplied almost tenfold in the past 40 years, increasing from 5, 000 tons in 1955 to approximately 50, 000 tons in 1994 (Fent 1996). TBT is used worldwide as a biocide in antifouling paints on ships and in wood protection, and its global pollution has been well documented (Fent and Hunn 1995...|$|E
40|$|The Robertsonian {{polymorphism}} (numerical {{change in}} the chromosome complement by centric fusion or fission) in the <b>dog-whelk</b> (Nucella lapillus, Mollusca: Gastropoda) has been known and studied sporadically for almost 50 years. However, the possible causes, consequences and proposed correlations of this phenomenon remain enigmatic. Nucella lapillus (2 n = 26 to 36), has undergone a marked reduction in chromosome number from its ancestral form; most other muricid species have a diploid chromosome number in the range 2 n = 60 - 70. Correlations have been proposed between chromosome number (or karyotype) and habitat (wave exposure), and also directly or indirectly with allozymes, shell shape and physiology. However, firm conclusions are lacking due to either, insufficient knowledge of the karyotypes in the populations studied, {{or the fact that}} any correlations are not consistent throughout the broad geographic range. This study reviews all the past research on the chromosomal polymorphism in N. lapillus, advances the karyology of this species by successfully labelling individual chromosomes through silver-staining of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with rDNA and telomeric probes, and proposes a new system of nomenclature for this polymorphism. Knowledge of the geographic variation in chromosome number and karyotype is advanced by studying around 70 populations throughout the range of N. lapillus (mainly in the UK, but also the USA and northern and southern Europe). Evidence is shown that, (1) the polymorphism is far more widespread geographically than was previously thought; (2) more than five pairs of metacentric chromosomes are involved in the Robertsonian polymorphism; and (3) inversions also occur in some populations. Putative links between chromosomal polymorphism in N. lapillus and Darwinian fitness are reviewed {{in the light of the}} new findings and more recent work on other species; data are presented on fecundity, fertility, inter- and intra-individual variation in karyotype, selection within populations (adults v. embryos, homo- v. heterozygotes) and a possible genetic/karyotypic link with phenotype (Dumpton syndrome, a reproductive abnormality). Cytogenetic records for other muricids are also reviewed and karyotypes and chromosome lengths of four other species (Ocenebra erinacea, Thais haemastoma, Murex trunculus, Ocinebrina aciculata) are recorded for the first time. Genome size (DNA content) of 8 species of muricid, including the 2 n= 26 and 2 n= 36 forms of N. lapillus, are determined by Feulgen densitometry and compared in the context of evolutionary studies on the family. Although chromosome number and haploid length in N. lapillus has been reduced, its genome size is actually greater than all but one of the other muricids studied, and consequently has a much higher DNA packing ratio (> 13000). Whether the chromosomal variation in N. lapillus represents polymorphism, polytypy, or speciation in progress remains unresolved, but substantial advances have been made in this dissertation and the required direction and focus for future work are clarified.
