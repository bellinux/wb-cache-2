25|$|In the 1960s Bernard Pietenpol {{began to}} favor {{converted}} engines from Chevrolet Corvair automobiles. The Corvair engine was smoother, stronger and significantly lighter in weight {{compared to the}} Model A, as the Corvair automobiles used air-cooled, flat-six configuration engines, similar in design to those already available (in generally larger displacements) for general aviation use. The length of a Pietenpol varies with the engine choices, as engines that are lighter than the Fords need to be mounted further out from the firewall for weight and balance reasons. Over the years over 30 different engines have flown in the Pietenpol Air Camper. Many modern Pietenpol builders prefer Continental A65, C85 or C90 air-cooled <b>flat</b> <b>four</b> powerplants. Several examples of the Aircamper have been built in Europe and are currently (2012) flying.|$|E
500|$|There were 21 {{stages in}} the race, {{covering}} a total distance of , [...] shorter than the 2011 Tour. The longest mass-start stage was the twelfth at , and stage 21 was the shortest at [...] The race featured twice the time trialling distance of the previous Tour, a total of , with the prologue, stage nine and stage nineteen. Of the remaining stages, nine were officially classified as <b>flat,</b> <b>four</b> as medium mountain and five as high mountain. There were three summit finishes: stage 7, to La Planche des Belles Filles; stage 11, to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles; and stage 17, to Peyragudes. The Col du Grand Colombier, in the Alps, was included for the first time, and was among six hors catégorie (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. The highest point of the race was the -high Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage sixteen. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage nine, in Mâcon, and fifteen, in Pau.|$|E

2500|$|The first Tundra flew on 12 May 2001, {{powered by}} a 134kW (180hp) Textron Lycoming O-360-A <b>flat</b> <b>four</b> engine.

[...] Other {{alterations}} {{were made to the}} later aircraft, principally to the undercarriage (the prototype had wheels mounted on faired V-struts with bungee sprung half-axles), to the cabin doors for ease of access, to the tailplane and fin for ease of building and by the addition of a double cabin floor for better sound insulation.|$|E
50|$|The Tétras {{has been}} {{fitted with a}} variety of engines; {{originally}} the 54 kW (72 hp) Humbert-Volkswagen HW 2000 was used. More recently two <b>flat</b> <b>fours</b> from the Rotax range, the 60 kW (80 hp) 912 UL or the 74 kW (98 hp) 912 ULS, have become standard choices.|$|R

50|$|Julius Lodge, {{originally}} named Nanmara, {{was built}} for Mr RS Melloy and Miss BE Nichols, and plans were approved by the BCC in November 1934. The building was described {{at the time of}} construction as being two-storeyed of brick and fibro construction with a tile roof. The building contained eight <b>flats,</b> <b>four</b> <b>flats</b> per floor, and each flat contained one bedroom, a living room, kitchen, bathroom and verandah. The contractor was Mr S Conwell of Holland Park, and the building was constructed at a cost of £2420. No architect has been identified.
