The more someone knows about the Internet, its history and politics, the more likely the term <b>internaut</b> fits them. The less he or she knows the more likely a different term would be more fitting. Other terms roughly analogous with <b>internaut</b> are cybernaut and netizen, though each has its own connotation.

40|$|This article ponders on the {{competencies}} and the positive approach Information Professionals {{need to work}} on the emergent web. It focuses on the epistemological aspect, thus analyzing forms of knowledge production: heuristic and hermeneutic. The former is based on primary principles, under which searches are carried out. Those searches lead to results that will aid in the advancement of knowledge. By hermeneutic approach we understand the circulation of meanings built on partial, individual and sectorial interpretations. This work considers how these approaches appear in the present Web, in light of the difference between an <b>internaut</b> of the original Web and one of Web 2. 0. It {{is not so much the}} informatics tools that vary, but the way in which these are used and innovated on, even with a limited knowledge.

40|$|Part 3 : WebInternational audienceDuring {{the visit}} to any website, the average <b>internaut</b> may face scripts that upload {{personal}} information to so called online trackers, invisible third party services that collect information about users and profile them. This is no news, and many works in the past tried to measure the extensiveness of this phenomenon. All of them ran active measurement campaigns via crawlers. In this paper, we observe the phenomenon from a passive angle, to naturally factor {{the diversity of the}} Internet and of its users. We analyze a large dataset of passively collected traffic summaries to observe how pervasive online tracking is. We see more than 400 tracking services being contacted by unaware users, of which the top 100 are regularly reached by more than 50  % of Internauts, with top three that are practically impossible to escape. Worse, more than 80  % of users gets in touch the first tracker within 1 second after starting navigating. And {{we see a lot of}} websites that hosts hundreds of tracking services. Conversely, those popular web extensions that may improve personal protection, e. g., DoNotTrackMe, are actually installed by a handful of users (3. 5  %). The resulting picture witnesses how pervasive the phenomenon is, and calls for an increase of the sensibility of people, researchers and regulators toward privacy in the Internet...|$|E
40|$|Prefetching {{is a basic}} {{mechanism}} to avoid to waste time when accessing data. However, a tradeoff must be established {{between the amount of}} network's resources wasted by the prefetching and the gain of time. For instance, in the Web, browsers may download documents in advance while an <b>Internaut</b> is surfing on the Web. Since the web surfer follows the hyperlinks in an unpredictable way, the choice of the web pages to be prefetched must be computed online. The question is then to determine the minimum amount of resources used by prefetching and that ensures that all documents accessed by the web surfer have previously been loaded in the cache. We model this problem as a game similar to Cops and Robber Games in graphs. A fugitive starts on a marked vertex of a (di) graph G. Turn by turn, an observer marks at most k >= 1 vertices and then the fugitive can move along one edge/arcs of G. The observer wins if he prevents the fugitive to reach an unmarked vertex. The fugitive wins otherwise, i. e., if she enters an unmarked vertex. The surveillance number of a graph is the least k >= 1 allowing the observer to win whatever the fugitive does. We also consider the connected variant of this game, i. e., when a vertex can be marked only if it is adjacent to an already marked vertex. All our results hold for both variants, connected or not. We show that deciding whether the surveillance number of a chordal graph equals 2 is NP-hard. Deciding if the surveillance number of a DAG equals 4 is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, computing the surveillance number is NP-hard in split graphs. On the other hand, we provide polynomial time algorithms to compute surveillance number of trees and interval graphs. Moreover, in the case of trees, we establish a combinatorial characterization, related to isoperimetry, of the surveillance number...|$|E
