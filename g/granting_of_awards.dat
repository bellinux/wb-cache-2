40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new unit established to provide extended and integrated student support, and the re-engineering of systems and processes in response to the changing educational environment and new market needs. As a form of reflection on professional practice, the paper provides examples of projects undertaken to meet strategic goals. The concept of reflective practice is based on the theory that complex situations &quot;are best dealt with by people who can flexibly and intuitively draw on their knowledge of practice (or their informal theory) rather than apply rules drawn from formal theory &quot; (Hackett, 2001 p 51). Education and training providers now operate in an increasingly competitive environment. Accessibility of the Internet, an increase in private provider activity in response to demands for 'just-in-time (JIT), 'just-for-me ' (JFM) training, and demands for flexible education delivery options, are changing and challenging institutions world-wide. Ruttenbur, Spikler and Lurie's commissioned report on world trends in e-learning documents an array of commercial and traditional providers competing in the global training and education marketplace and confirms that the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>awards</b> is no longer limited to universities and post-secondary institutes [Ruttenbur, 2000].

40|$|The {{traditional}} 2 ̆ 2 American Rule 2 ̆ 2 regarding attorney fees did {{not allow}} for prevailing parties to collect attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees from the unsuccessful party. In response to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Alyeska v. Wilderness Society, which reaffirmed the American Rule and its limited exceptions, Congress passed the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Award Act of 1976. In its wake, courts began awarding attorneys fees to prevailing parties. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Hensley v. Eckerhart, focused on {{the correlation between the}} degree of success of prevailing plaintiffs and the amount of the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees awarded. This Article discusses the effects on fee awards of the concepts of 2 ̆ 2 reasonableness 2 ̆ 2 in the circuits employing the elements set forth in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc. and other criteria between the time of Alyeska Hensley. Next, it sets forth the special circumstances which may preclude the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>awards,</b> examines the Hensley decision, and considers some recent trends in fee awards resulting from Hensley. This Article concludes that Hensley fails to clarify the problem of attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees for the partially prevailing plaintiff but is important as a reaffirmation of Alyeska and the American Rule...|$|E
