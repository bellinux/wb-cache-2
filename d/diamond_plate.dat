2500|$|After {{completing}} Fear of Music, Talking Heads {{embarked on}} their first Pacific region tour in June 1979 and played concerts in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii. The album was released worldwide on 3August. The LP sleeve was designed by band member Jerry Harrison. It is completely black and embossed with a pattern that resembles the appearance and texture of <b>diamond</b> <b>plate</b> metal flooring. The rest of the artwork was crafted by Byrne and includes heat-sensitive photography created by Jimmy Garcia {{with the help of}} Doctor Philip Strax. Harrison suggested the [...] "ludicrous" [...] title to the band. According to Weymouth, it was accepted because it [...] "fit" [...] with the album's themes {{and the fact that the}} quartet was under a lot of stress and pressure when making it.|$|E

[...] Known as the Limited Edition (LE) these Land Rover Defender 90’s were painted with a unique one year color known as Willow Green with a contrasting white accented roof; they were also fitted with body protection {{in the form of}} 5 large diamond plated sheets and an external safety cage with a full roof rack. [...] The 1997 Land Rover Defender 90 LE also came with the following options as standard equipment: [...] Air conditioning, rear ladder, rear step, twin tube running boards with <b>diamond</b> <b>plate</b> trim, front A bar and a limited edition placard which was affixed {{to the rear of the}} car that denoted its build number out of 300.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{assessment of the}} sputter resistance of polycrystalline <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> against xenon ion bombardment is reported, and first studies of integrating diamond walls into a Hall discharge channel are performed. The polycrystalline diamond is {{found to have a}} 25 % better resistance to sputtering than boron nitride, a more commonly used Hall thruster wall material. The <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> were integrated into a linear Hall thruster with an open electron drift. In comparison to a similar Hall thruster with boron nitride walls, the diamond containing discharge had an overall lower discharge current, but resulted in a slightly lower propellant utilization. However, unlike the case with boron nitride walls, operation with the diamond walls was limited to 200 V or higher, due to the emergence of large-scale fluctuations at lower voltages...|$|R

2500|$|The {{football}} team used nine different football combinations in the 2005 season, but introduced even more combinations in the 2006 season.

40|$|Single-crystal <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> with {{surfaces}} oriented in a (111) crystal plane {{are required}} for high-performance solid-state device platforms ranging from power electronics to quantum information processing architectures. However, producing plates with this orientation has proven challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for reliably and precisely fabricating (111) -faced plates from commercially available, chemical-vapor-deposition-grown, type-IIa single-crystal diamond substrates with (100) faces. Our method uses a nanosecond-pulsed visible laser to nucleate and propagate a mechanical cleave in a chosen (111) crystal plane, resulting in faces as large as 3. 0 mm× 0. 3 mm with atomically flat surfaces, negligible miscut angles, and near zero kerf loss. We discuss the underlying physical mechanisms of the process along with potential improvements that will enable the production of millimeter-scale (111) -faced single-crystal <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> {{for a variety of}} emerging devices and applications.

5000|$|A <b>diamond</b> <b>plate</b> is a steel plate, {{sometimes}} {{mounted on}} a plastic or resin base, coated with diamond grit, an abrasive that will grind metal. When they are mounted they are sometimes known as diamond stones. [...] The plate may {{have a series of}} holes cut in it that capture the swarf cast off as grinding takes place, and cuts costs by reducing the amount of abrasive surface area on each plate. Diamond plates can serve many purposes including sharpening steel tools, and for maintaining the flatness of man-made waterstones, which can become grooved or hollowed in use. Truing (flattening a stone whose shape has been changed as it wears away) is widely considered essential to the sharpening process but some hand sharpening techniques utilise the high points of a non-true stone. As the only part of a <b>diamond</b> <b>plate</b> to wear away is a very thin coating of grit and adhesive, and in a good <b>diamond</b> <b>plate</b> this wear is minimal due to diamond's hardness, a <b>diamond</b> <b>plate</b> retains its flatness. Rubbing the <b>diamond</b> <b>plate</b> on a whetstone to true (flatten) the whetstone is a modern alternative to more traditional truing methods.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our recent}} {{efforts in the}} integration of thick plate polycrystalline chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond into Stationary Plasma Thruster channel for improved wear resistance. Prior tests on laboratory Hall discharges indicated that CVD diamond has significant erosion resistance compared to the more commonly used boron nitride ceramics. Here, we extend our studies further, and have designed and have carried out preliminary tests of a diamond replacement nose cone on a commercial, space-qualified, BHT- 200 low power Hall thruster. A preliminary performance test verified that {{the introduction of the}} diamond nose cone resulted in nearly identical levels of thrust, efficiency, and specific impulse, within experimental uncertainty. The operation on diamond resulted in a minor increase in current, most likely due to the rougher shape of the diamond test nose cone assembly, or of the use of an alumina fastener for mating the assembly to the central pole piece of the thruster. Future diamond assemblies will consist of <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> that are brazed together for improved mechanical and thermal performance. In parallel, we have developed and performed initial vibration testing of brazed <b>diamond</b> <b>plates,</b> to verify the mechanical integrity of the proposed (brazed) diamond nose cone assembly. Broadband sine-sweep testing at 1 / 3 gRMS of two 6. 1 mm × 5. mm × 1 mm brazed <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> showed a nearly rigid frequency response over the range of 20 - 2000 Hz, with some resonances at higher frequencies, outside of the normal environmental testing range. Extended vibrations at 20 Hz, and at 3. 7 gRMS showed no noticeable shifts or degradation in the frequency response of the structure...|$|R

40|$|We {{have tested}} the first diamond double-crystal {{monochromator}} at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The monochromator {{consisted of two}} synthetic type lb (111) <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> in symmetric Bragg geometry. We tested two pairs of single-crystal plates: the first pair was 6 mm by 5 mm by 0. 25 mm and 6 mm by 5 mm by 0. 37 mm; the second set was 7 mm by 5. 5 mm by 0. 44 mm. The monochromator first crystal was indirectly cooled by edge contact with a water-cooled copper holder. We studied {{the performance of the}} monochromator under the high-power x-ray beam delivered by the APS undulator A. We found no indication of thermal distortions or strains even at the highest incident power (280 watts) and power density (123 W/mm{sup 2 } at normal incidence). The calculated maximum power and power density absorbed by the first crystal were 37 watts and 16 W/mm{sup 2 } respectively. We also compared the maximum intensity delivered by the diamond monochromator and by a silicon (111) cryogenically cooled monochromator. For energies in the range of 6 to 10 keV, the flux through the diamond monochromator was about a factor of two less than through the silicon monochromator, in good agreement with calculations. We conclude that water-cooled diamond monochromators can handle the high-power beams from the undulator beams from the undulator beamlines at the APS. As single-crystal <b>diamond</b> <b>plates</b> of larger size and better quality become available, the use of diamond monochromators will become a very attractive option...|$|R
