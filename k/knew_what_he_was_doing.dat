He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E

The court also denied a motion to gag the defendant's former representatives from the Public Defenders Office from speaking about the case, especially to the media.|$|E
25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, never would have let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{points out}} that, {{although}} it was said half-jokingly, so far as Shankly was concerned there was a degree of truth in what he had said. Shankly had fully realised the importance of football to its die-hard fans, himself included. It had become [...] "too important". Ian St John agreed that [...] "much of Shankly's behaviour was bizarre", but everything was done with a purpose because [...] "Shankly always <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> {{and what he was}} saying".|$|E
500|$|According to a Scientology publication, Moxon {{utilized}} Scientology doctrine {{to bring}} about the demise of the Cult Awareness Network. The publication, authored by Scientology official Kurt Weiland, stated: [...] "A civil case was filed by the victim against [...] Ross and the Cult Awareness Network. This time he had an attorney who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> and understood PTS/SP tech! The attorney was a Scientologist and OT [...] Rick Moxon." [...] "PTS/SP tech" [...] is Scientology terminology referring to the organization's founder L. Ron Hubbard's prescribed tactics of handling enemies called [...] "suppressive persons" [...] (SPs) and their associates, called [...] "potential trouble sources" [...] (PTSs). The Cult Awareness Network was seen by Scientology as a [...] "SP" [...] organization.|$|E

"Heartbreak Hotel" [...] was {{the second}} song Presley {{recorded}} at RCA Victor, following [...] "I Got a Woman", during his debut session at 1525 McGavock Street in Nashville on January 10, 1956. Presley arrived at the studio with the song ready to record without seeking RCA's approval, and although producer Steve Sholes was {{not sure that it}} would be a success, he recorded [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] believing that Presley <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band, who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio. Guitar player Scotty Moore later commented, [...] "It was a larger studio than Sun's and more regimented - they called everything by a tape number. We would sit around at Sun, eat hamburgers and then somebody would say, 'Let's try something.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1919, {{the matter}} went to {{consideration}} in Paris before the World War I Allies. Watt claims the Poles based their claims on ethnographical reasons and the Czechs based their need on the Teschen coal, useful {{in order to}} influence the actions of Austria and Hungary, whose capitals were fuelled by coal from the duchy. The Allies finally decided that the Czechs should get 60 percent of the coal fields and the Poles were to get {{most of the people}} and the strategic rail line. Watt writes: [...] "Czech envoy Edvard Beneš proposed a plebiscite. The Allies were shocked, arguing that the Czechs were bound to lose it. However, Beneš was insistent and a plebiscite was announced in September 1919. As it turned out, Beneš <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> A plebiscite would take some time to set up, and a lot could happen in that time – particularly when a nation's affairs were conducted as cleverly as were Czechoslovakia's." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Disease of the mind" [...] is not {{a medical}} term; it instead means that the {{defendant}} must show {{he was suffering from}} a disease which affected the functioning of the mind, which does not necessarily have to be a disease of the brain. This was confirmed in the case of R v Kemp [...] 1 QB 399, where the defendant's arteriosclerosis led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious. It must then be shown that this disease of the mind led to a [...] "defect of reason"; that the defendant's ability to reason was impaired by the disease. Alternately, the defendant can try to show {{that he did not know}} [...] "the nature or quality of his act or that it was wrong". The first requires proof that the defendant did not know what he was doing; that he had no awareness of what he was happening, that he was unaware of the consequences of his act or that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> but was deluded as to the circumstances; for the latter, Jonathan Herring gives the example of a man who [...] "thought he was killing a monstrous person when he was in fact killing a person". When arguing that the defendant was [...] "not knowing the act was wrong", [...] "wrong" [...] is taken to mean [...] "illegal", as set out in R v Windle [...] 2 QB 826.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{transportation}} hub, Singapore {{has always been}} a potential transit point for Golden Triangle heroin. In a letter to David Hawker, the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, Abdullah Tarmugi, the Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore, wrote: [...] "He was caught in possession of almost 400 grams of pure heroin, enough for more than 26,000 doses of heroin for drug addicts.... He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> and the consequences of his actions.

2500|$|He liked {{working with}} many of the same {{performers}} for other films, including Elliott Gould, Sally Kellerman, Keith Carradine, Shelley Duvall and Michael Murphy. Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors [...] "who flourish as improvisers," [...] such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, MASH, The Long Goodbye and California Split. Gould recalls that when filming MASH, his first acting job with Altman, he and costar Donald Sutherland didn't think Altman <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> He wrote years later, [...] "I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren't getting Altman's genius." [...] Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman's directing style. René Auberjonois explains: ...|$|E

So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, {{do you have any idea}} how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, in Ohio, 16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of {{his bedroom}} window to {{purchase}} the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father, a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, Ohio, U.S. His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it, and secured it in a lockbox in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun according to prosecutors. In October 2007, Daniel used his father's key to open the lockbox and remove the gun and the game. He then entered {{the living room of}} his house and shot both of them in the head, killing his mother and wounding his father. Petric was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole, which was later commuted to 23 years in prison. Defense attorneys argued that Petric was influenced by video game addiction. The court dismissed these claims. The judge, James Burge, commented that while he thought there was ample evidence the boy <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> Burge thought the game had affected him like a drug, saying [...] "I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Gravano {{and several}} {{other members of the}} Gambino family became disenchanted with Gotti's lust for the media and {{high-profile}} antics, feeling they brought too much heat. Several members of the family informed Gravano that Gotti's high profile and large gatherings of mob members at the Ravenite Social Club were constant targets for the FBI and that the media attention put a large spotlight on the Gambinos. Many members of the family, according to Gravano, complained to him about Gotti's use of Gravano in murders despite Gravano's position as underboss of the family. Members were also concerned about Gotti's frequent appearances in court. He was first tried for assaulting a refrigerator repairman over a parking space. Through witness intimidation, he was acquitted. Gravano had paid a juror in Gotti's second trial to vote in favor of an acquittal allowing Gotti to beat the RICO charges lodged against him. Gotti's third trial on state assault charges ended the same way. Gotti's ego began to bother Gravano as well as several other members of the family. Gotti was first known as the [...] "Dapper Don" [...] in the press for his Brioni suits and hand-painted ties as well as his well-combed hair and quick wit with reporters. Gotti required Gravano and Gambino consigliere Frank LoCascio to be at the Ravenite social club five days a week and all of his captains to make an appearance once a week. When Gravano warned Gotti about the negative attention from reporters as well as the constant surveillance from the FBI, Gotti instructed Gravano not to worry about it, as Gotti said that he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E
