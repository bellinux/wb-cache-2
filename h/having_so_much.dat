5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without <b>having</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as driven a car before; some tank commanders {{were forced to}} teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
25|$|Lopez dives {{into more}} detail about this conflict, {{focusing}} on the death and destruction that Sonnet 60 describes The second quatrain explains life's cycle, presenting the journey from birth to death and from sunrise to eclipse or sunset as ways to explicate the feeling of loss after <b>having</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> It culminates in the pessimism that all that was ever had, has been or will be lost. He explains the third quatrain as the degradation of his fascination's beauty, that the weapons that time methodically uses to slowly strip what the speaker values is a crushing blow. The completeness of time's destruction is made clear as if man's beauty and goodness are created only for time to demolish.|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, my first thought was, 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently. I was <b>having</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun hanging on a wire like Peter Pan, hanging onto a broom and doing other crazy stuff."

2500|$|Mixers, {{disturbed}} by the edicts of the PSC <b>having</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> influence in their daily practice, created the American Chiropractic Association (one of the early precursors to today's ACA). Though born out of necessity to defend against the UCA attacks, the ACA's stated purposes were to advance education and research for chiropractic. Its growth was initially stunted by its resolution to recognize physio-therapy and other modalities as pertaining to chiropractic. What growth did occur was credited to its second president, Frank R. Margetts, DC with support from his alma mater, National Chiropractic College. He insisted that no college administrator could hold an official position in the association, giving doctors in the field a collective voice. But a disagreement within the UCA in 1924 turned the tide for the ACA. B.J. was still working to purge mixers from practicing chiropractic, and he saw a new invention by Dossa D. Evans, the [...] "Neurocalometer" [...] (NCM), {{as the answer to}} all of straight chiropractic's (and particularly PSC's) legal and financial problems. As the owner of the patent on the NCM, he planned {{to limit the number of}} NCMs to 5000 and lease them only to graduates of the Palmer related schools who were members of the UCA. He then claimed that the NCM was the only way to accurately locate subluxations, preventing over 20,000 mixers from being able to defend their method of practice.|$|E
