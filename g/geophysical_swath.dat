40|$|The southernmost {{portion of}} the Macquarie Ridge Complex (MRC) {{comprises}} the Hjort Ridge, Trench, and Plateau, the topographic expression of the Australian-Pacific plate boundary south of New Zealand. On the basis of marine <b>geophysical</b> (<b>swath</b> bathymetry/reflectivity, seismic reflection, gravity, magnetic) data, teleseismic data, and gravity modeling, we argue that the Australian plate is actively underthrusting the Pacific plate along the Hjort Trench, but self-sustaining subduction does not yet appear to have commenced. We interpret a crustal discontinuity in the Trench as a shallowly dipping thrust splay off a sub-vertical transform fault in {{the crest of the}} Hjort Ridge (Hjort Fault). The Hjort Fault separates oceanic crust generated at the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR crust), located to the south, from oceanic crust generated at the extinct Australian-Pacific spreading center located to the north (MRC crust). Oblique convergence on the transform has initiated a significant plate boundary decollement in the Trench, but our estimate of ? 50 km of underthrusting does not support the existence of an eastwardly dipping Australian slab below ? 20 km depth. For the length of the Hjort Ridge and Trench system, oblique convergence is partitioned between the decollement in the Trench and the Hjort Fault. South of 57. 5 °S, the trench decollement accommodates thrusting. North of 57. 5 °S, the boundary-parallel component of convergence becomes dominant, the Trench gradually shallows, and the trench decollement evolves into a low-angle, oblique-slip fault. The trench decollement and strike-slip system in the Hjort Ridge are structural boundaries that contain tectonic slivers of inferred SEIR crust of the western flank of the Hjort Ridge that currently belong to neither the Australian nor the Pacific plate...|$|E

Up to 103 mounds organized in two main clusters have been recognized in a depth range of 299 – 590 m, displaying a high density of 5 mounds/km 2. Mounds, 1 – 48 m high above the surrounding seafloor and on average 260 m wide, are actually buried by a 1 – 12 m thick fine-grained sediment blanket. Seismic data suggest that the West Melilla mounds grew throughout the Early Pleistocene–Holocene, settling on erosive unconformities and mass movement deposits. During the last glacial–interglacial transition, the West Melilla mounds may have suffered a drastic change of the local sedimentary regime during the late Holocene and, unable to stand increasing depositional rates, were progressively buried. At the present day, temperature and salinity values on the West Melilla mounds suggest a plausible oceanographic setting, suitable for live CWCs.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} sediments from the fjords and continental margin of southern Alaska to develop high-resolution climatic and oceanographic {{records for the}} Late Quaternary. Our goal is to better understand linkages between climatic, terrestrial and oceanic systems in this tectonically active and biologically productive region. A field program was conducted aboard the R/V Maurice Ewing in August/September 2004 utilizing <b>geophysical</b> surveys (high-resolution <b>swath</b> bathymetric and backscatter imaging, shallow sub-bottom profiling, and where permitted, high-resolution seismic reflection profiling), piston and multi-coring, and CTD/water sampling at about 30 sites in this region. Cores are being analyzed for sedimentological, microfossil, geochemical and stable isotopic proxies, with chronologies constrained by Pb- 210, AMS radiocarbon, tephrochronolgic and paleomagnetic dating. Our preliminary results demonstrate that these rapidly accumulating sedimentary archives can resolve environmental changes on annual to decadal timescales. Records of recent changes in lithogenic sediment accumulation and biological productivity on the Gulf of Alaska shelf track historical climatic data that extends to the early 20 th century in this region. The records also correlate with multi-decadal climate regimes during the Little Ice Age as suggested by tree-ring, glacial advance and salmon abundance records from nearby coastal sites.

40|$|The Australian-Pacific {{transform}} {{plate boundary}} fault zone along the Macquarie and McDougall {{segments of the}} Macquarie Ridge Complex (MRC), south of New Zealand, is characterized by dominantly normal faults and pull-apart basins, in apparent conflict with the regional transpressional tectonic setting. We propose that present-day curvature of the transform is inherited from a preexisting divergent plate boundary and that the overall extensional kinematics shown by faults along the main plate boundary trace and exposed on Macquarie Island result from local stresses related to right-lateral, right stepping, en echelon plate boundary faults {{and not to the}} current transpressional setting. Transpression along the Australian-Pacific transform plate boundary has resulted in uplift along the ? 1500 km long Macquarie Ridge Complex. Macquarie Island, the only subaerial exposure of the complex, sits atop a ? 5 km high, ? 50 km wide submarine ridge of oceanic crust and lies ? 4. 5 km east of the major active plate boundary fault zone. Thus Macquarie Island and the surrounding seafloor provide a unique opportunity to study an active oceanic transform fault using complementary marine geophysical and land-based geological data. Mapping of recent faults affecting the topography of Macquarie Island shows that the island is extensively cut by high-angle normal faults forming pull-apart basins. Furthermore, evidence for reverse motion is rare. Using marine <b>geophysical</b> data, including <b>swath</b> bathymetry, reflectivity, and seismic reflection data, collected along the Australian-Pacific plate boundary north and south of the island, we have defined a 5 – 15 km wide plate boundary zone. A series of right stepping en echelon faults, within this zone, lies along the main plate boundary trace. At the right stepping fault terminations, elongate depressions (? 10 km wide and 1. 2 km deep) parallel the plate boundary, which we interpret as extensional relay zones or pull-apart basins. We propose that transpression is partitioned into en echelon strike-slip faults at the plate boundary and a convergent component that flexes the crust, causing the anomalous bathymetric ridge and trough morphology of the McDougall and Macquarie segments of the MRC. <br/...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) {{mission is}} European Space Agency (ESA's) second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission, {{launched}} in November 2009. It {{is a joint}} program between ESA Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial. SMOS carries a single payload, an L-Band 2 -D interferometric radiometer in the 1400 - 1427 MHz protected band. This wavelength penetrates well through the atmosphere, and hence the instrument probes the earth surface emissivity. Surface emissivity can then {{be related to the}} moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil, and, after some surface roughness and temperature corrections, to the sea surface salinity over ocean. The goal of the level 2 algorithm is thus to deliver global soil moisture (SM) maps with a desired accuracy of 0. 04 m 3 /m 3. To reach this goal, a retrieval algorithm was developed and implemented in the ground segment which processes level 1 to level 2 data. Level 1 consists mainly of angular brightness temperatures (TB), while level 2 consists of <b>geophysical</b> products in <b>swath</b> mode, i. e., as acquired by the sensor during a half orbit from pole to pole. In this context, a group of institutes prepared the SMOS algorithm theoretical basis documents to be used to produce the operational algorithm. The principle of the SM retrieval algorithm is based on an iterative approach which aims at minimizing a cost function. The main component of the cost function is given by the sum of the squared weighted differences between measured and modeled TB data, for a variety of incidence angles. The algorithm finds the best set of the parameters, e. g., SM and vegetation characteristics, which drive the direct TB model and minimizes the cost function. The end user Level 2 SM product contains SM, vegetation opacity, and estimated dielectric constant of any surface, TB computed at 42. 5 $^{circ}$, flags and quality indices, and other parameters o- interest. This paper gives an overview of the algorithm, discusses the caveats, and provides a glimpse of the Cal Val exercises...|$|R
40|$|The Galicia {{continental}} margin is a magma-poor rifted margin with an extremely complex structure. Its formation involves several rifting episodes during the Mesozoic {{in the vicinity}} of a ridge triple junction, which produces a change in the orientation of the main structures. In addition, there is an overimposed Cenozoic partial tectonic inversion along its northern border. Although this {{continental margin}} has been widely studied since the 70 ’s, most studies have focused on its western part in the transition to the Iberia Abyssal Plain, and there is a significant lack of information on the north and northwestern flanks of this margin. This fact, along with its great structural complexity, has resulted {{in the absence of a}} previous comprehensive regional geodynamic model integrating all the processes observed. In the present study we integrate a large volume of new <b>geophysical</b> data (gravity, <b>swath</b> bathymetry and 2 D multichannel reflection seismic). Data come from the systematic mapping of the Spanish EEZ project which provides a dense grid of gravity data and full seafloor coverage with swath bathymetry, and from the ERGAP project which provides serially-arranged 2 D seismic reflection profiles across the NW Iberia margin. The combined interpretation and modelling of this new information has arisen significant constraints on the origin, the deep crustal structure and the physiographic complexity of the margin, as well as on the characterization of the along- and across-strike variation of the ocean-continent transition along NW Iberia margin. The analysis of this information leads us to propose a conceptual model for the initiation of the tectonic inversion of a magma-poor rifted margin. Finally, a framework for the geodynamic evolution of the Galicia margin has been constructed, involving three main stages: A) an early stage from the end of rifting and oceanic drift in the Bay of Biscay (Santonian); B) an intermediate stage with the beginning of tectonic inversion in the north and northwestern Iberia margin (Campanian-Paleocene) mainly concentrated along the exhumed mantle zone; and C) a final stage of compressive deformation (Eocene-Oligocene) affecting both the continental and the oceanic crust, evidenced by large dip-slip thrusting. 0, 000...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfter the {{successful}} acquisition by a coarse L-band radiometer on board Skylab {{in the early}} seventies, the potential of L-band radiometry was made clear {{in spite of a}} strict limitation linked to minimum antenna dimensions required for appropriate spatial resolution. More than 20 years later new antenna concepts emerged to mitigate this physical constraint. The first to emerge, in 1997, and to become a reality, was the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission (0265; 0270). It is European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission (Kerr et al., 2001), launched in November 2009. It is a joint program between ESA, CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales), and CDTI (Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial). SMOS carries a single payload, an L-band 2 D interferometric radiometer in the 1400 – 1427 MHz protected band. This wavelength penetrates well through the atmosphere, and hence, the instrument probes the Earth surface emissivity from space. Surface emissivity can be related to the moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil, and after some surface roughness and temperature corrections, to the sea surface salinity over ocean. Soil moisture retrieval from SMOS observations with a required accuracy of 0. 04 m 3 /m 3 is challenging and involves many steps. The retrieval algorithms are developed and implemented in the ground segment, which processes level 1 and level 2 data. Level 1 consists mainly of directional brightness temperatures, while level 2 consists of <b>geophysical</b> products in <b>swath</b> mode, i. e., for successive imaging snapshots acquired by the sensor during a half orbit from pole to pole. Level 3 consists in composites of brightness temperatures, or geophysical products over time and space, i. e., global maps over given temporal periods from 1 day to 1 month. In this context, a group of institutes prepared the soil moisture and ocean salinity Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBD), used to in operational soil moisture and sea salinity retrieval algorithms (Kerr et al., 2010 a). The principle of the level 2 soil moisture retrieval algorithm is based on an iterative approach, which aims at minimizing a cost function. The main component of the cost function is given by the sum of the squared weighted differences between measured and modeled brightness temperature (TB) at horizontal and vertical polarizations, for a variety of incidence angles. The algorithm finds the best set of parameters, e. g., soil moisture (SM) and vegetation characteristics, which drive the TB model and minimizes the cost function. From this algorithm, a more sophisticated one was developed to take into account multiorbit retrievals (i. e., level 3). Subsequently, after several years of data acquisition and algorithm improvements, a neural network approach was developed so as to be able to infer soil moisture fields in near-real time. In parallel, several simplified algorithms were tested, the goal being to achieve a seamless transition with other sensors, along with other studies targeted on specific targets such as dense forests, organic rich soils, or frozen and snow-covered grounds. Finally, it may be noted that most of these approaches deliver not only the surface soil moisture but also other quantities of interest such as vegetation optical depth, surface roughness, and surface dielectric constant. The goal {{of this article is to}} give an overview of these different approaches and corresponding results and adequate references for those wishing to go further. Sea surface salinity is not covered in this article, while the focus is SMOS data...|$|R
