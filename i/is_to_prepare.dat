25|$|In essence, Kant’s {{remarks in}} the preface prepare the reader for {{the thrust of the}} ideas he goes on to develop in the Groundwork. The purpose of the Groundwork <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a {{foundation}} for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact which is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, he can only derive the necessity that the moral law requires from a priori reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the Groundwork attempts to establish a pure (a priori) ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility of a moral law and locates what Kant calls the “supreme principle of morality.” The aim of the following sections of the Groundwork is to explain what the moral law would have to be like if it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.|$|E

500|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin. It is {{a profile of}} an Illinois Christian {{fundamentalist}} school—its policies, practices, and participants. Peshkin, then Professor of Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, intended his account to be both impartial and [...] "empathetic". He presents the fundamentalists as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with [...] "formulas for success" [...] opposite [...] "fragmented and defensive" [...] detractors. They believe in [...] "one Truth"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths. A teacher told Peshkin that their job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> students for this [...] "one pattern" [...] of thought. In turn, the community's constituents {{do not wish to}} leave, but appreciate conformity as an end in itself. Peshkin describes the school as a [...] "total institution": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on Erving Goffman's 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school [...] "based on absolute truth". God's Choice was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships. It was published by the University of Chicago Press.|$|E
