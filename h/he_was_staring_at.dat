2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the space between the}} upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E
60|$|The {{man nodded}} absently. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Conger's clothing.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} him, {{surprised}} at the question. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the English shore.|$|E
60|$|We {{know why}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Alice, {{but of course}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> too gallant a gentleman to tell. Besides his astonishment has dazed him.|$|R
60|$|The silvery figure {{among the}} green leaves seems to linger as if hypnotised, though his escape is easy behind him; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the man below.|$|R
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> moodily <b>at</b> the {{elevator}} boy {{and did not}} seem to hear.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Selingman {{sat back}} in his place. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> his {{companion}} with wide-open eyes. Jean Coulois was moistening his lips with his tongue, his eyes were brilliant.|$|E
60|$|Joseph didn't answer 'im. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Emily, and {{the more}} he stared the better-looking she seemed to grow. She really was an {{uncommon}} nice-looking gal, and more than the cook was struck with her.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} the {{restorative}} began to show itself. The man on the bed moved restlessly. His eyes were no longer altogether expressionless. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Fentolin as one looks at some horrible vision. Mr. Fentolin smiled pleasantly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{the plastic}} bag when the room outside vanished.|$|R
60|$|Ann swung round, {{and gazed}} at her uncle in concern. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> blankly <b>at</b> the paper.|$|R
60|$|Rutherford did not reply. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> thoughtfully <b>at</b> the floor. He did {{not seem}} to have heard.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} struck at Lincoln's face, and incontinently a negro had him by collar and arm. He {{wrenched}} himself away, his sleeve tore noisily, and he stumbled back, to be tripped {{by the other}} attendant. Then he struck the ground heavily and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the distant ceiling of the hall.|$|E
60|$|In {{the nave}} {{it was cool}} and dim; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the blaze of candles on the great altar, and thinking, I am sure, of his {{incomparable}} Countess. I sat down beside him, and after a while, as if to avoid the appearance of eagerness, he asked me how I had enjoyed my visit to Casa Salvi, and what I thought of the padrona.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a {{striking}} figure {{that had just}} entered, closely followed by a crowd of admiring spectators. And, indeed, he seemed worthy of the homage. His magnificent form was closely attired in a velveteen jacket and trousers, with a singular display of pearl buttons along the seams, that were absolutely lavish in their quantity; a hat adorned with feathers and roses completed his singularly picturesque equipment.|$|E
60|$|Rowland had fancied that Roderick {{had no more}} surprises for him; but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him, wide-eyed.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Nick had risen, and <b>he,</b> too, <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> her. How <b>he</b> managed to appear so well dressed was a puzzle to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] {{said the}} woodpecker. [...] "Do {{you see a}} man sitting by the fire looking <b>at</b> us? <b>He</b> has <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> us that way all the evening." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the {{tablecloth}} and the stain {{of the wine}} that he had spilled when first Mademoiselle de Lavedan's name was mentioned. His head had been bent so that his long black hair had tumbled forward and partly veiled his face. At my question he suddenly looked up. The ghost of a smile hung on his sensuous lips, for all that excitement had paled his countenance beyond its habit.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the late}} hours of night had arrived, {{and most of}} the paupers were asleep in their poor beds, dreaming, perchance, of [...] "better days" [...] when pork-sausages were not so {{tremendous}} a treat, little Zook went to the table at which Charlie sat. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a newspaper, but in reality was thinking about his vain search, and beginning, if truth must be told, to feel discouraged.|$|E
6000|$|Old Mr. Toad {{was sitting}} in his usual place, but he wasn't singing. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{something}} in the water. When Peter said [...] "Good morning," [...] Old Mr. Toad didn't seem to hear him. He was too much interested in what he was watching. Peter stared down into the water to see what was interesting Old Mr. Toad so much, but he saw nothing but a lot of wriggling tadpoles.|$|E
60|$|The captain did not speak. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> fascinated <b>at</b> {{the thing}} on the table. Mrs. Pickett turned to Mr. Snyder. Her eyes, as they met his, held him entranced.|$|R
60|$|Turning to Big Otter, I {{found that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> {{me with an}} expression of such awful solemnity that I was partially roused with a feeling of alarm.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} it as it receded. Then <b>he</b> seemed to <b>be</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> distant things.|$|R
60|$|A {{short time}} {{afterwards}} Rowland saw {{the young man}} whom she had rejected leaning against a doorway. He was ugly, but what is called distinguished-looking. He had a heavy black eye, a sallow complexion, a long, thin neck; his hair was cropped en brosse. He looked very young, yet extremely bored. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling and stroking an imperceptible moustache. Rowland espied the Cavaliere Giacosa hard by, and, having joined him, asked him the young man's name.|$|E
60|$|Before {{he could}} reply she had vanished, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the empty doorway. The {{reference}} to the unfortunate Mr. Blodgett, after taking his breath away, aroused in him an intense curiosity betraying, as it did, a certain knowledge of past events in {{his life in the}} hitherto unknown daughter of Augustus interest could she have in him? Such a Flint. What question, from similar sources, has heightened the pulse of young men from time immemorial.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he {{clutched}} at her arm. She glanced up in surprise. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a passer-by. Her eyes followed his. In a neat morning suit, {{with a black}} bowler hat and well-polished shoes, a cigar {{in his mouth and}} a general air of prosperity, Mr. Edward Dane was strolling along Broadway. He passed without a glance at either of them. For a moment Philip faltered. Then he set his teeth and walked on. There was an ashen shade in his face. The girl looked at him and shook her head.|$|E
60|$|Ingleby did {{not look}} <b>at</b> her. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{apparently}} <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the forest, which loomed through the whirling haze a faint blur of vanishing trees, and he flung the answer over his shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|Gervais Miller from Lock and Key is {{mentioned}} as having once been Dave's only friend. He got his nickname [...] "Gerv the Perv" [...] from Riley because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> her chest.|$|R
60|$|She {{thought it}} best to obey. Very softly she left the room, and as she passed out <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the flame of the lamp and {{alternately}} clenching and unclenching his talon-like fingers.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had gone}} Nick threw himself back on the {{cushions}} of the divan and, with his hands locked above his head, sat a long time lost in thought. He had sent his servant to bed; he was unmolested. He gazed before him into the gloom produced by the unheeded burning-out of the last candle. The vague outer light came in through the tall studio window and the painted images, ranged about, looked confused in the dusk. If his mother had seen him she might have thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> his father's ghost.|$|E
60|$|If you {{can imagine}} a fond father whose only son has hit him with a brick, jumped on his stomach, and then gone off with all his money, you {{have a pretty good}} notion of how poor old Izzy looked. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me across the room, and talking to himself and jerking his hands about. Whether he thought he was talking to me, or whether he was rehearsing the scene where he broke it to the boss that a mere {{stranger}} had got away with his Love-r-ly Silver Cup, I don't know. Whichever it was, he was being mighty eloquent.|$|E
60|$|Old Abel {{was almost}} always sober in these, his later years. He was sober to-day. He liked to bask in that ripe {{sunlight}} {{as well as his}} dog and cat did; and in such baskings he almost always looked out of his doorway at the far, fine blue sky over the tops of the crowding maples. But to-day he was not looking at the sky, instead, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the black, dusty rafters of his kitchen, where hung dried meats and strings of onions and bunches of herbs and fishing tackle and guns and skins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't I be in this?" [...] {{the third}} man, young Lord Felixstowe, suggested, leaning forward and {{dropping}} the eyeglass through which <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Jacob. [...] "Seems to me I am {{as likely to}} land the fish as any of you." ...|$|R
50|$|Chris Sanders is a handsome, {{harmless}} new guy and Elizabeth's crush. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> actually <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Jessica {{like her}} twin sister and intensely crushing on her for years. The character {{was based on}} the director and illustrator of the same name.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>staring</b> {{straight}} <b>at</b> his mother's lips at the moment, and yet <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{unable to}} detect any visible {{part in the}} production of the voice. She explained the whisper. [...] "Altair is smiling at you. She says she will be with us to-night." ...|$|R
