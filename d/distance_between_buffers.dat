According to the parameter theory of conventional blasting, this paper summarizes theoretical analysis of buffer blasting about the aperture, the horizontal <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>buffer</b> blasthole and presplitting blasthole, the row spacing <b>between</b> the <b>buffer</b> blasthole and presplitting blasthole and the orifice <b>between</b> the <b>buffer</b> blasthole and presplitting blasthole.

50|$|The width <b>between</b> the <b>buffers</b> {{tends to}} {{increase}} as the gauge increases or decrease as the gauge decreases, so that if wagons are changed from one gauge to another, the buffers will no longer match. This occurs because the buffers are originally extensions of the frames, which are spaced according to the gauge. Conversely, as gauge gets smaller, the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>buffers</b> reduces also. The height of the buffers is usually lower on narrow gauge railways, corresponding to the generally lower height of the rolling stock. In short, when rebuilding wagons from one gauge to another, more work is needed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{epitaxial}} graphene {{buffer layer}} on the Si face of hexagonal SiC shows a promising band gap, {{of which the}} precise origin remains to be understood. In this work, we correlate the electronic to the atomic structure of the buffer layer by combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and high-resolution {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (HR-STEM). We show that the band structure in the buffer has an electronic periodicity related to the structural periodicity observed in STM images and published X-ray diffraction. Our HR-STEM measurements show the bonding of the buffer layer to the SiC at specific locations separated by 1. 5 nm. This is consistent with the quasi 6 x 6 periodic corrugation observed in the STM images. The <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>buffer</b> C and SiC is 1. 9 Å in the bonded regions and up to 2. 8 Å in the decoupled regions, corresponding to a 0. 9 Å corrugation of the buffer layer. The decoupled regions are sp 2 hybridized. Density functional tight binding (DFTB) calculations demonstrate the presence of a gap at the Dirac point everywhere in the buffer layer, even in the decoupled regions where the buffer layer has an atomic structure close to that of graphene. The surface periodicity also promotes band in the superperiodic Brillouin zone edges as seen by photoemission and confirmed by our calculations...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of Internet routers is greatly {{defined by the}} adopted switch architecture. Combined input-crosspoint buffered (CICB) packet switches are being considered of research interest because of their high switching performance. One of the main requirements in these switches is {{that the amount of}} memory needed to achieve 100 % throughput under flows with high data rates must be proportional to the number of ports and crosspoint buffer size, which is set by the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the line cards and the buffered crossbar. Therefore, long <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the line cards and the buffered crossbar can make a CICB switch costly to implement or infeasible. In this paper, we propose and discuss two CICB packet switches with flexible access to crosspoint buffers. The proposed switches allow an input to use any available crosspoint buffer at a given output, instead of having rigid access where an input can only access a dedicated crosspoint buffer at a given output, as is the case on previous existing architectures. The proposed switches provide high switching performance and support long <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the <b>buffered</b> crossbar and the line cards, while using crosspoint buffers of small size. Our switches reduce the required crosspoint buffer size by a factor of N, where N is the number of ports, keep service of cells in sequence, and use no speedup...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the determination of}} buffer size for machines in single and multi row Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) for the best layout obtained by genetic algorithm (GA) throughsimulation. To maximize the operating performance of FMS, many parameters must be considered, including the part types, sequencing, cost of transport <b>between</b> workstations, <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> machinesand <b>buffer</b> sizes. Of the various critical factors, following three are considered for analysis: (1) minimizing the buffer size (2) minimizing the blocking and (3) maximizing the machine utilization. Simulation enables more efficient planning of the whole FMS, easy modifications before implementation on the real system. The software package FLEXSIM is used to develop the simulation model. A model ofa optimum layout FMS obtained by GA that may contain a number of machines, input and output buffers, capturing part types flow quantities, part routes, from the database and AGV’s used as a meansof transport, is built by FLEXSIM software. Analysis is done on the model to determine the optimum buffer size for the machines. Thus by performing simulation on the model optimum buffer size in theindividual rows are established...|$|R
40|$|A very {{important}} challenge in designing through-silicon via (TSV) -based 3 D ICs is to accurately estimate, through {{all stages of}} the physical design, the interconnect delay which {{is strongly dependent on}} the layout of 3 D IC. The earlier in the design process and more accurate it can be done; the better design decisions can be made. Incorporating an optimal buffer insertion approach in the early layout design stage can significantly minimize delay and power in 3 D circuits. Unlike 2 D ICs, buffer insertion in 3 D ICs needs careful consideration of additional design constraints in interconnects spanning multiple device layers. In this paper, we propose a novel buffer insertion scheme for delay optimization during 3 D floorplanning. For individual 3 D nets, the algorithm efficiently computes the desired <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> consecutive <b>buffers</b> (buffer insertion length), which depends on the non-negligible TSV RC delay contribution of the net. This technique of variable buffer insertion length, used during floorplanning, allows optimizing buffers for individual 3 D interconnects and reduces overall buffer count by up to 25 % and total power consumption by up to 12 %. The proposed approach also includes a method for buffer insertion around a TSV, based on the TSV location and its RC delay. Our experiments suggest that the proposed method of buffer planning around TSVs avoids delay violation and reduces delay across TSVs up to 11 %, minimizing buffer usage. The paper also analyzes the impact of key parameters such as buffer size and TSV contact resistance on the delay and power dissipation in 3 D interconnects...|$|R
