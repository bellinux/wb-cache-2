Photon bubbles would develop spontaneously in radiation-dominated atmospheres when the {{magnetic}} pressure exceeds the gas pressure. We can imagine a region in the stellar atmosphere with a density lower than the surroundings, but with a higher radiation pressure. Such a region would rise through the atmosphere, with radiation diffusing in from the sides, leading to an even higher radiation pressure. This effect could transport radiation more efficiently than a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> increasing the allowed total radiation rate.

The logarithmic operation over the range-corrected and system-normalized received signal used in this method introduces a bias in the statistics of the noise-affected processed signal that can severely distort the estimates of the atmospheric attenuation and backscatter coefficients under measurement. It is shown that a fitting of the theoretically expected exponential signal to the range-corrected received one, using as the initial guess the results provided by the slope method and a least-squares iterative procedure, can yield enhanced accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratios and especially in moderate-to-high extinction conditions.

The nlte effect on the equivalent width of the 671 nm resonance line is small in 1 D models or in integrated light from the granulation model. The line-strength variations over the granulation pattern are however markedly different in nlte compared to lte – observations of this may provide diagnostics to nlte effects.

40|$|Mariner 9 {{ultraviolet}} morning terminator {{data indicate}} {{the presence of a}} high, optically thin scattering layer in the equatorial region of Mars extending to 50 S. This is consistent with the afternoon terminator results, which showed the presence of a scattering layer for latitudes as far north as 50 N. For both types of terminator observations, the magnitude of the reflectivity for large shadow heights and the apparent scale height of the signal are too large to be explained by a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The terminator observations poleward of 50 S were modeled by a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of molecular and particulate scatterers. As the lower atmosphere began to clear from the dust storm, a progressive change was noted in the magnitude of the terminator reflectivity which is attributed to a changing albedo for single scattering. The shape of the morning terminator reflectivity measured as a function of shadow height indicates larger apparent scale heights than were observed in the afternoon. The difference is attributed to an increase in thickness of the scattering layer during the night...|$|E

40|$|Up to now, the {{extraction}} of extinction and backscatter coefficients from a lidar signa] or lidar inversion {{has been done in}} <b>homogeneous</b> <b>atmospheres</b> by means of the slope method.

To counteract these problems an altemate method based on least squares minimization is presented. The inversion error is also assessed {{as a function of the}} SNR ratio and the visibility margin. A further method presented is Klett's analytical solution, which has proved to be the most suitable in inhomogeneous profiles.

40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} are performed {{to examine the}} effects of line shape and band structure on the radiative equilibrium temperature profile in planetary atmospheres. In order to accurately determine these effects, a method for calculating radiative terms is developed which avoids the usual approximations.

The present formulation is restricted to <b>homogeneous</b> <b>atmospheres</b> but the concept can be extended to the more general case. The numerical experiments reveal that the line shape and band structure of the absorbing gases have a large effect on temperatures in the higher layers of the atmosphere (corresponding to the stratosphere and mesosphere).

40|$|The {{slope method}} has customarily been used {{and is still}} used for {{inversion}} of atmospheric optical parameters, extinction, and backscatter in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>atmospheres</b> from lidar returns. Our aim is to study the underlying statistics of the old slope method and ultimately to compare its inversion performance {{with that of the}} present-day nonlinear least-squares solution (the so-called exponential-curve fitting). The contents are twofold: First, an analytical study is conducted to characterize the bias and the mean-square-estimation error of the regression operator, which permits estimation of the optical parameters from the logarithm of the range-compensated lidar return. Second, universal plots for most short- and far-range tropospheric backscatter lidars are presented {{as a rule of thumb}} for obtaining the optimum regression interval length that yields unbiased estimates. As a result, the simple graphic basis of the slope method is still maintained, and its inversion performance improves up to that of the present-day computer-oriented exponential-curve fitting, which ends the controversy between these two algorithms.
