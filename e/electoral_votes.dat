5|$|Washington was {{unanimously}} reelected president, receiving 132 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> (one {{from each}} elector), and Adams was reelected vice president, receiving 77 votes. The other 55 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> were divided among: George Clinton (50), Thomas Jefferson (4), and Aaron Burr (1).|$|E
5|$|Clinton won the 1992 presidential {{election}} (370 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes)</b> against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes)</b> and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes),</b> who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920 presidential election, Franklin was {{nominated}} as the running mate of Democratic presidential candidate James M. Cox. Eleanor joined Franklin in touring the country, making her first campaign appearances. Cox and Roosevelt were defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding, who won with 404 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> to 127 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes.</b>|$|E

5|$|By Election Day, November 2, 1920, few had {{any doubts}} that the Republican ticket would win. Harding {{received}} 60.2percent {{of the popular}} vote, the highest percentage since {{the evolution of the}} two-party system, and 404 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes.</b> Cox received 34percent of the national vote and 127 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes.</b> Campaigning from a federal prison where he was serving a sentence for opposing the war, Socialist Eugene V. Debs received 3percent of the national vote. The Republicans greatly increased their majority in each house of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As the election occurred prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes for the presidency, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person. Under the terms of the constitution, the individual who won the most <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> would become president while the individual with the second-most <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted.|$|E
500|$|Although {{registered}} Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, {{which includes}} Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign {{offices in the}} city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, {{said he would do}} whatever it took to deliver the district's <b>electoral</b> <b>vote</b> to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district [...] "in play". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's <b>electoral</b> <b>vote.</b> This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split <b>electoral</b> <b>vote</b> system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an <b>electoral</b> <b>vote</b> in Nebraska since 1964.|$|R

5|$|Harrison ran in all {{the free}} states except Massachusetts, and the slave states of Delaware, Maryland, and Kentucky. Hugh L. White ran in the {{remaining}} slave states except for South Carolina. Daniel Webster ran in Massachusetts, and Willie P. Mangum in South Carolina. The plan narrowly failed, as Van Buren won the election with 170 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes.</b> A swing of just over 4,000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state's 30 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> to Harrison, and the election would have been decided in the House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Taylor/Fillmore ticket won narrowly, with New York's <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> again {{key to the}} election. The Whig ticket won {{the popular}} vote by 1,361,393 (47.3 percent) to 1,223,460 (42.5 percent), and triumphed 163 to 127 in the Electoral College. Minor party {{candidates}} took no <b>electoral</b> <b>votes,</b> but {{the strength of the}} burgeoning anti-slavery movement was shown by the vote for Van Buren, who though he won no states earned 291,501 votes (10.1 percent) and finished second in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{compelling}} legislative actions recognizing the legal importance/authority of the state seal and arms occurred in February 1873 when {{a joint session of}} the United States Congress refused to recognize Arkansas's <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> in the November 1872 presidential election. The official tally of the state's <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> was submitted with an invalid seal (bearing the coat of arms of the office of the Secretary of the State of Arkansas versus the seal of the state of Arkansas bearing the state arms).|$|E
5|$|The <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> {{were counted}} during a Joint Session of Congress on February 8, 1797; Adams won the {{presidency}} by a narrow margin, garnering 71 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> to 68 for Jefferson (who became the vice president). The balance of the Electoral College votes were dispersed among: Thomas Pinckney (59), Aaron Burr (30), Samuel Adams (15), Oliver Ellsworth (11), George Clinton (7), John Jay (5), James Iredell (3), John Henry (2), Samuel Johnston (2), George Washington (2), and C. C. Pinckney (1).|$|E
5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large-population states. Those who argue that the College favors low-population states point out that such states have {{proportionally}} more <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> relative to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (proportionally allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, regardless of what state they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> gives them more actual clout.|$|E

5|$|In the end, Carter won the election, {{receiving}} 50.1% of {{the popular}} vote and 297 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> compared with 48.0% and 240 <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> for Ford. The election was close enough that had fewer than 25,000 votes shifted in Ohio and Wisconsin – both of which neighbored his home state – Ford would have won the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for Carter. Though he lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford had managed to close what was once an alleged 33-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin. Ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by Carter.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> in their current manner.|$|E

5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their own state. The individual who won the most <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> would become president while the individual with the second-most <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the presidential election of 1789, finishing in second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became the its first vice president.|$|E
5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of <b>electoral</b> <b>votes</b> and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E
