5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb is a laser source whose spectrum {{consists of a}} series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. <b>Frequency</b> <b>combs</b> can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a continuous-wave laser, four-wave mixing in nonlinear media or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work has been devoted to the latter mechanism, which was developed {{around the turn of the}} 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{variation of}} four-wave-mixing-based <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> {{is known as}} Kerr frequency comb. Here, a single laser is coupled into a microresonator (such as a microscopic glass disk that has whispering-gallery modes). This kind of structure naturally has a series of resonant modes with approximately equally spaced frequencies (similar to a Fabry–Pérot interferometer). Unfortunately the resonant modes are not exactly equally spaced due to dispersion. Nevertheless, the four-wave mixing effect above can create and stabilize a perfect frequency comb in such a structure. Basically, the system generates a perfect comb that overlaps the resonant modes as much as possible. In fact, nonlinear effects can shift the resonant modes to improve the overlap with the perfect comb even more. (The resonant mode frequencies depend on refractive index, which is altered by the optical Kerr effect.) ...|$|E
50|$|Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> (also {{known as}} microresonator <b>frequency</b> <b>combs)</b> are optical <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> which are {{generated}} from a continuous wave pump laser by the Kerr nonlinearity. This coherent {{conversion of the}} pump laser to a frequency comb takes place inside an optical resonator which is typically of micrometer to millimeter in size and is therefore termed a microresonator. The coherent generation of the frequency comb from a continuous wave laser with the optical nonlinearity as a gain sets Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> apart from today’s most common optical <b>frequency</b> <b>combs.</b> These <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> are generated by mode-locked lasers where the dominating gain stems from a conventional laser gain medium, which is pumped incoherently. Because Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> only rely on the nonlinear properties of the medium inside the microresonator and do not require a broadband laser gain medium, broad Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> can in principle be generated around any pump frequency.|$|E
50|$|One {{important}} {{property of}} Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs,</b> {{which is a}} direct consequence of the small dimensions of the microresonators and their resulting large free spectral ranges (FSR), is the large mode spacing of typical Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs.</b> For mode-locked lasers this mode spacing, which defines the distance in between adjacent teeth of the frequency comb, is typically in the range of 10 MHz to 1 GHz.

50|$|The {{coherent}} {{generation of}} an optical frequency comb from a continuous wave pump laser {{is not a}} unique property of Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs.</b> Optical <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> generated with cascaded optical modulators also possess this property. For certain application this property can be advantageous. For example, to stabilize the offset frequency of the Kerr frequency comb one can directly apply feedback to the pump laser frequency. In principle {{it is also possible}} to generate a Kerr frequency comb around a particular continuous wave laser in order to use the bandwidth of the frequency comb to determine the exact frequency of the continuous wave laser.|$|E
50|$|While the {{principle}} of Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> is applicable to any type of optical resonator, the requirement for Kerr frequency comb generation is a pump laser field intensity above the parametric threshold of the nonlinear process. This requirement is easier to fulfill inside a microresonator because of the possible very low losses inside microresonators (and corresponding high quality factors) {{and because of the}} microresonators’ small mode volumes. These two features combined result in a large field enhancement of the pump laser inside the microresonator which allow the generation of broad Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> for reasonable powers of the pump laser.|$|E

50|$|Because both use the {{nonlinear}} {{effects of}} the propagation medium, the physics of Kerr <b>frequency</b> <b>combs</b> and of supercontinuum generation from pulsed lasers is very similar.
