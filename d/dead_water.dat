5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a <b>dead</b> <b>water</b> zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
25|$|Hydrographic {{conditions}} {{at the mouth of}} the Göta älv in September 1745, are well known. The discharge of the Göta älv was unusually large due to heavy snowfall during the winter of 1744–45. The water level of Lake Vättern was also extremely high in 1745. These factors combined into an increase in the volume of fresh water flowing into the Älvsborgsfjorden, affecting the layers of fresh and salt water, making the conditions for <b>dead</b> <b>water</b> very favorable on 12September 1745. It may be that the Götheborg was suddenly trapped by <b>dead</b> <b>water</b> when making its final change of course, causing the ship to lose rudder function, go off course and run aground.|$|E
500|$|Fram left Christiania on 24 June 1893, cheered on by {{thousands}} of well-wishers. After a slow journey around the coast, the final port of call was Vardø, in the far north-east of Norway. Fram left Vardø on 21 July, following the North-East Passage route pioneered by Nordenskiöld in 1878–79, along the northern coast of Siberia. [...] Progress was impeded by fog and ice conditions in the mainly uncharted seas. The crew also experienced the <b>dead</b> <b>water</b> phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by friction caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. Nevertheless, Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass, was passed on 10 September. Ten days later, as Fram approached {{the area in which}} Jeannette had been crushed, heavy pack ice was sighted at around latitude 78°N. Nansen followed the line of the pack northwards to a position recorded as 78°49′N, 132°53′E, before ordering engines stopped and the rudder raised. From this point Fram's drift began.|$|E

500|$|The {{first leg}} of the journey eastward took Fram across the Barents Sea towards Novaya Zemlya {{and then to the}} North Russian {{settlement}} of Khabarova where the first batch of dogs was brought on board. [...] On 3 August Fram weighed anchor and moved cautiously eastward, entering the Kara Sea the next day. Few ships had sailed the Kara Sea before, and charts were incomplete. On 18 August, {{in the area of the}} Yenisei River delta, an uncharted island was discovered and named Sverdrup Island after Fram's commander. Fram was now moving towards the Taimyr Peninsula and Cape Chelyuskin, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass. Heavy ice slowed the expedition's progress, and at the end of August it was held up for four days while the ship's boiler was repaired and cleaned. The crew also experienced the <b>dead</b> <b>water</b> phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by energy dissipation caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. On 9 September a wide stretch of ice-free water opened up, and next day Fram rounded Cape Chelyuskin—the second ship to do so, after Nordenskiöld's Vega in 1878—and entered the Laptev Sea.|$|E
2500|$|A fourth {{interpretation}} is that [...] "dead back island" [...] was so-called {{because of the}} lack of fertile soil on the hills. However, since the island creates an area of <b>dead</b> <b>water</b> behind it with no wind (hence [...] "still behind" [...] - still or stopped being an alternative translation of mati) it may be as simple as this— less romantic perhaps, but believable from a nautical viewpoint.|$|E
2500|$|The joint {{statement}} by captain Eric Moréen {{and the crew}} to the Göteborgs Rådhusrätt ("the Municipal Court of Gothenburg") on the 19September 1745 states that the weather on 12September was fair and clear, the wind amenable and blowing from south-west or west-southwest. These were ideal conditions since the wind would be coming almost straight from aft. Crossing the Rivöfjorden the ship met with the current from {{the northern part of}} Göta älv, Nordre älv.

The father is displeased by the news, but undecided {{about how he}} should treat the visitors. In the end, he opts in favor of tricking them, offering them residence in a copper house, which he has ordered heated to an oven-like temperature. Gerilă, who has the foresight of entering ahead of his companions, proceeds to cool down the entire structure. In his attempt to delay the matter further, the Red Emperor then invites the group to a magnificent feast, and witnesses with alarm how his food and drink are rapidly consumed by Flămânzilă and Setilă. The emperor then decides to impose a test on Harap Alb and the others: that of sorting out a mierță (some 200 liters) of poppy seed from an equivalent quantity of fine sand {{in the space of}} one night, which Harap Alb manages with assistance from the ants. The monarch then tells the heroes that, if they want his daughter, they are to guard and follow for another night, letting them know that he does not know her ways.

This the protagonist accomplishes with assistance from the queen bee, who sets down on the princess' cheek.

60|$|And so, {{take it all}} around, we made a good haul.
