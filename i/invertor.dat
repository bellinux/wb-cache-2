50|$|Window design {{followed}} the 1960 Stock, {{consisting of two}} large windows between each set of doors, giving a double-glazed appearance. The doors opened into {{the gap between the}} inner and outer skins. However, on the doors themselves, the windows were curved, so that the top was much higher than previous designs, allowing passengers to see station signs without stooping. Visibility for the driver was improved by the provision of wrap-around cab windows. Loading times at stations were improved by providing a stand-back beside the doors, so that passengers standing near the doors did not block so much of the exit. Lighting was by fluorescent tube, with two lights in each car fed from the battery through an <b>invertor,</b> so that they remained lit should the motor alternator shut down. Two types of motor alternator were used. Some were manufactured by AEI, and generated 230V AC at 850 Hz, which was stepped down to 115V for the lighting and 58V for the battery charger. The alternative was manufactured by English Electric, and generated 60V at 850 Hz, which was stepped up for the lighting.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the alterations in eccentric evertor/concentric <b>invertor</b> strength ratio and their importance in the chronically unstable ankle. Eight patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and nine healthy individuals participated in this study. Isokinetic concentric and eccentric <b>invertor</b> and evertor muscle strength measurement was carried out at an angular velocity of 120 ° · sec- 1 by measuring maximal force moments (torque) during isokinetic ankle inversion and eversion movements. Functionally, evertor/invertor muscle strength ratios (E/I strength ratio) were calculated separately based on peak moment and angle-specific moments obtained at 0 °, 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° ankle joint angles. Peak and angle-specific eccentric evertor strength values at 0 °, 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° were significantly lower in the chronic ankle instability (CAI) group. In spite of this, no differences were obtained for peak and angle-specific concentric <b>invertor</b> torque values. Eccentric evertor/concentric <b>invertor</b> strength (Eecc/Icon) ratios were also significantly lower in the CAI group, but only at 15 ° and 20 °.

40|$|A Master's Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the award of the Master Of Science degree of Loughborough University. In recent years, attempts to develop new means of high speed efficient transportation have led to considerable world wide interest in high speed trains. This in turn has generated interest in the linear induction motor, which is considered {{to be one of the}} most suitable propulsion systems for super-high-speed trains. The operation of linear induction motors is based upon the same natural principles as the cylindrical rotor form of the machine, and this implies that the same methods of speed control by static frequency changer can be used. Linear motor speed control using·a variable frequency <b>invertor,</b> which has been used for some years with rotary induction motors, is investigated in this work. The steady-state performance of a motor fitted, in turn, with an aluminium reaction plate and aluminium cl added steel reaction plate, is described. A 3 -phase variable frequency d. c. link-fed <b>invertor</b> has been constructed to provide speed control for the motor. The d. c. link is supplied from a voltage source. The <b>invertor</b> has a single a. c. side commutation and operates with threethyristor triggering, that is with 180 ° thyristor conduction, giving a quasi-square wave output voltage. The logic control and thyristor switching circuits have 'been designed and built and are described in detail. From no-load and locked rotor tests, the equivalent circuit parameter for the linear induction motor with the two types of reaction plates have been measured for different frequencies with a sinusoidal supply. These are used to predict the motor steady-state performance. The measured performance of the motor with each type of rotor with a sinusoidal supply is compared with the results predicted for various frequencies (50, 40, 30, 20 and 10 Hz), allowing for the effect of the variation of the equivalent circuit rotor resistance parameter with slip frequency. A comparison of the motor performance is made when fitted with both types of reaction plate, when excited both sinusoidally and from the <b>invertor...</b>|$|E
