5|$|Dragon kiln: Dragon <b>kilns</b> were {{traditional}} Chinese <b>kilns</b> {{used for}} Chinese ceramics. According to recent excavations in Shangyu District {{in the northeast}} of Zhejiang province and elsewhere, {{the origins of the}} dragon kiln may go back as far as the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 to 1046 BCE), and is linked to the introduction of stoneware, fired at 1200°C or more. These <b>kilns</b> were much smaller than later examples, at some 5–12 metres long, and also sloped far less. The type had certainly developed by the Warring States period, and by the Eastern Wu kingdom (220–280 CE), there were over 60 <b>kilns</b> at Shangyu. Thereafter it remained the main design used in southern China until the Ming dynasty. The pottery areas of south China are mostly hilly, whereas those on the plains of north China typically lack suitable slopes; here the mantou kiln type predominated. The Nanfeng Kiln in Guangdong province is several centuries old and still functioning. It was a producer of Shiwan ware as well as architectural ceramics, and today also functions as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century lime was quarried, {{particularly}} on the west coast. The ruined remains of the quarriers' cottages can still be seen on Eilean nan Caorach and Inn Island, and old lime <b>kilns</b> {{can be seen at}} Sailean, Port na Moralachd and Port Ramsay; the last lime was produced in 1934. The remains of another two <b>kilns</b> can be seen at Kilcheran near Lismore Seminary, a Roman Catholic divinity school that was in operation from 1803 to 1828 {{at a time when the}} other inhabitants of the island were staunchly Presbyterian.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, farming was {{the most}} {{important}} activity in the area, and farming, both arable and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums. Evidence exists of lime <b>kilns,</b> used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.|$|E

The company became the first American commercial pottery to operate a fully computer-controlled tunnel <b>kiln.</b> The new <b>kiln</b> {{reduced the number of}} skilled <b>kiln</b> technicians needed because it collected information as the <b>kiln</b> fired and made adjustments automatically.|$|R
30|$|In the Reinhardswald, we {{registered}} a {{total number}} of 2626 charcoal <b>kiln</b> sites, which equates to a frequency of one charcoal <b>kiln</b> site per 7.7  ha. For the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park we found 1308 charcoal <b>kiln</b> sites, with a slightly higher frequency of one charcoal <b>kiln</b> site per 4.3  ha. In both study areas, the number of charcoal <b>kiln</b> sites per hectare ranges between 0 and 4. Generally, the spatial distribution of the charcoal <b>kiln</b> sites is irregular and different between both forest areas. In the Reinhardswald, there is a concentration {{in the north and}} the middle of {{the eastern part of the}} area, while in the western part charcoal <b>kiln</b> sites are completely absent in many places (Fig.  4). In the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park, the distribution of charcoal <b>kiln</b> sites is much more even. Only few parts of the National Park exhibit no evidence of charcoal <b>kiln</b> sites (Fig.  3).|$|R

5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from <b>kilns</b> to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Kiln</b> drying of Pinus radiata D. Don sapwood {{causes the}} {{development}} of a brown sub-surface coloration, commonly called <b>kiln</b> brown stain. Planing exposes the stain and this can spoil one of the appealing features of P. radiata—its light colour. <b>Kiln</b> schedule modifications—for example, drying with low <b>kiln</b> temperatures— reduced the frequency and intensity of <b>kiln</b> brown stain but increased drying times. An attempt was made to shorten drying times and produce an acceptable colour in the dried lumber by using high air velocities as well as high relative <b>kiln</b> humidities in conjunction with medium <b>kiln</b> temperatures. Depth (below the wood surface) and thickness of <b>kiln</b> brown stain were also determined in the dried P. radiata. Using stepped <b>kiln</b> schedules with either high air velocities or high relative humidity reduced development of <b>kiln</b> brown stain compared to accelerated conventional temperature 90760 °C drying, but considerably longer drying times were needed. Furthermore, stain formed about 0. 5 mm underneath the surface with a thickness of up to 2 mm. The best method for countering the effect of <b>kiln</b> brown stain would be to plane 2 mm off the surface of kiln-dried lumber during remanufacturing...|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} of the Jiaotanxia <b>kiln</b> was finally established by excavations carried out between 1984 and 1986; but the {{location of}} the Xiuneisi <b>kiln</b> remained unknown until excavations started in 1998 at the Tiger Cave <b>kiln</b> site provided confirmation that this was the hitherto unidentified Xiuneisi <b>kiln</b> (Kerr 2004).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{crack of}} <b>kiln</b> shells was seen {{regularly}} due to axis deflection and asymmetric load distribution. It {{will be helpful}} to improve <b>kiln</b> performance if the remaining life of <b>kiln</b> shells can be kept the same. For this the formulae of stress spectrum and fatigue life of <b>kiln</b> shells are obtained. Taking the aligned values of axis deflections as design variables, equal fatigue life of shells and maximum axis deflection as the objective function, considering the fuzzy factors during axis alignment, the fuzzy optimization model of <b>kiln</b> axis alignment is set up. The results indicate that <b>kiln</b> axis can be aligned as direct as possible, and life expectancy of <b>kiln</b> shells can be optimized to keep near the same. Accordingly, the valuable production time of <b>kiln</b> can be increased greatly by such aligned method...|$|R
5|$|The {{technology}} {{of everyday life}} is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows it to have been {{similar to that in}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of watermills in Pictland and <b>kilns</b> were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise easy in the changeable, temperate climate. Although constructed in earlier times, brochs, roundhouses and crannogs remained in use into and beyond the Pictish period.|$|E
5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in <b>kilns</b> between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, the small, {{scattered}} {{community in}} and around Milnrow was primarily agrarian, with the growing and milling of grain and cereal being the main labour of the people. Dry ironstone smelting was introduced into Milnrow {{at a very early}} time as evidenced from ancient <b>kilns</b> found at Tunshill. A chantry was constructed in the year 1400 by the Byrons—the then Lords of the Manor—and a chapel for the wider community in 1496; A document dated 20 March 1496, during the reign of Henry VII, proclaims that open land by the River Beal would be the site of the new chapel.|$|E

5|$|For {{over three}} centuries during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) China {{experienced}} sustained growth {{in per capita}} income and population, structural change in the economy, and increased pace of technological innovation. Movable print, improved seeds for rice and other commercial crops, gunpowder, water-powered mechanical clocks, the use of coal {{as a source of}} fuel for a variety of industries, improved techniques for iron and steel production, pound locks and many other technological innovations transformed the economy. In north China, the main fuel source for ceramic <b>kilns</b> and iron furnaces shifted from wood to coal.|$|E
5|$|Red wares were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery {{was fired in}} the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to {{a steady supply of}} firewood for their <b>kilns.</b> During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{came through}} the area between 1793 and 1800, with canal-side wharfs in Fenny Stratford, Great Linford, Bradwell and Wolverton. The route {{bypassed}} Newport Pagnell but, in 1817, an arm was dug to it from Great Linford. Trade along the canal stimulated the local economy. A large brickworks was established near the canal in Great Linford: two bottle <b>kilns</b> and the clay pits can still {{be seen on the}} site. Pottery from the Midlands begins to appear in excavations of dwellings from that period.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Western Canal ran between Taunton in Somerset and Tiverton in Devon in the United Kingdom. The canal had {{its origins}} in various plans, going back to 1796, to link the Bristol Channel and the English Channel by a canal, {{bypassing}} Lands End. An additional purpose of the canal was the supply of limestone and coal to lime <b>kilns</b> along with {{the removal of the}} resulting quicklime, which was used as a fertiliser and for building houses. This intended canal-link was never completed as planned, as the coming of the railways removed the need for its existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the castle}} was its residential tower. This tower may have been built around 1341 {{on the site of}} an older, unfortified house owned by the family on the same site, incorporating {{part of the}} structure into the new, crenellated tower. Alternatively, the central tower may have been built at some point between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, complete with crenellations, in which case the licence from Edward III served only to allow Manners to extend the perimeter fortifications. By the 1350s, the castle was surrounded by a manor which included mills for corn and fulling, lime <b>kilns</b> and coal mines.|$|E
5|$|The {{period was}} also renowned for {{ceramics}} and porcelains.The major production centers for porcelain were the imperial <b>kilns</b> at Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province and Dehua in Fujian province. The Dehua porcelain factories catered to European tastes by creating Chinese export porcelain by the 16th century. Individual potters also became known, such as He Chaozong, who became {{famous in the}} early 17th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture. In The Ceramic Trade in Asia, Chuimei Ho estimates that about 16% of late Ming era Chinese ceramic exports were sent to Europe, while the rest were destined for Japan and South East Asia.|$|E

PA 152 was extended north to US 309 in Sellersville in 1946, replacing the former routing of PA 413 between Perkasie and Sellersville. By 1960, the southern terminus of the route was cut back to its current location. PA 152 was extended west to end at PA 309 near Telford by 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, a mulatto trader from Gorée, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began {{planting}} rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime <b>kilns.</b> The French administration treated Baudin as their representative {{on the island}} and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.|$|E
