French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. Compared with after the Reformation, the interiors of churches were often <b>elaborate,</b> <b>with</b> highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, were created in the mid-fifteenth century. They are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E

However, because of its cost, few families can afford it. The second type is called “pavo” which is used for special occasions. It is similar to the first but with a less intense red and with smaller designs. The third type, called “pájaros y palomas” (birds and doves) is the most economical of the three and can be found fairly easily in markets. It is white with figures of birds and other animals in vivid and contrasting colors. This used to be reserved for women of middle age or older but it has since been adopted by many.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the survival of a Brucella abortus aqpX mutant during the elaboration and conservation of fresh and ripened cheeses at 4 C and 24 C. The pH values and water activity were monitored {{for each type of}} cheese. The fresh cheese was <b>elaborated</b> <b>with</b> raw milk inoculated with 6 × 108 colony-forming units (CFU) /mL each of parental and mutant strain. Ripening cheeses were <b>elaborated</b> <b>with</b> both raw and pasteurized milk and inoculated with 12 × 108 CFU/mL each of parental and mutant strains. In fresh cheese, survival was observed during elaboration and conservation for 7 days at 4 C in mutant and parental strains. The number of survivors of the mutant strain was 10 times lower compared with the parental strain at pH 5 and aw of 0. 930. In the cheese <b>elaborated</b> <b>with</b> raw milk and ripened at 24 C, both strains survived until day 17 at pH 4. 0 and aw of 0. 89. However, when the cheese was <b>elaborated</b> <b>with</b> pasteurized milk, the parental strain survived until day 31 of ripening, and the mutant strain survived 24 days at pH 4 and aw of 0. 886. The survival of the mutant strain showed a diminution of one logarithm during elaboration and ripening of cheese as compared with the parental strain. When the cheese was <b>elaborated</b> <b>with</b> raw milk and ripened at 4 C, survival of the parental strain was 24 days, whereas the mutant strain survived only 17 days (pH 5 and aw 0. 90). Regarding the cheese <b>elaborated</b> <b>with</b> pasteurized milk and maturated at 4 C, both strains survived 31 days (pH 5 and aw 0. 90), with the same survival diminution during elaboration and ripening. Our results show that in both types of cheese, the mutated aqpX strain survived 10 times less than the parental strain, which shows that the aqpX gene can be related to the survival of Brucella abortus in this type of cheese.

500|$|The {{plan and}} {{decoration}} of Fatimid mosques reflect Shiite doctrine {{and that the}} mosques were often used for royal ceremonial purposes. [...] The characteristic architectural styles of Fatimid mosques include portals that protrude from the wall, domes above mihrabs and qiblas, porches and arcades with keel-shaped arches supported {{by a series of}} columns, façade ornamentation with iconographic inscriptions and stucco decorations. The mosques followed the hypostyle plan, where a central courtyard was surrounded by arcades with their roofs usually supported by keel arches, initially resting on columns with Corinthian capitals. The arches held inscription bands, a style that is unique to Fatimid architecture. [...] The later columns often had a bell-shaped capital with the same shape mirrored to form the base. The prayer niche was architecturally more <b>elaborate,</b> <b>with</b> features such as a dome or transept. The Fatimid architects built modified versions of Coptic keel-arched niches with radiating fluted hoods, and later extended the concept to fluted domes.

2500|$|Fashion in {{the years}} 1750–1775 in European {{countries}} and the colonial Americas was characterised by greater abundance, elaboration and intricacy in clothing designs, loved by the Rococo artistic trends of the period. The French and English styles of fashion were very different from one another. French style was defined by elaborate court dress, colourful and rich in decoration, worn by such iconic fashion figures as Marie Antoinette. After reaching their maximum size in the 1750s, hoop skirts began to reduce in size, but remained being worn with the most formal dresses, and were sometimes replaced with side-hoops, or panniers. Hairstyles were equally <b>elaborate,</b> <b>with</b> tall headdresses the distinctive fashion of the 1770s. [...] For men, waistcoats and breeches of previous decades continued to be fashionable. English style was defined by simple practical garments, made of inexpensive and durable fabrics, catering to a leisurely outdoor lifestyle. These lifestyles were also portrayed through the differences in portraiture. [...] The French preferred indoor scenes where they could demonstrate their affinity for luxury in dress and lifestyle. [...] The English, on the other hand, were more [...] "egalitarian" [...] in tastes, thus their portraits tended to depict the sitter in outdoor scenes and pastoral attire.|$|E

In the chancel there are some meagre patches of old glass, and some of modern date, not very well worth looking at.

The more ancient tombs are also very numerous, and among them that of the Bishop who founded the cathedral. Within the screen, against the wall, is erected a monument, by Chantrey, to the Earl of Malmesbury; a full-length statue of the Earl in a half-recumbent position, holding an open volume and looking upward,--a noble work,--a calm, wise, thoughtful, firm, and not unbenignant face. Beholding its expression, it really was impossible not to have faith in the high character of the individual thus represented; and I have seldom felt this effect from any monumental bust or statue, though I presume it is always aimed at.|$|E
60|$|To have a mind {{penetrated}} {{with this}} spiritual persuasion, {{is to be}} in full possession of the highest strength that man can attain. It springs from a scientific and rounded interpretation of the facts of life, and is in a harmony, which freshly found truths only make more ample and <b>elaborate,</b> <b>with</b> all the conclusions of the intellect in every order. The active energies are not paralysed by the possibilities of enfeebling doubt, nor the reason drawn down and stultified by apprehension lest its methods should discredit a document, or its inferences clash with a dogma, or its light flash unseasonably on a mystery. There is none of the baleful distortion of hate, because evil and wrong-doing and darkness are acknowledged to be effects of causes, sums of conditions, terms in a series; they are to be brought to their end, or weakened and narrowed, by right action and endeavour, and this endeavour does not stagnate in antipathy, but concentrates itself in transfixing a cause. In no other condition of the spirit than this, in which firm acquiescence mingles with valorous effort, can a man be so sure of raising a calm gaze and an enduring brow to the cruelty of circumstance. The last appalling stroke of annihilation itself is measured with purest fortitude by one, whose religious contemplation dwells most habitually upon the sovereignty of obdurate laws in the vast revolving circle of physical forces, on the one hand, and, on the other, upon that moral order which the vision and pity of good men for their fellows, guiding the spontaneous energy of all men in strife with circumstance, have raised into a structure sublimer and more amazing than all the majesty of outer nature.|$|E
