5|$|Although most ants survive {{attempts}} by humans to eradicate them, a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> highly endangered. These {{tend to be}} island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species. Examples include the critically endangered Sri Lankan relict ant (Aneuretus simoni) and Adetomyrma venatrix of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are known}} to {{catalyze}} more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> catalytic RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.|$|E
5|$|Most {{national}} cemeteries {{are administered}} by the Department of Veterans Affairs, although a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> managed by the National Park Service and the U.S. Army. None of the cemeteries are considered official units of the system; they are all affiliated with other parks.|$|E
50|$|I {{always knew}} I {{would never be}} in my {{profession}} nothing even closer he <b>was.</b> Because too <b>few</b> <b>were</b> too good in his field. Fewer could be too good fathers as he <b>was.</b> Even <b>fewer</b> <b>were</b> too good husbands. Even extremely <b>fewer</b> <b>were</b> too good-spirited people. And there isnt any existing word to describe how rare and dedicated Palmeiras fan he was.|$|R
25|$|Numerous tunnels were {{excavated}} as {{shelters and}} to store ammunition and food. A <b>few</b> <b>were</b> completed, some abandoned. <b>Few</b> <b>were</b> lined with concrete before materials became scarce {{and the workers}} left the Island.|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, most events occur monthly. <b>Few</b> events <b>are</b> {{released}} quarterly and even <b>fewer</b> <b>are</b> released weekly. Below are some examples.|$|R
5|$|The Phalacrocoracidae are {{a family}} of medium to large coastal, {{fish-eating}} seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies; the majority of species have mainly dark plumage, but some are pied black and white, and a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> more colourful.|$|E
5|$|While emphasising {{the ability}} of the human {{imagination}} to uncover truth through a study of nature, the poem also questions religious certainty. However, according to the poem only a privileged <b>few</b> <b>are</b> able to see nature as it truly is and reveal its secrets to the world.|$|E
5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} {{depends on}} its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E

50|$|Ignatius Alphonso <b>Few</b> <b>was</b> born on April 11, 1789 {{the son of}} Captain Ignatius Few and Mary Candler in Columbia County Georgia. A {{historical}} oddity {{exists in}} the life of Emory University in that Emory's founder (I. A. <b>Few),</b> <b>was</b> Asa Candler's cousin (who later became Emory’s greatest benefactor).|$|R
50|$|The Legislative Assembly {{first met}} on 1 October 1791. It {{consisted}} of 745 members. <b>Few</b> <b>were</b> nobles, very <b>few</b> <b>were</b> clergymen, {{and the great}} body came from the middle class. The members were generally young, and, since none had sat in the previous Assembly, they largely lacked national political experience.|$|R
5|$|Although most flies {{live and}} fly {{close to the}} ground, a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> known to fly at heights and a few like Oscinella (Chloropidae) {{are known to be}} {{dispersed}} by winds at altitudes of up to 2000ft and over long distances. Some hover flies like Metasyrphus corollae have been known to undertake long flights in response to aphid population spurts.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms {{were built}} in Valletta {{to serve as the}} war {{headquarters}} for the defence of Malta. They were later used in the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily. Throughout the war, many air-raid shelters also were dug in the limestone rock of the islands, either by the government or by individuals or families, to protect the civilian population of Malta from Italian or German aerial bombardment. Many of the shelters still exist, and a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> open to the public.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the number of women employed in the mines {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are incomplete and a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> contradictory.|$|E
5|$|For the Shakkanakkus, {{the lists}} are {{incomplete}} and after Hanun-Dagan who ruled {{at the end}} of the Ur era c. 2008 BC (c. 1920 BC Short chronology), they become full of lacunae. Roughly 13 more Shakkanakkus succeeded Hanun-Dagan but only <b>few</b> <b>are</b> known, with the last known one reigning not too long before the reign of Yaggid-Lim who founded the Lim dynasty in c. 1830 BC.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding experienced a revival, and {{the consumption of}} horse meat continued to decrease. On March 11, 1994, the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again, and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses. Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France, with some going to Italy, Belgium and Germany, mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons. A <b>few</b> <b>are</b> sent to Sicily and Guadeloupe, but this is quite rare.|$|E
5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, but a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E

5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and <b>few</b> <b>are</b> willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{buildings}} on Mackinac Island are built of wood, a <b>few</b> <b>are</b> of stone, and most have clapboard siding. The architectural styles on the island span 300 years, from the earliest Native American structures to the styles of the 19th century. The earliest structures were built by the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribes before European exploration. At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century. Mackinac Island has the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States, and one of few survivors in North America.|$|E
50|$|The {{company had}} not {{given up on the}} rear-engined idea and a new car, the Type J, {{appeared}} in 1922 but only a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> sold. It had a bonnet and radiator very similar to the front-engined cars. The final car, the type G of 1930 was also rear-engined, with the engine behind the rear axle, only a <b>few</b> <b>were</b> made.|$|R
