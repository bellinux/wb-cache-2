5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an <b>electric</b> <b>transmission</b> corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E

25|$|Ephaptic {{transmission}} is when two nerves {{communicate with each}} other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance <b>electric</b> <b>transmission</b> and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to “cross-talk” and send action potentials in both directions.|$|E
25|$|Several {{forces are}} driving {{the growth of}} wind power in Texas: {{favorable}} wind resources and land availability, State targets for renewable energy, cost efficiency of development and operation of wind farms, and a suitable <b>electric</b> <b>transmission</b> grid. The broad scope and geographical extent of wind farms in Texas is considerable: wind resource areas lie in the Texas Panhandle, along the Gulf coast south of Galveston, and in the mountain passes and ridge tops of the Trans-Pecos in the western tip of Texas. While there are over 10,700 wind turbines currently operating in Texas to generate electricity, there are still 80,000 windmills operating in Texas for pumping water, indicating the amount of growth potential still left for wind power generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of electric locomotives {{around the turn}} of the 20th century and later diesel-electric locomotives spelled the beginning of a decline in the use of steam locomotives, although it was some time before they were phased out of general use. As diesel power (especially with <b>electric</b> <b>transmission)</b> became more reliable in the 1930s, it gained a foothold in North America. The full transition away from steam power in North America took place during the 1950s. In continental Europe, large-scale electrification had replaced steam power by the 1970s. Steam was a familiar technology, adapted well to local facilities, and also consumed a wide variety of fuels; this led to its continued use in many countries until the end of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The General Pershing Zephyr was {{the ninth}} of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Zephyr streamliners, {{and the last}} built as an {{integrated}} streamliner rather than a train hauled by an EMD E-unit diesel locomotive. It was constructed in 1939 with bodywork and passenger cars by Budd Company and diesel engine, <b>electric</b> <b>transmission,</b> power truck, and other locomotive equipment by General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation. Because its intended Kansas City, Missouri to St. Louis, Missouri route passed near the birthplace and boyhood home of famous World War I General John J. Pershing, the train was named after him. The power car was named Silver Charger, after Pershing's horse Charger, while the passenger cars were named after U.S. Army badges of rank—Silver Leaf, Silver Eagle, and Silver Star.|$|E
500|$|The {{turbines}} {{were initially}} {{intended to use}} <b>electric</b> <b>transmission,</b> and would have produced [...] apiece.

The ships mounted eight 500kW diesel generators arranged in four pairs, five 690kW turbo-generators, and one 460kW, the last of which was connected to a 400kVA AC generator. Another 550kVA diesel generator provided additional AC power. The electrical plant provided a total 7,910kW at 220volts.|$|E

500|$|In 1926, Williams {{mandated}} {{the use of}} {{parachutes for}} all RAAF aircrew. He had visited the Irvin Air Chute Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an Airco DH.9, on 26May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5August, having decided that it would set [...] "a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them..." [...] Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank ("I {{thought it would be}} a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet") and [...] "too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt <b>electric</b> <b>transmission</b> line", he completed the exercise unscathed.|$|E

The Ordnance Department concurred, but added on 1,000 T23 series tanks, an advanced design handicapped by problems with the reliability of its <b>electric</b> <b>transmission.</b> McNair disapproved the request, writing that [...] "the M4 tank, particularly the M4A3, has been widely hailed as the best tank on the battlefield today... Other than this particular request, which represents the British view—there has been no call from any theater for a 90mm tank gun. There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank... there can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank versus tank duel—which is believed unsound and unnecessary... {{there is no indication that}} the 76mm antitank gun is inadequate against the Mark VI (Tiger) tank." ...|$|E
500|$|The Foote brothers' first {{projects}} in Jackson, Battle Creek and Adrian, like most pre-1900 electric power projects, were created for street lighting, with some limited residential and business lighting. Since {{transmission of electricity}} over long distances was not well understood, they were situated near the cities they served. But the demand for power was growing, driven by among other things, {{the advent of the}} streetcar and increased industrial use of electricity, outstripping the capacity of smaller rivers and existing dams. So larger rivers were sought. In 1898 the Foote brothers, working with engineering partner Fargo, constructed the Trowbridge Dam across the Kalamazoo River in order to supply the city of Kalamazoo. The dam was located near Allegan, about [...] away from the city, an unheard of distance at the time, and was the first major hydroelectric project in Western Michigan. Initially beset by power loss during transmission and other problems, the Trowbridge dam successfully provided power to a larger area than previous dams, after the Foote brothers advanced {{the state of the art}} in insulators and <b>electric</b> <b>transmission</b> equipment.|$|E
