30|$|In {{the only}} case {{described}} to date of a radial tear in both roots [15] concurrent with a chronic ACL tear, Lee et al. [15] postulated that {{the mechanism of}} injury was involvement of the posterior lateral root together with an ACL injury. The medial radial tear in the posterior root was caused by forceful mechanical stress secondary to instability. In the present case, avulsion of both meniscal roots was associated with an acute ACL tear. From {{a review of the}} video recording, the mechanism of injury was seen to be clearly due to forceful rotatory stress. As postulated by Park et al. [20], anterior tibial translation in an ACL injury may pull the lateral meniscus forward, stripping the meniscofemoral ligament away the meniscus attachment. The mechanism of medial meniscus root injury is more difficult to explain. Due to external rotation, for stress associated with compression axial load, the posterior horn <b>is</b> <b>impinged</b> <b>by</b> the femoral condyle. Markolf et al. [16] have shown that the anterior tibial force and the external tibial torque during knee loading produce relatively high posterior horn attachment forces, presumably by impinging the medial femoral condyle against the posterior meniscal rim.|$|E
40|$|Satellites {{in orbit}} are {{expected}} to maintain a preset attitude either pointing towards Earth (in case of satellites for weather) or pointing towards space {{for the purpose of}} research and exploration. The satellite as a system though is extremely nonlinear and the system parameters are not easily available. The goal of this thesis is to develop robust and adaptive control laws {{that can be used to}} control the attitude of satellites in elliptic orbits. The attitude of the satellite is controlled by the use of Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) on the solar panels of the satellite. The SRP is basically a mechanical pressure caused by the photons impinging on the solar panels. By deflecting the solar panels the area that <b>is</b> <b>impinged</b> <b>by</b> photons is varied and therefore the torque on the satellite is also varied. This torque is used to control the attitude of the satellite which is expected to be maintained at a preset orientation. In this work, different methods will be used to control the satellite under different conditions involving state and output feedback. For state feedback all the states of the system are assumed to be available. In this case the states would involve the pitch angle, angular velocity and acceleration of the satellite. However the information on these states may not be easily available. Output feedback is when the output alone of the system is used and only an estimation of other states is used. Simulation is used to project the results of the different types of controllers...|$|E
40|$|We present new {{evidence}} of shallow-water muddy contourite drifts at two distinct {{locations in the}} central Mediterranean characterized by a relatively deep shelf edge (between 170 and 300 m below sea level) : the south-eastern Adriatic margin and the north-western Sicily Channel. The growth of these shelf-edge contourite drifts is ascribed to the long-term impact of the Mediterranean themohaline circulation. The Levantine Intermediate Water flows continuously, with annual or inter-annual variations, and affects the shelf edge and the upper slope in both study areas. In addition, the SW Adriatic margin <b>is</b> <b>impinged</b> <b>by</b> the seasonally modulated off-shelf cascading of North Adriatic Dense Water. This water mass has formed ever since the large Adriatic continental shelf was drowned by the post-glacial sea-level rise. It energetically sweeps the entire slope from the shelf edge to the deep basin. These bottom currents flow parallel or oblique to the depth contours, and are laterally constricted along markedly erosional moats aligned parallel to the shelf edge where they increase in flow velocity. The internal geometry and growth patterns of the shelf-edge contourites reflect changes in oceanographic setting affecting the whole Mediterranean Sea. In particular, seismic correlation with published sediment cores documents that these deposits are actively growing and migrating during the present interglacial, implying an enhancement in bottom-water formation during intervals of relative sea-level rise and highstand. Regardless of the specific mechanisms of formation, sediment drifts in both study areas {{have been affected by}} widespread thin-skinned mass-wasting events during post-glacial times. Repeated mass-transport processes have affected in particular the downslope flank of the shelf-edge contourite drifts, indicating that these muddy deposits are prone to failure during, or soon after, their deposition...|$|E

30|$|Diffuse aurora is {{primarily}} {{caused by the}} precipitation of energetic electrons (0.1 – 30 keV) in the atmosphere along the magnetic field lines, and occurs over a broad latitude range (Ni et al. 2008; Thorne et al. 2010). Although generally not visible by naked eyes, the diffuse auroral precipitation provides {{the main energy source}} for the high-latitude upper atmosphere (Newell et al. 2009). Concerning the present event, the IMF Bz was primarily dominated by positive value (northward orientation), and the solar wind condition was relatively quiet before the sudden enhancement of the solar wind dynamic pressure indicated in Fig.  2, thus the magnetosphere was nearly undisturbed before the SI onset due to the inefficiency of energy loading from the solar wind to the magnetosphere by component magnetic reconnection in the low-latitude magnetopause (Fuselier and Lewis 2011). The extremely faint diffuse-type auroral structure flickering in the southern edge of the FOV of the ASI at YRS shown in Fig.  4 was also a good indicator for the quiet magnetospheric circumstance. We note that when the magnetosphere <b>was</b> <b>impinged</b> <b>by</b> the IP shock, the magnitude of the geomagnetic field clearly increased at lower latitude (Fig.  3). This can be understood in terms of an enhancement of the magnetopause current flowing from dawnside to duskside as the compressional wave approaches. It was previously shown that VLF chorus wave activity in the magnetospheric cavity can be triggered or see its intensity increased while the energetic electron precipitation is enhanced significantly and rapidly as well, {{as a result of the}} sudden external compression by the IP shock (Gail et al. 1990). Consequently, the wave-particle interaction properties are significantly affected by the magnetic perturbation and plasma variations associated with a shock sudden impact.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an analytical {{study of the}} effect of the gradient in quasi-static plateau stress on the dynamic behavior of graded cellular rods under impact loading. Finite element (FE) simulations of graded hexagonal and circular cells’ chains under uniaxial impact loading are first carried out by using ABAQUS/EXPLICIT to observe their dynamic deformation modes. To build an analytical model, a graded cellular rod, whose quasi-static plateau stress varies along the axial direction, is supposed to <b>be</b> <b>impinged</b> <b>by</b> a rigid mass G with initial velocity V 0. Only one shock front appears when the gradient is positive, while two shock fronts appear in the rod with negative gradient. Analytical expressions of the dynamic response parameters for the graded cellular rod are theoretically derived by using the one-dimensional shock theory originally proposed by Reid and Peng (1997). Closed form solution is found for the single shock (SS) mode, while finite difference method is employed to obtain solutions for the double shock (DS) mode. Densification velocity, at which the graded rod is just fully crushed {{at the end of its}} dynamic response, is determined; and accordingly, the maximum energy-absorbing capacity of the graded cellular rod is determined. The weakest part of the graded rod is suggested to be placed at the impact end to achieve higher energy absorption. The theoretical models are then extended to the second scenario in which the graded cellular rod together with attached mass G impinges onto a rigid target. Similar to Scenario I, the gradient significantly influences the capacity of the graded cellular rod when the ratio of mass G to the mass of the rod is relatively small. The comparison between the FE simulation results and analytical predictions shows good agreement, which validates the theoretical model...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{high-pressure}} jets for {{supply of}} coolant to the cutting zone {{has the potential}} to significantly increase the productivity and process stability when machining difficult-to-cut materials such as Ni-based superalloys. Apart from better chip-breakability, the jets enable the coolant to reach closer to the cutting edge and hence enhance its capability to dissipate heat. This work deals with characterization of conventional and surface-modified uncoated WC-Co tools used for machining of a Ni-based superalloy (Alloy 718) with assistance of high-pressure coolant supply. Specifically, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to study the flank wear lands and areas <b>impinged</b> <b>by</b> the coolant of conventional and surface-modified tools. As compared to conventional tools, the surface-modified tools (with arrays of square pyramidal shaped dimples on rake and flank faces) enabled to reduce flank wear. This was linked to the larger surface area provided by the modifications which can enhance the tool-coolant interaction. In that way, the heat dissipation during cutting is improved and the tool is subjected to less thermal softening and wear. At the tool surfaces, the Co-binder was removed by erosion during the coolant-impact when machining. The erosion occurred on areas of both rake and flank surface which <b>are</b> <b>impinged</b> <b>by</b> the high-pressure coolant jets and are not in contact with the workpiece during cutting. The erosion damage can be used to determine the access of coolant to the cutting edge. Such observations are not possible during the machining since the cutting zone is visually inaccessible. In addition, the existence of an erosion-free zone adjacent to the flank wear land was observed. This indicated that the coolant jets did not reach this location. Instead, the high temperature occurring at the tool surface during machining led to vaporization of the coolant and the formed vapor-barrier prevented the coolant to reach closer to the cutting zone. After the conducted machining tests, the worn flank faces were covered by workpiece material. Removal of the adhered material allowed to characterize the underlying tool microstructure. However, fragments of workpiece precipitates were still found on the worn tool surface. Because of longer contact times and larger thermal loads in the tertiary shearing zone in connection with increasing flank wear, the morphology of the fragments changed to a more smeared-out appearance...|$|R

The breakup products, oxygen and a proton, were detected in coincidence. First-order perturbation theory significantly overpredicts the breakup cross section for the 208 Pb target. Dynamical calculations with a dynamic polarization as the leading order correction were performed. The calculations reproduce the data for 17 F on 58 Ni but overpredict the breakup of 17 F on 208 Pb {{by a factor of}} two at forward angles...|$|R
40|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{syndrome}} with markedly high heritability. The diagnostic {{indicators of}} autism are core behavioral symptoms, rather than definitive neuropathological markers. Etiology {{is thought to}} involve complex, multigenic interactions and possible environmental contributions. In this review, we focus on genetic pathways with multiple members represented in autism candidate gene lists. Many of these pathways can also <b>be</b> <b>impinged</b> upon <b>by</b> environmental risk factors associated with the disorder. The mouse model system provides a method to experimentally manipulate candidate genes for autism susceptibility, and to use environmental challenges to drive aberrant gene expression and cell pathology early in development. Mouse models for fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome and other disorders associated with autistic-like behavior have elucidated neuropathology that might underlie the autism phenotype, including abnormalities in synaptic plasticity. Mouse models have also been used to investigate the effects of alterations in signaling pathways on neuronal migration, neurotransmission and brain anatomy, relevant to findings in autistic populations. Advances have included the evaluation of mouse models with behavioral assays designed to reflect disease symptoms, including impaired social interaction, communication deficits and repetitive behaviors, and the symptom onset during the neonatal period. Research focusing {{on the effect of}} gene-by-gene interactions or genetic susceptibility to detrimental environmental challenges may further understanding of the complex etiology for autism...|$|R
