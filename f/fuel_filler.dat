5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E

25|$|The bumpers {{were very}} small, {{no more than}} trim pieces. A strange and sour-looking front gave way to an ovoid rear end, {{culminating}} in an engine cover perforated by at least 50 vent openings. On the rear fenders two louvered vents allow air to the engine compartment; the right-hand one also opens to allow access to the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler.</b> Finally, a frameless opening rear glass provides a measure of hatchback practicality.|$|E

25|$|Bladder tanks, bag tanks or fuel cells, are {{reinforced}} rubberised bags {{installed in}} a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> neck or access panel, and is secured by means of snap fasteners or cord and loops inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprop aircraft use bladder tanks.|$|E
25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} a 4.0L V6 mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or an optional 5-speed automatic transmission. The V6 powertrains were unchanged from {{those used in}} 2005–2009 Mustangs. Though the 2010 Mustang V-6 retained a single exhaust outlet, {{the diameter of the}} tip had been increased one-half of an inch to three inches. The 2010 Mustang included new spring rates and dampers to improve ride quality and control and Ford's AdvanceTrac traction and stability control system standard. Newly standard on the base Mustang were 17-inch painted aluminum wheels while 18-inch wheels continue to be optional (except for V8 models, where 18-inch wheels were mounted by default). Other new available features and options for the 2010 Mustang included Ford SYNC, dual-zone automatic climate control, an updated navigation system with Sirius Travel Link, a capless <b>fuel</b> <b>filler,</b> a reverse camera system to aid in backing up, and an updated version of the V6 Pony Package.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "radiator" [...] cap was {{actually}} the <b>fuel</b> tank <b>filler,</b> which led to problems when mechanics unfamiliar with air-cooled cars topped off the fuel tank with water.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} {{for determining the}} fission heat flux of a prime specimen inserted into a specimen of a test reactor. A pair of thermocouple test specimens are positioned {{at the same level}} in the holder and a determination is made of various experimental data including the temperature of the thermocouple test specimens, the temperature of bulk water channels located in the test holder, the gamma scan count ratios for the thermocouple test specimens and the prime specimen, and the thicknesses of the outer clads, the <b>fuel</b> <b>fillers,</b> and the backclad of the thermocouple test specimen. Using this experimental data, the absolute value of the fission heat flux for the thermocouple test specimens and prime specimen can be calculated...|$|R
25|$|In Europe and Australia, the {{customer}} selects {{one of several}} color-coded nozzles {{depending on the type}} of <b>fuel</b> required. The <b>filler</b> pipe of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded <b>fuel.</b> The tank <b>filler</b> opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. In European Union countries leaded fuel is no longer available, with LRP (lead replacement petrol) being the only fuel available for engines which need it.|$|R
25|$|The D type was {{modified}} {{for use on}} unarmed, long-range photo-reconnaissance versions of the Spitfire, such as the P.R. Mk Id (P.R. versions {{described in more detail}} below), with weapon bays left empty, and the relatively heavy-skinned leading edge wing structure ahead of the main spar converted to integral auxiliary fuel tanks capable of carrying 66½ Imperial gallons (300 l) in addition to that stored in the fuselage tanks ahead of the cockpit. The filler caps were well outboard, between ribs 19 and 20 on the leading edge, because the wing tips were higher {{than the rest of the}} wing due to dihedral, and thus the only place a <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> cap could be located. An expansion and overflow vent was fitted to protect the tanks from bursting as the fuel vaporized and expanded from the hot sun beating directly on the thin metal wing skin (which doubled as the walls of the tank). This vent was fitted further outboard, between ribs 20 and 21, in the highest space in the tank, where vapor would naturally collect.|$|E
25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2016 {{model year}} the Volt {{required}} premium gasoline of (R+M)/2 octane rating of 91 or higher because the higher octane permitted the 10.5:1 compression ratio engine to utilize more ignition timing advance {{in order to}} maximize its fuel efficiency by 5 to 10% as compared to regular gasoline. For users who drive mostly in electric mode and to avoid maintenance problems caused by storing the same gasoline in the tank for months, the 2011 Volt has a sealed and pressurized fuel tank to avoid evaporation, and as a result, the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> has to be depressurized before opening the tank. Also the engine management system monitors the time between engine running and it is programmed to prompt the driver to run past the [...] all-electric range before recharging in order to consume some gasoline. If the driver does not run on gasoline, the system will automatically run the maintenance mode which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate the fluids within the engine. A configuration with an E85 flex-fuel capable engine is under development and was expected to be available in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the Electrosport was differentiated from regular production Hornets by a one-piece solid fiberglass body-colored panel {{in place of the}} AMC's silver and black plastic grille. Additional gauges were added to the instrument panel. The Hornet’s gas cap covered the three-prong plug mounted in the former <b>fuel</b> tank <b>filler</b> hole to which an extension cord connected to 220-volt AC power.|$|R
5000|$|... 1961-1965 : Engine specs {{amended to}} a {{normally}} aspirated engine of between 1300 cc and 1500 cc, no compressors allowed, minimum weight set at 450 kg, pump fuel only, automatic starter, roll bar required, double braking system mandatory, standardised seatbelt anchorage, fire protection for <b>fuel</b> tanks, <b>fillers</b> and breathers, FIA begin to organise safety inspections (previously done by local authorities), protective helmet and overalls obligatory, flag signalling code established.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fuel</b> tank, tank <b>filler</b> {{neck and}} {{evaporative}} canister {{are made of}} stainless steel. Both the fuel pump and fuel filter are completely sealed inside the gas tank and require a complete replacement of the gas tank if either the fuel pump or filter fail.|$|R
2500|$|In 1972 the [...] "L" [...] {{received}} new <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> caps {{to reduce}} moisture seepage, and better seats and seat tracks. 1100 {{were built in}} 1972.|$|E
2500|$|The Ford GT {{features}} {{many new}} and unique technologies, including superplastic-formed frame, aluminum body panels, roll-bonded floor panels, a friction stir welded center tunnel, {{covered by a}} magnesium center console, a [...] "ship-in-a-bottle" [...] gas tank, a capless <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> system, one-piece door panels, and an aluminum engine cover with a one-piece carbon fiber inner panel.|$|E
2500|$|All U.S. market Hornets {{featured}} {{catalytic converters}} and now required gasoline without tetraethyl lead. [...] "Unleaded Fuel Only" [...] warnings were displayed {{on both the}} fuel gauge and on a decal by the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler.</b> Consumers complained loudly about the 1974 [...] "mandatory seat belt" [...] system, and it was replaced in 1975 with a simple reminder buzzer and light.|$|E
2500|$|... "FlexFuel" [...] {{vehicles}} have upgraded {{fuel system}} and engine components which {{are designed for}} long life using E85 or M85, and the ECU can adapt to any fuel blend between gasoline and E85 or M85. Typical upgrades include modifications to: fuel tanks, fuel tank electrical wiring, fuel pumps, fuel filters, <b>fuel</b> lines, <b>filler</b> tubes, <b>fuel</b> level sensors, fuel injectors, seals, fuel rails, fuel pressure regulators, valve seats and inlet valves. [...] "Total Flex" [...] Autos destined for the Brazilian market can use E100 (100% Ethanol).|$|R
5000|$|The later Mk IIs and {{approximately}} the first 4,000 Mk IIIs had a later type of [...] "beetle back" [...] {{with an additional}} small window on the left front side and windows in both doors. A canvas roof was mounted on a cruciform steel frame over the crew compartment, {{and there were two}} square vents in the roof behind the canvas section. The vehicle also had larger <b>fuel</b> tanks and <b>filler</b> cap surrounds.|$|R
5000|$|Mazda began {{producing}} the Festiva as the [...] "Mazda 121" [...] for Australia and Europe in 1987, but this model was never retailed in Japan. The 121 ended production in 1990, and was officially discontinued by Mazda Australia in February 1991. From October 1991, Ford Australia began importing {{the car as}} the [...] "Ford Festiva" [...] from Kia's South Korean production facility. Where the Mazda was sold as a three-door hatchback, the Ford was sold initially as a five-door only. From January 1993, a Festiva three-door, badged [...] "Festiva Trio" [...] was launched in Australia. Both versions were powered by the overhead camshaft carbureted 1.3-liter B3 engine with the five-speed manual transmission; a three-speed automatic was optional for the five-door. Standard equipment in Australia included an AM/FM radio, tachometer, intermittent windscreen wipers, remote releases for the rear door and <b>fuel</b> tank <b>filler</b> door, with air-conditioning available as an option. Ford discontinued the Festiva in the Australian market in March 1994.|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 Grand Prix {{received}} a revised split grille with vertical bars that was entirely above the bumper. Out back, the boattail effect was softened somewhat {{due to a}} new federally mandated [...] bumper that {{was added to the}} similar mandated front bumper introduced in 1973. The license plate and <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> were moved above the bumper and taillight lenses were revised.|$|E
2500|$|Changes for the 1975 {{model year}} were minor as AMC {{focused on the}} {{development}} and introduction of its innovative Pacer, but Matadors now included a standard [...] "no maintenance" [...] electronic ignition developed by Prestolite. All U.S. market Matadors featured catalytic converters that required the use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. New [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] decals were placed by the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> door and on the fuel gauge. Steel-belted radial tires became standard equipment on all Matadors.|$|E
2500|$|Riding {{the same}} {{wheelbase}} as the sedan, the liftback was {{identical to the}} sedan from the A-pillar forward and featured a sloping roof (compromising rear headroom) and a hatchback with a more shallow Kammback tail. The rear license plate hid the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> cap. The Spirit offered a generous cruising range with its [...] "fuel tank capacity of 21 gallons and probable fuel mileage of 25 mpg or more... enabling the car's driver to travel over 500 miles between fill ups".|$|E
40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which travel on a gantry crane for the filling process. The filling nozzle and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the <b>fuel</b> tank <b>filler</b> neck. If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the filler neck. In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the filler neck of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the filler neck, the docking element is docked onto the fuel tank cap. The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|R
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the <b>fuel</b> tank <b>filler.</b> A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|R
5000|$|Testing {{continued}} until February 18, 1943, {{when the second}} prototype crashed. Flown by Boeing's chief test pilot, Edmund T. [...] "Eddie" [...] Allen on a two-hour powerplant performance test, leaking <b>fuel</b> from a <b>filler</b> cap in the wing leading edge ran down inside the leading-edge and ignited, spreading to the engines. Due to the much reduced power, the aircraft, unable to climb, crashed into the Frye meat-packing plant, demolishing {{the majority of the}} packing plant and killing all eleven crew, 22 employees at the plant and one fireman. The crash killed many élite Boeing personnel involved in the design; the pilot, Allen, was chief of the Research Division. After the crash, the United States Army Air Forces and a congressional committee headed by then-Senator Harry S. Truman investigated the B-29 program issuing a scathing report, prompting the Army Air Forces {{to take control of the}} program.|$|R
2500|$|The U.S. National Fire Protection Association {{does most}} of the {{research}} and code writing to address the potential for explosions of gasoline vapor. The customer fueling area, up to [...] above the surface, normally does not have explosive concentrations of vapors, but may from time to time. Above this height, where most <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> necks are located, there is no expectation of an explosive concentration of gasoline vapor in normal operating conditions. Electrical equipment in the fueling area may be specially certified for use around gasoline vapors.|$|E
2500|$|The road racing {{version of}} the XR-750 used an {{aluminum}} oil tank, had a [...] fiberglass fuel tank, and a fiberglass fairing which included extra heat shielding to protect the rider's left leg when riding in a tuck position. On the top center of the fuel tank was a leather pad with a round cutout for the left-side <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> cap. Like the dirt tracker, it used a Ceriani fork and Girling shocks, two 36mm Mikuni carburetors and tuned dual reverse cone exhaust. Instrumentation consisted of a Smiths tachometer.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1980s, the European {{motorcycle}} {{industry as}} a whole was reeling from Japanese competition, causing many companies like NVT (the amalgamated surviving British companies Norton, Triumph, and BSA), Moto-Guzzi, and many others to struggle or disappear completely. [...] Laverda attempted to update their product line by introducing the RGS sports tourer in 1983, [...] with features such unbreakable Bayflex plastic mouldings; <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> in the fairing; integrated but removable luggage (Executive version), and adjustable footpeg position. [...] In 1985, came the SFC 1000 sports model [...] a badge engineered attempt based on the RGS to reprise the hallowed SFC name.|$|E
40|$|The {{composite}} SARAS wing is a wet {{fuel tank}} enclosed by end ribs at station # 4, # 6 and # 20, rear spar, front spar, front beam, top skin and bottom skin. The fuel pressure is {{developed in the}} tank area due to the aircraft acceleration. The objective {{of this study is}} to check the safety of wing against combined effect of the critical air load and fuel pressure on the wing structure acting simultaneously. Static and buckling analysis of the wing for the combined critical air load case and fuel pressure case for ultimate load have been carried out to check the safety of the structure. Detailed studies have been made to understand the effect of fuel pressure at the skin to rib and skin to spar joints using the results of global FE analysis. The bolts pull through load on top flange and T-pull load on bottom flange of all ribs and spars have been extracted based on the analysis. This is to ensure the safety of bolted joints on top side against bolt pull load and co-cured joints on bottom side against T-pull load. The strains are extracted for stringers, rib and spar gussets which have been modeled using one dimensional element to prove the safety against <b>fuel</b> pressure. <b>Filler</b> cap cut out has been modeled with actual edge distances and rivet forces are extracted for comparing with test results on a single lap bearing specimen...|$|R

5000|$|West Coast Choppers {{motorcycles}} {{are described}} as old school, and minimalist. [...] WCC bikes have been called more stripped down when contrasted with decades-long established chopper builders like Arlen Ness, that is, a bike with, [...] "not much there but engine, what the law requires, and something to hold onto." [...] In spite of this characterization, a WCC trademark {{is the use of}} 9×19mm and [...]44 Magnum shell casings as purely non-functional decorations, adorning the <b>fuel</b> or oil <b>filler</b> caps or top of the motorcycle's handlebar risers, or elsewhere. The presence of this 20th-century gun ammunition is intended to evoke Jesse James' distant ancestor, old west outlaw and gunfighter Jesse James.
