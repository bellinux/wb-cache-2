5|$|Interactionist dualism, {{or simply}} interactionism, is the {{particular}} form of dualism first <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> Descartes in the Meditations. In the 20th century, its major defenders have been Karl Popper and John Carew Eccles. It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.|$|E
5|$|Comte's {{positivism}} {{established the}} initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research. Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are more typically {{cited as the}} fathers of contemporary social science. In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism. Positivism has also been <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> 'technocrats' {{who believe in the}} inevitability of social progress through science and technology.|$|E
5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

5000|$|The word {{populism}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word populus, which means people in English (in the sense of [...] "folk", [...] "nation", as in: [...] "The Roman People" [...] (populus Romanus), not in the sense of [...] "multiple individual persons" [...] as in: [...] "There are people visiting us today"). Therefore, populism <b>espouses</b> government <b>by</b> the people as a whole (that is to say, the masses). This is in contrast to aristocracy, synarchy or plutocracy, each of which is an ideology that <b>espouses</b> government <b>by</b> a small, privileged group above the masses.|$|R

5|$|In 1932twelve {{years after}} the ACLU was foundedit had {{achieved}} significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> the ACLU, {{and the general public}} was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general. But the Great Depression brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large {{increase in the number of}} free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{followed}} the musical ideals <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical {{themes in the}} Russian Easter Festival Overture, folk song in Capriccio Espagnol and orientalism in Scheherazade, possibly his best known work. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work {{up to and including}} his Third Symphony—some, like Antar and Sadko, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition.|$|E
5000|$|According to Henry of Huntingdon, Robert died {{of shame}} after [...] "a certain earl carried off the lady he had <b>espoused,</b> either <b>by</b> some intrigue or by force and stratagem." [...] He {{was the last}} {{surviving}} Norman nobleman to have fought in the Battle of Hastings.|$|R

5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Most Jews, {{religious}} and secular, consider {{the wall to}} be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap. There are, however, some haredi Jews who hold different views. Most notable are the adherents of the Satmar hasidic dynasty who retain the views <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> their Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who would not approach the Wall after the 1967 conquest because of his opposition to Zionism, although he did visit the site during his visits to the Holy Land in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
50|$|During 1941, the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers again {{published}} one of Schade's studies. His {{new study}} was entitled: Design Curves for Cross-Stiffened Plating Under Uniform Bending Load. This paper {{proved to be}} an important work, as the theories <b>espoused</b> therein <b>by</b> Schade were thereafter accepted and adopted by BuShips as new policy and practice regarding estimating static responses on welded stiffened ship panels.|$|R
5000|$|Johan Rudolf Kjellén ( [...] , 13 June 1864, Torsö [...] - [...] 14 November 1922, Uppsala) was a Swedish {{political}} scientist and politician who first {{coined the term}} [...] "geopolitics". His work was influenced by Friedrich Ratzel. Along with Alexander von Humboldt, Karl Ritter, and Ratzel, Kjellén would lay the foundations for the German Geopolitik that would later be <b>espoused</b> prominently <b>by</b> General Karl Haushofer.|$|R
50|$|Like Thomas Aquinas College, the SII <b>espoused</b> {{academic}} freedom <b>by</b> not limiting admissions to applicants of any religious or philosophical belief. Students {{tended to be}} Catholic, but some non-Catholics became students and faculty members.|$|R
5|$|Following the defeat, the Chief of the German General Staff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, {{ordered the}} Supreme Army Command {{to conduct a}} court of enquiry into the {{defensive}} collapse of the Arras sector. The court concluded that the Sixth Army headquarters had disregarded frontline commander reports, noting a possible imminent attack and as a result, reserve units were kept too far back to execute a timely and effective counterattack. The court concluded that Sixth Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an elastic defence properly as <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> German defensive doctrine of the time. Instead, the defensive system {{was a series of}} unmoving strong points and static lines of resistance, which the Allied artillery ultimately isolated and destroyed. As a result of the inquiry, Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium where he served the remainder of the war as that country's Governor General.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
5|$|No {{attempt to}} arrest Blackburn was made, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with his family in}} early 1873. The family lived in Louisville's Galt House hotel, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice in that city. During a cholera epidemic in 1873, Blackburn rightly theorized that the disease was spread by the consumption of contaminated water, but most citizens accepted the competing theory that cholera was a miasmatic disease. This theory was <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> Thomas S. Bell, a better-known physician in Louisville. Thousands {{died as a result of}} failing to heed Blackburn's advice to boil potentially contaminated water before drinking it. Blackburn's philanthropic work included treating victims of yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873 and Fernandina, Florida, in 1877. He refused to accept compensation for his services in either city, but was presented with gifts from appreciative residents in both cases. Several southern newspapers also carried glowing accounts of Blackburn's service.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{reference}} to Idealism in Hindu texts is in Purusha Sukta of the Rig Veda. This sukta <b>espouses</b> panentheism <b>by</b> presenting cosmic being Purusha as both pervading all universe and yet being transcendent to it. Absolute idealism {{can be seen}} in Chāndogya Upaniṣad, where things of the objective world like the five elements and the subjective world such as will, hope, memory etc. are seen to be emanations from the Self.|$|R
5000|$|It also {{discusses}} the Wang Yangming {{school of thought}} (according to which, [...] "to know and not to act is not truly to know"), <b>espoused</b> in Japan <b>by</b> Chusai Oshio, a rebel who died in 1837 while leading an insurrection in Osaka.|$|R
5000|$|Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950) was an [...] "Indian sage" [...] with a {{philosophy}} about {{the path to}} self-knowledge and the integration of personality <b>espoused</b> in books <b>by</b> author Paul Brunton and Ramana's own writings such as the Collected Works (1969) and Forty Verses on Reality (1978).|$|R
5|$|Taylor and Westmoreland {{began to}} lobby Kỳ and Thi, {{the two most}} {{powerful}} generals in the junta outside Khánh, hoping to enlist them {{in an effort to}} shut down Phát and Thảo while also removing Khánh. Kỳ was the most convenient outlet, as the air force along with both the American and South Vietnamese military headquarters were adjacent to one another at Tan Son Nhut, making communication easy, whereas Thi was commanding I Corps in the far north. Westmoreland communicated with Kỳ through the latter’s adviser, Robert R. Rowland. Despite his inconvenient geographical location, Thi was seen as being hostile to Khánh by this point in time, and as a supporter of and commander of a region which was seen as the Buddhist heartland of Vietnam, he and his grassroots support base were strongly opposed to the Diemist pro-Catholic ideology <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> Phát and Thảo.|$|E
5|$|When the CCP {{entered the}} First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924–27 with the Guomindang (GMD), the each party {{established}} their own women’s department during this time. However, the United Front {{ended with the}} White Terror (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror {{because they were not}} {{under the control of the}} GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the New Life Movement, which sought to counter the gender role <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927–1945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{theology}} <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> their religious leaders, {{the people of}} Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in nearly every calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were very real and present for them. They believed {{in the presence of}} malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, but {{there is little evidence that}} Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.|$|E
50|$|Since independence, Gabon has {{followed}} a nonaligned policy, advocating dialogue {{in international affairs}} and recognizing each side of divided countries. In inter-African affairs, Gabon <b>espouses</b> development <b>by</b> evolution rather than revolution and favors regulated private enterprise as the system most likely to promote rapid economic growth. Gabon played an important leadership role in the stability of Central Africa through involvement in mediation efforts in Chad, the Central African Republic, Angola, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R.C.), and Burundi.|$|R
50|$|By 448 Eutyches had {{set himself}} {{up for a}} {{confrontation}} with orthodoxy <b>by</b> <b>espousing</b> views that Christ was made of heavenly flesh and therefore not fully human, or otherwise denying the full humanity of Christ. These views, though opposite of those of Nestorius, were just as unorthodox.|$|R
25|$|In 1821, Lord Eldon {{had been}} created Viscount Encombe and Earl of Eldon by George IV, whom he managed to conciliate, partly, no doubt, <b>by</b> <b>espousing</b> his cause against his wife, whose {{advocate}} he had formerly been, and partly through his reputation for zeal against the Roman Catholics.|$|R
5|$|Continuity-based {{theories}} {{are held by}} a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that: Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} al-Ma'mun, continuing his predecessor's support for Mu'tazilism, a theological doctrine that attempted to tread a middle way between secular monarchy and the theocratic nature of rulership <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> the Alids and the various sects of Shi'ism. Mu'tazilis espoused {{the view that the}} Quran was created and hence fell within the authority of a God-guided imām to interpret according to the changing circumstances. While revering Ali, they avoided taking a position on the righteousness of the opposing sides in the conflict between Ali and his opponents. Mu'tazilism was officially adopted by al-Ma'mun in 827, and in 833, shortly before his death, al-Ma'mun made its doctrines compulsory, with the establishment of an inquisition, the miḥna. During his brother's reign, al-Mu'tasim played {{an active role in the}} enforcement of the miḥna in the western provinces, and continued on the same course after his accession: the chief advocate of Mu'tazilism, the head qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, was perhaps the dominant influence at the caliphal court throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign.|$|E
5|$|In late 1918, the British Labour Party {{called for}} the {{establishment}} of an international conference of socialist parties, the Labour and Socialist International. Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international socialist conference to offset its impact. Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky, and Angelica Balabanoff, the First Congress of this Communist International ("Comintern") opened in Moscow in March 1919. It lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in their own nations. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings, with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern. During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism <b>espoused</b> <b>by</b> revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments. While Zinoviev became Comintern's President, Lenin retained significant influence over it.|$|E
50|$|Although many {{audio and}} video {{recordings}} of zajal events have been made, especially on Lebanese TV during the 1960s, 70s and 80s, {{there has been little}} effort to properly transcribe or archive these recordings at national or university libraries for serious scholarly research. The elevation of this canon to scholarly attention was not helped {{by the fact that the}} cause of colloquial Lebanese was <b>espoused</b> only <b>by</b> ultra-nationalists (especially during the divisive Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990), who sought to claim a Lebanese culture distinct from that of the Arabs.|$|R
5000|$|Espoused {{values are}} the organization's stated values and rules of behavior. It {{is how the}} members {{represent}} the organization both to themselves and to others. This is often expressed in official philosophies and public statements of identity. It can sometimes often be a projection for the future, of what the members hope to become. Examples {{of this would be}} employee professionalism, or a [...] "family first" [...] mantra. Trouble may arise if <b>espoused</b> values <b>by</b> leaders are not in line with the deeper tacit assumptions of the culture.|$|R
5000|$|Many modern English {{translations}} tend {{to favor}} cypress (although otherwise the word for [...] "cypress" [...] in Biblical Hebrew is berosh). This was <b>espoused</b> (among others) <b>by</b> Adam Clarke, a Methodist theologian famous for his commentary on the Bible: Clarke cited the resemblance between Greek word for cypress, kuparisson and the Hebrew word gophar.|$|R
