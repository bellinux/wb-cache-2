40|$|Interactive tools make data {{analysis}} both {{more efficient and}} more accessible to a broad population. Simple interfaces such as Google Finance as well as complex visual exploration interfaces such as Tableau are effective because they are tailored to the desired user tasks. Yet, designing <b>interactive</b> <b>interfaces</b> requires technical expertise and domain knowledge. Experts are scarce and expensive, and therefore it is currently infeasible to provide tailored (or precise) interfaces for every user and every task. We envision a data-driven approach to generate tailored <b>interactive</b> <b>interfaces.</b> We observe that <b>interactive</b> <b>interfaces</b> are designed to express sets of programs; thus, samples of programs-increasingly collected by data systems-may help us build <b>interactive</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Based on this idea, Precision Interfaces is a language-agnostic system that examines an input query log, identifies how the queries structurally change, and generates <b>interactive</b> web <b>interfaces</b> to express these changes. The focus {{of this paper is}} on applying this idea towards logs of structured queries. Our experiments show that Precision Interfaces can support multiple query languages (SQL and SPARQL), derive Tableau's salient interaction components from OLAP queries, analyze < 75 k queries in < 12 minutes, and generate interaction designs that improve upon existing interfaces and are comparable to human-crafted interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Behavior change {{represents}} an important {{new approach to}} addressing the energy crisis. Utility companies and private companies are deploying sensor-based power meters and related residential electricity monitoring technologies with the view that monitoring energy use will eventually result in a reduction in energy consumption. The success of these technologies depends largely on homeowners responding to the data with appropriate changes in their consumption behavior. Most energy feedback interfaces, however, have not been designed through a human-centered process and display data {{in ways that are}} unlikely to change behavior. Our proposal is to design <b>interactive</b> <b>interfaces</b> that combine a deeply human-centered process with insights from behavioral economics to reduce residential energy consumption.

40|$|Lisp-based HTTP servers {{provide a}} {{starting}} point for building Web-based applications written in Common Lisp. They do not provide a complete solution. An application needs additional facilities for generating content and managing dialogs. We present some lightweight tools that have been essential in producing applications with complex <b>interactive</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Expressing computed responses is greatly simplified by scripting a template HTML page with some Lisp code. This is managed through our Active Lisp Pages (ALP). Conducting a dialog with a user requires managing an evolving state, for which we have implemented a simple interaction manager. We integrate <b>interactive</b> <b>interfaces</b> developed by third parties in our application, using a simple API based on XML and XSLT. Finally, SOAP messaging provides applications with a standard means of exchanging messages with custom interfaces. These tools have allowed us to assemble consistent and usable user interfaces for our applications...|$|R

Statistical analysis provides insight into the characteristics of vocal querying and possible useful concepts. In the second part of the paper, it is described how categories and concepts from the statistical analysis have been used for the refinement of taxonomies that address user <b>interactive</b> <b>interfacing</b> and feature extraction...|$|R
