25|$|Unlike copper alloys, {{stainless}} steel (S30400) does not exhibit {{any degree of}} bactericidal properties. This material, {{which is one of}} the most common touch surface materials in the healthcare industry, allows toxic E. coli O157:H7 to remain viable for weeks. Near-zero bacterial counts are not observed even after 28 days of investigation. <b>Epifluorescence</b> photographs have demonstrated that E. coli O157:H7 is almost completely killed on copper alloy C10200 after just 90 minutes at 20°C; whereas a substantial number of pathogens remain on {{stainless steel}} S30400.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source to be focused on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to be focused on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, <b>epifluorescence,</b> and confocal microscopy.|$|E

5000|$|Macro-scale {{biological}} processes, such as {{the spread}} of virus infections, can be followed using GFP labeling. [...] In the past, mutagenic ultra violet light (UV) {{has been used to}} illuminate living organisms (e.g., see) to detect and photograph the GFP expression. Recently, a technique using non-mutagenic LED lights have been developed for macro-photography. [...] The technique uses an <b>epifluorescence</b> camera attachment based on the same principle used in the construction of <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopes.|$|E
50|$|In <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopy, the {{objective}} lens acts {{not only as}} a magnifier for the light emitted by the fluorescing object, but also as a condenser for the incident light.|$|E

50|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} requires intense, near-monochromatic, illumination {{which some}} widespread light sources, like halogen lamps cannot provide. Four main types of light source are used, including xenon arc lamps or mercury-vapor lamps with an excitation filter, lasers, supercontinuum sources, and high-power LEDs. Lasers are {{most widely used}} for more complex fluorescence microscopy techniques like confocal microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy while xenon lamps, and mercury lamps, and LEDs with a dichroic excitation filter are commonly used for widefield <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopes. By placing two microlens arrays into the illumination path of a widefield <b>epifluorescence</b> microscope , highly uniform illumination with a coefficient of variation of 1-2% can be achieved.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of fluorescence microscopes, especially {{those used in}} the life sciences, are of the <b>epifluorescence</b> design shown in the diagram. Light of the excitation wavelength {{is focused on the}} specimen through the objective lens. The fluorescence emitted by the specimen is focused to the detector by the same objective that is used for the excitation which for greater resolution will need objective lens with higher numerical aperture. Since most of the excitation light is transmitted through the specimen, only reflected excitatory light reaches the objective together with the emitted light and the <b>epifluorescence</b> method therefore gives a high signal-to-noise ratio. The dichroic beamsplitter acts as a wavelength specific filter, transmitting fluoresced light through to the eyepiece or detector, but reflecting any remaining excitation light back towards the source.|$|E
50|$|Most {{fluorescence}} microscopes in use are <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopes, where excitation of the fluorophore and {{detection of}} the fluorescence are done {{through the same}} light path (i.e. through the objective). These microscopes are widely used in biology and are the basis for more advanced microscope designs, such as the confocal microscope and the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF).|$|E

The industry-standard Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) system provides for a comprehensive quality management framework as a part of which such tests can be conducted. Testing methods applied include phage and serological typing, direct <b>epifluorescence</b> filter techniques (DEFT) and plasmid profiling.|$|E
50|$|Microscopic {{demonstration}} of the large typically shaped oocysts {{is the basis for}} diagnosis. Because the oocysts may be passed in small amounts and intermittently, repeated stool examinations and concentration procedures are recommended. If stool examinations are negative, examination of duodenal specimens by biopsy or string test (Enterotest) may be needed. The oocysts can be visualized on wet mounts by microscopy with bright-field, differential interference contrast (DIC), and <b>epifluorescence.</b> They can also be stained by modified acid-fast stain.|$|E
5000|$|A {{silicon wafer}} is {{typically}} {{used as the}} reflective surface in a FLIC experiment. An oxide layer is then thermally grown {{on top of the}} silicon wafer to act as a spacer. On top of the oxide is placed the fluorescently labeled specimen, such as a lipid membrane, a cell or membrane bound proteins. With the sample system built, all that is needed is an <b>epifluorescence</b> microscope and a CCD camera to make quantitative intensity measurements.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fluorescence}} microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence and phosphorescence instead of, or in addition to, reflection and absorption to study properties of organic or inorganic substances. The [...] "{{fluorescence microscope}}" [...] refers to any microscope that uses fluorescence to generate an image, {{whether it is}} a more simple set up like an <b>epifluorescence</b> microscope, or a more complicated design such as a confocal microscope, which uses optical sectioning to get better resolution of the fluorescent image.|$|E
50|$|Acridine orange {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} and used in many different areas, such as <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopy, the assessment of sperm chromatin quality. Acridine orange stain is particularly useful in the rapid screening of normally sterile specimens, and its recommended {{for the use of}} fluorescent microscopic detection of microorganisms in direct smears prepared from clinical and non-clinical materials. The staining has to be performed at an acid pH in order to obtain this differential staining effect with bacteria showing orange stain and tissue components yellow to green.|$|E
50|$|Marine bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} live as obligate {{parasitic}} agents in marine bacteria such as cyanobacteria.

5000|$|In the 1970s, the {{alternative}} technique of direct microscopic counting {{was developed by}} Francisco et al. (1973) and Hobbie et al. (1977). Bacterial cells were counted with an <b>epifluorescence</b> microscope, producing what is called an [...] "acridine orange direct count" [...] (AODC). This led to a reassessment of the large concentration of bacteria in seawater, which {{was found to be}} more than was expected (typically on the order of 1 million per milliliter). Also, development of the [...] "bacterial productivity assay" [...] showed that a large fraction (i.e. 50%) of net primary production (NPP) was processed by marine bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Acridine orange is {{an organic}} compound. It {{is used as}} a nucleic acid-selective {{fluorescent}} cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. Being cell-permeable, it interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions respectively. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein, with an excitation maximum at 502 nm and an emission maximum at 525 nm (green). When it associates with RNA, the excitation maximum shifts to 460 nm (blue) and the emission maximum shifts to 650 nm (red). Acridine orange will also enter acidic compartments such as lysosomes and become protonated and sequestered. In these low pH conditions, the dye will emit orange light when excited by blue light. Thus, acridine orange can be used to identify engulfed apoptotic cells, because it will fluoresce upon engulfment. The dye is often used in <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopy.|$|E
50|$|Polony {{sequencing}} is {{an inexpensive}} but highly accurate multiplex sequencing technique {{that can be}} used to “read” millions of immobilized DNA sequences in parallel. This technique was first developed by Dr. George Church's group at Harvard Medical School. Unlike other sequencing techniques, Polony sequencing technology is an open platform with freely downloadable, open source software and protocols. Also, the hardware of this technique can be easily set up with a commonly available <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopy and a computer-controlled flowcell/fluidics system. Polony sequencing is generally performed on paired-end tags library that each molecule of DNA template is of 135 bp in length with two 17-18 bp paired genomic tags separated and flanked by common sequences. The current read length of this technique is 26 bases per amplicon and 13 bases per tag, leaving a gap of 4-5 bases in each tag.|$|E
50|$|Light sheet {{fluorescence}} microscopy (LSFM) is a {{fluorescence microscopy}} technique with an intermediate optical resolution, but good optical sectioning capabilities and high speed. In contrast to <b>epifluorescence</b> microscopy only a thin slice (usually {{a few hundred}} nanometers to a few micrometers) of the sample is illuminated perpendicularly to the direction of observation. For illumination, a laser light-sheet is used, i.e. a laser beam which is focused only in one direction (e.g. using a cylindrical lens). A second method uses a circular beam scanned in one direction to create the lightsheet. As only the actually observed section is illuminated, this method reduces the photodamage and stress induced on a living sample. Also the good optical sectioning capability reduces the background signal and thus creates images with higher contrast, comparable to confocal microscopy. Because LSFM scans samples by using a plane of light instead of a point (as in confocal microscopy), it can acquire images at speeds 100 to 1000 times faster than those offered by point-scanning methods.|$|E

50|$|More recently, the {{technique}} {{has been used}} to study exocytosis in chromaffin cells. When imaged using DIC, chromaffin cells appear as round cells with small protrusions. When the same cell is imaged using IRM, the footprint of the cell on the glass can be clearly seen as a dark area with small protrusions (see Figure 2 in the gallery below). When vesicles fuse with the membrane, they appear as small light circles within the dark footprint (Figure 2, bright spots in the top cell in the right panel). An example of vesicle fusion in chromaffin cells using IRM is shown in movie 1. Upon stimulation with 60 mM potassium, multiple bright spots begin to appear inside the dark footprint of the chromaffin cell as a result of exocytosis of dense core granules. Because IRM doesn't require a fluorescent label, it can be combined with other imaging techniques, such as <b>epifluorescence</b> and TIRF microscopy to study protein dynamics together with vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Another benefit of the lack of fluorescent labels is reduced phototoxicity.|$|E
5000|$|Immunofluorescence {{can be used}} on tissue sections, cultured cell lines, or {{individual}} cells, and may be used to analyze the distribution of proteins, glycans, and small biological and non-biological molecules. This technique can even be used to visualize structures such as intermediate-sized filaments. If the topology of a cell membrane has yet to be determined, epitope insertion into proteins can be used in conjunction with immunofluorescence to determine structures. Immunofluorescence can also be used as a [...] "semi-quantitative" [...] method to gain insight into the levels and localization patterns of DNA methylation since it is a more time consuming method than true quantitative methods and there is some subjectivity in the analysis of the levels of methylation. Immunofluorescence can be used in combination with other, non-antibody methods of fluorescent staining, for example, use of DAPI to label DNA. Several microscope designs can be used for analysis of immunofluorescence samples; the simplest is the <b>epifluorescence</b> microscope, and the confocal microscope is also widely used. Various super-resolution microscope designs that are capable of much higher resolution can also be used.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{regions of}} {{interest}} are observed by hybridising them with probes labelled by haptens like biotin; this {{can then be}} bound {{by one or more}} layers of fluorochrome-associated ligands (such as immunofluorescence antibodies). Multicolour tagging is also possible. This has several potential uses, typically as a high-resolution physical mapping technique (e.g. for positional cloning), an example of which was the correct mapping of 200 kb of the CAPN3 gene region, or the mapping of non-overlapping sequences (since the distance between two probes can be accurately measured). It is therefore useful for finding exons, microdeletions, amplifications, or rearrangements. Before the combing improvement, FISH was too low-res to be of use in this case. With this technique, the resolution of FISH is theoretically limited only by the resolution of the <b>epifluorescence</b> microscope; in practice, resolutions of around 2 µm are obtained, for DNA molecules usually 200-600 kb long (though combing-FISH has been used with some success on molecules in excess of 1 Mb long), and there may be room for improvement through optimisation. Since DNA analyses using this technique are single-molecule, genomes from different cells can be compared to find anomalies, with implications for diagnosis of cancer and other genetic alterations.|$|E
