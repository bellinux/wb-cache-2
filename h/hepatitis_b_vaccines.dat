40|$|Background. The {{duration}} of protection {{in children and}} adults (including health care workers) resulting from the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccine</b> primary series is unknown. Methods. To determine the protection afforded by <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccine,</b> Alaska Native persons who had received plasma-derived <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccine</b> when they were 16 months of age were tested for antibody to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> surface antigen (anti-HBs) 22 years later. Those with levels! 10 mIU/mL received 1 dose of recombinant <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccine</b> and were evaluated {{on the basis of}} anti-HBs measurements at 10 – 14 days, 30 – 60 days, and 1 year. Results. Of 493 participants, 60 % (298) had an anti-HBs level 10 mIU/mL. A booster dose was administered to 164 persons, and 77 % responded with an anti-HBs level 10 mIU/mL at 10 – 14 days, reaching 81 % by 60 days. Response to a booster dose was positively correlated with younger age, peak anti-HBs response after primary vaccination, and the presence of detectable anti-HBs before boosting. Considering persons with an anti-HBs level 10 mIU/mL at 22 years and those who responded to the booster dose, protection was demonstrated in 87 % of the participants. No new acute or chronic <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus infections were identified. Conclusions.

5000|$|Several major {{scientific}} discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university {{is probably best}} known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering. It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language. Penn can also boast {{some of the most important}} discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med; the Rubella and <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccines</b> were developed at Penn; the discovery of cancer's link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia), and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers. More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet, and limbs. Conductive polymer was also developed at Penn by Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa, an invention that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Ralph L. Brinster, on faculty since 1965, developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper). The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets's method of measuring Gross National Product, the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones), and the [...] "Wharton Model" [...] developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then President Nixon's health reform in the 1970s.|$|E

By the end of 2001, 142 countries were using hepatitis B vaccine in routine immunization schedules. The actual price of the vaccine has been a major deterrent to its introduction in many countries and has limited further use of the vaccine. The use of hepatitis B vaccine has resulted in dramatic reductions in the prevalence of the carrier state in many areas with a reduction in the carrier rate to less than 1 % from levels of 15 - 20 % (Kane, 1998; Kane, 1997).

Forty four group A infants with birthweights of <  2000  g received three doses at 1,  2, and 7  months of age. Forty one group B infants with birthweights of ⩾ 2000 g received three doses at 0,  1, and 6  months of age.  RESULTS—After vaccination, 42  infants from group A (95 %) and 37  infants from group B (90 %) developed protective levels of antibody.

40|$|The notable {{increase}} in the quantity of economic evaluations in the last 2 decades has not been matched by good methodological standards. This problem is particularly evident {{in the field of}} economic evaluations of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The results of 2 systematic reviews conducted by us in 1993 and 1996 showed three problem areas. A sizeable minority of study reports failed to provide a clear study aim, showing a basic ignorance of the first rule of conducting scientific research. The basic epidemiological assumptions upon which the economic models were based showed variability which persisted even after stratification, raising the question of the accuracy of the epidemiological knowledge base of hepatitis B infection and its progression. Lastly, many of the studies showed weaknesses in basic methods of conducting and reporting economic evaluations.

Most of the {{presently}} available vaccines including <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccines</b> administered through parenteral route, fail {{to induce}} a mucosal antibody response. Therefore, oral immunization {{appears to be}} an effective and attractive alternative to parenteral immunization. However, the problem of degradation of antigen in the harsh and hostile environment of the gastrointestinal tract consequently requires larger doses and more frequent dosing of antigen. Furthermore, much larger doses can induce antigen tolerance.
