40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{dynamic analysis}} of a <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> <b>press</b> by using CAE tool. The {{purpose of this study}} is to make it easy for engineers to predict the dynamics of the knucklejoint press. These predictions are essential for the optimal design of its mechanical system. At firs, we developed a computer aided design system for the analysis introducing dynamic simulation software named Working Model. In this system, Working Model is linked to other applications such as CAD and Excel in order to make it easy to draw a diagram of the analytical model and to analyze data generated by simulations. Then we performed the experiments of the knucklejoint press, and compared the experimental results with the simulation results to verify　that this simulation results show accurately the dynamic characteristics of the actual machine. Finally we investigated the fluctuation in rotating speed and the effect of flywheel...|$|E
40|$|The article {{raises an}} issue to enhance {{technological}} forging capabilities on the known <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> <b>presses.</b> It provides an illustrated overview of main design types of presses with crank-knuckle, toggle-knuckle, and <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> mechanisms. The article also shows {{the advantages of}} the modernization way and improvement just of the active press equipment in terms of quality-to-price ratio, for example, as compared to the similar new foreign press equipment. It gives an overview of features, which provide forging processes owing to kinetic energy accumulated with the moving parts of the known designs of the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> <b>presses</b> depending on the drive actuating mechanism. Focused attention is drawn to forging on the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> <b>presses</b> for a time of contact with a work piece to be comparable with the duration of the work piece deformation process on hydraulic forging hammers. This allows us to forge thin-wall products with process automation compared to the forging hammers. Analysis of accumulating processes of kinetic energy by the moving parts of the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> <b>presses</b> has shown that presses driven by hydraulic cylinders or two screw hydraulic cylinder are the most optimal for technological operations as evidenced by references to domestic and foreign invention certificates and patents. The article presents disadvantages of forging on presses with hydraulic or pneumatic drive. It is a dependence of the deformation force, caused, mainly, by a force of the drive cylinder. The article gives linear movement rate quantities of press moving members depending on the drives of the actuating mechanism. Based on the above analysis of the features to manufacture work pieces on the <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> <b>presses,</b> the article gives the rationale for the relevance of forging {{in a short period of}} time, provided that the moving parts of the press accumulate the required kinetic energy. This can be achieved only through modernization and improvement of forging equipment designs, in particular, using modern industrial hydraulics facilities, software and hardware systems for industrial automation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{technology}} in recent decades {{has led to the}} reduction of cost and weight of materials. The modified system has become popular in industry as well as in research. As a result, this there are reduction in accident and safety has increased. Many systems used in industries use <b>knuckle</b> <b>joint</b> which is combination of two materials: cast iron and stainless steel. Here we are proposing the modification of one of the material that is changing cast iron into a composite polymer material. The proposed system has many advantages over other system such as making the device, simpler and having maximum safety and is ecofriendly. The analysis of the system proves all the above features mention above. The reason for considering polymer is that property of polymer is mostly similar to the property of metal. Composite polymers are characterized by a high flexibility material. The revolutionary evolution in technologies in last year allowed reducing stress and strain.
