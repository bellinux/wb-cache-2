40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines whether <b>ethical</b> investment <b>funds</b> {{are good}} investments {{in comparison with}} other stock market investments for individual investors. Firstly, the financial performance of <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> was analysed using traditional risk adjusted performance measures. Performance was first compared with market benchmarks and then in comparison with other funds using a 'matched pair' approach (Luther, Matatko and Corner 1992; Mallin, Saadouni and Briston, 1995; Gregory, Matatko and Luther, 1997). This analysis indicated that the financial performance of <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> was {{not significantly different from}} market benchmarks and other funds. It was therefore concluded that <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> were good investments financially. A second empirical study used field research to examine the policies and processes of <b>ethical</b> <b>funds.</b> Two complementary strategies for dealing with ethical issues were identified; screening and engagement. Screening involves the use of exclusionary and/or positive ethical criteria in the stock selection process. This study indicated that <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> had a number of processes in place to address ethical issues. These processes included ethical screening; ethical advisory committees; specialist ethical researchers and use of other organisations. In terms of the policies and processes employed by <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> they were "good" investments compared to other funds. This confirms previous findings that <b>ethical</b> <b>funds,</b> although not a "panacea" were an improvement over other funds and that some <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> engaged with firms on ethical issues (Cowton, 1999; Mills, 2000; Friedman and Miles, 2001). Finally, ethical history and Church perspectives are employed in a tentative analysis of whether <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> are good investments ethically (Mackenzie, 1997). This preliminary analysis made it clear that some <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> would not be good investments in a moral sense for certain investors...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in <b>ethical</b> mutual <b>funds</b> {{has experienced a}} strong upsurge in Sweden over the last years, and the market for <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> has grown to include a total of 59 funds. However, the amount actually invested in <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> falls short of the expectations; only 1. 5 {{percent of the total}} assets invested in mutual funds are placed in <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> while some 60 percent of the Swedish people claim that they consider ethics an important issue when choosing which funds to invest in. People seem to be uncertain whether it is possible to combine an optimal rate of return with ethical considerations or not, and this uncertainty could be one reason why people are deterred from investing in <b>ethical</b> <b>funds.</b> The objective of the thesis is therefore to analyse if the performance of Swedish <b>ethical</b> mutual <b>funds</b> differs from the average return of the market, thereby making it easier for savers to make an investment decision based upon valid information rather than preconceived ideas. Out of the total 59 Swedish <b>ethical</b> mutual <b>funds</b> nine funds were selected, which all apply a strict type of ethical screening that corresponds well to the general view of ethics among the Swedish people.

The analysis of the portfolio composition shows that there are small differences in the structure of portfolios concerning industry composition and company size. However, the <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> tend to hold more stocks in their portfolios than non-ethical ones. The results provide some evidence on the underperformance of ethical funds; this underperformance is stronger in years of poor stock market performance, which indicates that systematic risk of <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> may be higher. ethical, social responsible investment, SRI, investment, funds, portfolio, returns, risk, screening, Sweden...|$|R

40|$|Background and problem: There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in social and ethical investments and this increase can be due to many reasons such as growth of investors’ concern, growth of corporate social responsibility and growing evidence that ethical funds produce good returns as reasons to the increase of ethical investments (Schwartz, 2003). Through research of the literature we find that what qualifies as an <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> is not clear. This makes it difficult for the customer to understand on what grounds the companies are excluded or included in the fund. That is, if almost all companies fall under the requirements of the <b>ethical</b> <b>fund,</b> then there is basically no difference between an <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> and a Swedish main stream average fund (non-ethical fund). Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the ethical funds’ processes from the targeted banks, what the requirements for the companies to be included in an <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> are, if the banks’ differentiate from each other and which companies are not suitable to be included in an <b>ethical</b> <b>fund.</b> Delimitation: The thesis is delimited to only include Swedish ethical funds provided by Swedish banks. Method: The method used to investigate ethical funds, the exclusion of companies and the comparison of the banks was through semi structured interviews with representatives from the targeted banks and their ethical advisors. The interviews were performed through e-mail with the banks, personal interview with two of the ethical advisors and telephone interview with Swedbank Robur. The five banks included in the study are Danske Bank, Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and Swedbank. The ethical advisors are Ethix, GES Investment Services and Swedbank Robur Internal Screening Department. Results and conclusions: The authors found that the targeted banks consult their ethical advisors or, in Swedbank Robur’s case, have their own internal process regarding the process. The process can for all banks be applied to four steps; objective, screening criteria, data collection and evaluation (Reich, Wolff, Zaring, Zetterberg & Åhman, 2001). It was also concluded that there is no significant difference between an <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> and a non-ethical fund since only a few companies were excluded from the funds’ ethical screens, with the exception of Robur Ethica Sverige Mega that excluded half of the companies at the Swedish Stock Exchange...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its starting-point the {{traditional}} Treynor and Mazuy timing model and its conditional version and adapts them {{so as to}} be able to distinguish between the stock picking and market timing abilities of ethical and conventional fund managers. Seven European countries are analysed and similar results are found for each country. In general, perverse stock picking and market timing abilities are observed for conventional fund managers. With regard to <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> managers, we find perverse market timing ability when the ethical benchmark underperforms the conventional one and successful market timing ability when the opposite occurs. Furthermore in some cases a positive stock picking ability is found for ethical funds. The more restrictive the definition of the term <b>ethical</b> <b>fund,</b> the greater the cost of diversification for ethical managers. Moreover for best-in-class funds a negative stock picking ability is registered, and the market timing ability improves when the ethical Market outperforms the conventional one and worsens when the opposite occurs...|$|E

We propose a new ES measure for common stocks, by comparing the value held by <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> and the value held by equity funds for that stock. Then, we calculate the funds' ES by aggregating the ES of funds' holding common stocks. We find a strong heterogeneity for <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> in terms of ethical strength, with only one fifth of them being actually worth this label. These funds distinguish from others by much stronger ethical strength, higher total assets and mostly small caps stocks. Consistent with the hypothesis that ethical investment is costly for firms, we find a highly significant, negative relation between performance and ES for equity funds. This relation is robust to traditional performance determinants, such as funds' size, turnover rate, expenses, or portfolio concentration. For <b>ethical</b> <b>funds,</b> this relation is similar, except for the funds exhibiting the stronger ethical strength...|$|R

The evaluation of <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> performance has been achieving a lot of academic interests. This study employed a time series data to examine the influence of market status and fund characteristics {{on the performance of}} ethical funds. Three mutual fund performance measurements are utilized in this study, which are 1 -factor model from Sharp (1964) and Lintner (1965), 3 -factor model from Fama and French's (1993), and 4 -factor model from Carhart (1997). Mature, growing, and initial market statuses and fund characteristics which are fund size, age, expense ratio and social performance, are analysed and testes whether they have influences on the performance of ethical funds. This study obtains some findings. Market status has a significant influence on <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> performance.

Only a minority (SR: 13.6  % and INT: 12.1  %) believe that an <b>ethical</b> <b>fund</b> should dedicate considerable resources or all of its resources to influence companies and therefore should accept much lower returns.

40|$|Background: Ethical {{investing}} {{is growing}} in importance due to investors’ concern with environmental and social issues. However, there is difference of opinion regarding {{the extent to which}} the limited investment universe affects the financial return of ethical investments. Recent empirical findings suggest that while there is no statistically significant difference in the returns of <b>ethical</b> and conventional <b>funds,</b> <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> tend to be less risky due to having better managed firms in the portfolio. More nuanced conclusions are drawn by Nofsinger and Varma (2014) who provide evidence that US <b>ethical</b> mutual <b>funds</b> outperform conventional funds in times of crisis at the cost of underperformance in non-crisis times, indicating that <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> are “safer” investments. Purpose: This thesis builds on the latter findings, focusing on the European market instead. Its purpose is to examine whether European <b>ethical</b> mutual <b>funds</b> are safer than European conventional mutual funds in times of crisis and non-crisis. An analysis of the ethical funds’ screening-styles, returns and risk factor loadings will be performed to explain their volatility relative to conventional funds. The empirical investigation is based on a matched pair analysis of 33 European <b>ethical</b> mutual <b>funds</b> and 33 European conventional mutual funds with a European investment universe between 01 - 2005 and 01 - 2015. Method: Volatility in the funds’ returns is estimated econometrically by means of three types of GARCH models (GARCH, TGARCH and EGARCH). To explain volatility differences, we moreover calculate the funds’ risk factor loadings from a five factor model. In addition, we test to what degree the variance in the ethical funds’ returns is influenced by screening techniques, and whether there are any significant differences regarding the techniques being applied. Conclusion: Basedonthevariance,weobservethatethicalfundshavealowermeanreversionfroma shock and greater exposure in the volatility to certain market news. We moreover show that they are less exposed to systematic market risk and small firms. During the crisis we find that <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> react more to certain market news but less exposed to the systematic market risk. The empirical results also suggest an overperformance of <b>ethical</b> <b>funds</b> in times of crisis at the expense of underperformance in times of non-crisis, indicating support for Nofsinger and Varma’s (2014) conclusion.
