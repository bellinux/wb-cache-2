40|$|A {{new concept}} of space {{radiator}} of variable emittance for satellite thermal control is presented. The radiator {{is composed of}} two stages which exchange <b>heat</b> through <b>radiation</b> between <b>finned</b> surfaces covered with variable emittance coatings, whose emissivity is increased with temperature. Under cold conditions the radiative heat coupling between the stages is minimal, preventing the equipment subcooling, while in hot conditions the heat exchange is increased. A steady-state mathematical model was developed and numerically coupled to an optimization algorithm, and a design optimization procedure was performed. Two optimization criteria were employed: minimization of the radiator mass and the power consumption of heater under cold conditions. The Generalized Extremal Optimization algorithm {{was used as the}} optimization tool. The design was then modeled in detail using the SINDA/Fluint package considering orbital conditions of the EQUARS satellite. The performance of the radiator concept proposed here was also compared to a conventional design, for the same operational conditions. It is envisioned that the utilization of such radiators in micro-satellites will lead to considerable electric power savings for safe heaters and may contribute to a longer satellite life. In the design trade-off, the cost for this saving is additional radiator mass and volume...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the design implications for spacecraft radiators {{made possible by}} the successful fabrication and Proof-of-concept testing of a graphite-fiber-carbon-matrix composite (i. e., carbon-carbon (C-C)) heat pipe. The proto-type heat pipe, or space radiator element, consists of a C-C composite shell with integrally woven fins. It has a thin-walled furnace-brazed metallic (Nb- 1 %Zr) liner with end caps for containment of the potassium working fluid. A short extension of this liner, at increased wall thickness beyond the C-C shell, forms the heat pipe evaporator section which is in thermal contact with the radiator fluid that needs to be cooled. From geometric and thermal transport properties of the C-C composite heat pipe tested, a specific radiator mass of 1. 45 kg/m 2 can be derived. This is less than one-fourth the specific mass of present day satellite radiators. The report also {{discusses the}} advantage of segmented space radiator designs utilizing heat pipe elements, or segments, in their survivability to micro-meteoroid damage. This survivability is further raised by the use of condenser sections with attached fins, which also improve the <b>radiation</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rate. Since the problem of <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> from a <b>fin</b> does not lend itself to a closed analytical solution, a derivation of the governing differential equation and boundary conditions is given in appendix A, along with solutions for rectangular and parabolic fin profile geometries obtained by use of a finite difference computer code written by the author...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Heat {{radiation}} equation contains 4 th exponential {{order of}} temperature which makes mathematics analysis very complicated and troublesome. Therefore, most heat transfer experts and scholars believe, {{based on their}} own experiences, that the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> effect can be ignored due to small temperature difference between insulated surfaces and surrounding to simplify analysis. Due to this reason, insulation examples shown in most heat transfer, air conditioning and refrigeration text books, and some commercial packages for the design of insulations, commonly ignore the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>radiation.</b> However, this paper demonstrates that the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> effect can not be ignored in the situations of thin insulation with low ambient convective heat coefficient and a large surface emissivity. In those situations, ignoring the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> will result in an inaccurate insulation design. The paper also shows that a smaller insulated surface emissivity can largely promote the insulation effect.

It is shown that the magnetic field produces a totally reflecting layer. Consequently, the atmosphere can be divided into two distinct regions. In the lower region, the solution can be written as a linear combination of an upward and a downward propagating wave, and in the upper region the solution, which satisfies the upper boundary condition, decays exponentially or behaves like a constant. These two regions are connected by a region in which the reflection and transmission of the waves takes place. Moreover, the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> affects only the lower region and changes the sound speed from the adiabatic value to the isothermal one. The reflection coefficient and the attenuation factor of the amplitude of the waves are derived for all values of the <b>heat</b> <b>radiation</b> coefficient.

Regarding near- and far-field transfer through a gas like air, we show that a microscopic model (based on gas particles) and a macroscopic model (using a dielectric contrast) yield identical results. We also compare the radiative transfer through a medium like air and the energy transfer found from kinetic gas theory. Comment: 21 pages, 17 figure...|$|R
