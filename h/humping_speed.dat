40|$|Abstract: Although {{there are}} no {{legislations}} governing the installation of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in Taiwan, their existence is of need in certain road sections, in particular, traffic calm areas. This study compares the effectiveness of single and tandem <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in <b>speed</b> reduction. Data collected include {{the distance from the}} <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> where drivers brake to reduce speed, which would shed light on the effective area of <b>speed</b> <b>humps.</b> Difference in <b>speed</b> reduced by single and tandem <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> are also determined by the before-after study to compare the effectiveness of these two types of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in <b>speed</b> reduction. The results reveal that <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> are effective in reducing speed and that tandem <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> are more effective than single <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in <b>speed</b> reduction. The findings in this study can be useful references for traffic engineering and can serve as guidelines for deciding which type of humps to be installed on certain road sections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Speed</b> <b>humps</b> {{have become}} a common traffic calming {{technique}} to reduce vehicle speeds in residential neighborhoods. There {{is a need to}} develop standard <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> warning signs as well as to determine <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings that take into account both motorist comprehension and community preference. This study had two major goals. The first was to examine preference for various configurations for signs that are placed next to a <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> as well as for lead signs when approaching a series of <b>speed</b> <b>humps.</b> The second was to examine which type of <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings people prefer. There were 103 research participants in this study. In the first task, participants developed <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> signs that included <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> symbols, <b>speed</b> advisory messages, and location indication messages. In the second task, participants compared ten different <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> markings and determined which markings they: (1) liked the most, (2) thought made it easiest to actually detect a hump, (3) thought made it most difficult to do so, and (4) thought best indicated a raised pedestrian crosswalk. The paper discusses the various <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> sign configurations and roadway markings that participants preferred or thought would most effectively warn drivers. The results of this study will be used in future research to objectively evaluate comprehension, conspicuity, and driver behavior for different <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> sign and marking designs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many jurisdictions {{are faced}} with {{increased}} traffic speeds and volumes on residential streets. In an attempt to mitigate these unwanted traffic characteristics many jurisdictions have implemented traffic calming programs. The most commonly used traffic calming devices to reduce vehicle <b>speeds</b> are <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables. These devices {{have been shown to}} be effective in large urbanized areas but little information is available on their impact in smaller rural cities. This study examined the impact of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables on vehicle speed profiles, mean vehicle speed, 85 th percentile vehicle speed, and the frequency of speeders in the City of Atlantic (population of approximately 7, 400). Temporary <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables were installed on two residential streets, Roosevelt Drive and Redwood Drive, in Atlantic. Speed data was collected during four periods: “before”, while the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> was in place, while the speed table was in place, and “after”. Speed data were collected and evaluated upstream of the devices, at the devices, and downstream of the devices. It was concluded that the <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> and <b>speed</b> tables effectively reduced mean vehicle speed and 85 th percentile vehicle speed at the location of the devices and downstream of the devices but not upstream of the devices. An evaluation of 85 th percentile speed indicated that these devices are as effective in small rural cities as they are in more urbanized areas...|$|R
40|$|California {{has adopted}} a Complete Streets policy, which {{requires}} local municipalities to design roadways that {{meet the needs of}} all users (pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists). This policy, combined with complaints about motorists speeding in residential areas, has been a catalyst for jurisdictions to install traffic calming measures on residential streets. One popular traffic calming measure used in the City of Redwood City is the installation of <b>speed</b> <b>humps.</b> A <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> is a raised pavement surface that provides a physical reminder for motorists to slow down while traveling over it. Although literature shows that the installation of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> can decrease vehicular speeds on residential roads, the impact <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> have on adjacent streets has not been fully researched. This project has evaluated the effectiveness of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> at reducing vehicular speeds, volumes, and motorist accidents. The term “appropriate area”, as used in this research, is defined as the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> installation area which is determined by the City Engineer. The research has addressed impacts on two types of streets: streets with <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> installed and streets adjacent to their installation. The following research questions have been addressed: If installed in an appropriate residential area, can <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> reduce vehicular <b>speeds</b> and volumes? How are vehicular volumes on adjacent streets impacted? If installed in an appropriate area, can <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> reduce the occurrence of motorist collisions? How is the occurrence of motorist collisions impacted on adjacent streets? After the installation, do residents on adjacent streets feel safer in their neighborhood...|$|R

40|$|Traffic calming {{is defined}} as a device that will reduce the speed of the vehicle at a certain places.

40|$|Flume {{measurements}} of a one-dimensional sliding hump starting from rest in quiescence fresh water indicate {{that when the}} <b>hump</b> travels at <b>speed</b> less than the shallow-water wave celerity, three waves emerge, travelling in two directions. One wave travels {{in the opposite direction}} to the sliding hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (backward free wave). Another wave travels approximately in step with the hump (forced wave), and the remaining wave travels {{in the direction of the}} hump at approximately the shallow-water wave celerity (forward free wave). These experiments were completed for a range of sliding <b>hump</b> <b>speed</b> relative to the shallow-water wave celerity, up to unity of this ratio, to investigate possible derivation from solutions of the Euler equation with non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms being included or excluded. For the experimental arrangements tested, the forced waves were negative (depression or reduced water surface elevation) waves while the free waves were positive (bulges or increased water surface elevation). For experiments where the sliding hump travelled at less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity did not include transient behaviour measurements (i. e. when the three waves still overlapped). The three wave framework was partially supported by these measurements in that the separated forward and forced waves were compared to measurements. For the laboratory scale experiments, the forward free wave height was predicted reasonably by the long-wave equation (ignoring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms) when the sliding <b>hump</b> <b>speed</b> was less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity. The forced wave depression magnitude required the Euler equations for all <b>hump</b> <b>speed</b> tested. The long-wave solution, while being valid in a limited parameter range, does predict the existence of the three waves as found in these experiments (forward travelling waves measured quantitatively while the backward travelling waves visually by video). Nevertheless, the forced wave transient development required non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms for higher sliding <b>hump</b> <b>speeds.</b> The forward free wave, controversially, does not need non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms until much higher <b>hump</b> <b>speeds,</b> suggesting that the forward free wave falls in the parameter space where long-wave equations apply whereas the forced wave more often falls into the parameter space requiring non-linear and non-hydrostatic terms. It does raise the question of why the forced wave transient dynamics does not impact on the initial transient dynamics where the forward free wave is in the long-wave theory, escaping the forced wave (at least for speeds less than 80 % of the shallow-water wave celerity) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} few years, the topics {{concerning}} vehicular communications have been in conducting researches. One research topic is to acquire important information (e. g., traffic conditions, weather conditions) necessary to disseminate to car drivers. Road profile information is very important information that the drivers who know this in advance can use to avoid accidents. <b>Speed</b> <b>hump</b> on a road, {{which is one of}} the road profile information, can cause an accident especially at night if a driver has never passed through the road before. This paper proposes a technique to estimate <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> profile using quarter car model. In this technique, two acceleration sensors are needed to install at sprung mass and unsprung mass of a car. The signals of the two sensors are then passed through the estimation model to get the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> profile in time unit (i. e., height versus time). To obtain the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> profile in space unit (i. e., height versus distance), the information of car velocities while passing the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> is required.

40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>humps</b> are {{the most}} common type of traffic calming devices due to their low cost and easy installation. However, in many Egyptian roads, {{considerable}} number of these humps is randomly placed without proper engineering studies and justifications. Deterioration of pavement condition is observed near these humps. This paper presents a case study applied to collect and analyze visual inspection data for the reason of evaluating the impact of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> on pavement condition on intercity rural roads. The paper used 52 <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> located in an intercity two-lane, two-way road that connects two cities, Tahta and Gerga, in Upper Egypt. The total length of this road is about 34  km. Pavement condition index (PCI), in road sections, near <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in the two directions of travel were calculated from the visual inspection measurements. The characteristics of each <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> (width, height, and distance from preceding hump) were measured. Using statistical analyses, the correlations between the pavement conditions and hump characteristics were examined.

40|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>hump</b> or {{also known}} as road hump is {{designed}} to ensure safety for both drivers and pedestrian. The use of <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> in residential streets is an efficient way of controlling speed ofvehicles. However, in Malaysia some ofthe dimensions designed by the local authorities had been implemented on an 'ad hoc' basis without any proper standards or guidelines (HPU, 2002). Although Highway Planning Unit (HPU) and Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) have stipulated specific ranges of dimensions for the installation of <b>speed</b> <b>humps,</b> however no perfect and ideal guidelines were introduced and were not properly enforced by the local authorities. Therefore, with many styles and inconsistent designs of the <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> a well-established empirical study has been implemented to develop optimal designs consistency models. In this study, the geometric design of the <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> was related to 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level. The speed data were carried out by using a laser gun meter detector to obtain the spot speed data at the selected <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> location and vibration data collection were carried out using triaxial acceleration transducers connected to Racelogic VBOX II SX. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to develop a statistical relationship between <b>speed</b> <b>hump</b> geometric, 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level.

The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare <b>speed</b> <b>humps</b> with two newer traffic calming devices that are gaining popularity in the US, the speed slot and speed cushion. Crossing speed and driver behavior were measured at selected traffic calming devices on roadways in the Washington DC metropolitan during the summer of 2003. The subject devices include: • 12 -ft and 22 -ft asphalt speed humps; • 14 -ft prefabricated speed humps; • 22 -ft speed slots; and • 10 -ft speed cushions.

All the collected data were analyzed trough statistical tests in order to assess their homogeneity or not between different locations and various types of roads. Finally, we were able of making some conclusions and highlighting design aspects. On one side, RCWs with similar geometries and higher heights (about 15 cm) have similar effects on vehicle speeds lowering, regardless of local conditions (location, road geometry, driver behaviour, etc.). Moreover, raised crosswalks installed in a series have strong efficacy than the isolated ones.
