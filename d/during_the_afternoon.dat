5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Rick is the third-most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} on record. Developing {{south of}} Mexico on October15, 2009, Hurricane Rick traversed an area favoring rapid intensification, {{allowing it to}} become a hurricane within 24 hours of being declared a tropical depression. An eye began to form <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of October16; once fully formed, the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of October17, the storm attained Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Several hours later, Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record with winds of 180mph (285km/h) and a barometric pressure of 906mbar (hPa; 26.75inHg).|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was caused}} by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved into the Southern Plains states on April 25. An extratropical cyclone developed ahead of this upper-level trough between northeastern Oklahoma and western Missouri, which moved northeast. Conditions were similar on April 26, with a predicted likelihood of severe thunderstorms, including an extended threat of strong to violent long-track tornadoes <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> and evening hours; mixed-layer CAPE values were forecast to be around 3000–4000 J/kg, around east Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The storm mode on April 26 was predicted to consist of mostly discrete supercells <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> and early evening, shifting over to a mesoscale convective complex, with more of a threat of damaging winds and hail during the nighttime hours.|$|E
