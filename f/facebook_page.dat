40|$|Objective of the Study: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to better understand how public Finnish B 2 B companies use corporate <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages.</b> The study further approached the <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages</b> from two different perspectives, and aimed to find first of all, how elements of corporate identity on Facebook shape the corporate image, and secondly, how the <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages</b> can foster organizational identification. Methodology and Theoretical Framework: The data for the study was collected directly from public <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages.</b> All in all, the posts and comments from 11 B 2 B companies' <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages</b> were collected from a time period of three months. After an initial analysis of these 11 pages, the data was further narrowed down to only three case companies for a more fine-grained analysis. The methods of analysis included a qualitative content analysis of the <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages</b> and a rhetorical analysis of the case companies' posts. The theoretical framework outlined the two perspectives used to study the <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages.</b> Firstly, it defined the elements of corporate identity as symbolism, behaviour, communication and the consistency of messages and argued that the management of these elements aims at creating a favourable public image of the company. Secondly, the theoretical framework posited that external communication can also be used to foster organizational identification, and specifically this can be done through rhetorical devices and external reactions. Findings and Conclusions: The study found that the most common type of post was an update from an industry event or career fair. The content analysis of the <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages</b> discovered that the use of symbolism was partly restricted by the Facebook platform, but prominent in profile pictures and cover photos. The element of behaviour was present in the way companies treated their followers' comments and questions. Regarding communication, the findings showed that the tone of voice on the pages was often informal. In addition, identities were performed through affiliations with the industry, values or other organizations. The study also found that <b>Facebook</b> <b>pages</b> used certain rhetorical devices to foster organizational identification, most prominently highlighting individual employees, and using an assumed "we". In addition, likes and comments showed external reactions in a more visible way than other more traditional media...|$|R
