Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.|$|E

Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them.

5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A.
