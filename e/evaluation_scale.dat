The SIAS is significantly correlated with the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), consistent with the observation that social interaction fears and social phobia scrutiny fears co-exist, although they are still two different sets of symptoms. It is strongly related to other related measures of social anxiety and social phobia, including the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Mini Social Phobia Inventory (mini-SPIN), Brief Fear of Negative <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Scale</b> (BFNE), the Fear of Positive <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Scale</b> (FPES), and the Interaction Anxiousness Scale.

40|$|The bachelors thesis deals "Evaluation Scales as a Part of Nursing Documentation". The bachelors thesis {{consists}} of two parts. The theory part dealt with nursery documentation and <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales.</b> The objective of the thesis was to present portions of nursery documentation {{that are based on}} legislation and the use of nursing documentation {{in the course of the}} nursing process. It described the areas of assessment of patient's medical condition by a nurse allowing the use of more evaluating scales. In the practical part of the thesis three objectives were set. The first objective was to map out <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> used by nurses in selected health care facilities. The second objective involved mapping out understanding of nurses of and in using <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales.</b> The third objective was to establish whether nurses can actively participate in selecting of <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> in their wards. Three assumptions were then set up. The first assumption was as follows: "The use of <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> varies according to the type of the health care facility". The second assumption read: "Nurses are informed on the possibilities of using evaluation scales". The third assumption read: "Nurses can participate in active selection of evaluation scales". A quantitative method of anonymous questionnaire was employed to establish the factual state. A single questionnaire type was used for all nurses. The questionnaire involved 33 questions and 12 subquestions that were closed and semi-closed for addition of a short answer. Opening questions of the questionnaire were of identification nature. Subsequent questions dealt with different evaluation areas, the use of <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> and perception of <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> by nurses. The file of questioned persons consisted of nurses serving in the České Budějovice a. s. and the Nemocnice Písek a. s. hospitals. In total 168 questionnaires were distributed. 84 of them to nurses of the České Budějovice a. s. hospital and 84 questionnaires to nurses of the Nemocnice Písek a. s. hospital. Clearly set diagrams were processed based on nurses' answers. Discussion results were compared with specialized literature. The final part of the thesis contains summary results and assumptions of the thesis author are confirmed or rebutted herein. The first assumption: "The use of <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> varies according to the type of the health care facility" has been confirmed. The second assumption: "Nurses are informed on the possibilities of using evaluation scales" has been confirmed.

5000|$|Developed by Robert Marin in 1991, the Apathy <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Scale</b> (AES) {{is a way}} of {{measuring}} as related to brain-related pathology. Centered around evaluation, the scale can either be self-informed, or other-informed. The three versions of the test include self, informant such as a family member, and clinician. The scale is based around questionnaires that ask about topics including interest, motivation, socialization, and how the individual spends their time. The individual or informant answers on a scale of [...] "not at all", [...] "slightly", [...] "somewhat" [...] or [...] "a lot". Each item on the evaluation is created with positive or negative syntax and deals with cognition, behavior, and emotion. Each item is then scored and, based on the score, the individual's level of apathy can be evaluated.|$|E
50|$|The Animal Metaphor test {{consists}} {{of a series of}} creative and analytical prompts in which the person filling out the test is asked to create a story and then interpret its personal significance. Unlike conventional projective tests, the Animal Metaphor Test works as both a diagnostic and therapeutic battery. Unlike the Rorschach test and TAT, the Animal Metaphor is premised on self-analysis via self-report questions. The test combines facets of art therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and insight therapy, while also providing a theoretical platform of behavioral analysis. The test has been used widely as a clinical tool, as an educational assessment, and in human resource selection. The test is accompanied by an inventory, The Relational Modality <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Scale,</b> a self-report measure that targets individuals' particular ways of resolving conflict and ways of dealing with relational stress. These tests were developed by Dr. Albert J Levis at the Center for the Study of Normative Behavior in Hamden, CT, a clinical training and research center.|$|E

40|$|Apathy, a {{quantitative}} reduction in goal-directed behavior, is a prevalent symptom dimension {{with a negative}} impact on functional outcome in various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression. The aim of this review is to show that interview-based assessment of apathy in humans and observation of spontaneous rodent behavior in an ecological setting can serve as an important complementary approach to already existing task-based assessment, to study and understand the neurobiological bases of apathy. We first discuss the paucity of current translational approaches regarding animal equivalents of psychopathological assessment of apathy. We then present the existing <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> for the assessment of apathy in humans and propose five sub-domains of apathy, namely self-care, social interaction, exploration, work/education and recreation. Each of the items in apathy <b>evaluation</b> <b>scales</b> can be assigned to one of these sub-domains. We then show that corresponding, well-validated behavioral readouts exist for rodents and that, indeed, three of the five human apathy sub-domains have a rodent equivalent.
