[...] He also {{suggested}} that power plants could use the dead bodies of Hindus as fuel. [...] "Jews," [...] el-Faisal said, [...] "should be killed ... as by Hitler." [...] He said: [...] "People with British passports, if you fly into Israel, it is easy. Fly into Israel and do whatever you can. If you die, you are up in paradise. How do you fight a Jew?

2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> snake, you kill it. At GM, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to England he took up a life of sport and gambling, and became a {{well-known}} figure at sporting events and Crockford's. He hunted in Leicestershire, played cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club, and attended race meetings and boxing matches where {{he was known as}} Vinny Cotton, Sir Vincent Twist, or the Baronet. On occasion he was involved in brawls, and was once quoted as advising brawlers to [...] "pitch into the big rosy men, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little lemon-faced nine-stone man, {{have nothing to do with}} him". In 1836, having lost much of his fortune at the gaming tables, he bought the Age stagecoach which ran between London and Brighton. Cotton drove the coach for two years, before his mother's ill health caused him to return to Madingley.|$|E
