40|$|The {{evolution}} of a new machine is described, from an idea conceived in 1960 to a prototype operative in September 1964. The {{emphasis is on the}} decisions, methods, criteria, and results incorporated in the machine rather than on analytical aspects of the design. The primary criterion guiding the design was to provide a machine more economical for users to own. A description is given of the machine, PC 64, which is a new completely hydraulic 42 in. x 4 in. capacity production paper cutter of the guillotine type, weighing less than 3000 lbs. Introduction of the essentials of a guillotine cutter and analysis of a 1960 commercial machine are used to establish reference limits for the new machine. Results of cutting tests performed to determine the most advantageous cutting angle are included. Important new features of PC 64 include a single shear straightline motion <b>knife</b> <b>drive</b> powered by a single hydraulic cylinder, and a hydraulically driven and controlled backstop. Optional automatic control for the backstop is accomplished by means of notched program bars affording trimout cuts to. 015 in. It is shown that for any cutting angle selected, the height, width, and length of PC 64 cannot be reduced further. The machine is evaluated by comparison with commercial cutters marketed prior to and during the project. From the comparison it is concluded that features of PC 64 have commercial potential and that the primary criterion has been met. Photographic materials on pages 11, 48, 49, 162, 163 and 181 are essential and will not reproduce clearly on Xerox copies. Photographic copies should be ordered. </p...|$|E

60|$|Then with {{a little}} jerk of his {{shoulders}} the man who {{caught sight of the}} opening moved again, faster than he had done, and the watcher surmised that fear and savagery struggled for the mastery within him. The latter apparently rose uppermost, for he came straight on through the thicket, sprang across the clear space, and would have plunged into the bush beyond it but that Alton, reaching out caught him by the ankle. Then he lurched forward with a hoarse cry, went down, and rolled over with Alton's hand at his throat, and the blade of the <b>knife</b> <b>driven</b> through the inner side of the sleeve of his jacket.|$|R
60|$|In {{the middle}} of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of an {{enormous}} man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in its contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of blood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork. His knees were drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of his broad, brown, upturned throat there projected the white haft of a <b>knife</b> <b>driven</b> blade-deep into his body. Giant as he was, the man must have gone down like a pole-axed ox before that terrific blow. Beside his right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.|$|R

5000|$|A South Seas island prince is wrongly {{convicted of}} murder and {{executed}} by having a <b>knife</b> <b>driven</b> into his heart, {{the result of a}} plot by a witch doctor (the true murderer) who resented the prince's friendly relations with American scientists stationed on a field laboratory on the island. The prince is buried in a hollow tree trunk and forgotten about until nuclear radiation reanimates him {{in the form of the}} [...] "Tabanga", a scowling tree stump. The monster escapes from the laboratory and kills several people, including the witch doctor, whom the Tabanga pushes down a hill to be impaled on his own crown of shark teeth. The creature cannot be stopped, burned, or trapped. Only when a crack rifle shot from one of the scientists <b>drives</b> the <b>knife</b> (which still protrudes from the creature's chest) all the way through its heart does it finally die and sink into the swamp.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} experimental data, verifying the applicability of signal analysis techniques for condition monitoring of a packaging machine. In particular, the activity focuses on the cutting process that divides a continuous flow of packaging paper into single packages. The cutting process is made by a steel <b>knife</b> <b>driven</b> by a hydraulic system. Actually, the knives are frequently substituted, causing frequent stops of the machine and consequent lost production costs. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a diagnostic procedure to assess the wearing condition of blades, reducing the stops for maintenance. The packaging machine was provided with pressure sensor that monitors the hydraulic system driving the blade. Processing the pressure data comprises three main steps: the selection of scalar quantities that could be indicative of the condition of the knife. A clustering analysis was used to set up a threshold between unfaulted and faulted knives. Finally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was applied to classify the technical condition of knife during its lifetime...|$|R

50|$|Individuals with {{congenital}} insensitivity to pain have painless injuries {{beginning in}} infancy but otherwise normal sensory responses upon examination. Patients frequently have bruises and cuts, {{and are often}} only diagnosed because of limping or lack of use of a limb. Individuals {{have been reported to}} be able to walk over burning coals and to insert <b>knives</b> and <b>drive</b> spikes through their arms. It has been observed that the insensitivity to pain does not appear to be due to axonal degeneration.|$|R

50|$|Wood chips {{used for}} {{chemical}} pulp must be relatively uniform {{in size and}} free of bark. The optimum size varies with the wood species. It is important to avoid damage to the wood fibres as this {{is important for the}} pulp properties. For roundwood it is most common to use disk chippers. A typical size of the disk is 2.0 - 3.5 m in diameter, 10 - 25 cm in thickness and weight is up to 30 tons. The disk is fitted with 4 to 16 <b>knives</b> and <b>driven</b> with motors of Â½ - 2 MW. Drum chippers are normally used for wood residuals from saw mills or other wood industry.|$|R

We shall say only, therefore, that after tempests not a few of porcine squealing, answered always by counter-latration on the vigilant Plotho's part;--squealing, chiefly, from the Reich's-Hofrath at Vienna, the Head Tribunal of Imperial Majesty, which sits judging and denouncing there, touched to the soul, as if by a <b>knife</b> <b>driven</b> into its side, by those unheard-of treatments of Saxony and disregard to our DEHORTATORIUMS, and which bursts out, peal after peal, filling the Universe, Plotho not unvigilant;--the poor old Reich's-Diet did at last get into an acting posture, and determine, by clear majority of 99 against 60, {{that there should be}} a [...] "Reich's Execution Army" [...] got on foot. Reich's Execution Army to coerce, by force of arms, this nefarious King of Prussia into making instant restitution to Saxony, with ample damages on the nail; that right be done to Kurfursts of this Reich. To such height of vigor has the Reich's-Diet gone;--and was voting it at Regensburg January 10th, 1757; [Helden-Geschichte, iv. 252, 302, 330; Stenzel, v. 32.] that very day when nefarious Friedrich at Berlin, case-hardened in iniquity to such a pitch, sat writing his INSTRUCTION TO COUNT FINCK, which we read not long since.

Twice it opened its great jaws and spat, and twice it strove to close them. Oh! what if it should rid itself of the <b>knife,</b> or <b>drive</b> it through the soft flesh of the throat? Then he was lost indeed! But this it might not do, for the lower blade caught upon the jawbone, and at each effort it drove the sharp point of the upper knife deeper towards its brain. Moreover, so good was the steel, and so firm were the hide bindings of the handles, shrunken as they were with the wet, that nothing broke or gave.|$|R

5000|$|The Babylon 5 episode [...] "Comes the Inquisitor" [...] (1995) {{features}} a character named Sebastian who is Jack the Ripper, abducted by the alien Vorlons {{in the year}} 1888 and made into their inquisitor {{so that he can}} test (through torture) beings who are called to lead an important cause. In the TV series Grimm, the final three episodes of the fourth season reveal that Jack the Ripper was a spirit that initially manifested over a century before the Whitechapel murders; the Jack spirit possesses one of the series protagonists after a near-death experience, but the others are able to 'exorcise' Jack by shooting his host with rubber bullets to trick Jack into thinking that his host was being murdered. The idea of the Ripper as a supernatural entity is used again in the third season of the television series Sleepy Hollow, with the 'killer' in this case being a <b>knife</b> that <b>drives</b> its wielder to act on their darker impulses as it absorbs the blood of its victims; it is defeated when it is tricked into stabbing someone with malaria, the infection tainting the blood and thus weakening the blade.|$|R
40|$|A new {{oscillating}} cryo-knife {{for producing}} uncompressed vitreous sections is introduced. The knife is a modified cryo diamond <b>knife</b> that is <b>driven</b> by a piezo translator. Optimal {{setting for the}} oscillation {{was found to be}} in the inaudible frequency range of 20 - 25 kHz. Yeast cells and polystyrene spheres were used as model systems to describe compression in the vitreous sections. We found that compression could be reduced by a factor of about 2 when the knife was oscillating. When the oscillator was turned off, sections were compressed by 40 - 45 %. However, only 15 - 25 % compression was obtained when the knife was oscillating. In some cases completely uncompressed sections of yeast cells were produced. It was also found that the amount of compression depends on the specimen itself and on its embedding medium. With the results shown here, we demonstrate that the oscillating knife can produce high-quality vitreous sections with minimum cutting artefacts...|$|R

A splinter of the blade remains within the wound, causing Frodo to fall very ill as they travel to Rivendell. Aragorn warns them that, unless treated soon, Frodo will become a wraith like the NazgÃ»l himself. As the travellers near their destination, they meet Glorfindel, an elf-lord from Rivendell, who helps them reach the River Bruinen near Rivendell. But the NazgÃ»l, all nine now gathered together, ambush the party at the Ford of Bruinen. Glorfindel's horse outruns the pursuers and carries Frodo across the Ford. As the NazgÃ»l attempt to follow, a giant wave commanded by Elrond, the lord of Rivendell, sweeps them away and Frodo collapses.|$|R
40|$|Children as {{the next}} {{generation}} {{can not be separated}} from their social environment. Family is the first social environment and then peers, school, neighborhood and society at large is a place for children to develop themselves. In this case tualah people who will play a role in it. But unfortunately there are still parents who commit acts of violence against children. Acts of violence carries a wide impact, one of which affects the child's social adjustment to their environment in everyday life. Social adjustment becomes very important because it is a provision for the child to be able to live comfortably and happily in life with the surrounding environment. This research is a qualitative descriptive study. The subjects in this study were four students SDN Batu Mulia I, Panyipatan, Ta-La, Kal-cell. The four subjects are obtained by interviewing the teachers and citizens. The data mining technique used was interviews. And methods of data analysis used in this research is the implementation of data collection, data reduction, data presentation and draw conclusions. The results showed that the forms of violence experienced by four subjects physically: beaten hands, beaten wood, pinched, scratched, kicked, lit mosquito coil, inserted in the barrel, locked in the house, thrown crescent, disabet <b>knife,</b> dijambak, <b>driven</b> and rammed head-knock into the wall. Psychological violence: scolded, shouted at, abused, humiliated, threatened, and blamed continually. Violence neglect: not given time to learn, not supervised, are not taken care of, not being fed and will be handed over to social institutions. As a result, the four subjects suffered burns, cuts, bruises, aches, dizziness, difficulty learning, anxiety, conduct acts of aggression, not confidence, withdrawal from society, shunned from society and had difficulty adjusting socially. From the interviews that uses four indicators can be concluded that the four subjects experienced poor social adjustment. It is evident from the lack of parental role in directing the pattern of good behavior at home, subjects can not apply that model behavior diidolakannya in everyday life, motivated subjects tend not to be realized because there are restrictions from parents and some resistance from friends peers, and with no personal satisfaction...|$|R
