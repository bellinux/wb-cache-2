However, because the <b>face</b> <b>widths</b> of colonnades are inversely proportional to the growth rate of columnar joints from the cold margin (Goehring et al., 2009; Grossenbacher and McDuffie, 1995), variation in the <b>face</b> <b>widths</b> of the colonnades with elevation implies several discontinuous episodes of tuff emplacement, cooling, and compaction in MMNG, rather than a single event occurring after the earlier tuff emplacement resulting in the Chotdae-bong colonnades.

30|$|Fifth, we only {{obtained}} limited {{data of the}} <b>face</b> <b>widths</b> for a scaling analysis {{because of}} rare intact colonnades that have not experienced significant weathering and fracturing. However, to further test our hypothesis of the three-stage emplacements of the Mudeungsan Tuff, additional data measurements of the <b>face</b> <b>widths</b> throughout the colonnades should be required. Furthermore, the simplified numerical models {{used in this study}} only approximate the growth rate of columnar joints, which are reasonable for the scaling analysis (Fig.  9). Although we assumed that the growth rate of the columnar joints in the early stage represents the effective growth rate, this assumption requires additional, effective cooling processes such as water infiltration along the joints, which is discussed in previous studies (Goehring et al., 2009; Grossenbacher and McDuffie, 1995). If there is continuous water infiltration, the growth rate of columnar joints might remain constant with time. Future work of numerical modeling should test the effect of water infiltration on jointing growth. Although laboratory experiments are not relevant to the development of entablatures, the existence of an entablature between the C 2 U and C 2 L colonnades should be verified.|$|R
40|$|Reliability is the {{probability}} that a system, component or device will perform without failure for a specified period of time under specified operating conditions. The concept of reliability is of great importance in the design of various machine members. Conventional engineering design uses a deterministic approach. It disregards the fact that the material properties, the dimensions of the components and the externally applied loads are statistical in nature. In conventional design these uncertainties are covered with a factor of safety, which is not always successful. The growing trend towards reducing uncertainty and increasing reliability is to use the probabilistic approach. In the present work a six speed gear box are designed using reliability principles. For the specified reliability of the system (Gear box), component reliability (Gear pair) is calculated by considering the system as a series system. Design is considered to be safe and adequate if {{the probability}} of failure of gearbox is {{less than or equal to}} a specified quantity in each of the two failure modes.

In machine tools, the propose of {{a gear box}} {{is to provide a}} series of useful output speeds so that the machining operation can be carried out at its most optimum operating conditions high spindle speeds with low feed rate for roughing operations. An important aspect in the design of machine tool transmission is to keep the cost and volume of the gear box to a minimum. The probabilistic approach to design has been considered to be more rational compared to the conventional design approach based on the factor of safety. The existence of uncertainties in either engineering simulations or manufacturing processes calls for a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) model for robust and cost-effective designs.

The percentages of right-, left-, and mixed-faced subjects were close to those found for paw preference in cats.

40|$|Wildhaber-Novikov gears are {{becoming}} more and more popular for heavy load applications. They have been tried as speed-reducing gears, in spite of heavy noise generation, in aircraft jet engines, marine engines and agricultural machinery. These circular-arc gears, though stronger than involute geras, have the disadvantage of needing larger <b>face</b> <b>width.</b> Axial <b>face</b> <b>width</b> required can be minimized only at the expense of load-carrying capacity. This is not a serious disadvantage with stationary engines. But in the case of automotive applications, this fact limits the load-carrying capacity of Wildhaber-Novikov gears, since space problem is very critical in these applications and large face widths, therefore, cannot be used for such gear-reduction units. The <b>face</b> <b>width</b> is determined by the helix angle and, therefore, a thorough investigation of the dependence of the load-carrying capacity on helix angle is necessary, if these special types of gears have to make headway into the automotive field. In this experimental investigation, three-dimensional photoelastic technique has been employed to study the load-carrying capacity/face width ratio. Three-dimensional gear models made of epoxy castings (Araldite B) were loaded in a specially built gear-loading fixture and were stress frozen. Gear cutters of Wildhaber-Novikov gears developed at the laboratory were used for the preparation of these three-dimensional gear models. The stress-frozen models were analyzed using the conventional slicing technique to study the contact and bending-stress distribution along the <b>face</b> <b>width.</b> The load-carrying capacity in terms of contact stress and bending stress has been studied for different face widths and helix angles. Twenty-deg pressure angle, 14 -mm module gears of alladdendum type of Wildhaber-Novikov gears with different helix angles up to 40 deg were tested. The helical-overlap ratio used was 1. 0.
