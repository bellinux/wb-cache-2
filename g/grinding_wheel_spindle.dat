30|$|This paper proposes an {{experimental}} approach for monitoring and {{inspection of the}} formation accuracy in ultra-precision grinding (UPG) {{with respect to the}} chatter vibration. Two factors related to the grinding progress, the grinding speed of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>spindle,</b> and the oil pressure of the hydrostatic bearing are taken into account to determining the accuracy. In the meantime, a mathematical model of the radius deviation caused by the micro vibration is also established and applied in the experiments. The results show that the accuracy is sensitive to the vibration and the forming accuracy is much improved with proper processing parameters. It is found that the accuracy of aspheric surface can be less than 4 μm when the grinding speed is 1400 r/min and the wheel speed is 100 r/min with the oil pressure being 1.1 MPa.|$|R

Also, the relationship between mechanical properties of a <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> and the grade is also clear.

40|$|AbstractThe {{conventional}} {{method of}} delivering grinding fluid that floods delivery with high supply fluid pressure and nozzle fluid rare to achieve high performance grinding.

In this paper, a theoretical hydrodynamic pressure modeling is presented for the flow of coolant through the grinding zone during high-speed precision grinding.

Furthermore, the hydrodynamic pressure peak value was only generated in the minimum clearance region where a higher fluid pressure gradient was observed.

Dressing is a vital stage in the grinding process to ensure a consistent wheel topography and performance. However, the effects of roller dressing on functional performance of vitreous {{grinding wheels}} {{as well as its}} influence on different abrasive grit morphologies have not been fully characterised. This paper studies the influence of dressing parameters on the topography, morphology and characteristics of the surface of different vitrified abrasive wheels in order to better understand the process and therefore optimise the preparation of grinding wheels for industrial machining. Alumina grinding wheels with conventional and engineered grit shapes were dressed at two different infeed rates over a range of seven different speed ratios (from − 0. 8 to + 1). An experimental methodology has been developed incorporating a range of known techniques to define the abrasive wheel condition including measured power consumption and ground graphite coupons as well as using optical microscopes to measure grain fracture flats, peak density and abrasive grain shape. It has been found that power consumption of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>spindle</b> increases at higher infeed rates and speed ratios. This leads to increased fracturing of the grains and whole-grain pull out. According to the results the infeed rate has a more substantial effect on wheel topography than speed ratio and the response of engineered grit morphologies to dressing is dependent on grit orientation...|$|E
