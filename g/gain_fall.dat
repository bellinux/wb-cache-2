30|$|Several such {{approaches}} {{have been considered}} in the literature to reduce the requirements of CJP, such as limited feedback [7, 8] and limited backhauling [5, 6, 9, 10]. Partial joint processing (PJP) is a general framework aiming to reduce the complexity requirements of CJP, basically the feedback and backhaul load. In the particular PJP approach considered in this article, a CCN or the serving BS instructs the UTs to report the CSI of the links in the cluster of BSs whose channel <b>gain</b> <b>fall</b> within an active set threshold or window, relative to their best link (usually the serving BS) [7]. This is summarized in Algorithm 1. Note that a similar approach is used in [8]. PJP {{can be regarded as}} a user-centric clustering when it is implemented over a static cluster, since overlapping subclusters or active sets of BSs are dynamically formed. Note that CJP is a particular case of PJP when the threshold tends to infinity.|$|E

This chapter of the "Les Entretiens du Carla" reviews the potential of nutritherapy for the prevention or improvement of sarcopenia, which is the progressive reduction in muscle mass and muscle strength prevalent in late-life. It is critical that we review nutrients and their potential to maintain muscle mass and strength which ultimately will help minimize falls and fractures among the older population. Evidence from randomized-controlled trials will be reviewed for muscle mass as well as important sarcopenia-related endpoints including lower extremity strength and function, as well as falls and fall-related fractures. This chapter will focus on vitamin D as a compelling strategy with evidence for strength <b>gain,</b> <b>fall</b> and fracture prevention from double-blind randomized controlled trials. The other strategy discussed is increased protein intake although longer-term trials and evidence for clinically important endpoints are limited. Today, there is no consistent data on other micronutrients or macronutrients with an established potential to combat sarcopenia...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{teaching}} strategies that improve {{the development of}} phonemic awareness are important to ensure students are fluent readers by third grade. The use of handheld devices to improve phonemic awareness with kindergarten students may be such a strategy, but no research exists that evaluates {{the use of these}} devices. This study explored the effectiveness of Bee-Bot handheld devices in kindergarten classrooms to teach phonemic awareness. A 4 -month sequential mixed-methods study was conducted in four classrooms: two that used Bee-Bot handheld devices in phonemic awareness lessons and two that never used the devices. The score <b>gain</b> (<b>Fall</b> 2009 to Winter 2010) for initial sound fluency (ISF) on the DIBELS assessment was analyzed for between-group effects using ANCOVA, controlling for Fall 2009 letter naming fluency (LNF) scores. No significant difference was found between ISF scores of students using the Bee-Bots and those not using them. Interviews of the 4 classroom teachers determined their perceptions of the ways handheld devices supported phonemic awareness. Interviews were coded for (a) assessments, (b) engagement, (c) strategies, (d) social growth and (e) technology standards. Teachers reported that students using Bee-Bot handheld devices remained on task longer, increased motivation, developed leadership skills, and students enjoyed learning with the devices. Findings suggest that handheld devices used to enhance phonemic awareness in kindergarten may offer an engaging way to enhance social skills while providing technology integration. This study contributes to social change by improving teacher knowledge of technology-assisted strategies for social and literacy skills among less advantaged populations...|$|E

50|$|So in {{oscillators}} {{that must}} produce a very low-distortion sine wave, {{a system that}} keeps the gain roughly constant during the entire cycle is used. A common design uses an incandescent lamp or a thermistor in the feedback circuit. These oscillators exploit the resistance of a tungsten filament of the lamp increases in proportion to its temperature (a thermistor works in a similar fashion). The lamp both measures the output amplitude and controls the oscillator gain at the same time. The oscillator's signal level heats the filament. If the level is too high, then the filament temperature gradually increases, the resistance increases, and the loop <b>gain</b> <b>falls</b> (thus decreasing the oscillator's output level). If the level is too low, the lamp cools down and increases the gain. The 1939 HP200A oscillator uses this technique. Modern variations may use explicit level detectors and gain-controlled amplifiers.|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{potential}} energy is typically divided into an available and a nonavailable part. In this article a hypothetical utilization of {{a fraction of}} the nonavailable {{potential energy}} is described. This part stems from the water vapor that can be converted into the liquid phase. An energy gain results when the potential energy of the condensate relative to a reference height exceeds the energy necessary to condensate the water vapor. It is shown that this can be the case in a saturated atmosphere without convective available potential energy. Finally, simulations with the numerical cloud model HURMOD are performed to estimate the usability of the device in practice. Indeed, a positive energy output results in a simulation with immediate gathering of the condensate. On the contrary, potential energy <b>gained</b> <b>falls</b> significantly short of the necessary energy for forming the condensate when a realistic cloud microphysical scheme allowing re-evaporation of condensate is applied. Taken together it can be concluded that, a utilization of atmospheric potential energy is hypothetically possible but the practical realization is probably not feasible...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a new type}} of continuous channel multiplier (CEM) fabricated from a low-resistance glass to produce a high-conductivity channel section and thereby obtain a high count-rate capability. The flat-cone cathode configuration of the CEM is specifically designed for the detection of astigmatic exit images from grazing-incidence spectrometers at the optimum angle of illumination for high detection efficiencies at XUV wavelengths. Typical operating voltages are in the range of 2500 - 2900 V with stable counting plateau slopes in the range 3 - 6 % per 100 -V increment. The modal gain at 2800 V was typically in the range (50 - 80) million. The modal <b>gain</b> <b>falls</b> off at count rates in excess of about 20, 000 per sec. The detection efficiency remains essentially constant to count rates in excess of 2 million per sec. Higher detection efficiencies (better than 20 %) are obtained by coating the CEM with MgF 2.
