2500|$|The Princess's {{influential}} short hairstyle {{was created}} by Sam McKnight after a Vogue shoot in 1990, which, in McKnight and Donatella Versace's opinion, showed her liberty. The Princess reportedly did her own make up and would always have a hairstylist by her side before an event, on which she told McKnight: [...] "It's not for me, Sam. It is for the people I visit or who come to see me. They don't want me in off-duty mode, they want a princess. Let’s <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> they want." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Moses became well known as a sport caster, calling the rugby and The Ashes matches of the Australian cricket team in England in 1934 from telegraphed despatches as if the {{commentary}} was live from the venue. [...] He became the ABC's Sporting Editor in Sydney in January 1933, the Federal Controller of Talks in September 1934, the Federal Liaison Officer in August 1935, and finally, in November 1935, the [...] General Manager. His predecessor, Walter Conder, had been {{in conflict with the}} chairman of the ABC, William James Cleary. Conder had wanted to give the listeners what he thought they wanted: sports and entertainment; Cleary wanted to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>what</b> he thought they should have: discussion and high culture.

2500|$|As {{the front}} line {{continued}} to withdraw, they appeared from the woods {{directly in front of}} Morton and then slowly took refuge behind his lines.

[...] With that, the lines were ordered to stand and open fire, putting gaps into the oncoming Confederate lines. The lines wavered and then began to withdraw. Upon seeing the success, Rosecrans order the brigade to charge forward and occupy the fields just outside the woods. The Confederates rallied three times and pressed forward again, but each time, were forced back.|$|E

5000|$|The Lancair designs {{provided}} {{the highest performance}} in the single-engine GA class, and as the kit-build market was dominated by pilots looking to outperform existing [...] "off-the-shelf" [...] designs, the Lancair's kits sold well.

[...] Regarding the series airing on a network that broadcasts other reality shows featuring uncritical depictions of sexuality and alcohol as recurring themes, he said, [...] "The people that need what we have are watching VH1.

60|$|Now is not {{the answer}} to the puzzle this: That God is impartial; that He is no respecter of persons, but causing His sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and His rain to fall on the just and on the unjust; and so {{rewarding}} every man according to his work, paying him for all work done, of whatever kind it may be?
