40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{exclusion}} of the left atrial appendage (LAA) {{has been used to}} reduce the risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). While LAA exclusion has been associated with a reduced risk of stroke, the effect on the electrical activity of the LAA (a potential source of AF) remains unknown. As such, we sought to demonstrate whether surgical <b>epicardial</b> <b>clip</b> occlusion leads to the electrical isolation of the LAA. METHODS: From December 2010 until August 2011, 10 patients with paroxysmal AF underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery with bilateral pulmonary vein isolation and an LAA clip occlusion with a new <b>epicardial</b> <b>clip.</b> Before and after the clip was placed, pacing manoeuvres were performed to assess the electrical exit and entry blocks from the LAA. RESULTS: All clips were applied successfully. The mean procedure time for the clip application was 4 ± 1 min. No complications occurred related to clip application. Prior to the pericardial closure, 18 ± 3 min after the clip placement, the LAA stimulation and pacing manoeuvres demonstrated complete electrical isolation of the LAA in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Epicardial LAA clip occlusion leads to the acute electrical isolation of the LAA and may not only provide stroke prevention but also reduce the recurrence of AF...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveAtrial {{fibrillation}} puts {{patients at}} significant risk for embolic stroke originating {{from the left}} atrial appendage. Few means are available for safe, effective, and durable left atrial appendage occlusion. A new clip device was evaluated with regard to safety and effectiveness for epicardial left atrial appendage occlusion. MethodsPatients with atrial fibrillation undergoing elective cardiac surgery through a median sternotomy were enrolled for concomitant <b>epicardial</b> <b>clip</b> placement. Early postoperative and 3 -month follow-up computed tomography studies {{were used to assess}} clip stability and left atrial appendage perfusion. ResultsFrom September 2007 to December 2008, 34 patients underwent successful clip placement. No device-related complications occurred. Operative mortality was 8. 8 % and not study or device related. Deployment was rapid, and left atrial appendage occlusion was confirmed by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in all patients. In addition to excellent clinical outcomes (no stroke/transient ischemic attack), serial computed tomography demonstrated stable clip location and appendage perfusion at 3 months in all patients. ConclusionSafe, effective, and durable left atrial appendage occlusion can easily be achieved with this new clip. Further trials are necessary to evaluate the role of the left atrial appendage occlusion in stroke prevention...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{a significant}} risk factor for embolic stroke originating from the left atrial appendage (LAA). This is the first report of long-term safety and efficacy data on LAA closure using a novel <b>epicardial</b> LAA <b>clip</b> device in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS Forty patients with AF were enrolled in this prospective ‘first-in-man' trial. The inclusion criterion was elective cardiac surgery in adult patients with AF for which a concomitant ablation procedure was planned. Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to exclude LAA thrombus at baseline and evaluate LAA perfusion after the procedure, while computed tomography (CT) was used for serial imagery workup at baseline, 3 -, 12 -, 24 - and 36 -month follow-up. RESULTS Early mortality was 10 % due to non-device-related reasons, and thus 36 patients {{were included in the}} follow-up consisting of 1285 patient-days and mean duration of 3. 5 ± 0. 5 years. On CT, clips were found to be stable, showing no secondary dislocation 36 months after surgery. No intracardial thrombi were seen, none of the LAA was reperfused and in regard to LAA stump, none of the patients demonstrated a residual neck > 1 cm. Apart from one unrelated transient ischaemic attack (TIA) that occurred 2 years after surgery in a patient with carotid plaque, no other strokes and/or neurological events demonstrated in any of the studied patients during follow-up. CONCLUSION This is the first prospective trial in which concomitant epicardial LAA occlusion using this novel <b>epicardial</b> LAA <b>clip</b> device is 100 % effective, safe and durable in the long term. Closure of the LAA by <b>epicardial</b> <b>clipping</b> is applicable to all-comers regardless of LAA morphology. Minimal access <b>epicardial</b> LAA <b>clip</b> closure may become an interesting therapeutic option for patients in AF who are not amenable to anticoagulation and/or catheter closure. Further data are necessary to establish LAA occlusion as a true and viable therapy for stroke prevention. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION The trial is registered at www.
