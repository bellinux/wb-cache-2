40|$|The {{development}} of low-loss optical silica fibres and reliable semiconductor laser {{sources in the}} early 1970 s have enabled the practical realisation and massive deployment of optical-fibre communications worldwide. However, high bit-rate transmission is severely limited by the fibre residual loss and dispersion [1].

40|$|We {{present a}} new kind of {{broadband}} continuous-wave source which outperforms any other broadband superluminescent or amplified spontaneous emission source both in terms of output spectral density and bandwidth. Our source covers the wavelength band of interest for fibre applications (from 1450 to 1625 nm) and has an output power of approximately 1. 3 W. The source is obtained by pumping a conventional non-zero <b>dispersion-shifted</b> <b>fibre</b> with a continuous-wave Raman fibre laser tuned to the region of small anomalous dispersion of the fibre. The laser beam undergoes an extreme spectral broadening in the fibre. Our experimental results show clearly that the modulation instability (MI) -induced soliton fission is the key element leading to this spectral broadening. Modulation instability is seeded by fast intensity instabilities present in the laser output. We show that this source features good power stability and we believe that it might have very interesting applications in fibre sensing, for instance to avoid the need of amplification in the interrogation of remote Bragg gratings or to improve the resolution and dynamic range of optical coherence tomography setups.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{exploitation}} of fibre Bragg gratings in optical communication networks. New designs, as well as procedures for dynamically altering grating characteristics are proposed for several important functions. We begin with designing gratings for flattening the gain profile of an erbium-doped fibre amplifier. The design process uses an alternative method to the inverse scattering method, but produces a similar spectral response quality. These gratings have either modulated refractive index or chirp rate. Then, we propose a reconfigurable phase-code encoder. The device is composed of a uniform grating, {{with a number of}} equidistant fine wires for the purpose of modulating the phase via the thermo-optic effect. Error free data transmission is demonstrated in several optical code-division multiple access architectures. The characteristics of the device are also theoretically modelled. Next, we construct a simple package for continuous tuning of fibre gratings, which adopts the beam bending technique. It demonstrates over 110 nm tuning range and the operational wavelength can be accurately predicted. Its spectral response and limitations are also studied. This device has been incorporated into several optical systems, which include tunable distributed feedback fibre laser, add-drop multiplexer and high power fibre laser. Finally, we present a package for varying the dispersion of a fibre grating. The package deforms a beam into a cubic function shape with a contra-flexure point at the middle. Consequently, this allows changes in the grating delay characteristic without shifting its centre wavelength. This device has achieved dispersion compensation of an 80 km non-zero <b>dispersion-shifted</b> <b>fibre</b> in a 10 Gb/s system. Additionally, since its bandwidth also changes with the stress gradient, it has also been utilised as a bandwidth-variable bandpass filter at the receiving terminal of a spectrum-sliced wavelength-division multiplexed system. <br/...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{performance}} of dispersion-shifted-fibre (DSF) and semiconductor-optical-amplifier (SOA) based phase conjugators for a 10 Gb/s non-return-to-zero system with respect to conversion efficiency, noise figure and distortion. Fibre gratings are used for signal extraction and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) suppression, allowing closer wavelength spacing and reducing the conjugation noise figure by up to 12 dB. Despite the higher SOA conversion efficiency, both conjugators give similar noise figures with ASE suppression. However, the DSF based conjugator {{has the advantage of}} distortion tolerance at higher input power. Introduction: Optical phase conjugation has attracted much recent research attention due to its potential application for group-velocity-dispersion and self-phase-modulation compensation in mid-point spectral inversion (MPSI) systems, and also for coherent wavelength conversion in optical switching and routing. The two most promising optical phase conjugation techniques are four-wave mixing (FWM) in either <b>dispersion-shifted</b> <b>fibre</b> (DSF), or semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA). A DSF based conjugator requires phase matching close to its zero dispersion wavelength for efficient four-wave mixing. This restricts its wavelength flexibility compared to an SOA based conjugator which offers a much wider conversion bandwidth. Furthermore, the low FWM conversion efficiency in passive DSF seems to make the SOA a preferred phase conjugating medium. However, in a practical communication system, conjugation optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is more important than conversion efficiency. The noise at the conjugate wavelength is usually dominated by the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from the pump and signal. The reduction of this noise has been demonstrated in an SOA based conjugator (i) by bandpass filtering of the pump and/or signal waves before mixing, and (ii) by the insertion of a notch filter at the conjugate wavelength before the conjugator. In this letter, SOA and DSF based conjugators are compared by investigating the conversion efficiency, noise and eye opening in a 10 Gb/s non-return-to-zero (NRZ) externally-modulated system, using an identical filtering network. We report {{for the first time the}} use of fibre gratings for efficient ASE noise filtering and conjugate signal extraction. The performance enhancement using these noise-suppressing gratings is also investigate...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work on {{a variety}} of novel fibre-based, all-optical approaches to the implementation of several key telecommunications operations. It can be divided into two distinct parts. The first part relates to the generation and coherent manipulation of short pulses in all-fibre systems. The development of an actively and harmonically mode-locked polarisation-maintaining erbium fibre ring laser operating at a repetition rate of 10 GHz is first presented. Long-term stable operation is ensured by the use of an optical phase lock loop to maintain resonant operating conditions. The ring laser incorporated a long length of <b>dispersion-shifted</b> <b>fibre</b> that enhanced soliton compression of the generated pulses, and a filter to allow for tuneable operation within the erbium gain bandwidth. The output was in the form of 2 - 4 ps nearly transform-limited solitons, the width of which depended on pump power. A series of characterisation measurements on this laser is presented. These include autocorrelation and optical spectrum measurements of the pulses, frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) characterisation, an interpulse noise measurement, jitter measurements using the RF spectrum of the pulses, and bit error-rate measurements. A technique that uses superstructured fibre Bragg gratings for passively manipulating short pulses in a coherent manner is presented. The technique relies on filtering in both amplitude and phase the (broad) spectrum of the input pulses, thereby producing pulses of a desired spectral, and hence temporal response. The pulses generated from the erbium fibre ring laser were used in a series of experiments that demonstrated this technique. A basic pulse encoding and decoding scheme, pulse shaping of soliton pulses into square pulses, and repetition rate multiplication from 10 to 40 GHz are presented. The second part of the thesis concerns a detailed characterisation of the recently discovered optical nonlinearities associated with the reflectivity of a gallium:glass interface. It is demonstrated that such mirrors can be formed at the tip of a cleaved fibre. The reflectivity of these mirrors is shown to change at the erbium wavelengths by 30 % under suitable temperature and optical excitation. An assessment of the dependence of the magnitude, dynamics and optical phase response of the nonlinearity on temperature and pump power is carried out. The reproducibility of the nonlinear effect was also examined. Gallium mirrors were then used to passively Q-switch a variety of fibre lasers. Due to their broadband nature, Q-switching of lasers of significantly different lasing wavelengths was achieved (1064 and 1550 nm). Pulse energies up to 10 µJ were obtained. This performance is directly comparable to that achieved using state-of-the-art (wavelength-selective) saturable absorbers. <br/...|$|E
