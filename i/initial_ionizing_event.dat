40|$|We have {{obtained}} blue photometric {{measurements of the}} N 2 second positive 399. 8 nm and the N+ 2 first negative 427. 8 nm emission from sprites, elves and lightning, along with supporting video images. The pulse width and intensity results for sprites {{are consistent with those}} ofSuszcynsky et al. (1998). The red emission from sprites has been independently and unambiguously identified byHampton et al. (1996) andMende et al. (1995) as the nitrogen first positive band. The source has been attributed to electron impact excitation from low energy electrons (≈ 1 eV) in the sprite. The short pulse width of the 427. 8 nm and 399. 8 nm photometer time traces obtained in this investigation are probably not from the same source that produces the red emission. The results reported here indicate an <b>initial</b> energetic <b>ionizing</b> <b>event</b> sufficient to <b>ionize</b> and excite nitrogen followed by secondary electron processes which give rise to the dominant red emission. The photometer results for elves are consistent with the EMP mechanism suggested byInan et al. (1996). The photometer traces obtained for lightning indicate emissions consistent with a ‘continuing current’ as the charge redistributes within the thunderstorm cloud. We find that the ratio of the intensity of the 399. 8 nm N 2 (2 P) emission to that of 427. 8 nm N+ 2 (1 N) emission can be used to discriminate among sprites, elves and lightning...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} to identify and clone novel transforming genes from radiation-induced tumors. This method involves {{the creation of a}} cDNA expression library from radiation-induced tumors. The library is transfected into non-transformed cells, and the nude mouse tumorigenicity assay functionally defines the acquisition of a transformed phenotype. cDNA clones responsible for transformation are rescued by PCR amplification. This method is applicable to a variety of mammalian systems. The only requirement is a functional assay with which to measure the acquisition of an altered phenotype following transfection of a cDNA library. While this method has not yet been applied to a radiation-induced tumor, it has identified a cDNA for the 16 kD subunit of v-H⁺-ATPase, which has been associated with cellular transformation. Two protocols were used to generate radiation-induced tumors. One experiment utilizing fractionated doses of ionizing radiation had a much greater tumor yield than the second protocol using a single dose of 11. 25 Gy. To determine if the mechanism of gene activation is different in radiation- and chemically-induced tumors, the expression pattern of five tumor-associated genes was analyzed. The expression patterns of mals 1 - 4 were not significantly different in tumors generated by the two carcinogens. However, transin, a secreted protease, was overexpressed in radiation-induced papillomas and undetectable in chemically-induced papillomas. This observation supports previous studies indicating a higher conversion rate of radiation-initiated benign papillomas to malignant squamous cell carcinomas when compared to their chemically-initiated counterparts. Transin degrades basement membrane proteins and may be involved in the progression of benign, encapsulated tumors to malignant, invasive squamous cell carcinomas. Isolation and characterization of genes with dominant transforming activity from radiation-induced tumors will provide information {{to bridge the gap between}} the <b>initial</b> <b>ionizing</b> radiation <b>event</b> and the subsequent development of malignant tumors.

40|$|Two {{atmospheric}} {{responses to}} simulated astrophysical <b>ionizing</b> radiation <b>events</b> significant {{to life on}} Earth are production of odd-nitrogen species, especially NO 2, and subsequent depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ozone depletion increases incident short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVB, 280 - 315 nm) and longer (> 600 nm) wavelengths of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400 - 700 nm). On the other hand, the NO 2 haze decreases atmospheric transmission in the long-wavelength UVA (315 - 400 nm) and short wavelength PAR. Here we use the results of previous simulations of incident spectral irradiance following an <b>ionizing</b> radiation <b>event</b> to predict changes in Terran productivity focusing on photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton. The prediction {{is based on a}} spectral model of photosynthetic response developed for the dominant genera in central regions of the ocean (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus), and remote-sensing based observations of spectral water transparency, temperature, wind speed and mixed layer depth. Predicted productivity declined after a simulated <b>ionizing</b> <b>event,</b> but the effect integrated over the water column was small. For integrations taking into account the full depth range of PAR transmission (down to 0. 1 % of utilizable PAR), the decrease was at most 2 - 3 % (depending on strain), with larger effects (5 - 7 %) for integrations just to the depth of the surface mixed layer.

The charge states were distinguished by time-of-flight measurements and the electron energies {{were analyzed by}} a newly designed electrostatic analyzer of the low-pass high-pass filter type which has a large (~ 1. 45 π steradian) solid angle acceptance. For each of nine electron energies from 10 to 160 eV, the <b>ionizing</b> <b>events</b> associated with each residual ion charge state were counted. The electron energy dependence of the charge-state ratios and the average charge determined from the experimental data were in satisfactory agreement with calculations made with a simple statistical model {{based on the assumption}} of independent interactions between the projectile and the ejected electrons. In this model the single-electron ionization probability is assumed to be given by P(b) = P(0) exp(-b/r 0) where r 0 is a characteristic length and b the impact parameter. Values of r 0 and P(0) were determined by fitting the experimental data with this model. The charge-state ratios averaged over ejected electron energies agree with the data of DuBois et al...|$|R
40|$|Future Ge spectrometers {{flown in}} space to observe cosmic gamma-ray sources will {{incorporate}} segmented detectors {{to reduce the}} background from radioactivity produced by energetic particle reactions. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of a}} segmented Ge detector in rejecting background events due to the beta decay of internal radioactivity, a laboratory experiment has been carried out in which radioactivity was produced in the detector by neutron irradiation. A Cf- 252 source of neutrons was used to produce, by neutron capture on Ge- 74 (36. 5 percent of natural Ge) in the detector itself, Ge- 75 (t sub 1 / 2 = 82. 78 min), which decays by beta emission with a maximum electron kinetic energy of 1188 keV. By requiring that an <b>ionizing</b> <b>event</b> deposit energy in two or more of the five segments of the detector, each about 1 -cm thick, the beta particles, which have a range of about 1 -mm, are rejected, while most external gamma rays incident on the detector are counted. Analysis of this experiment indicates that over 85 percent of the beta events from the decay of Ge- 75 are rejected, which is in good agreement with Monte Carlo calculations...|$|R
