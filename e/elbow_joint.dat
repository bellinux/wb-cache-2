5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> was immobile.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), <b>elbow</b> <b>joint,</b> ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

25|$|The {{forearm and}} {{pectoral}} girdle of H.nbsp&floresiensis {{have been examined}} by Larson et al. (2007). Modern humans have {{the top of the}} bone twisted between 145 and 165 degrees to the plane of the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint.</b> For LB1, the twist was initially reported to be 110 degrees. Larson later revised this measurement to 120 degrees.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, throwing, {{commonly}} referred to as chucking, is an illegal bowling action which occurs when a bowler straightens the bowling arm when delivering the ball. The laws of cricket specify that a bowler's arm must not extend during the bowling action. Only the rotation of the shoulder can be used to impart velocity to the ball. Throws are not allowed. If the umpire deems that the ball has been thrown, he will call a no ball which means the batsman cannot be given out from that delivery. Current regulations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) set the legal limit of 15 degrees of permissible straightening of the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> for all bowlers in international cricket. This law applies between {{the point at which the}} bowling arm passes above shoulder height and the point at which the ball is released. The limit is to allow some natural flexing of the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> which happens during the course of legal delivery.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to find the {{difference}} between actual and anticipated frequencies of individual types of FCP (fragmented coronoid process) in relation to the extent of radioulnar incongruity. We evaluated the radiographs of <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> (n = 135) of dogs (n = 77) with arthroscopically (n = 109) or arthrotomically (n = 26) proven fragmented coronoideus medialis ulnae. Radioulnar incongruity was classified as a congruent joint (0 - 0. 5 mm), moderate incongruity (0. 6 - 2 mm) and marked incongruity (> 2. 1 mm). In <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> without radiologically identifiable radioulnar incongruity (0 - 0. 5 mm) significantly higher occurrence of fissured PCM (processus coronoideus medialis) was found (p 2. 1 mm) we found significantly higher occurrence of FCP with a dislocated fragment (p < 0. 001). The results of this study suggest the possibility of using the assessment of radioulnar incongruity from radiographs of <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> in mediolateral projection for specifying the X-ray diagnosis of FCP with regard to the type of FCP lesion.

25|$|In general, {{reconstruction}} of the upper limb can only be performed if active elbow extension is present. This stabilizes the elbow and gives the patient a reach. It will also allow {{the transfer of the}} other muscles crossing the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> (like the m. brachioradialis and m. extensor carpi radialis longus). It is also an operation whose results allow the patient to gain confidence {{in the rest of the}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|Originally, this {{definition}} {{said that the}} <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> must not straighten out during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it {{near the top of}} the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler's elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position.|$|E
25|$|A biomechanical study {{conducted}} by Phil Senter (2006) used articulated casts of the Ornitholestes type specimen's right forelimb to determine its range of motion. Senter found that the antebrachium (forearm) could swing freely within a 95° range. When flexed (bent inward) at the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint</b> to the maximum possible extent, the humerus (upper arm bone) and radius (a lower arm bone) formed a 53° angle. The ability of Ornitholestes to bend the forearm to an angle significantly more acute than 90° is characteristic of Maniraptoriformes, but absent in more primitive theropods such as Coelophysis and Allosaurus.|$|E

25|$|Kano's {{vision for}} judo {{was one of}} a martial way that could be practiced realistically. Randori (free practice) was a central part of judo {{pedagogy}} and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo. Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the <b>elbow</b> <b>joint.</b> Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in ukemi (break falls) and practiced on tatami (rice straw mats).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the possibilities {{and limitations of}} arthroscopy to detect flexor enthesopathy in dogs and to distinguish the primary from the concomitant form. Materials and methods: Fifty dogs (n = 94 <b>elbow</b> <b>joints)</b> were prospectively studied: dogs with primary flexor enthesopathy (n = 29), concomitant flexor enthesopathy (n = 36), elbow dysplasia (n = 18), and normal <b>elbow</b> <b>joints</b> (n = 11). All dogs underwent an arthroscopic examination of one or both <b>elbow</b> <b>joints.</b> Presence or absence of arthroscopic characteristics of flexor enthesopathy and of other elbow disorders were recorded. Results: With arthroscopy, several pathological changes of the enthesis were observed in 100 % of the joints of both flexor enthesopathy groups, but also in 72 % of the <b>joints</b> with <b>elbow</b> dysplasia and 25 % of the normal joints. No clear differences were seen between both flexor enthesopathy groups. Clinical significance: Arthroscopy allows a sensitive detection of flexor enthesopathy characteristics, {{although it is not}} very specific as these characteristics may also be found in joints without flexor enthesopathy. The similar aspect of both forms of flexor enthesopathy and the presence of mild irregularities at the medial coronoid process in joints with primary flexor enthesopathy impedes the arthroscopic differentiation between primary and concomitant forms, requiring additional diagnostic techniques to ensure a correct diagnosis...|$|R
