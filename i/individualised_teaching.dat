40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore how three English {{teachers}} in Swedish compulsory school work towards fulfilling the task of meeting every single student's individual needs when it comes to learning. By interviewing these teachers, the study aims to answer the following questions: What does <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> mean to the three interviewed teachers? What kind of challenges do they face when it comes to meeting the needs of all the students and how do they work with <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching?</b> One of the biggest challenges the teachers face when they attempt to individualise teaching is that is takes a lot of time to analyse every single student's individual needs and it is not always obvious what kind of need the teacher has to take into account when trying to individualise the lesson for the learner. Bigger classes result in the fact that teachers are not always able to meet the requirement found in Lgr 11 that teachers must meet every single student's individual needs...|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} {{aim of this}} dissertation is {{to formulate}} and examine the discursive constructions of “the good teacher” in a specific discursive practice in the media arena. The broader aim is {{to participate in a}} discussion about the relationship between the media and education, including education policy. The discursive practice that is studied is the Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter. The material underlying the study consists of articles published on the editorial and comment pages of the paper during the 1990 s, a decade when the Swedish education system underwent some major changes. In {{the first part of the}} empirical study, the articles included are categorised, first according to the debates constituted and then according to five themes related to the position of the teacher. The second part of the empirical study focuses on education as it is constructed in the discursive practice examined, progressing step by step towards achieving the specific aim of the study. The findings here include the following: a situation for education is established which involves a clear distinction between two different ways of perceiving education; a space of possibility for schooling is opened which excludes certain issues; a preferred school is formed in which priority is given to subject knowledge and order; distinct subject positions are offered to different figures in education, including teachers who are given an authoritative voice and educational researchers who are not; and finally the “good teacher” constructed is an expert who bears and transmits subject knowledge and a proponent of traditional values who manages to <b>individualise</b> <b>teaching.</b> It is also found in the study that a conservative discourse serves to provide an illness for a remedy that is put forward by a neo-liberal discourse, and that media logic is at work in the framing of educational issues in the practice studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reach an understandingfrom the teachers' {{perspective}} of their possibilities to successfully teach ina way that fulfills every child's individual needs in a classroom, according tothe idea of a school for everyone. This study also aims for an understanding ofhow the inclusion of children with special needs in the classroom effect the otherpupils. The main questions asked are: How do teachers think that the conditions of teaching adaptedto all pupils look like in practice? What are the factual conditions that affect the terms forinclusive education according to the teachers? The empirical data were obtained through qualitativesemi-structured interviews with six teachers in primary school, stage 1 - 3. The materialwas processed using an inductive thematic analysis. The results shows that the mainconditions that teachers believe affect their teaching are if there is a combinationof a high student-teacher ratio and high number of pupils with special educationalneeds, if they have opportunity to teach in small groups and access to adequateeducational facilities, and last but not least, time. Time to be there forevery child, to <b>individualise</b> their <b>teaching</b> adapted to every child’s needs,for planning lessons, to discuss the ethical dilemmas with their colleagues andto reflect in order to use the right methods and strategies in the inclusiveclassroom. In this study, it appears that inclusion of childrenwith special needs is very complex. Inclusion leads to teachers findingthemselves in professional ethical dilemmas in which priorities must be madebetween individual pupils and the collective. Teachers are in need of betterconditions to be able to create a school for everyone. One change that isproposed by the teachers, and also by me in this study, is that it should betwo teachers in each classroom.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory can be combined with adaptive techniques to improve <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> in an Intelligent Learning Environment (ILE). The ILE is called Web F-SMILE, it operates over the Web and is meant to help novice users learn basic skills of computer use. Tutoring is dynamically adapted to the individual learner based on the learner modelling component {{of the system and}} the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) that is employed to process the information about the user. As a result, MAUT provides a way for the system to select on the fly the best possible advice to be presented to users. Advice is dynamically formed based on adaptive presentation techniques, where adaptation is performed at the content level and adaptive navigation support, which is performed at the link level of the hyperspace of the tutoring system. The adaptivity of learning depends on factors such as the learner's habits, prior knowledge and skills, which are used as criteria for the application of MAUT in the educational software. In this way, a novel combination of MAUT with adaptive techniques is used for intelligent web-based tutoring. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} teachers' {{conceptions of}} what it means to be pedagogical. The work has itsstarting point in van Manen's work concerning pedagogical tact. By using this concept vanManen tries to describe teachers' tacit and intuitive skills to decide what to do or what not to do in any given situation. This study is based largely on the assumption that van Marten's concept is too narrow and perhaps invalid in certain contexts. The study was conducted as a phenomenographical study with the help of video-stimulated-recall-interviews. Four aspects of the phenomena were identified:: The pedagogical relation: this aspect is constructed by four qualitatively different conceptions: parent-like, friend-like, manager-like and partner-like. The pedagogical control: this aspect is also constructed using four conceptions: as a question of finesse, negotiation, organisation and as a question of rules of the game. The pedagogical teaching: here the aspect consists of three conceptions: to transmit know-ledge, to make children work and to help children learn. The pedagogical ways of coping with dilemmas: the last aspect is made up by three conceptions: situational, principle and methodological. Different types of dilemmas occur according to whether the classroom is organised as collective teaching or <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching.</b> The results show that the phenomena being pedagogical can only be partly understood throughthe concept pedagogical tact. Further, the understanding of the phenomenon seems to be dependent on how the classroom is organised. Being pedagogical can therefore be seen as complex and as contextually dependent. It is influenced not only by cultural and historical factors but also on the type of activities undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Teachers {{are aware}} that pupils who enter school have {{different}} levels of prior knowledge; that being especially characteristic of the Romani. Thus, teaching Romani pupils presents a special challenge for teachers. Most Romani pupils have difficulties with understanding the Slovenian language and only {{use it as a}} means of communication at school. The theoretical part of the thesis introduces the Romani as an ethnic group with all their characteristics and the theoretical basics of initial literacy, individualisation and differentiation of lessons. The empirical part deals with an action research in which three Romani male pupils and one female pupil were monitored during the initial literacy process during a whole school year. At {{the beginning of the school}} year their prior level of knowledge was established. An individual plan of work was prepared for each pupil and their progress was monitored. The work was differentiated and <b>individualised,</b> <b>teaching</b> methods, means and kinds of work were tailored to their needs. The work was organised in smaller groups so that more attention was being paid to these pupils and the process involved the class teacher, the second teacher in the first grade and a Romani teaching assistant. The conclusions of the research are that the Romani pupils have made a considerable progress, judging by their individual development, since they had to make up for their deficits from the preschool period. Based on the results we reached the decision that the female pupil should repeat a year since it is our opinion that the first year at school lays the foundations which need to be strong enough to enable further education. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{was based on}} a {{programme}} that followed the Nurture Group concept in a Secondary School in New Zealand. The Success at School (SAS) programme was based within the school complex and consisted of a home classroom where students were provided with both an academic and social/ life skills programme. The nine selected students were all failing academically and socially within the Year 9 cohort. Academically, all students made some small gains in their literacy and numeracy skills and also on task behaviour. Socially, small gains were made by most students in their positive interactions with others and in decreasing their absences, suspensions, referrals from class and lateness to school. Eight of the nine students indicated an attachment/ trust relationship with their teacher and/ or teacher aide. However it is not clear if the small gains that were made by most of the students can be directly attributed to the Nurture Group concept. The small group size, 1 : 1 <b>teaching,</b> <b>individualised</b> learning programmes and the introduction of a social skills programme may also have contributed to the small academic and social gains the students made.

40|$|Our {{project will}} be {{focusing}} on the new primary school reform and the challenges the teachers have been facing during its first period. We have compiled empiricism through our production of qualitative data. Our qualitative data have been conducted by interviewing two teachers and one school leader at a school located north from Copenhagen. This data was produced {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the challenges the teachers are facing in their approach to their work, due to the new reform. We have used three theorists, Richard Sennett, Alex Honneth and Rasmus Willig, who all have been contributing to answer our problem statement. Based on our analysis of the reform we get the understanding that the reform has resulted in a change of paradigm where teaching now is seen as a way to reach the goal instead of being the goal. The most important purpose of the reform is the goal of higher skilled students. Beside that we have got to that understanding that the “arbejdstidsregler” has caused that the teachers have experienced a less flexible approach to their work and that they have faced huge difficulties to live up to the new standards the reform sets. Furthermore the reform strives to develop and fulfil the students potential the best possible way. The teachers see this as an impossible task, because the new “arbejdstidsregler” results in less time to preparation and less time to a more <b>individualised</b> way of <b>teaching...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is {{merit in}} lecturers seeking students' {{perspectives}} on their learning experiences {{in order to}} foster high quality teaching and learning: Brookfield argues that simply seeking to understand students' experiences of their learning is a key indicator of good teaching practice. However, students' perspectives on learning experiences can be considered feedback only when lecturers acknowledge and act on them. That is, when outputs of a course, i. e. students' reporting of their learning experiences, are used by the lecturer as inputs into the same course {{in a way that}} changes the course. When such feedbacks are created and applied within a course's teaching term, the feedbacks can be of immediate developmental benefit, and visibly so for students. In this paper, we report and analyse lecturers' responses to students' reports of their learning experiences, consistent with Brookfield's call for teachers to use students' perspectives to support critical reflection on their teaching. Data were collected as part of a multi-institutional trial of the Peer Assisted Teaching Scheme (PATS) across five Australian universities in 2012. The data analysed in this study comprise: (i) lecturer's interpretations of students' perspectives on their learning experiences; and (ii) lecturers' decisions to vary or not vary teaching strategies and course management in response. Considering students' reports of their learning experiences is typically a highly <b>individualised</b> aspect of <b>teaching</b> practice. In contrast, PATS creates a collegial and constructive framework in which responses to students' experiences of teaching can be crafted...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematics}} {{achievement of}} {{a cohort of}} 955 students in 42 classes in six schools in London was followed over a four-year period, until they took their GCSEs {{in the summer of}} 2000. All six schools were regarded by Ofsted as providing a good standard of education, and all were involved in teacher-training partnerships with universities. Matched data on key stage 3 test scores and GCSE grades were available for 709 students, and these data were analysed in terms of the progress from key stage 3 test scores to GCSE grades. Although there were wide differences between schools in terms of overall GCSE grades, the average progress made by students was similar in all six schools. However, within each school, the progress made during key stage 4 varied greatly from set to set. Comparing students with the same key stage 3 scores, students placed in top sets averaged nearly half a GCSE grade higher than those in the other upper sets, who in turn averaged a third of a grade higher than those in lower sets, who in turn averaged around a third of a grade higher than those students placed in bottom sets. In the four schools that used formal whole-class teaching, the difference in GCSE grades between top and bottom sets, taking key stage 3 scores into account, ranged from just over 1 grade at GCSE to nearly 3 grades. At the schools using small-group and <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching,</b> the differences in value-added between sets were not significant. In two of the schools, a significant proportion of working class students were placed into lower sets than would be indicated by their key stage 3 test scores...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Nilsson, Nils-Erik, Write in Your Own Words: A Study of Learning Processes in Research Report Writing in School. The thesis {{examines}} sixty pupil texts {{produced in}} the school activity called pupil research at secondary level of a Swedish school where this activity was scheduled one day per week. The purpose of this thesis is to develop knowledge about the writing done by pupils under the specific conditions of pupil research. The research is done from four different perspectives. First, I discuss the pupils’ use of sources. Secondly, I investigate the pupils’ use of genre. Thirdly, I discuss the pupils understanding of their research topics, and finally I discuss how we are to understand the influx of pupil research as a methodological phenomenon. The study shows {{that most of the}} texts can be described as reproduced texts, which imply that the pupil is not the originator of the conveyed thoughts. None of the pupils has produced a text the requested genre of research reports; they have chosen a school genre that is familiar to them depending on whether their purpose has been to account for or to inform or influence. The results indicate that the pupils’ knowledge about the phenomenon they have been studying is very insufficient. Only in a few cases can one say that the pupils draw conclusions. The pupils reproduce facts, often in a fragmentary manner, which indicates that it is doubtful that they have developed any knowledge at all. The fact that students tend to copy texts is discussed from two different perspectives. On the one hand, plagiarism is treated as a problem, and on the other hand, it is discussed from a language development perspective. The fact that school has adopted research as a method is in part explained by the increasingly heterogeneous student population in school, which has led to this form of <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a study {{exploring}} the lived experiences and emotional responses of female patients learning to perform clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC). Background. There is general consensus that CISC {{should be considered in}} preference to in-dwelling catheterisation wherever feasible. Published literature has tended to focus on quality of life issues and technical and physical aspects. There has been less investigation into patients’ initial perceptions of CISC and into their subsequent experiences of learning the technique. Design. This qualitative study used a phenomenological research design. Method. Aseries ofsemi-structured, in-depth interviews were held with a purposive sample of adult female patients performing CISC aged 34 – 64 years. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using the ‘Framework’ method. Results. This study identified six recurrent themes: grief and loss, lack ofknowledge(regarding femaleanatomy,bladder dysfunction and catheters), negative associations and stigma, psychological aversion and embarrassment, nursing approaches and coping mechanisms. Conclusion. Loss of normal bladder function may represent a devastating event and trigger emotional responses associated with grief and loss. Patientsmayexperience a range of reactions whilst learning CISC, including embarrassment and aversion, which may not dissipate over time. However, psychological distress is not inevitable and varies enormously between individuals. The nursing approach is vital, as individualised, empathic care is recognised and valued. Relevance to clinical practice. This study adds to an emerging body of knowledge providing an enhanced understanding of the lived experiences of patients learning CISC. Nurses need to be alert to a range of potential emotional responses. This will facilitate the adoption of <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning strategies, designed to optimise the patient’s assimilation of CISC into their lifestyle, promoting physical health, psychological wellbeing and independent living...|$|E

The study adopted a descriptive survey research design for the study. The population of the study com-prised 3462 secondary schools' teachers in Ondo Central Senatorial District while {{the sample consisted of}} 360 teachers. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the sample. The first stage was a simple random technique to select three Local Government Areas from six Local Government Areas in the District. Proportionate sampling technique was used to select 24 secondary schools from the three Local Government Areas selected. The last stage in-volved using proportionate stratified random sampling to select a total of 360 teachers. Data for the study were collected using questionnaire tagged Teachers Shills in Identifying Students' Talents Questionnaire (TSITQ). Data collected were analysed using frequency count and simple percentages. The results showed that the predominant skill used by teachers in identifying students' talents were Guidance and Counselling, Motivation, Creative teaching and Pedagogical. It was found out that motivational strategy (in form of gifts, prizes and scholarship) was predominantly used by teachers in managing students' talents followed by independent study, creative teaching and pro-gramme planning. Based on the findings of the study it was therefore recommended that teachers should improve on their strategies such as independent study, creative <b>teaching,</b> <b>individualised</b> instructions and programme planning in managing secondary school students' talents...|$|R

The aim of the course is to introduce and allow tutors to practice the pedagogic skills relevant to encounters with students engaged in independent and <b>individualised</b> modes of <b>teaching</b> and learning such as assignments, projects, contract learning, practical work and research. The study is firmly grounded in principles reviews of staff development, theories derived from thorough of instruction, and microencounter theory and techniques. In exploring this novel area of study, the new generic term, microtutoring, is defined. The research approach is firmly based in the descriptive, case study, course evaluation tradition with some experimental research integrated within the overall design. A detailed description is given of the development of observable skills and the design of instruments for their detection and measurement. The clustering of skills into the meaningful and highly relevant dimensions of structure, directness, centredness, control, cognitive level and appropriateness is described. A full account is given of the formative evaluation of the course and the data and results derived from summative evaluation are processed and discussed. Further development and research in relation to both course and skills is identified and prioritised. Experimental results suggest {{that it is possible to}} cause significant changes to the tutorial skills, dimensions and style of a tutor in a predetermined direction.

In this article, Gill Golder, teaching and research fellow (physical education), Brahm Norwich, Professor of Educational Psychology and Special Educational Needs, and Phil Bayliss, senior lecturer in special educational needs and education studies, all based in the School of Education and Lifelong Learning at the University of Exeter, describe developments in Exeter's secondary phase Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) programme. The authors set their account in the context of policy requirements in England and international trends towards more inclusive teacher education. They report on an initiative designed to enhance the knowledge, skills and attitudes of trainee teachers and to equip them to differentiate their teaching to meet the individual needs of all pupils, including those with special educational needs. This initiative involved all trainees working intensively with one pupil, supported by the SENCo in their teaching practice school.

40|$|This {{field study}} {{attempts}} to analyse {{the development of}} an integrated humanities programme at a recently built open space high school in the A. C. T. during {{the first three years of}} its existence. The school opened shortly after the beginning of the A. C. T. Educational System and the staff were imbued with the idealism and innovative climate that prevailed at this time. There was an absence of system constraint that co-incided with the political proclamation of school based curriculum development. This field study is the story of what can happen when a staff is plunged into the deep end of innovation without the necessary support systems. Nevertheless some of the innovations have stabilised, with some promise of permanency, during these first three years. Open View began with a radical curriculum from the beginning: i) a child centred curriculum ii) vertically integrated teaching groups iii) non-streaming of students iv) open access curriculum v) an <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> programme vi) little traditional class group teaching vii) staff participation in decision making viii) a mini-school structure based on a strong pastoral system ix) non competitive continuous assessment x) a large degree of subject integration All of these innovations can be viewed in the humanities programme. A controversial programme such as humanities has had a radical effect upon the rest of the school. Hence in tracing the development of the humanities programme, the field study indirectly traces the development of the total school. The innovation that has particular relevance to educationalists is the development of the mini-school structure and the combination of the pastoral and the academic through the teaching teams of the minischools. The principal theme of this field study is the effect that the mini-school and subject integration has had on traditional roles such as that of the subject seniors and the assistant principals...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{began with}} the study of teachers' written comments on pupils' written work in an English teaching context. There were several reasons for {{the selection of the}} written comment as the subject of an investigation: first, the comment communicates the teacher's response to the pupil's work, and as such it offers a potential source of information to the pupil of relevance to his learning. In addition, written comments, as a form of <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> on an informal day-to-day basis, seem likely to represent {{a significant portion of the}} total feedback received by any one pupil in relation to his individual performance. Third, to date, teachers' comments have not figured to any real extent as an area of research. Where they have, they have tended to be part of a wider study which did not involve the conceptualisation of comments as providing instructive information of value to the learner. For all of these reasons, an investigation of the character and possible contribution of the written comment to pupil learning seemed a potentially worthwhile area for research. Hence, the written comment is the focus of the first part of this study. Though the work {{began with the}} written comment, in time the questions emerging from the initial investigation suggested the value of extending the field to include a detailed study of the relationship between the classroom context and the written comment; and, more significantly as it turned out, of the oral comment as instructive feedback to the learner. Oral comments, therefore, are the subject of the second part. In the third section, the main questions arising from the oral comment data are examined. This meant in fact consideration of some teachers' images of the aspect of their teaching which most features the oral comment. In summary, the three parts of the study are: 1) an investigation of written comments; 2) an investigation of oral comments; 3) a report of teachers' accounts of one major aspect of their teaching...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{international}} interest in involving patients in interventions {{to promote and}} support them in securing their own safety. This paper reports a systematic review of evaluations {{of the effectiveness of}} interventions that have been used with the explicit intention of promoting patient involvement in patient safety in healthcare. Methods: The authors searched Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, HMIC, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, PsycINFO and ASSIA to August 2008. We also searched databases of reports, conference proceedings, grey literature, ongoing research and relevant patient safety organisations, and hand-searched two journals. Meta-analysis of the data was not appropriate; therefore, studies were categorised according to how the interventions encouraged patients' actions to improve safety-informing the management plan, monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment (by health professional and by self), making systems safer-and were critiqued in a narrative manner. Findings: The authors identified 14 individual experimental and quasiexperimental studies plus one systematic review. The majority of studies fell into the monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self category and were all related to enhancing medication safety. Authors reported improved patient safety incident outcomes for the intervention groups compared with controls where the interventions aimed to encourage patient involvement in: (1) monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self (self-management of anticoagulation, 'easy' read information leaflet, nurse-led education to promote self-medication in hospital, patient package insert using lay terminology); (2) informing the management plan/monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self (<b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> plan by nurse, pharmacist counselling). It was not possible to draw any clear conclusions as to the effectiveness of the interventions (with the exception of one specific aspect of self-medication, that is, self-management of anticoagulation) due to concerns about the methodological quality of the studies. Conclusions: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote patient involvement on patient safety incidents and in general is poor quality. Existing evidence is confined to the promotion of safe self-management of medication, most notably relating to the self-management of oral anticoagulants...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to investigate, through the {{narratives}} of ex-perienced teachers, insights and strategies in the teaching of history in upper secondary school. Based on a flexible grounded theory, life history and theories of pedagogical content knowledge, seven experienced history teachers have been interviewed about their conceptions of history teaching. Development of insights into history teaching and the formation of knowledge can be described as involving both a refinement of practice and more revolutionary turning points. These insights emphasize that good knowledge of the subject is central for legitimacy and creativity. History teaching in Sweden is described as increasingly international and contem-porary, and focussed on students’ learning from various points of view. Varied teaching is stressed with the teacher in centre and also being able to take the role of arranger. Of importance is also the handling of teaching in history as a foundation course as well as an advanced or specialized course. Influences from other subjects have had a diverse impact {{at the same time as}} personal interests and experiences, as well as external influences, have been important for the development of strategies. History teachers’ teaching strategies may be described in terms of 1) multiperspectivity, where different points of view and interpretations of history are central; 2) narrative history, where through both major and minor stories, a chronological structure and animation of the subject of history are strived after; 3) social scientific history, which uses history to explain contemporary society through making comparisons and seeking general patterns; and 4) an eclectic strategy, which strives after varieties of an <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> of history by allowing students to make their ways into history in diverse ways. The experienced history teachers’ narratives make evident how the subject of history can be transformed, they demonstrate different conceivable ways of teaching history and reveal its complexity. The teachers’ narratives show how, through their strategies in interaction with their insights in history teaching, they have created an overview and structure in the complex reality of teaching history. The teachers’ insights and strategies constitute a practice based contribution to a more experience informed practice and research on the teaching of history...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this degree thesis is to {{investigate}} what the English teachers in an upper sec-ondary school, think about teaching students in ability grouped classrooms. The questions that I have set out to investigate include what the teachers think about ability grouping in English, the school’s current organisation of ability groups, {{the pros and cons}} of ability grouping in English, differentiation in teaching and if students get more individualized teaching with abil-ity groups, how the teachers cooperate and what would be the optimal teaching situation in an English learning classroom. I did a lot of theoretical research on the subject and studied old essays on similar subjects. I also did some classroom observations to use as background information for my interviews. I interviewed five teachers of different sex, age, and teaching experience. The teachers clearly had different views on {{the pros and cons of}} ability grouping and how to deal with the stu-dents’ different levels of English. They all agreed on the advantages it creates for the teachers, the main advantages being the small groups and the students being on almost the same level. They also agreed on the difficulty of <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching,</b> even with ability groups. Most of them also agreed that the main problem with ability grouping is how to deal with the weak-est or most basic level. It’s important that they have good pedagogical teachers who want to teach them and know how to. It also leads to problems amongst the teachers, in deciding who should or wants to teach which group and how to teach on a certain level. The teachers all had different ideas on how to improve the organisation of English teaching, from small mixed groups or only two ability levels, to a rotation of teachers between the groups and the different areas of English. In conclusion, upper secondary students are used to different groups, since they have chosen not only schools, but programs and individual courses. If the goal is small groups in English, maybe ability grouping is a possible solution. But above all, it has to be a possibility for the students, not the teachers...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech(Education)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 When a child enters formal {{education}} {{a certain level}} of development and experience is expected. If there is a language deficit or shortfall upon entering formal schooling, a negative perception of schooling can develop, resulting in a low level of success in the classroom. Research has clearly shown that learners with a hearing deficit, and who received very little stimulation at an early age, tended to develop a language deficit which hampered their entrance into, as well as their performance in mainstream education. The ideal is thus that a child should experience success in the learning process at the earliest possible stage. Hereupon he can develop and realise his full potential as a human being. Children who experience early success should be more capable of coping with the challenges that schooling and learning present. If these learners receive early intervention to support their language development it could lead to being more successful in mainstream education. Learners with a cochlear implant must receive intensive hearing and communicative training. They are taught how to effectively interpret the sound relayed by the implant, and thereafter, if possible, be able to use this "hearing ability" to enter into interactive spoken language. Motivation and support from parents, family and friends is a determining factor in the successful use of the implant. This should lead to a learner being able to reach his full potential. From the research conducted it has become evident that the language deficit retrogression of the child leads to under-achievement when formal schooling begins. This is because of different hearing difficulties. However, if such a pre-school child is assisted and supported at an early stage through effective intervention strategies, language deficit can be decreased or even completely cured. In this study a learner who had received a cochlear implant, was closely observed. A significant improvement in his language ability was evinced. The action research study was an <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning situation with a learner who had a cochlear implant and with a language deficit. Over a period of 19 months different intervention strategies were used to improve the learner's language ability. The intervention strategies which were successful {{can be used as a}} possible point of departure for further research and study to give educators and parents a better insight into this problem. Through intensive research these findings can be developed as a possible support system or methodolgy for educators in the inclusive classroom...|$|E

A considerable body of literature in gifted education considered the quality of teachers’ classroom practices in regular classrooms. The purpose of this mixed methods {{study was to investigate}} the knowledge, beliefs, and competencies that characterise teachers’ classroom practices with gifted students in regular classrooms in Saudi Arabia. The study used multiple data sources, including quantitative data collected via the Classroom Practices Questionnaire (CPQ) (Archambault, Dobyans, Slavin, 2 ̆ 6 Westberg, 1993) from 351 male and female teachers of gifted students in Saudi school, follow up qualitative data collected via semi-structured interviews with ten of the teacher supervisors and two exemplary teachers of gifted students. Quantitative results showed that development of writing skills, acceleration, modifying the curriculum, developing reading skills and grouping were less frequently used with gifted and average students, while the use of discussion and questioning was used frequently with gifted and average students. For all six categories included in the questionnaire, the means of the application of classroom practices were higher for gifted students than for average students. The results of demographic data showed no statistically significant differences between the responses of the teachers regarding their classroom practices with gifted students according to their years of teaching, highest degree earned, employment status, or grade level currently teaching. The demographic data also showed that female teachers and teachers who participated in a workshop or seminar on questioning and discussion were more likely to implement this classroom practice with their gifted students compare to male teachers and teachers without training. The qualitative results revealed {{that the majority of the}} teachers in Saudi regular classrooms are not applying adequate, effective classroom practices for gifted students. The results indicated a lack of special planning for the gifted, unavailability of enrichment, inconsistent and irregular grouping practices, complete lack of acceleration strategies, inability of teachers to modify the regular curriculum and use advanced methods and instruction strategies. The interviews with exemplary teachers showed they had made some successful attempts to instruct their gifted students in the regular classroom, especially by adding specific tasks and activities for gifted students in their weekly plan, providing home enrichment activities, and using computers and scientific films. These teachers also indicated that they have used <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> and asked gifted students about their interests. In conclusion, the quantitative and qualitative findings of current study give a general impression that the knowledge, beliefs, and classroom practices of teachers of gifted students in Saudi classrooms are not particularly effective and successful in meeting the needs of gifted students in regular classrooms. Moreover, the results of the current study and previous studies reaffirms the importance of reconsidering the training programs for in-service and pre-service teachers of gifted students as well as re-evaluating and reformulating selection criteria of teachers of gifted students in Saudi schools...|$|E

Bavio se problemom razvoja nastavnih inovacija između kumulativnog kontinuiteta i revolucionarnog diskontinuiteta. Istraživanje je proveo na relevantnim izvorima, građi i literaturi u postupku kritičke analize pedagoške dokumentacije. Analiza je ukazala da se kod nastavnih inovacija prepoznaju različiti modeli: kumulativnog kontinuiteta, cikličkog karaktera nastavnih inovacija, revolucionarnog diskontinuiteta i kumulativnog regresivnog kontinuiteta. U kumulativnom kontinuitetu nastavna se inovacija u dužem vremenskom periodu pa čak i u različitim paradigmama nadograđuje, bogati, anakrono izostavlja, ali je početna izvorna nastavna inovacija prepoznatljiva. Kao primjer kumulativne kontinuirane nastavne inovacije navodi se individualna i individualizirana nastava. Neke nastavne inovacije obnavljaju se svakih desetak godina pod istim ili različitim nazivima. Često novi početci ne priznaju ili ne uvažavaju već dostignuti nivo kako bi „nova inovacija“ izgledala što originalnijom. Ovaj model nastavnih inovacija moguće je imenovati kao ciklički karakter. Ciklički karakter nastavnih inovacija prepoznatljiv je na primjeru obrazovanja usmjerenog prema učenicima. Dio nastavnih inovacija javlja se kao apsolutna suprotnost, kao antiteza postojećeg stanja i tada je moguće govoriti o revolucionarnom diskontinuitetu. Primjer revolucionarnog diskontinuiteta navodi se za odnos stare i nove škole i njihovih nastava. Posebna je pažnja posvećena modelu kumulativnog regresivnog kontinuiteta. U ovom modelu primjetljiva je regresivna tendencija. Što se na nekom problemu više radi, on ne samo da se ne rješava i poboljšava nego je prisutna stalna nepoželjna tendencija. Ilustrativan je primjer kumulativnog regresivnog kontinuiteta fenomen preopterećenosti učenika. The {{author has}} {{researched}} the educational innovations {{in the historical}} context of compulsory schooling in Croatia. He dealt {{with the issue of}} the development of educational innovation between cumulative continuity and revolutionary discontinuity. The study was carried out with relevant sources, materials and literature in the process of critical analysis of pedagogical documentation. The analysis has shown {{that in the case of}} educational innovation several models could be recognised: the cumulative continuity model, cyclical nature of teaching innovation, the revolutionary discontinuity model and the cumulative regressive continuity model. In the cumulative continuity model, educational innovation is being built up, enriched or left out over a longer period of time, or even in different paradigms, but the original innovation remains distinctive. An example of such innovation can be found in case of individual work and <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching.</b> Some innovations are being re‐established every several years (mostly around ten) under the same or a different name. It is often the case that new beginnings do not admit or appreciate the previously reached level so that the “new innovation” would seem more original than it actually is. Such model can be called the cyclical characteristic. The cyclical feature of educational innovation is evident when we speak of student‐directed teaching. Some innovations appear to be the exact contrast, they serve as the antithesis of the current situation, and then it is possible to speak of a revolutionary discontinuity. For instance, the relationship between the old school and the new school teaching philosophy. Special attention was paid to the model of cumulative regressive continuity. In this model, a regressive tendency is noticeable. The more a certain issue is being dealt with, the worse the situation becomes. Not only that it is not solved but it also has a negative tendency, which is the case with the phenomenon of student overload. Der Autor hat die pädagogischen Innovationen im historischen Kontext der allgemeinen Schulpflicht in Kroatien erforscht. Er befasste sich mit dem Problem der Entwicklung von Innovationen im Bildungsbereich zwischen kumulativer Kontinuität und revolutionärer Diskontinuität. Die Studie wurde auf relevanten Quellen, Materialien und Literatur mit dem Verfahren der kritischen Analyse der pädagogischen Dokumentation durchgeführt. Die Analyse zeigt, dass bei Innovationen im Bildungsbereich verschiedene Modelle erkannt werden: Modell der kumulativen Kontinuität, des zyklischen Charakters von Innovationen im Bildungsbereich, der revolutionären Diskontinuität und der kumulativen regressiven Kontinuität. Bei der kumulativen Kontinuität wird die Innovation im Unterricht auf lange Sicht, auch in unterschiedlichen Paradigmen erweitert,bereichert, anachronistisch ausgelassen, aber die anfängliche ursprüngliche Innovation bleibt erkennbar. Als Beispiel für die kumulative kontinuierliche Innovation im Unterricht wird der individuelle und individualisierte Unterricht genannt. Einige Innovation im Bildungsbereich werden alle zehn Jahre unter den gleichen oder anderen Namen erneuert. Oft respektieren oder erkennen die neuen Anfänge das bereits bestehende Niveau nicht an, um als "neue Innovation" origineller zu erscheinen. Dieses Modell der Bildungsinnovation kann als zyklischer Charakter genannt werden. Die zyklische Natur der Unterrichtsinnovation ist am Beispiel des schülerorientierten Unterrichts erkennbar. Ein Teil der Innovation erscheint als absolutes Gegenteil, als Antithese der gegenwärtigen Situation, und dann ist es möglich, von revolutionärer Diskontinuität zu sprechen. Als ein Beispiel für eine revolutionäre Diskontinuität wird das Verhältnis der alten und neuen Schule und ihres Unterrichts angegeben. Besondere Aufmerksamkeit galt dem Modell der kumulativen regressiven Kontinuität. In diesem Modell ist die regressive Tendenz bemerkbar. Je mehr an einem Problem gearbeitet wird, wird er nicht nur nicht gelöst oder verbessert, sondern es ist auch eine anhaltende unerwünschte Tendenz vorhanden. Ein anschauliches Beispiel für die kumulative regressive Kontinuität ist das Phänomen der Überlastung der Schüler...|$|E
40|$|Proefskrif [...] PU vir CHO, 1974 I. A CONCEPT FORMULATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATION In the Christian {{school the}} teacher {{acts as a}} {{substitute}} for the natural parent of the child during school hours. With the parent he is co-responsible before God for the spiritual welfare of each child, although the parent can never get away from his baptismal vow. Substitute parentship gained new significance with the introduction of tutor teaching in Transvaal schools in 1963. Tutor teaching was introduced as the most important component in differentiated education. It supposes scientific individualised education where each child is observed as a person with particular needs, talents and gifts. In a changing world with its many pot-holes, misrepresentations, double standards, etc., not only the child but also the parent seeks solid values and norms. It appears that material prosperity resulted into selfishness and laziness of many people. The responsibility for the education of their children is easily shifted on to others, while mental achievements at the cost of level-headedness are seemingly •the most important aim of many parents. Under these circumstances tutor teaching is becoming more significant. In the primary school where the child receives his primary education, it is essential that each child is known as a whole so that both his possibilities and his limitations can be identified as early as possible, and that immediate attention can be given to them. But tutor education also demands meaningful and scientific conferences with the natural parents, so that parents can be enlightened and informed about their child on the one hand, but also to direct many parents on the other hand. The aim of this investigation is besides establishing the value and place of tutor teaching in the Afrikaans medium primary school in Transvaal, also to determine whether the system of tutor teaching can be used as an aid in national education and national exaltation, and to indicate direction in the light of findings. In this investigation the historical, empirical and questionnaire methods of scientific research have been used. B. HISTORICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL TEACHING AND THE GUIDANCE OF THE TUTOR AND GUIDANCE BY THE TRANSVAAL EDUCATION PLACEMENT OF TUTOR PROGRAMME (INTEGRATION SYSTEM) AS PRESCRIBED DEPARTMENT Since the earliest times parents were responsible for the education of their children. With the progress through the years this task became too comprehensive and schools became necessary to assist parents in the teaching of their children. Parents were not exempted from their educational and teaching responsibility as regards their children, but their task was only supplemented by the school. In the Transvaal the teacher has always acted as supplementary parent of the child during school hours. Supplementary parentship means to be guardian of the child. Guardian or tutor teaching is a natural consequence of supplementary parentship and stresses the necessity of <b>individualised</b> <b>teaching</b> and education. The Transvaal Education Department introduced the system of tutor teaching in 1963. Underlying the success of the whole system, the accent is put on the relationship of confidence that should exist between guardian teacher and child, observation of the child W 1 der all circumstances and the necessity to guide and inform the child in respect of all his needs. To know the child as a person who has specific needs, knowledge of his home background is indispensable. Without this knowledge true education is impossible. In the primary school the classroom teacher is also tutor teacher. Without doubt tutor education has tremendous possibilities, but {{the way in which the}} system has been implemented in the primary school, gives the impression that it is not really considered important. This impression is confirmed by the fact that instructions in regard to tutor teaching to headmasters of primary schools and rectors of colleges of education, have initially been vague, that even today colleges pay little, if ru 1 y, attention to theory and practice of tutor teaching and that it has never been the subject of a headmasters' symposium or an orientation course. It was simply expected of headmasters to implement tutor teaching and the guidance programme later on without thorough enlightenment. In addition it was left to head= masters themselves to decide whether time should be allocated for tutor periods, whether individual records should be kept for the children and whether house-calls by tutors should be done. PRESENT CULTURAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SETUP AND VIEWS AND THE NECESSITY FOR NATIONAL EDUCATION The highest calling as regards their children is for the normal Afrikander parent with a Christian-national outlook, to lead them by example and attitude towards God. Coupled herewith the parent will strive to see that his children are well-adapted and useful citizens of their country, and that they should render a life of service in their particular cultural pattern. Such a parent may justly expect that the Christian-national school should assist him in his task. The Afrikaans speaking citizen differs from the English speaking citizen in outlook in their respective cultural patterns. In this chapter certain shortcomings in the Afrikander's Christian-national way of life are pointed out, of which the Christian-religious need is most important. From this need flows forth the alarming number of divorces which leaves ten thousands of children without a father, a mother or a home, in a heartless world. Permissiveness amongst adults takes on bigger dimensions which is also notable in the seemingly approval of pornography. Due to the "missing” father as the person with authority ru 1 d the mother who has to fill this additional role, there is a negative educational environment in many homes. Children may become emotionally unbalanced, may revolt against authority and may take their refuge to drugs. It appears that adults do not offer the youth ample challenges, which are characteristic of the many children who leave school at an early age. People become more egoistic and human relationships, not only between White and White, but also between White, Black and Coloured, seem to be poor. Where the Afrikander's biggest need is of a religious nature, it appears that the solution lies in the revaluation of the family and its values. The family which is the back bone of a nation, has been discussed for many years, but nothing has been done on large-scale in an organised manner, to guide parents. Against this background and need, the tutor teacher must fulfil his vocation as national educator. He can rely on the assistance of the orthodox parent, but the majority of parents appear to shift their responsibilities on to the teacher, and expect aid and enlightenment from him. For the survival, not only of the Afrikander, but also for that of the entire White population and the other population groups in S. A., it is imperative to start with national education on a comprehensive scale. National education has already been done in countries like America, Canada and Holland. In S. A. tutor teaching can be used as a powerful and efficient instrument in national ennoblement, if the Christian school realises its vocation and if teachers are adequately equipped for their task. Guardians - parents and teachers - should then communicate with each other on a Christian-national basis. D. TUTOR TEACHING IN THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHILD AND THE GUARDIAN At present the responsibilities of the tutor teacher are exceedingly great and of eternal value. For the teacher, however, it is difficult to fulfil his Christian educational task and indicate direction, because circumstances which could have been eliminated are against him. On the one hand there are parents who expect Christian-national education from the school, but on the other hand, although legislation makes provision for Christian and national education, the same parents have a fatalistic inclination in that they do not demand that Christian-national education is put into practice. Teacher training takes place in a spirit of neutrality without a thorough knowledge of the Christian-Protestant matrimonial and baptismal formulary, the Heidelberg catechism and concordances. Most of the headmasters do not regard the Christian foundation of education and teaching as of fundamental and foremost importance. It appears therefore that not much positive motivation from headmasters to their staff can be expected. It is an extreme pity, even fatal, because true education takes place in the classroom. In a time where the school and its tutors should give true and purposeful guidance to child and parent, one gets the impression that the school gives a little religious instruction, cultivates a little culture, moralises a bit and does a lot of scholastic and sports "training". All these are done with or without the co-operation of parents. Furthermore, it appears as if all the controlling is focused on subject methods and scholastic progress. In defence of the practical positive Christian headmaster can be alleged that he is overburdened with administrative and other duties and cannot therefore pay sufficient attention to tutor education. The result is that his staff may also be unmotivated in respect of the Christian-national aims and they are simply teachers who teach. The family has particular problems due to the "missing" father figure and the mother who in many instances has to fulfil the double burden of bread-winner and educator of the children. The school must realise these conditions because in many cases permissiveness, as well as problems of order and discipline arise from them. Teachers are inclined to meet out uniform punishment for infringements without thorough investigation of the reasons for the infringements and without eliminating those causes. The tutor should also ascertain by means of investigation. what the attitudes and inclinations of parents are in different environments. By doing this he will have a better conception of the child, because the child is a product of his family and environment. By showing real interest in a child, the teacher can where necessary influence parents positively by means of discussions. Tutor teaching and individual teaching con only have meaning when the tutor observes each child in a purposeful, systematic and objective manner in respect of every facet of the child's life. He cannot educate in mass, only individually. To do this, he should put in writing his own observations of the child, as well as all other available information. Some of the most important information can only be obtained from the parents by means of house-call or parent-teacher conferences. E. PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES AS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO TUTOR TEACHING The parent and the teacher are the two biggest allies in the education of the child. Both parent and teacher observe the child. The parent knows his child from birth and this intimate knowledge is very valuable to the tutor. Without conferences, this knowledge is lost to the tutor, to the detriment of the child. Through discussions the teacher gains larger insight of the child and also of the parents' attitudes towards education and teaching, religion, culture, ideals, etc. By showing real interest in each child the parent gains confidence in the school and the parent can be influenced to change detrimental or negative attitudes. Where these attitudes cannot be modified, it may still be possible for the parent to change his attitude towards his child for the good of the child. In this chapter the different kinds of conferences and the approaches, the feelings of children, parents and teachers towards one another - and the records that should be kept, are discussed in detail. Conferences, especially where house-call is unpractical or impossible, are indispensable in tutor teaching. Especially in the Christian school, parent-teacher conferences should form an integral part of the school programme even during school hours. Conferences should not be merely incidental that could be neglected at random. On the contrary, conferences are essential because the school claims that it educates as an individual the entire child. Unfortunately there is no proof that student teachers have any training in the technique of discussions with parents. F. TUTOR TEACHING (GUIDANCE) AS IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE AFRIKAANS MEDIUM PRIMARY SCHOOL IN TRANSVAAL The information as included in 273 questionnaires has been tabulated. The majority of headmasters from whom responses have been received, are headmasters of PI, PII, and PIII schools, viz. 252 while 21 are headmasters of PIV schools. As regards qualifications 61, 9 % of the headmasters have higher qualifications that the prescribed minimum requirements for their posts, 30, 8 % have post-graduate degrees, while 21, 6 % are busy with further study. More than 80 % of the headmasters are of the opinion that not only can tutor teaching be implemented in the primary school, but that it is in fact necessary. Nearly 94 % of the headmasters agree that children's home background must be known. The manner in which schools obtain this information, however, does not suggest that it is obtained scientifically or that data are reliable. The impression is that where information has been obtained, many schools rely on guess-work,. Only 15 % of the schools make provision for tutor periods on their time-tables, which vary from 10 to 90 minutes per week. More than 50 % of the schools keep records of the children. Although 96 % of the headmasters think that parent-teacher conferences are important and that conferences take place at an average of 2, 3 per year, there is no indication that individual conferences are conducted. Most of these conferences are of a social nature and consist of parent evenings and/ or displays. The average number of parents per school which is contacted per year in this manner is 62, 1 % while 55, 2 % of the parents with children who have scholastic or behaviour problems are reached. The majority of headmasters are not in favour of individual parent-teacher conferences during school hours. Only 7 of the 273 headmasters had tuition in tutor teaching inter alia by self-education. Although tutor teaching was started in 1963, only 88 (2, 2 %) of the 4 032 teachers at the 273 schools had tuition in tutor teaching. It could have simplified matters for headmasters if a larger number of teachers had had tuition in tutor teaching. Nearly 94 % of the headmasters are in favour of in-service-training of teachers in education which could also mean a category increment. It indicates the urgent need of teachers and the probable realization of their inability to cope with matters without thorough tuition in education. Most of the schools, viz. 69, 9 % have parent-teacher associations. It is an indication that parents participate in school activities. Headmasters could give in their responses their views on any aspect of tutor teaching. This indicated undeniably that most of them realise the importance of tutor teaching and that anxiety exists about the child and many parents. But above all they indicated the urgent need for clear guidance and enlightenment [...] This applies to guidance for teachers, parents and children, to an acceptable and standardised tutor record card and the time to be allotted for a tutor period in a full time-table. A reproduction of an experiment with parent-teacher conferences during school hours about progress reports is also given in this chapter. The experiment showed that this. type of conference is practical and that the child as well as the parent and teacher benefit from it. It also compels the tutor to give attention to the individual child and to report instructively about him. Questionnaires which were completed by parents and teachers, clearly showed that the child can only benefit when parents and teacher communicate. It, however, demands meaningful and purposeful guidance and motivation of teachers. Via these conferences on progress reports, group conferences can be initiated where parents and teachers can discuss current educational problems. The headmaster should, however, always take the initiative and lead. With the new guidance programme and the necessity of sports and group tutors, the probability of a so-called teachers workshop has been investigated. During these meetings the headmaster and vice-principals, as well as the group tutors discuss problems which emerge from parent-teacher conferences, as well as the needs and problems of the children in general and individually. This is the opportunity where the "top management" of the school can be motivated about all the aims of the Christian-national school, which can have effect with the other teachers. In respect of extramural activities, it has been proved that all the pupils of a school can partake in cultural and sport activities by means of sport and culture periods. A tutor record card is also shown in this chapter. Some of the particulars are obtained from Ed. Lab. cards, while most of the information is derived from intensive observation of the child by the tutor. Where house-call is impossible, the necessary background information of a child can be obtained by means of written questions to parents and by individual conferences. G. TEACHER TRAINING AND OTHER MATTERS AND HOW THEY AFFECT TUTOR TEACHING AND THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL Legislation provides for Christian and national education in Transvaal schools. Teacher-training has a functional, educational and professional aim. It is doubtful whether college students are trained in the Christian-national way of life. Selection of candidates with regard to their way of life, evaluation by lecturer and headmaster and practical experience in tutor teaching and parent-teacher conferences during practise teaching are matters discussed in this chapter. It appears as if student, teacher and headmaster are not evaluated according to the example they set or to their attitude in regard to the implementation of the Christian and national educational policy. These are matters which closely correlate with tutor teaching because the tutor should carry out the Christian-national way of life. It is alleged that as soon as a large number of women become members of a profession which provides for both sexes, that profession tends to loose prestige in the eyes of the public. It is not implied that this is the case in primary education, but the large number of women makes it difficult for boys to identify themselves with men. Serious attention should be given to the shortage of men in the primary school. It is possible that potential men recruits might see the teaching profession as a woman's profession and as a result they don't feel attracted to the profession. As regards qualifications, more than 70 % of all teachers in Transvaal have 3 years and less training as teachers. Most of them are women. Because many married women have to serve the double role of housewife and teacher, they probably do not see their way open for additional study, to the detriment of education and teaching. It seems necessary that the authorities, because they previously found it in order for teachers to suffice with 2 and 3 years training, should provide courses for these teachers to improve their qualifications. From this investigation it was clear that a course in Christian education whereby all the aims of Christian-national education, tutor teaching, parent-teacher conferences, etc. should be implemented and started. There is a serious need for such a course. II. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS A number of deductions are made and recommendations are put forth. III. MATTERS THAT REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION A list of problems encountered in this investigation finalises this chapter. Doctora...|$|E
