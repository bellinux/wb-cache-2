The virus circulates among rodents and vector mosquitoes and sometimes infects humans, causing a febrile illness with occasional neurological manifestations. The virus is named after the Everglades, a region of subtropical wetlands in southern Florida. The virus is endemic to the U.S. state of Florida, where its geographic range mirrors that of the mosquito species Culex cedecei.

EVEV circulates near metropolitan Miami, {{which indicates the}} potential for substantial human disease, should outbreaks arise. We characterized EVEV infection of cotton rats in South Florida, USA to validate their role in enzootic transmission. To evaluate whether the viremia induced in cotton rat populations regulates EVEV distribution, we also infected rats from a non–EVEV-endemic area. Viremia levels developed in rats from both localities that exceeded the threshold for infection of the vector. Most animals survived infection with no signs of illness, despite virus invasion {{of the brain and}} the development of mild encephalitis. Understanding the mechanisms by which EVEV-infected cotton rats resist clinical disease may be useful in developing VEE therapeutics for equines and humans. <b>Everglades</b> <b>virus</b> (EVEV; Togaviridae: Alphavirus) circulates among rodents and vector mosquitoes in South Florida and can tangentially infect humans, causing a febrile disease with occasional neurologic signs. The most closely related Venezuelan {{equine encephalitis}} (VEE) complex viruses, enzootic subtype ID strains, are the progenitors of subtype IAB and IC strains responsible for major epidemics and epizootics (1).

40|$|<b>Everglades</b> <b>virus</b> (EVEV), an alphavirus in the Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} complex, circulates among rodents and vector mosquitoes in Florida and occasionally infects humans. It causes febrile disease, sometimes accompanied by neurologic manifestations. Although previous surveys showed high seroprevalence in humans, EVEV infections may be underdiagnosed because {{the disease is}} not severe enough to warrant a clinic visit or the undifferentiated presentations complicate diagnosis. Documented EVEV activity, as recent as 1993, was limited to south Florida. Using dogs as sentinels, a serosurvey was conducted to evaluate whether EVEV circulated recently in Florida and whether EVEV’s spatial distribution parallels that of the mosquito vector, Culex cedecei. Four percent of dog sera contained neutralizing EVEV antibodies, and many seropositive animals lived farther north than both recorded EVEV activity and the principal vector. These results indicate that EVEV is widespread in Florida and may be an important, unrecognized cause of human illness. <b>Everglades</b> <b>virus</b> (EVEV), a mosquitoborne Venezuelan {{equine encephalitis}} (VEE) complex alphavirus (Togaviridae; Alphavirus), circulates continuously in enzootic foci in Florida.

Human EVEV serosurveys in the 1960 s and 1970 s indicated that people in south Florida were frequently exposed to EVEV.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Everglades</b> <b>virus</b> (EVEV), an alphavirus in the Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} (VEE) complex, is a mosquito-borne human pathogen endemic to South Florida. Field isolations of EVEV from Culex (Melanoconion) cedecei and laboratory susceptibility experiments established this species as its primary vector. However, isolates of EVEV from Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus and Culex nigripalpus, more abundant and widespread species in South Florida, {{suggested that they}} also transmit EVEV and could infect many people. We performed susceptibility experi-ments with F 1 generation Oc. taeniorhynchus and Cx. nigripalpus to evaluate their permissiveness to EVEV infection. In contrast to {{the high degree of}} susceptibility of Cx. (Mel.) cedecei, Oc. taeniorhynchus and Cx. nigripalpus were relatively refractory to oral EVEV infection, indicating that they are probably not important vectors. Identification of vectors involved in enzootic EVEV transmission will assist in understanding potential changes in vector use that could accompany the emergence of epizootic or epidemic EVEV...|$|E
