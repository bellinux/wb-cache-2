It was used in 17th-century French lace making, crochetage designating a stitch used to join separate pieces of lace, and crochet subsequently designating both a specific type of fabric and the <b>hooked</b> <b>needle</b> used to produce it. Although the fabric is not known to be crochet in the present sense, a genealogical relationship between the techniques sharing that name appears likely.|$|E

6000|$|Milly had for {{the third}} time her air of consideration; but she came back with it to her plea of some minutes before. [...] "I'll tell you at supper--good-bye till then." [...] And she left the room with a {{lightness}} that testified for her companion to something that again particularly pleased her in the renewed promise of motion. The odd passage just concluded, Mrs. Stringham mused as she once more sat alone with a <b>hooked</b> <b>needle</b> and a ball of silk, the [...] "fine" [...] work with which she was always provided--this mystifying mood had simply been precipitated, no doubt, by their prolonged halt, with which the girl hadn't really been in sympathy. One had only to admit that her complaint was in fact but the excess of the joy of life, and everything did then fit. She couldn't stop for the joy, but she could go on for it, and with the sense of going on she floated again, was restored to her great spaces. There was no evasion of any truth--so at least Susan Shepherd hoped--in one's sitting there while the twilight deepened and feeling still more finely that the position of this young lady was magnificent. The evening at that height had naturally turned to cold, and the travellers had bespoken a fire with their meal; the great Alpine road asserted its brave presence through the small panes of the low, clean windows, with incidents at the inn-door, the yellow diligence, the great waggons, the hurrying, hooded, private conveyances, reminders, for our fanciful friend, of old stories, old pictures, historic flights, escapes, pursuits, things that had happened, things indeed that by a sort of strange congruity helped her to read the meanings of the greatest interest into the relation in which she was now so deeply involved. It was natural that this record of the magnificence of her companion's position should strike her as, after all, the best meaning she could extract; for she herself was seated in the magnificence as in a court-carriage--she came back to that, and such a method of progression, such a view from crimson cushions, would evidently have a great deal more to give. By the time the candles were lighted for supper and the short, white curtains were drawn, Milly had reappeared, and the little scenic room had then all its romance. That charm moreover was far from broken by the words in which she, without further loss of time, satisfied her patient mate. [...] "I want to go straight to London." ...|$|E

50|$|Macramé is {{the ancient}} art form of {{knotting}} many different geometric patterns together {{without the use}} of <b>hooks,</b> <b>needles,</b> or hoops. This knotting can be used to not only make jewelry, but decorative coverings and wall hangings as well. Materials used for this include natural fibers such as cotton, jute, sisal, linen, and hemp which all come from plants and herbs and synthetic cords such as yarn, rayon, rattail, and nylon. Finally, they are processed into strands in which the fibers lay parallel to each other.|$|R
5000|$|Chain cast-on : Uses a {{crochet hook}} or two {{knitting}} needles. To execute, hold a knitting needle in {{left hand and}} crochet hook or second knitting needle in right hand. Make a slip-knot in yarn {{and put it on}} the crochet <b>hook</b> or right-hand <b>needle.</b> Wrap the yarn from the back of the left-hand needle and over to the front, over the crochet <b>hook</b> or right <b>needle,</b> pass the slip-knot loop over the wrap, leaving the new loop on the crochet <b>hook</b> or right <b>needle.</b> Repeat, wrapping the yarn over the left-hand needle before passing it over the crochet <b>hook</b> or right <b>needle</b> to make a new loop, until you have one less stitch than required. Place the last loop on the left-hand needle as the first stitch that will be worked. This cast-on creates an edge that mimics a standard bind-off edge.|$|R

50|$|The bone was {{fashioned}} into {{tools such}} as spoons, knives, awls, pins, fish <b>hooks,</b> <b>needles,</b> flakers, hide scrapers and beamers. They made musical rasps, flutes and whistles as well as toys of bone. Decoratively carved articles were also made of bone such as hair combs, hair pins and pendants. Antler is much harder than bone and was used for flakers, points, knives and hair combs. Even the teeth and hooves {{did not go to}} waste. The teeth were drilled and used for decoration on clothing and necklaces. The hooves were also drilled and used for decoration on clothing as well as strung for rattles and bells.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of rebozos (shawls) energized the textile industry {{by the middle}} of the 20th century in Uriangato and Moroleón. Little by little people took to producing handmade artesanal sweaters, blouses and shirts woven with a <b>hook</b> <b>needle.</b> The 1960s saw Uriangato's first clothing factories. Many textiles produced in Uriangato were sold in other Mexican cities. Nevertheless, due to the great demand for Uriangato-made clothing, the first street market (tianguis) was installed by the 1980s. The tianguis characterizes Uriangato all over México and elsewhere. It has contributed greatly to the progress and improvement of Uriangatenses' quality of life. Nearly sixty-percent of Uriangatenses work in the clothing business.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of vibrotactile feedback in a needle-insertion task using a surgical robot. Four participants performed the task by hand (using a manual needle driver instrument) and by using a surgical robot, with or without vibrotactile feedback. The vibrotactile feedback signal indicated the deviation in force direction, with the signal amplitude modulated by the force magnitude. Visual feedback was always available in all experimental conditions. The participants ’ task was to insert a <b>hooked</b> <b>needle</b> into a simulated tissue pad at a premarked entrance point and drive {{it out of the}} tissue pad at a corresponding pre-marked exit point. The participants were instructed to hold the <b>hooked</b> <b>needle</b> in an orientation that minimized side-loading on the simulated tissue pad and prevented needle rotation in the needle driver. The forces exerted by the needle on the simulated tissue pad were recorded. The results indicated that the vibrotactile display was useful in reducing the overall force-direction deviation during the needle-insertion task, but it increased task completion time. It generally took twice as long to perform the task with the robot than with the hand. One participant who was experienced with the surgical robot consistently applied less force with the robot than with the hand. The vibrotactile feedback reduced the magnitude of the force component that was perpendicular to the suturing surface, but not the forces along the suturing surface. We compare our results to those reported in the literature and discuss the challenges we faced in assessing haptic feedback in a skilled surgical task such as the one used in the present study...|$|E

50|$|Growth was the {{dominant}} theme during the decade, engendering a more well-rounded and financially sound company. As the 1890s progressed, Excelsior Needle diversified {{into a number}} of new areas, including the manufacture of knitting machine latch needles and the manufacture of heavy <b>hook</b> <b>needles</b> used in the mass production of shoes and other leather goods. Excelsior Needle continued to diversify, forming a subsidiary named Torrington Swaging Company, to manufacture spokes for bicycle wheels. (This was in response to a new feature of the sewing machine industry that took shape during the 1890s: Sewing machine manufacturers, led by the Singer Company, had begun to manufacture bicycles in increasing numbers.)

2500|$|It was the {{development}} of the knitting machine that introduced <b>hooked</b> <b>needles</b> and enabled faultless, automated knitting. Most knitters probably aren’t even aware of the many processes that their fingers perform in the making of a single stitch. [...] However, large gauge needles emphasize those actions and knitting becomes increasingly more awkward when the needle diameter is greater than the width of the knitter's finger. [...] On a one-inch diameter (size 50) needle for instance, the shaft begins to taper one and three quarter inches from the tip. This means that the stitches are spread much further apart on mega knitting needles, making them more difficult to control. [...] The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers don’t have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important. [...] Turn the left (non-working) hook to face away at all times; turn the right (working) hook toward you up whilst knitting (plain stitch) and away whilst purling.|$|R

A bronze vessel has been found which is decorated with gold and silver. A gold foundry with about 3000 unpolished semi-precious stones has been found. Many tools used for polishing these stones and a furnace were found there. A burial site has been found with 11 skeletons, with their heads in the north direction. Near the heads of these skeletons, utensils for everyday use were kept. The three female skeletons have shell bangles on their left wrists. Near one female skeleton, a gold armlet has been found. In addition semi precious stones have been found lying near the head, suggesting that they were part of some sort of necklace.|$|R
25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} <b>needle</b> <b>hook</b> (tuck stitch). <b>Needles</b> can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping.
