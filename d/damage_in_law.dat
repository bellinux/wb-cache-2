This Article examines {{a set of}} metaphors currently doing <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> – those for legal research. It shows that while technology has radically altered the material world of legal research, our dominant metaphors have remained static, and thus, become outmoded. Conceptualizing today’s reality using old metaphors fails; it is like pouring new wine in old wineskins. To address this problem, this Article first surfaces unwarranted assumptions buried in the metaphors we use when talking about research and then proposes new metaphors to better serve theory and practice. It concludes by examining how this investigation into “finding law” implicates primary jurisprudential concepts of law...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} vindicatory damages should be {{available}} in the child welfare tort cases against public authorities. These are cases in which the plaintiffs sue public authorities either for not protecting them from harm when they were children, or where it is alleged that the authority’s employees abused the children while in its care. Vindicatory damages would be intended to mark the wrong to the plaintiff, rather than attempting to compensate the consequences. This thesis argues in support of the availability of a separate head of vindicatory <b>damages</b> <b>in</b> tort <b>law,</b> including negligence, and explores some of the liability issues which arise in these cases, including vicarious liability, liability for omissions and liability in negligence for the way in which a statutory power is exercised or for a breach of a statutory duty.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to give an {{analysis}} of liability for <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> the Czech labour law, viewed by the practise of the courts. The thesis is composed of seven chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of liability for <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> labour <b>law.</b> Chapter one is subdivided into two parts. Part one describes liability for <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> general and it's specifics and functions <b>in</b> labour <b>law.</b> Part two deals with how the Labour Code governs prevention of damage. Chapter two looks at binding nature of case-law <b>in</b> the civil <b>law</b> from {{a different point of}} view. Chapter three deals with all kinds of the liability of an employee. It is subdivided therefore into four parts. The first one that explores General liability of an employee, is divided into another six parts, each focused on one of the basic conditions of liability for <b>damage</b> <b>in</b> labour <b>law,</b> namely: employment relationship, breach of legal obligation, damage, causal connection, fault and performance of working tasks (together with following acts in direct connection with it).

40|$|Should {{there be}} pain-and-suffering <b>damages</b> <b>in</b> tort <b>law?</b> Most legal economists who {{wrote on the}} subject that {{there should not be}} pain-and-suffering <b>damages</b> <b>in</b> tort <b>law.</b> A {{minority}} of scholars thought the decision of whether tort law should provide pain-and-suffering damages is an empirical, or an experimental, question that cannot be armchair-theorized. Yet, all scholars who have done empirical or experimental work to explore the desirability of pain-and-suffering damages reached the conclusion that it is undesirable. In this paper I argue that the majority view cannot serve as a policy-making aid. I side with the minority of scholars who argue it is an empirical or experimental question. I then show why the empirical and experimental evidence provided by scholars who recognized the need for empirical or experimental studies cannot serve as a policy making aid for denying pain-and-suffering coverage <b>in</b> tort <b>law.</b> I then provide preliminary evidence that it may in fact be desirable to have pain-and-suffering <b>damages</b> <b>in</b> tort <b>law.</b> Specifically, I present three experimental studies I researched in order to study the demand for pain-and-suffering coverage. Most importantly, I was interested to know whether participants perceive any difference between monetary and non-monetary coverage. In my studies, participants faced four insurance decisions involving the purchase of four different types of products: padding for roller skates ($ 40), a portable saw ($ 100), computer monitor ($ 250), and tires for a car ($ 800). For each product, participants had to state the price they were willing to pay, above the price of the product, for monetary and for pain-and-suffering insurance. Before answering the questions, participants were told that they had no other rights whatsoever to a remedy for any loss as result of an accident besides the insurance coverage that they were about to buy. I then compared the demand for monetary coverage with the demand for pain-and-suffering coverage. My results in all studies show {{that the vast majority of}} the participants treated the two types of insurance the same, either buying them both or buying neither. Moreover, on average, in all studies the majority of participants (in the state of full information) treated both types of insurance exactly the same, namely, they paid exactly the same amount of money for both types of insurance. Of those who did not treat it the same, the vast majority preferred monetary to pain-and-suffering insurance...|$|R

50|$|Restitutio ad integrum or {{restitutio in integrum}} is a Latin term {{which means}} {{restoration}} to original condition.

The general rule, as the principle implies, is that the amount of compensation awarded should put the successful plaintiff in the position he or she would have been had the tortious action not been committed. Thus the plaintiff should clearly be awarded damages for direct expenses such as medical bills and property repairs and the loss of future earnings attributable to the injury (which often involves difficult speculation about the future career and promotion prospects).|$|R

40|$|The present article surveys {{various issues}} <b>in</b> the <b>law</b> {{relating}} to the award of restitutionary <b>damages</b> <b>in</b> contract <b>law,</b> utilising as its point of focus the recent House of Lords decision in Attorney-General v Blake.

While we argue that there is, on a more general level, no overriding objection in principle to the award of restitutionary damages for cynical breach of contract, {{this is still a}} rather controversial area. Looked at in this light, we suggest that the judicious award of restitutionary <b>damages</b> <b>in</b> situations where public policy requires it (such as, we argue, was the case in Blake itself) may be the preferable (albeit more modest) way forward...|$|R
