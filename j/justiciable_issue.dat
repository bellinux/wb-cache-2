500|$|However, {{the law on}} {{this issue}} is {{presently}} unclear. In Lee Mau Seng, the High Court said that mala fides was not a <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> {{in relation to the}} ISA. A similar stance was taken in Malaysia in Karam Singh. However, in Teo Soh Lung the Court of Appeal said that it did not need to decide whether Lee Mau Seng has precluded judicial review in mala fides situations until a case with a mala fides factual situation arises. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of Malaysian cases reflecting [...] "a gradual recognition that ... indicate a retreat from the purely subjective approach".|$|E
500|$|Even if the {{subject-matter}} {{of a case}} {{is generally}} non-justiciable, there are exceptions where the courts will still review the case. For instance, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but, on a closer look, the courts may decide {{that there is a}} justiciable matter within it. In such a situation, the courts will intervene and review the case. An example of this was given by Judicial Commissioner Menon in Lee Hsien Loong: [...] "here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on the application of domestic law, that is something the court may well find justiciable." [...] In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on the interpretation of a treaty generally, which is impermissible, from the consideration of [...] "the application of an international treaty by reference to the facts of an individual case" [...] which is allowed. Also, in R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Everett (1988), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales took the view that a decision by the Secretary of State exercised under the royal prerogative to deny a passport to a British citizen residing abroad raised a <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but [...] "a matter of administrative decision, affecting the rights of individuals and their freedom of travel".|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Chief Justice Burger concurred in the result: [...] "I {{concur in}} the result reached {{even though the}} {{allegations}} of the complaint are on the borderline necessary to compel an evidentiary hearing. Some of the claims alleged are frivolous; others do not present <b>justiciable</b> <b>issues.</b> There cannot possibly be any constitutional or legal requirement that the government provide materials for every religion and sect practiced in this diverse country. At most, Buddhist materials cannot be denied to prisoners if someone offers to supply them.|$|R
40|$|Conflict' and 'dispute' are two {{distinct}} notions. The conceptual {{difference between the}} two is explored and further reviewed through the literature on conflict and dispute in the field of construction; a taxonomy for future study is also introduced. Conflict, it is proposed, exists wherever there is incompatibility of interest, and therefore is pandemic. Conflict can be managed, possibly to the extent of preventing a dispute resulting from the conflict. Dispute is associated with distinct <b>justiciable</b> <b>issues.</b> Disputes require resolution. This means that they can be managed: the process of dispute resolution lends itself to third party intervention. The construction industry and the chemical process industry in the UK are compared, through perceptions and experiences of conflict and disputes arising from their two sets of standard contract forms. The methodology is a review of published cases and a survey conducted among professionals with experience. The paucity of research in this field is discussed and the empirical work on the causes of conflict and dispute is reviewed. It is concluded that effective management of conflicts and disputes would be furthered by separating the two fields, and particularly by applying a more stringent structuring. Conflict, Construction, Chemical Industry, Dispute, Standard Contracts, Taxonomy,...|$|R
50|$|In some cases, an {{applicant}} may lack standing {{to seek a}} remedy. In other cases, the issue may have become moot or academic and therefore not <b>justiciable.</b> An <b>issue</b> may also be non-justiciable {{because it is not}} yet ripe for decision by a court. The Bill of Rights contains special rules relating to these issues when it is directly applied. In such cases, it demands a broader approach to standing. In cases of indirect application, the ordinary legal rules apply.|$|R
500|$|In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs (1971), the High Court {{affirmed that}} {{with respect to}} the President's {{satisfaction}} that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore, mala fides or bad faith was [...] "not... a <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> {{in the context of the}} Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc". Essentially, this means that the President's satisfaction is subjective, and not objective. The effect of this decision is that [...] "the Constitution left it to the executive, and not the judiciary, to decide what national security required". Subsequently, in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal took a different stand, holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. (Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended [...] "as the Minister sees fit", as well as to revoke such a direction.) The Court said that [...] "the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law" [...] because [...] "all power has legal limits", and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Frederick Arthur Chua {{ruled that}} the {{amendments}} to Article 149 and to the ISA did {{have the effect of}} depriving the applicant of her right to judicial review of the legality, rationality and constitutionality of her detention under the ISA. The court observed that the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze had allowed the appeal solely on a technical ground – that the respondents had not adduced sufficient evidence of the President's satisfaction. Other matters mentioned in that judgment were merely obiter dicta. Therefore, although it had been held in Chng Suan Tze that the President's satisfaction under section 8(1) of the ISA was [...] and thus reviewable by the court, these observations did not apply to the present proceedings {{in the light of the}} new provisions in the ISA. Section 8B(1), which stated that the law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on 13 July 1971, reaffirmed the law governing judicial review as laid down in the High Court's 1971 decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which was rendered on that date. Thus, the section had the effect of making a [...] test applicable to the exercise of powers under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. Section 8B(2) provided that there was to be judicial review only in regard to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirement of the ISA governing such act or decision. If the discretion exercised by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 was subjective, the court could not assess whether the powers conferred on the President and the Minister by sections 8 and 10 were exercised legally. The applicant had the burden of proof of showing that her detention was [...] unlawful as the respondents had adduced a valid detention order and evidence of the President's subjective satisfaction that she should be detained. Furthermore, Lee Mau Seng had held that bad faith is not a <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> in the ISA context.|$|E

50|$|Section 28 {{gave the}} courts, {{for the first}} time, the power to order {{disclosure}} of documents by the Crown and require the Crown to answer requests for further information. This new power is subject to important qualifications in s.28(2) including the proviso that the Crown can resist disclosure where this could be “injurious to the public interest”. This reasserted the traditional doctrine of Crown privilege but also made the <b>issue</b> <b>justiciable,</b> ultimately giving rise to the doctrine of public-interest immunity.|$|R
2500|$|Having {{declared}} redistricting <b>issues</b> <b>justiciable</b> in Baker, {{the court}} {{laid out a}} new test for evaluating such claims. The Court formulated the famous [...] "one person, one vote" [...] standard under American jurisprudence for legislative redistricting, holding that each individual had to be weighted equally in legislative apportionment. This affected numerous state legislatures that had not redistricted congressional districts for decades, despite major population shifts. It also ultimately affected the composition of state legislative districts as well, which in Alabama and numerous other states had overrepresented rural districts and underrepresented urban districts with much greater populations.|$|R
50|$|We have {{no power}} per se to review and annul acts of Congress {{on the ground that}} they are unconstitutional. The {{question}} may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue,</b> is made to rest upon such an act…. The party who invokes the power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.|$|E

5000|$|The United States Supreme Court has {{determined}} that the case or controversy requirement found in Article Three of the United States Constitution prohibits United States federal courts from issuing advisory opinions. Accordingly, before the court will hear a case, it must find that the parties have a tangible interest {{at stake in the}} matter, the issue presented must be [...] "mature for judicial resolution" [...] or ripe, and a <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> must remain before the court throughout the course of the lawsuit. While this doctrine is still in full force, there has been a liberalization of these requirements in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was argued}} {{that there was no}} real {{emergency}} and yet the Proclamation remained unretracted with consequential peril to fundamental rights. In our view this is a political, not <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> and the appeal should be to the polls and not to the courts. The traditional view that political questions fall outside the area of judicial review, is not a constitutional taboo but a pragmatic response of the court to the reality of its inadequacy to decide such issues and to the scheme of the Constitution which has assigned to each branch of the government in the larger sense a certain jurisdiction. ... The rule is one of self-restraint and of subject matter, political sense and respect for other branches of government like the legislature and the executive.|$|E
5000|$|A {{majority}} of states allow generally for an award to any {{party in a}} lawsuit, if another party has forced him to expend money on attorneys fees to defend against a claim utterly or substantially lacking any possible merit and brought in bad faith (frequently called [...] "abusive litigation" [...] or a [...] "frivolous lawsuit"). For example, in Georgia, a trial court must award attorneys fees if a party has brought a claim [...] "with respect to which there existed such a complete absence of any <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> of law or fact {{that it could not}} be reasonably believed that a court would accept the asserted claim, defense, or other position". Meanwhile, a trial court may, but is not required to, award attorneys fees if a party has made a claim [...] "that lacked substantial justification or...was interposed for delay or harassment, or if opposing party unnecessarily expanded the proceeding by other improper conduct".|$|E

5000|$|The Supreme Court made {{a number}} of {{observations}} regarding the issues involved:"In this case, all three factors, applied purposively and flexibly, favour granting public interest standing to the respondents. In fact, there is no dispute that the first and second factors are met: the respondents’ action raises serious justiciable issues and the respondents have an interest in the outcome of the action and are fully engaged with the issues that they seek to raise. Indeed, the constitutionality of the prostitution provisions of the Criminal Code constitutes a serious <b>justiciable</b> <b>issue</b> and the respondents, given their work, have a strong engagement with the issue...This case constitutes public interest litigation: the respondents have raised issues of public importance that transcend their immediate interests. Their challenge is comprehensive, relating as it does to nearly the entire legislative scheme. It provides an opportunity to assess through the constitutional lens the overall effect of this scheme on those most directly affected by it...''''It is obvious that the claim is being pursued with thoroughness and skill...The impugned Criminal Code provisions, by criminalizing many of the activities surrounding prostitution, adversely affect a great number of women. These issues are also clearly justiciable ones, as they concern the constitutionality of the challenged provisions...Some aspects of the statement of claim raise serious issues as to the invalidity of the legislation...Granting standing will not only serve to enhance the principle of legality with respect to serious issues of direct concern {{to some of the most}} marginalized members of society, but it will also promote the economical use of scarce judicial resources"'''' ...|$|E
