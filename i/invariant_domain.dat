40|$|A new second-order {{method for}} {{approximating}} the compressible Euler equations is introduced. The method preserves all the known invariant domains of the Euler system: positivity of the density, positivity {{of the internal}} energy and the local minimum principle on the specific entropy. The technique combines a first-order, <b>invariant</b> <b>domain</b> preserving, Guaranteed Maximum Speed method using a Graph Viscosity (GMS-GV 1) with an <b>invariant</b> <b>domain</b> violating, but entropy consistent, high-order method. <b>Invariant</b> <b>domain</b> preserving auxiliary states, naturally produced by the GMS-GV 1 method, are used to define local bounds for the high-order method which is then made <b>invariant</b> <b>domain</b> preserving via a convex limiting process. Numerical tests confirm the second-order accuracy of the new GMS-GV 2 method in the maximum norm, where 2 stands for second-order. The proposed convex limiting is generic and {{can be applied to}} other approximation techniques and other hyperbolic systems. Comment: Submitted to SIAM SIS...|$|E

Thus, in dynamical context, if an entire function has a completely <b>invariant</b> <b>domain</b> and omits some value, then the omitted value belongs to the completely <b>invariant</b> <b>domain.</b> We conjecture that the same property holds if a is a locally omitted value (i. e., the projection of a direct singularity of f − 1).

30|$|Counteracting {{geometrical}} attacks such as rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) {{remains one}} of the most challenging problems for robust watermarking.

These schemes can be roughly categorized into five paradigms, namely exhaustive search, <b>invariant</b> <b>domain,</b> auto-correlation, feature-based implicit synchronization, and geometrical correction [1 – 4].
