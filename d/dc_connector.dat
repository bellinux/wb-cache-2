500|$|The SG-1000 {{is powered}} by an 8-bit Zilog Z80 central {{processing}} unit running at 3.58 MHz for the SG-1000 and SG-1000 II, and at 4MHz for the SC-3000. [...] Its video processor is a Texas Instruments TMS9928A, capable of displaying up to 16 colors, and its sound processor is a Texas Instruments SN76489. [...] All three chips were also used in the ColecoVision. [...] The system includes 8 kbit (1 kB) of random access memory (RAM) and 16 kbit (2 kB) of video RAM. [...] The controller is hardwired to the system in the original model, and detachable in the SG-1000 II. [...] Video and audio output are supplied through an RF switch. [...] Power is supplied through a 9V <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> connected to an AC adapter.|$|E
2500|$|Recharging {{receptacles}} vary between models.

50|$|A <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> is an {{electrical}} connector for supplying direct current (DC) power. For portable consumer electronic devices, the coaxial power connector is frequently used, {{but many other}} types of connectors also exist.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{domestic}} AC power plugs and sockets, <b>DC</b> <b>connectors</b> {{have many more}} standard types that are not interchangeable. The dimensions and arrangement of <b>DC</b> <b>connectors</b> can be chosen to prevent accidental interconnection of incompatible sources and loads. Types vary from small coaxial connectors used to power portable electronic devices from AC adapters, to connectors used for automotive accessories and for battery packs in portable equipment.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{mobile phones}} use <b>DC</b> <b>connectors</b> that {{are unique to}} the manufacturer, or even a {{specific}} phone. In the interest of improved interoperability of phone battery chargers, major manufacturers have agreed to standardize on the micro-USB connector for new phone chargers from 2010.|$|R
50|$|CHAdeMO {{was formed}} by The Tokyo Electric Power Company, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries (the {{manufacturer}} of Subaru vehicles). Toyota later joined as its fifth executive member. Three of these companies have developed electric vehicles that use TEPCO's <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> for quick charging.|$|E

50|$|ISO 4165 is a {{standard}} adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that describes a double-pole <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> to supply between 12 and 24 V DC at up to 12 amps to appliances in vehicles. Although roughly similar in design to an automotive accessory receptacle, the ISO 4165 connector is shorter and smaller in diameter. It was originally {{a standard}} fitting on all the German military vehicles during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} specifies an additional, different {{design for}} extra-low voltages up to 50 V AC and currents of 16 or 32 A. This resembles, but is larger than, the IEC 60906 <b>DC</b> <b>connector.</b> Three 6 mm pins 20.5 mm long are equally spaced around a 15.4 mm diameter circle. They {{are surrounded by}} a 23 mm long shroud with an inner diameter of 36 mm and an outer diameter of 42 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{cigarette}} lighter receptacle (also called a cigar lighter receptacle or cigar lighter socket) {{in an automobile}} was initially designed to power an electrically heated {{cigarette lighter}}, but became a de facto standard <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> to supply electrical power for portable accessories used in or near an automobile. While the cigarette lighter receptacle is a common feature of automobiles and trucks, as a DC power connector it has the disadvantages of bulkiness, relatively low current rating, and poor contact reliability.|$|E

50|$|The car {{cigarette}} lighter socket is also called a cigar lighter receptacle, {{since it was}} originally designed as a lighter for cigars—hence its rather large size. These sockets were not originally designed to provide DC power, and are not an ideal <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> for several reasons. Three sizes exist, one for 6 VDC and two for 12 VDC and the mating of the different sized 12 VDC plugs and jacks is problematic. Because of this, and the small gauge wire sometimes used, they may provide unreliable power connections.|$|E
50|$|At the 15th International VDI-Congress of the Association of German Engineers, the {{proposal}} of a Combined Charging System (CCS) was unveiled on 12 October 2011 in Baden-Baden. Seven car makers (Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Porsche and Volkswagen) {{have agreed to}} introduce the Combined Charging System in mid-2012. This defines a single connector pattern on the vehicle side that offers enough space for a Type 1 or Type 2 connector along with space for a 2-pin <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> allowing up to 200 A. The seven auto manufacturers have also agreed to use HomePlug GreenPHY as the communication protocol.|$|E
50|$|The charger/headset jack for the F3 Motofone (and variants) {{was not a}} {{standard}} 2.5 mm or 3.5 mm headset port. It was a <b>DC</b> <b>connector</b> that can support mono sound quality. This is not well documented at Motorola, and internal documentation indicates the jack is {{a standard}} 2.5 mm TRS connector jack. The jack shown on the Motorola site clearly has a pin {{in the center of}} the jack, prohibiting use of a standard 2.5 mm plug. A mono headset was available as part number CFLN6103AA and the name of it is Motorola S215 Pedestrian Kit. This is a headset only and not an adapter.|$|E
