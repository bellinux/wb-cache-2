5000|$|The idea can be briefly {{explained}} as follows. According {{to the theory}} of sliding modes, in order to describe the system behavior, once sliding mode starts, the function [...] should be replaced by equivalent values (see <b>equivalent</b> <b>control</b> in the theory of sliding modes). In practice, it switches (chatters) with high frequency with slow component being equal to the equivalent value. Applying appropriate lowpass filter {{to get rid of the}} high frequency component on can obtain the value of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>control,</b> which contains more information about the state of the estimated system. The observer described above uses this method several times to obtain the state of the nonlinear system ideally in finite time.|$|E

40|$|The <b>equivalent</b> force <b>control</b> method uses {{feedback}} control to replace numerical iteration and solve the nonlinear equation in a real-time hybrid simulation via the implicit integration method. During the real-time hybrid simulation, a time delay typically reduces {{the accuracy of}} the test results and can even make the system unstable. The outer-loop controller of the <b>equivalent</b> force <b>control</b> method can eliminate the effect of a small time delay. However, when the actuator has a large delay, {{the accuracy of the}} test results is reduced. The adaptive forward prediction method offers a solution to this problem. Thus, in this paper, the adaptive polynomial-based forward prediction algorithm is combined with <b>equivalent</b> force <b>control</b> to improve the test accuracy and stability. The new method is shown to give good stability properties for a specimen with nonlinear stiffness by analyzing the location of the poles of the discrete transfer system. Simulations with linear and nonlinear specimens are then presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Finally, experimental results with a linear stiffness specimen and a magneto-rheological (MR) damper are used to demonstrate that this method has better accuracy than the <b>equivalent</b> force <b>control</b> method with non-adaptive delay compensation...|$|R

50|$|A {{carburetor}} basically {{consists of}} an open pipe through which the air passes into the inlet manifold of the engine. The pipe {{is in the form}} of a Venturi: it narrows in section and then widens again, causing the airflow to increase in speed in the narrowest part. Below the Venturi is a butterfly valve called the throttle valve — a rotating disc that can be turned end-on to the airflow, so as to hardly restrict the flow at all, or can be rotated so that it (almost) completely blocks the flow of air. This valve controls the flow of air through the carburetor throat and thus the quantity of air/fuel mixture the system will deliver, thereby regulating engine power and speed. The throttle is connected, usually through a cable or a mechanical linkage of rods and joints or rarely by pneumatic link, to the accelerator pedal on a car, a throttle level in an aircraft or the <b>equivalent</b> <b>control</b> on other vehicles or equipment.|$|E

50|$|The main {{operator}} control units, of these plans, appeared {{similar to a}} 232 plus Bellset 26 combo but was now a Tele 248 plus Bellset 39a (early versions) or 44 (later). These bellsets had a recess, in the front, dominated by a horizontal, quadrant mounted, 4 position slider, flanked by either 1 or 2 press buttons, for buzzing the extension(s). These Bellsets 39a and 44 were bellsets in name only, as they contained no bell. What they did contain was a maze of spring contact sets, mainly activated by a cam at the pivot of the slide switch. The system required a separate, remote mounted bellset, for incoming signalling. The main unit could make and answer exchange calls, talk to and transfer calls to the extension(s). The extensions could call and {{talk to each other}} and the main unit, but could only make external calls if a request to the operator, for the exchange line, was honoured.When this system was eventually revisited and brought up to date, with the 700 series Plans 105 and 107, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>control</b> unit was dubbed 'The Planset'.|$|E
