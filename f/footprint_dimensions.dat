30|$|Footprints can be {{recovered}} {{from a variety of}} crime scenes such as polished floor, dirt, sand, mud, snow, and even on walls when criminals try to escape by jumping from walls (Naples and Miller 2004). It is apparent from the forensic literature that sex and stature can reliably be estimated from <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> (Barker and Scheuer 1998; Kanchan et al. 2014; Khan and Moorthy 2015; Krishan et al. 2015; Atamturk 2010). Many studies also tried to estimate the weight from <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions.</b> In a study, Krishan (2008) tried to establish the correlation of body weight with <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> (Krishan 2008). In this study, 300 bilateral footprints were collected from 50 adult male North Indian subjects (age 18 to 30  years). Footprints were collected in three stages; in the first stage, no weight was given to the subject, in the second stage 5  kg, and in the third stage, 20  kg weight was given to the subjects while taking footprints. The results of this study reveal that holding 5  kg of weight in the hands did not affect the dimensions of the footprints; however, a significant (p[*]<[*] 0.01) difference in the <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> had been observed when subjects held 20  kg of weight. Positive and statistically significant correlation of foot dimensions with normal body weight had also been observed in this study. In both left and right footprints, footprint length at first toe (R[*]=[*] 0.75, L[*]=[*] 0.74) and at the second toe (R[*]=[*] 0.74, L[*]=[*] 0.74) showed the highest correlation with normal body weight. Regression models for body weight estimation were also developed from all the left and right <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Similar studies on other populations also tried to formulate regression models for weight estimation from <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> (Robbins 1986; Fawzy and Kamal 2010; Abledu et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} sought to verify the utility and {{reliability}} of <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> in sex determination in a Ghanaian population. Bilateral footprints were obtained from 126 Ghanaian students (66 males and 60 females) aged 18 - 30 years at Koforidua Polytechnic using an ink pad and white papers. Seven dimensions-length of each toe (designated T 1 -T 5) from the most anterior point of the toe to the mid-rear heel point, breadth at ball (BAB) and breadth at heel (BAH) [...] and the heel-ball (HB) index were obtained from each footprint. Some <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> (i. e. T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5) showed statistically significant bilateral asymmetry in males only. All the <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions,</b> except HB index, were significantly greater in males than females (p< 0. 001). Applied singly in discriminant function analysis, the <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> allowed 69. 8 %- 80. 3 % of cases to be correctly classified into their sex groups; the accuracy of sex classification was higher using left footprints than right footprints. With all dimensions subjected to stepwise discriminant function analysis 80. 3 % and 77 % of cases could be correctly classified, combining both T 5 and BAH for left footprints and T 1, BAB and BAH for left footprints respectively. The present study has demonstrated, {{for the first time}} among Ghanaian subjects, the utility and reliability of sex determination standards developed from <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The results thus provide the baseline for elaborated studies in the future...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the utility and reliability of <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> in age, sex and stature determination in the North Indian population. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out using a sample of 400 people (146 female and 254 male) aged 10 - 65 years in Uttar Pradesh, North Western state of India. Footprints of both feet were taken bilaterally, and thus a total of 800 prints were obtained. A cluster of 7 measurements were taken carefully {{with the help of}} a scientific scale ruler. Five measurements were length dimensions from the most anterior part of the toe (T 1 –T 5) to the mid rear heel point and two were breadth dimensions from both left and right footprints: breadth at ball (BBAL), breadth at heel (BHEL) and 2 indexes: heel-ball Index (HBI) and footprint index (FPI). All data were analyzed statistically using Student’s t-test, regression coefficient and Pearson’s correlation for the estimation of sex on the basis of <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Results: The T 1 in left footprints was greater than right footprints in males, while T 1 and BBAL were both found to be greater in left footprints than right footprints in females.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on Altimetry Systems For Autonomous Landing and Take Off (ASFALTO) that has been performed in the framework of the technology studies for the Italian government research program PRORA-UAV owned by the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA) and the research consortium CoRiSTA. ASFALTO is a joint project on the integration of advanced altimeters onboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to be used as vertical navigation sensors for autonomous take off and landing on runways that are not equipped with navigation aids. In order to demonstrate in flight the developed navigation and automatic flight control techniques, CIRA has build a small UAV that is called Flight Small Scale Demonstrator (FSSD). Landing is a very demanding phase in terms of vertical navigation for both manned and unmanned aircrafts. Indeed, the standalone GPS civil service is not capable to guarantee these performances. As a consequence, more accurate altimeters are investigated to be adopted onboard. All these sensors need to meet power and mass requirements for a small UAV. First of all, a laser and a radar altimeter model have been selected to be installed on the aircraft. The main difference between these instruments is that radar <b>footprint</b> <b>dimension</b> is larger than laser one. They have been chosen following requirements for the installation onboard FSSD. Subsequently, well-suited altimetry determination techniques have been investigated and an error budget analysis has been performed to determine the expected accuracy level. This analysis accounted for range, attitude, and mounting errors influence on altitude measurement. Finally, a specific sensor fusion algorithm has been developed in order to obtain the best state estimation taking advantage of measurements from standard navigation sensors such as GPS and inertial sensors. The developed altimetry techniques have been tested in flight. Flight test results are also reported...|$|R

We show that typical fibers retain such highly ordered propagation of light over remarkably large distances, which allows correction operators to be introduced in imaging geometries in order to maintain high-quality performance even in such flexible micro-endoscopes. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{adductor}} magnus (AM) {{has historically}} been a potential source of confusion in patients with suspected proximal hamstring avulsion injuries. Purpose: To investigate the anatomic characteristics of the AM, including its osseous origin, anatomic dimensions, and rela-tionship to the proximal hamstring tendons. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Dissection of the AM origin was performed in 11 (8 cadavers) fresh-frozen hip-to-foot cadaveric hemipelvis specimens. The gross anatomy and architecture of the proximal hamstring and AM tendons were studied. After dissecting the hamstring tendons away from their origin, the dimension, shape, and orientation of the tendon footprints on the ischial tuberosity were determined. Results: The AM was identified in all cadaveric specimens. The mean tendon thickness (anterior to posterior [AP]) was 5. 7 ± 2. 9 mm. The mean tendon width (medial to lateral [ML]) was 7. 1 ± 2. 2 mm. The mean tendon length was 13. 1 ± 8. 7 cm.

30|$|Foot and <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> {{have been}} {{proved to be}} a {{reliable}} means of stature estimation in forensic casework (Hisham et al. 2012; Krishan et al. 2012). However, little has been known for its relationship with body weight. A handful of studies tried to estimate body weight from <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> (Robbins 1986; Krishan 2008; Fawzy and Kamal 2010; Abledu et al. 2016). Similarly, gait parameters such as step length and stride length have been explored for their relationship with stature but not with body weight. In a study, conducted on 198 adult male Jat Sikhs, Jasuja et al. (1997) tried to estimate stature from step length measurements. In this study, a mean correlation coefficient of 0.289 and 0.433 was observed between step length and stature at a normal and fast speed respectively. Stature estimation regression models were also developed from step length measurements in this study. The association of gait parameters with body weight had never been investigated in a forensic context. In forensic cases, when only partial footprints are available for investigation, then the base of gait and area swept in one stride can be used for weight estimation. In the present study, a weak but significant correlation of the base of gait and area swept in one stride with weight has been observed. A weak correlation suggests that human gait is not a sole function of the body weight. A positive correlation of body weight with the base of gait could be attributed to the fact that if weight increases, then a larger basal support is required for balancing. An increased base of gait could be the balancing strategy achieved by the person during normal walking. Similar arguments can be extended for the positive correlation of body weight with area swept in one stride. In a complete gait cycle (normal walk), a transition of body weight from one foot to another foot happens. A triangular area covered by the body in one stride represents the basal support to the body during the weight transition phase of the gait cycle. A larger area for increased weight seems plausible.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} no {{dominant}} technology for the concentrated solar power plants that means {{there is still a}} way to go. Within this context, new concepts for solar fields and power cycles are being studied. One of them is the proposed on this paper: the integration of line-focusing solar field, with parabolic trough or linear Fresnel solar collectors, with molten salts as heat transfer fluid and supercritical carbon dioxide Joule-Brayton power cycles. This concept works as a feasible design solution to increase efficiency and reduce final energy cost in solar electricity production. In this work, four Joule-Brayton cycles configurations were assessed and compared with the considered reference, a concentrated solar power plant with direct steam generation in the solar field and a Rankine power cycle. The studied Joule-Brayton cycles are: simple cycle, recompression cycle, partial cooling with recompression cycle and recompression with main compression intercooling cycle. The common operation conditions for all the configurations are that at design-point the high pressure turbine inlet temperature value is 550 ºC, this limit was established considering maximum temperature allowed by selective coating material in linear receivers. Also is analyzed the hypothetical scenario of increasing the turbine inlet temperature to 650 ºC, extrapolating the receivers heat losses regressions. The innovative configurations of solar field and supercritical carbon dioxide power cycles increase plant efficiency, for recompression cycle configuration, up to 46. 84 % (550 ºC turbine inlet) and 50. 85 % (650 ºC turbine inlet), and reduces required solar field effective aperture area and land area for a fixed plant power output. Proposed configurations, parabolic trough collector and linear Fresnel coupled with a Joule-Brayton cycle decreases the solar field required for the same net power. Relating to power block, the supercritical carbon dioxide higher density in comparison with water steam, reduces turbines and compressors <b>dimensions,</b> <b>footprint</b> and final cost, but is a technology nowadays under industrial development and final turbo machines cost could not be assessed in this study.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{the work of the}} Laboratory for Electromagnetic Compatibility Testing in the Technical Test Center (TTC), we {{investigated}} the influence of the Faraday cage on measurement results. The primary goal of this study is the simulation of the fields in the cage, especially around resonant frequencies, {{in order to be able}} to predict results of measurements of devices under test in the anechoic chamber or in any other environment. We developed simulation (computer) models of the cage step by step, by using the Wipl-D program and by comparing the numerical results with measurements as well as by resolving difficulties due to the complex structure and imperfections of the cage. The subject of this paper is to present these simulation models and the corresponding results of the computations and measurements. Construction of the cage The cage is made of steel plates with the dimensions 1. 25 m x 2. 5 m. The base of the cage is a square; the <b>footprint</b> interior <b>dimensions</b> are 3. 76 m x 3. 76 m, and the height is 2. 5 m. The cage ceiling is lowered by plasticized aluminum strips. The strips are loosely attached to the carriers which are screwed to the ceiling. The cage has four ventilation openings (two on the ceiling and two on one wall), made of honeycomb waveguide holes. In one corner of the cage, there is a single door with springs made of beryllium bronze. For frequencies of a few tens of MHz, the skin effect is fully developed in the cage walls. By measuring the input impedance of the wire line parallel to a wall of the cage, we calculated the surface losses of the cage plates. In addition, we used a magnetic probe to detect shield discontinuities. We generated a strong current at a frequency of 106  kHz outside the cage and measured the magnetic field inside the cage at the places of cage shield discontinuities. In this paper, we showed the influence of these places on the measurement results, especially on the qualitative and quantitative changes of the cage resonant frequencies. Model of the cage On the basis of the testing, the initial simulation model of the cage in the Wipl-D program consists of plates with losses, including losses at plate junctions, wall ventilation openings, aluminum profiles, profile carriers, and screws. The analysis showed that this model is not satisfactory. To obtain a more accurate model of the cage, we need the additional and more precise model of the lowered ceiling. That would complicate the model and require a lot of additional testing. For obtaining a simpler, but more reliable simulation model, we dismounted the aluminum profiles from the carriers. Thereafter, the agreement between the simulation and the experimental results was better than for the initial model, but still is not good enough, due to the uncertainties caused by the strips carriers and the screws. Final model of the cage To avoid the uncertainty due to the strips carriers, we removed the carriers and the screws from the cage. A very good matching of the simulation and the experimental results was achieved. We showed that the relative difference of the resonant frequencies between simulation and measurement is less than 1  %. However, the relative difference of resonant frequency between simulation or measurement and theoretical results is also less than 1  %, except for TE 101 and TE 011 modes, for which the relative difference is under 5  %. We explained the exception by the influence of the places of the cage shield discontinuities on the measurement results. Conclusion The results of the simulations and the measurements for the final model show good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We showed that the resonant frequencies in the simulations and the measurement results have same positions and depths. Also, the relative differences of the resonant frequencies are less than 1  %. As future work, we will provide a technique for the identification of equivalent sources that represent the device under test. This would enable a characterization of the tested device in an arbitrary electromagnetic environment and allow a comparison of results obtained in different laboratories.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Human {{footprint}} fossils {{have provided}} essential {{evidence about the}} evolution of human bipedalism {{as well as the}} social dynamics of the footprint makers, including estimates of speed, sex and group composition. Generally such estimates are made by comparing footprint evidence with modern controls; however, previous studies have not accounted for the variation in <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> coming from load bearing activities. It is likely that a portion of the hominins who created these fossil footprints were carrying a significant load, such as offspring or foraging loads, which caused variation in the footprint which could extend to variation in any estimations concerning the footprint’s maker. To identify significant variation in footprints due to load-bearing tasks, we had participants (N = 30, 15 males and 15 females) walk at a series of speeds carrying a 20 kg pack on their back, side and front. Paint was applied to the bare feet of each participant to create footprints that were compared in terms of foot length, foot width and foot area. Female foot length and width increased during multiple loaded conditions. An appreciation of footprint variability associated with carrying loads adds an additional layer {{to our understanding of the}} behavior and morphology of extinct hominin populations...|$|E
40|$|Results from a 26 shot {{ballistic}} {{range test}} of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) entry capsule are presented. The supersonic pitch damping properties of the MSL capsule were characterized between Mach 1. 35 and Mach 3. 5 and total angles-of-attack from 0 to 30 degrees. In flight, the MSL entry capsule will utilize a radial center-of-gravity offset to produce a non-zero trim angle-of-attack. This offset trim angle will produce lift, enabling the capsule to fly a guided entry and reducing the landing <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> to within 10 km of the desired landing site. A lifting configuration could not be tested at the ballistic range used for this test as the models would swerve into the range walls, possibly damaging cameras, the coordinate reference system or other facility assets. Ballistic (non-lifting) data was extracted and will be implemented in a conservative fashion {{to ensure that the}} dynamic stability characteristics of the flight vehicle are bounded. A comparison between the MSL pitch damping results and the dynamic model of the Mars Exploration Rover capsule shows generally close agreement with no significant differences in damping characteristics due to the change in backshell geometry. Dynamic moments are also compared to the MSL reaction control system (RCS) control authority to show the controller has sufficient margin to easily damp any dynamic stability effects...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{and active}} {{observations}} at L band (frequency (is) approximately 1. 4 GHz) from the Aquarius/SAC-D mission offer new capabilities {{to study the}} polar regions. Due {{to the lack of}} polar-gridded products, however, applications over the cryosphere have been limited. We present three weekly polar-gridded products of Aquarius data to improve our understanding of L-band observations of ice sheets, sea ice, permafrost, and the polar oceans. Additionally, these products intend to facilitate access to L-band data, and can be used to assist in algorithm developments. Aquarius data at latitudes higher than 50 degrees are averaged and gridded into weekly products of brightness temperature (TB), normalized radar cross section (NRCS), and sea surface salinity (SSS). Each grid cell also contains sea ice fraction, the standard deviation of TB, NRCS, and SSS, and the number of footprint observations collected during the seven-day cycle. The largest 3 dB <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> are 97 km 156 km and 74 km 122 km (along across track) for the radiometers and scatterometer, respectively. The data is gridded to the Equal-Area Scalable Earth version 2. 0 (EASE 2. 0) grid, with a grid cell resolution of 36 km. The data sets start in August 2011, with the first Aquarius observations and will be updated on a monthly basis following the release schedule of the Aquarius Level 2 data sets. The weekly gridded products are distributed by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} envisages the {{morphological}} differences in anthropometric measurements on footprints among the preschool children and analyzes its manifestation {{in the different}} weight category. This study also focuses on the diagnosis of flatfoot among the studied population. Data has been collected from 160 participants (80 boys and 80 girls) from Bengali Hindu caste population aged 3 to 6 years. Anthropometric measurements included height, weight and body mass index. Other measurements on foot morphology included foot length, foot breadth diagonal, foot breadth horizontal, ball of the foot length, outside ball of the boot length, heel breadth, and toe lengths T 1, T 2, T 3. T 4, T 5. Staheli’s Plantar Arch Index, Chippaux-Smirak Index and foot angle were calculated. Various statistical tests like t-test, Pearson’s correlation and ANOVA were performed. Among all the variables, foot breadth horizontal showed statistically significant difference {{between boys and girls}} (p< 0. 05). All the <b>footprint</b> <b>dimensions</b> showed a significant (p< 0. 05) positive correlation with height and weight in both the boys and the girls. However, the Staheli’s Plantar Arch Index showed a significant (p< 0. 05) negative correlation with height and weight and Chippaux-Smirak Index showed a significant (p< 0. 05) negative correlation with height only among both the boys and the girls. Significant differences (ANOVA) were found between the foot morphology of children in three different weight categories (underweight, healthy and overweight) except the foot angle, and both indices. The present study evinces that weight affects the foot structure of the children. The prevalence of flatfoot was found to be 57. 5 % among the children with no significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the boys and the girls. The results thus provide a podium for intricate studies in the future. Timely prognosis of flatfoot in children can instigate early rectification of flat-footedness...|$|E
