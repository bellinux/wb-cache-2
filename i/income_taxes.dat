40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms and the {{development}} of Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues in the period of 1983 - 2011. It points out two key features of the Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms: 1) the tax reforms have embraced tax rates cutting and tax bases broadening apcomprehensive <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> system toward the schedular tax system. Then, regarding tax revenues, data shows that the Indonesian's nominal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues have increased considerably during that period; however they {{have not been able to}} increase Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> ratios significantly. This phenomenon indicates that even though the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> reforms did have positive effects on increasing the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues, they were not the only factors for the steep increase of Indonesian's nominal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. This paper shows that Indonesian's relatively high inflation rates and high economic growth during that period have considerably contributed to the steep increases of <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. At the end, in order to increase the Indonesian's <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> revenues fur- ther, this paper notes that beside tax regulation reform, it is equally necessary to promote public tax awareness, tax authorities' professionalism and integrity, and the implementation of governance practices in Indonesian's bureaucracy...|$|R

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal <b>income</b> <b>taxes,</b> and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
