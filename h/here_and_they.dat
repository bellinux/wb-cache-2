50|$|Due to its double administration, {{the town}} of Lomazzo was always {{declared}} neutral ground by the two factions. After the wars, the ambassadors met <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> proclaimed the peaces. The first peace treaty was signed in 1249, but war renewed and years of disagreement continued.|$|R
25|$|A {{freshwater}} well or spring {{lies in a}} rock cut basin in {{the middle}} of the island. This may be entirely natural or partly so, as place name and other evidence suggests that a chapel once existed here and a supply of freshwater would have been essential. Sheep were once grazed <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would have required a good supply of freshwater, as would the rabbits which still survive (1993). Two elder bushes were growing over the well / spring during the 1993 Scottish Wildlife Trust visit.|$|E
25|$|The next day, at the Simpson house, Marge {{tells the}} {{children}} that the new phone books are <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> have Bart and Lisa's picture on the front cover. Bart and Lisa come down, only {{to realize that the}} picture on one of the phone books is not the one of the fire on Mt. Springfield; it is actually a photo of baby Bart and Lisa naked on the toilet, causing them to scream in horror. Marge says that the shot was actually in the film on the camera, and that since she had taken it, she won the prize for them. Bart and Lisa, after accepting that they will be the laughingstock of the entire town, happily hug their mother. Meanwhile, Barney's confidence and his relationship with Homer are restored, and he looks forward to an alcohol-free future, although he is now addicted to double-tall mocha lattes.|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are".|$|E

500|$|Interviewed by the Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Haaretz {{about the fact}} that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: [...] "The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticize the policy of the State of Israel – just as we are allowed to criticize any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist". She has opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: [...] "The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of radical Islam in the problematic regions".|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, Berkeley drew {{national}} attention when the Berkeley city council passed {{a motion to}} send a letter to the US Marines to tell them they were [...] "unwelcome intruders." [...] Bates voted to approve the motion. [...] He voted to amend the letter on February 12 to remove language like [...] "unwelcome intruder" [...] from the letter. [...] On 13 February 2008, Bates said: [...] "I think it stands (that) we didn't want them <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> came <b>here.</b> <b>And</b> (<b>they</b> are) unwelcome, you know we'd like them to leave voluntarily. So I don't think an apology is in order." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was after}} rehearsals at Western Recorders that Binder took special note of how Presley {{and the other}} musicians would spontaneously unwind by improvising old blues and rock 'n' roll numbers.

2500|$|Approximately {{three dozen}} {{people came to}} the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards. The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the {{attendance}} as the first, and the 3rd awards ceremony had double this number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: [...] "We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press {{from all over the}} world are <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are looking for something to do, it could well catch on," [...] he said to BBC News.|$|E
