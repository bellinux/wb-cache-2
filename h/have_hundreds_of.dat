5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E

25|$|Plant miRNAs {{usually have}} near-perfect pairing with their mRNA targets, which induces gene {{repression}} through cleavage {{of the target}} transcripts. In contrast, animal miRNAs are able to recognize their target mRNAs by using as little as 6–8 nucleotides (the seed region) at the 5' end of the miRNA, which is not enough pairing to induce cleavage of the target mRNAs. Combinatorial regulation is a feature of miRNA regulation in animals. A given miRNA may <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> different mRNA targets, and a given target might be regulated by multiple miRNAs.|$|E

[...] In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel. [...] In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding stitches to each wale in turn, moving across the fabric as in a raster scan. [...] By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale. [...] Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may <b>have</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine.
