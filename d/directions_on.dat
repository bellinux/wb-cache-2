5|$|The Sri Lankan {{military}} began attacking Kilinochchi {{from three}} <b>directions</b> <b>on</b> 23 November 2008. Throughout {{the month of}} December, the SLA conducted three offensives {{in an attempt to}} take Kilinochchi. Heavy monsoon rains affected both sides during the months of November and December, with floods covering a large area in and around Kilinochchi. Troop movements were limited by this, and mines had been scattered around the area by the flood waters. Throughout the offensive, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out numerous air strikes against Kilinochchi in support of the SLA.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} {{collected during}} this investigation strongly supports {{the conclusion that}} this accident was caused by N600XL and GOL1907 following ATC clearances which directed them to operate in opposite <b>directions</b> <b>on</b> the same airway at the same altitude resulting in a midair collision. The loss of effective air traffic control was {{not the result of}} a single error, but of a combination of numerous individual and institutional ATC factors, which reflected systemic shortcomings in emphasis on positive air traffic control concepts.|$|E
5|$|In early November, the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO {{intensified}} their offensive {{aimed at}} capturing Saborsko and the Slunj pocket. The main axes of the advance radiated north and northwest from the Plitvice Lakes—towards Slunj and Saborsko respectively. The JNA force {{assigned to the}} offensive was organised as the Tactical Group 2 (TG-2), {{under the command of}} Colonel Čedomir Bulat. The TG-2, whose bulk consisted of a reinforced motorised battalion detached from the 236th Motorised Brigade and a D-30 howitzer battalion, was supported by the 5th Partisan Brigade, both subordinated to the 13th JNA Corps as well as a police unit and a SAO Krajina TO brigade drawn from Plaški. The attacking force, supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and tanks, approached the village from three <b>directions</b> <b>on</b> the morning of 12 November, while the main force advancing towards Slunj reached Rakovica. According to SAO Krajina sources, the air strikes commenced at 9a.m. and lasted for fifteen minutes. They were followed by a 30-minute artillery bombardment before ground forces were ordered to attack.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had a {{fortified}} base, Stützpunkt Podglavica, near Podglavica in {{the village}} of Prkosi (between Vrtoče and Kulen Vakuf). The base, with about 500 members of the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division and an artillery battery, secured the roads from Petrovac to Bihać and Kulen Vakuf. In September 1943, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 10th Krajina Brigade and a battalion of the Drvar–Petrovac Partisan Detachment were directed to attack it. Bursać volunteered to throw hand grenades at the pillboxes and machine-gun nests protecting the base. Although her company commander objected because she still appeared ill, Bursać insisted on throwing the grenades. The three Partisan battalions attacked the base from three <b>directions</b> <b>on</b> 18September at 11pm. Bursać and her group of grenade throwers destroyed several pillboxes before they came under fire from another. They destroyed the pillbox, but Bursać received a serious leg wound and was carried to a less exposed area.|$|E

5|$|The XrossMediaBar, {{originally}} {{used on the}} PSX, is a graphical {{user interface}} currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, {{as well as a}} variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down <b>directions</b> <b>on</b> a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.|$|E

40|$|The giant honeybee, Apis dorsata build nests on {{both natural}} and manmade {{structures}} by orienting their nests towards different directions. The observations revealed that, the giant honeybee colonies were well distributed on tall buildings, trees and rock cliffs and orientated their nests towards Northeast direction in greater numbers. However, the nests built on trees and rock cliffs showed better orientation towards Northeast and East-West directions respectively. A. dorsata also showed differential levels of nest orientation when distributed individually and in groups. Comparatively, the bee nests were oriented towards Northeast and Southwest <b>direction</b> <b>on</b> buildings and North-South and Northwest <b>direction</b> <b>on</b> trees on distribution of colonies both individually and in groups. However, on rock cliffs, irrespective of individual or group distribution, the nests were oriented towards East-West direction in large numbers.

In 1938, train services were provided by the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Netherlands Railways), when the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen merged with the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (Hollandic Iron Railroad Company), until the railway stop was closed on 15 May 1938.
