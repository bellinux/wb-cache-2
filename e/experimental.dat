5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist <b>experimental</b> physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of <b>experimental</b> approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, <b>experimental</b> work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E
5|$|<b>Experimental</b> Jet Set, Trash and No Star is {{the eighth}} studio album by American <b>experimental</b> rock band Sonic Youth, {{released}} on May 10, 1994 by DGC Records. It {{was produced by}} Butch Vig and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1987 album Sister was recorded. Unlike its predecessor Dirty, <b>Experimental</b> Jet Set features a more low-key approach and references the band's earlier work on the independent record label SST Records. The album contains quieter and more relaxed songs that deal with personal and political topics.|$|E

40|$|A {{large body}} of nonexperimental {{literature}} finds residing in a disadvantaged neighborhood is deleterious for mental health, and recent evidence from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program—a social experiment giving families living in high-poverty neighborhoods the opportunity to move to low-poverty neighborhoods—suggests a causal effect of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on adult mental health. We use qualitative data from 67 Baltimore adults who {{signed up for the}} MTO program to understand how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood produced these mental health benefits. First, we document the vast array of mental health challenges, traumatic experiences, and stressors reported by both <b>experimentals</b> (those who received a housing voucher to move to a low-poverty neighborhood) and controls (those who did not receive a voucher). We then explore how changes in the physical and social environments may have produced mental health benefits for <b>experimentals.</b> In particular, <b>experimentals</b> reported the following: improved neighborhood and home aesthetics, greater neighborhood collective efficacy and pride, less violence and criminal activity, and better environments for raising children. Notably, we also document increased sources of stress among <b>experimentals,</b> mostly associated with moving, making the positive effects of MTO on adult mental health all the more remarkable. These findings have important implications for bot...|$|R

Each of the two knife cuts was 1. 2 mm lateral from midline and extended from the preoptic area to the mamillary hypothalamic region. Five <b>experimentals</b> survived only 3 to 5 days following surgery as none was able to eat or drink. Three <b>experimentals</b> showed prematurely devel-oped wattles and caruncles about the neck, larger testes, and more advanced stages of spermatozo-an development and tubule growth compared to sham-operated controls. When male poults were placed in a floor pen {{two of the three}} <b>experimentals</b> displayed mating behavior by strutting. No strutting was observed in controls. Similar to the chicken, male poults receiving parasagittal knife cuts throughout the anterior-posterior extent of the hypothalamus and thalamus showed advanced gonadal development.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that earnings subsidies promote employment by increasing rewards to labor market activity. This paper asks whether subsidies also affect job duration and wage growth. We provide an analytical framework that identifies causal links between earnings subsidies, job turnover, and wage growth. This framework {{highlights the importance}} of the form of the subsidy on the decision about the type of job to accept and, hence, its potential effect on within-job wage growth. The subsidy is predicted to increase job turnover and to affect between-job wage growth by affecting reservation wages. We use this framework to analyze the effects of the Canadian Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP). Consistent with the theory, we find that <b>experimentals</b> have shorter job duration and experience faster within-job and between-job wage growth than <b>experimentals</b> who continued to be eligible only for Income Assistance...|$|R

40|$|Pinealectomized lizards (Podarcis sicula) whose {{locomotor}} rhythms {{were recorded}} in constant temperature (29 degrees C) and darkness were subdivided into 2 groups of hosts: Each belonging to the Ist group (<b>experimentals)</b> received from a donor a pineal gland, and each belonging to the 2 nd one (controls) received a piece of cerebellum. Pineal transplantation induced drastic changes in the free-running period (tau) of locomotor rhythms, which were significantly greater than the tau changes induced by cerebellum transplantation. Either application or removal of melatonin implants left the locomotor rhythms of the controls completely undisturbed, showing that in absence of melatonin rhythms (pinealectomy alone abolishes blood-borne melatonin rhythms) melatonin implants are ineffective. Melatonin rhythms, however, had {{to be present in}} the <b>experimentals,</b> because the circadian system reacts to melatonin implants by changing tau (as if melatonin rhythms had been suppressed) and to removal of the implants by again changing tau (as if melatonin rhythms had been restored) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a goal-setting model on behavioural change, thirty nine adults between the ages of 23 and 73 years who were in a weight loss program were assigned to one of two groups. One group was taught to change eating behaviour using a weight-reducing diet. The other group was taught to use a goal-setting model to change behaviour. Pretest and posttest surveys were completed by all participants, and a call-back survey by theexperimentals. The PET Type Check and Kolb's Learning Style Inventory were administered to all participants. As well, five of the <b>experimentals</b> were interviewed. Results of qualitative analyses showed {{no significant difference between the}} two groups, but qualitative research suggested that <b>experimentals</b> were more likely to use the goal-setting model to make behavioural changes, and that being successful increased their self-efficacy. 11 Acknowledgments As tills research dra~s to a close, I realize how very impo-rtant-it is to c~-me t...|$|R

40|$|Before {{the onset}} of female fertility, we removed 12 early-settling male tree {{swallows}} (Tachycineta bicolor) from their nest-boxes and mates, and allowed replacement males which had been floaters to settle with the original female residents. We predicted that females which had their original mate choice altered (<b>experimentals)</b> {{would be more likely}} to obtain extra-pair fertilizations than females which remained paired with their original, early-settling mates (controls). The proportion of females obtaining extra-pair fertilizations, however, did not differ between controls and <b>experimentals,</b> indicating that mating tactics of female tree swallows were unaffected by mate replacement. However, differences between early-settling and replacement males did exist. Replacement males had shorter wing chords than early-settling males, suggesting that they were younger. Moreover, a significantly greater proportion of replacement males than early-settling males were unringed and thus new to the study site. Our results suggest that if females are choosing males for good genes, then early-settling males are not superior in genetic quality to the smaller replacement males which had originally been floaters...|$|R
40|$|Employment {{programs}} {{meant to}} place welfare adults in work or training {{became an important}} part of Aid to Families with Dependent Children starting in the 1980 s. These programs are effective if one means that they have positive impacts in evaluations, less so if one expects them to make a large and visible change in the welfare problem. In programs evaluated by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, impacts on employment, earnings, and dependency are small in absolute terms but somewhat larger {{as a percentage of the}} control group mean. Impacts are understated in some studies because randomization occurred only after enrollment in the work program or because control group members had access to equivalent services. Results are also depressed by the failure of many <b>experimentals</b> to participate in the tested program. Programs raise the activity of <b>experimentals</b> in work-related activities much more than they raise earnings or employment. Effects on dependency are understated because evaluations do not capture deterrence effects. The sharp decline in AFDC in Wisconsin in recent years suggests the power of work requirements to drive the rolls down. ...|$|R
