50|$|Roll <b>forming,</b> <b>roll</b> bending or {{plate rolling}} is a {{continuous}} bending operation {{in which a}} long strip of metal (typically coiled steel) is passed through consecutive sets of rolls, or stands, each performing only an incremental part of the bend, until the desired cross-section profile is obtained.

40|$|Cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is an {{extremely}} important but little studied sheet metal forming process. In this thesis, the process of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is introduced and it is seen that <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design {{is central to the}} cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. The conventional design and manufacture of <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> is discussed and it is observed that surrounding the design process are a number of activities which although peripheral are time consuming and a possible source of error. A CAD/CAM system is described which alleviates many of the problems traditional to <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. New techniques for the calculation of strip length and controlling the means of forming bends are detailed. The CAD/CAM system's advantages and limitations are discussed and, whilst the system has numerous significant advantages, its principal limitation can be said to be the need to manufacture <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> and test them on a mill before a design can be stated satisfactory. A survey of the previous theoretical and experimental analysis of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is presented and is found to be limited. By considering the previous work, a method of numerical analysis of the cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process is proposed based on a minimum energy approach. Parallel to the numerical analysis, a comprehensive range of software has been developed to enhance the designer's visualisation of the effects of his <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. A complementary approach to the analysis of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design is the generation of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design, a method for the partial generation of designs is described. It is suggested that the two approaches should continue in parallel and that the limitation of each approach is knowledge of the cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. Hence, an initial experimental investigation of the rolling of channel sections is described. Finally, areas of potential future work are discussed...|$|R

40|$|At the {{division}} of Paper Technology a forming unitconsisting of headbox, <b>forming</b> <b>roll</b> unit and reservoir systemfor suspension recirculation has been constructed, with themain purpose to experimentally study the paper forming event byvisually following the fibre flow phenomena in the formingzone. The effect of various running parameters upon the pressuredistribution, which is in correlation to the flow phenomenaoccuring during forming, has been studied with a flush mountedpressure sensor. Some combinations of running parametersresulted in highly oscillating pressure pulses, which wereevaluated by their wavelength. The visualisation was made with a high-speed video cameraand a pulsed laser light source. The forming zone was observedvia a mirror mounted on the <b>forming</b> <b>roll,</b> thus following aspecific small area of the forming zone. This made it possibleto follow floc motions relative to the forming roll/wire. Theflocs were found to move towards the wire due to the dewateringflow wereupon the bottom part of the floc was pinned to thewire. If the suspensionspeed {{is different from the}} wire speedthe floc will be stretched out, because the upper part of thefloc has a slightly different speed in comparison to the bottompart. If this speed difference is high enough, the flocs maysplit and thus contribute to fragmentation. The floc-floc interaction has been studied in a Couetteapparatus. It has been observed that voids in the suspensionplay a central role for the floc break-up process. The reasonis belived to be that voids induce movement inside thesuspension, which is a prerequisite for floc break-up. Thefloc-floc relative movements have been found to obey simplelaws of rack-and-pinion principles. NR 2014080...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{roll forming}} {{is limited to}} {{components}} with uniform cross-section; the recently developed flexible roll forming (FRF) process {{can be used to}} form components which vary in both width and depth. It has been suggested that this process can be used to manufacture automotive components from Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) which has limited tensile elongation and is unsuitable for stamping. In the flexible roll forming process, the pre-cut blank is fed through a set of rolls; some rolls are computer-numerically controlled (CNC) to follow the 3 D contours of the part and hence parts with a variable cross-section can be produced. As with conventional roll forming, the number of forming stations is kept to a minimum, particularly the controlled roll stations, in order to limit tooling costs. This paper introduces a new flexible roll forming technique which can be used to form a complex shape with the minimum tooling requirements. In this method, the pre-cut blank is held between two dies and the whole system moves back and forth past CNC forming rolls. The <b>forming</b> <b>roll</b> changes its angle and position in each pass to incrementally form the part. In this work, the process is simulated using the commercial software package Copra FEA. The distribution of total strain and final part quality are investigated as well as related shape defects observed in the process. Different tooling concepts are used to improve the strain distribution and hence the part quality. The current work presents a new cost-effective flexible roll forming technique and minimizes the number of tool changes...|$|E
40|$|Planetary roller drives (PRD) with axial {{backlash}} {{have the highest}} load capacity amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which thread rolls are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between the roll turns operating with the screw and nut turns. These include rollers size variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of thread roll loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then the roll's turns mating with the nut along one of the roll's generatrices and the roll turns mating with the screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts thread turn flank angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on the mating roll turns along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average roll thread diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between the roll turns mating with the nut and the screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two <b>forming</b> <b>roll</b> generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts thread turns load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive threaded parts turns loading irregularity is strong...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} fluid dynamic {{mechanisms}} related to papermaking, specif- ically: the initial dewatering mechanisms during roll-forming and fibre motion in sedimentation and in shear flow. Pressure and wire position measurements {{have been conducted}} in a model resembling the forming zone and the measured pressure distributions are shown to have more complex patterns than the simple model p / T/R (where T is the wire tension and R is the roll radius). It is shown that an increase in wire tension has a similar effect as a decrease in flow-rate on {{the shape of the}} pressure distribution. In addition, it is shown that the drainage has a stabilizing effect on the dewatering pressure. The flow around the <b>forming</b> <b>roll</b> has also been modelled with the assump- tion that the wire is impermeable. A non-linear equation for the position of the wire is derived that clearly shows that the Weber number, We, is an im- portant parameter. The equation is linearized around the trivial solution and has a standing wave solution with a specific wavelength that scales with the We-number. Motion of non-Brownian fibre settling in a Newtonian fluid at a small but finite Reynolds number has been studied experimentally. Two different regimes of sedimentation were identified. For dilute suspensions, fibres gener- ally fall without flipping and may travel at velocities larger than that of an isolated particle. In the semi-dilute regime we found the settling process to be dominated by large-scale fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations scale with the suspension volume concentrationφ according toφ 1 / 3, which is similar to the findings for settling spheres. The influence of shear on fibre orientation in the near wall region was studied in cellulose acetate fibre suspensions. At low concentration and low aspect ratio fibres were observed to orient perpendicular to the streamwise direction (named rollers) in the near wall region whereas the orientation further into the suspension was unchanged. As the concentration and aspect ratio increased the fraction of rollers decreased. Finally, an evaluation of a commercial Ultra Velocity Profiler unit in fibre suspensions are presented. The idea was to determine the velocity and characterise the turbulence from ultra sound echoes from particles in the fluid. However, the spatial and/or temporal resolution of the measurements did not permit turbulence characterisation. These limitations might be possible to overcome and some procedures are proposed and evaluated. QC 2010102...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the water}} fed into a paper machine is removedmechanically in the forming and press sections. One of thefactor which has an {{important}} influence on mechanicaldewatering, i. e. in both forming and pressing, is thestress-strain behaviour of the fibre network. The focus of this thesis is {{on the development of}} improvedmathematical descriptions of the stress-strain behaviourexhibited by fibre networks in the forming and press sections. The first part of the thesis presents a physically based modelof the forming and densification of fibre mats in twin-wireformers. The model can calculate the ecect of the applicationof a varied load through the forming section. It was developedfrom mass and momentum balances of the fibre and liquid phases,the fibre mat stress-porosity relation and an expression forthe permeability {{as a function of the}} porosity. The fibre-matstress-porosity relation used is rate-independent and presentshysteresis. Simulations have been conducted to study theeffects of roll pressure, blade pulses, wire tension andbeating. The effect of sequential blade pressure pulses afterthe <b>forming</b> <b>roll</b> on the dewatering and the concentrationgradients could be characterised. The simulations alsoexhibited rewetting by expansion when the fibre mats left theforming roll. Increasing wire tension resulted in increaseddewatering, but the rate of increase diminished rapidly withincreasing tension. The simulation results also indicated thatbeating has a large influence on dewatering. The second part of the thesis presents two models of therate-dependent stress-strain behaviour of the fibre networkthat is observed in wet pressing. The first model was based onthe approach pioneered by Perzyna (1966) for strain-ratedependent plasticity and was quite satisfactory for calculatingthe stress-strain behaviour of the fibre network in singlepress nips. It was successfully applied for studyingdensification and dewatering in both normal wet pressing andhigh temperature wet pressing. However, the first model onlyincludes rate dependence in the compression phase of thecompressionexpansion cycle; the expansion phase is treated asbeing rate independent The second model of the stress-strain behaviour of the fibrenetwork treats both compression and expansion as being ratedependent, according to experimental observations. It is basedon the idea that the wet fibre web may be conceived as alayered network of restricted swelling gels. A swollen fibre isa restricted gel, the inner swelling pressure in a swollenfibre wall being balanced by the stresses in the fibre wallstructure. The observed rate dependence of wet webs in bothcompression and expansion phases was attributed to the flow ofwater out of and into the fibre walls. The second model gavepredictions that are in good agreement with results fromuniaxial experiments using pressure pulses of arbitrary shapefor both a single pulse and a sequence of pulses. It maytherefore be used as a general model for the rheologicalbehaviour of the wet fibre network in wet pressing, providedthe model parameters are estimated from experimental data withsmall experimental error.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} half century <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> has become a highly {{productive}} metal forming technology, well-established in the industry for the manufacturing of mass products. About 8 % of the annual world production of steel is processed by <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> mills. <b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> technology enables the manufacturing of profile-shaped products with an extremely wide spectrum of geometrical shapes. In lightweight construction, the utilization of roll-formed structures of high and ultra-high-strength steels has increased remarkably in the recent years. However, the application of those types of steel entails some disadvantages resulting in a decreasing forming capacity and enormous efforts to reach the required dimensional accuracy. Until a profile leaves the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> machine with the target quality, it is mostly necessary to align the <b>forming</b> <b>rolls</b> several times. Sometimes even design changes are required. This is the result of unreliable process planning. Furthermore, typical profile failures such as twist, flare and spring-back occur even stronger compared to mild steels. Nowadays, it is usual to control the dimensional accuracy of the profiles after the last forming stand. This kind of quality control has the following disadvantage: manufacturing errors are detected very late. Therefore, a continuous quality control process and an active manipulation during the forming process promise a large potential for an improvement of the dimensional accuracy and an increase of <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> productivity...|$|R
