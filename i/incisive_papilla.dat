40|$|Background/Aim. The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{especially}} nifedipine, causes gingival hyperplasia {{which leads to}} the destruction of the deeper periodontal tissues. During this process, inflammatory changes and the changes of colagen fibers occur. The aim {{of this study was to}} metrically compare the extent of proliferation of connective tissue in the deeper periodontal tissue in experimental animals regarding the dose and duration of nifedipine administration. Methods. The study involved 50 Wistar rats to which water solution of nifedipine was given in certain time intervals and doses. Before starting the experiment, i. e. before nifedipine administration, and in the defined time intervals, measuring of the morphology of gingival size was performed including the buccolingual and mesiodistal wideness and vertical altitude of the central interdental papilla. The measurement was performed by the use of a special graduated probe. Histometric analyses of the tissue samples were done on the sagital cross-sections in the direction from the top to the bottom of papilla on five levels. For the statistical analysis of the data, the established values to the extent of the most present changes were used. The mesiodistal and buccolingual diameters for the levels L 2 and L 3 were quantitively determined and compared. These values were compared to the vertical diameter of gingival growth determined before the onset of patohistologic analyses of the tissue samples. Results. At the beginning of the experiment, the volume of the lower <b>incisive</b> central <b>papilla</b> in the rats was 12 mm 3. The central interdental papilla vertical altitude was 6. 6 mm in rats which had received a lower dose of nifedipine, 8 mm in rats which had received a higher dose in the defined time intervals while the value for the control group was 3. 8 mm. Conclusion. The obtained results showed that the administration of nifedipine led to the extensive gingival hyperplasia in the experimental animals. Gingival hyperplasia correlates with both the dose of nifedipine and the duration of its administration...|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: The <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> remains {{relatively}} {{constant in}} position and is frequently {{used as an}} anatomic landmark for anterior teeth. Several {{attempts have been made}} to use the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> as guides to arrange maxillary anterior teeth for edentulous patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between maxillary anterior teeth and the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla,</b> while comparing the findings with the classical estimate value. Materials and methods: Horizontal distances between the labial surface of the central incisors and the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> [the distance from the labial surface of the central incisors and the posterior border of the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> (CPIP), the distance from the labial surface of the central incisors and the anterior border of the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> (CAIP), and the distance from the labial surface of the central incisors and the center of the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> (CCIP) ] and the size of the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> (SIP) were measured by a digital caliper on the stone casts formed for 103 dentate persons. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate and quantify the correlation, while simple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the strength of the association between the variables (α =  0. 05). Results: Pearson correlation coefficients for SIP and the distance between the labial surface of the central incisors and the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> (CPIP, CAIP, and CCIP) were significant (P <  0. 05). A simple linear regression analysis of the data was performed, which showed that SIP contributed significantly to the prediction of the distances between the labial surface of the central incisors and the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> (CPIP and CCIP; P <  0. 05).

For this purpose 100 maxillary casts of Sudanese dental students in Khartoum University were examined. Age ranged from 17 - 25 years. The distances from the labial surface of the central incisor to the center and posterior point of the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> were measured. The distance between the canine cusp tips was also measured. The area on the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> where the intercanine line passed was indicated. Prior to measurements a dental surveyor was modified to standardize the positions of the casts. The occlusal plane was the reference plane.

40|$|Background and Aims: Teeth {{position}} {{is an important}} component in a facial esthetic. Distance between <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> and incisal edge of the maxillary centrals is a stable landmark in reconstruction anterior teeth of maxilla. Therefore in this study, we tried to establish this index in patients who recourse to the fixed prosthodontics dentistry faculty of Tabriz. Materials and Methods: The initial samples consisted of 59 patients referred to prosthodontics department of Tabriz dental faculty and took upper jaw impressions with irreversible hydrocolloid. Then, records poured by moldana stone until 15 minutes and needed anatomical spots were highlighted. The horizontal distance from anterior part on incisal edge of the maxillary centrals to anterior border, center and posterior border of incisive papillae were measured and statistically inspected. Results: The mean distance between the most anterior point of the incisal edge of the maxillary central incisors and the middle point, anterior border and posterior border of the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> was 8. 54, 7. 12, 10. 28 mm with standard deviations of 0. 83, 0. 75, 1. 002 mm.

40|$|The {{achievement}} of an esthetic restoration is a con-stant challenge to dentists. To fulfill a natural appear-ance in {{the rehabilitation of}} deficient dentition, the upper anterior teeth should be positioned {{as close as possible}} to the positions originally occupied by the natural teeth, because the dentate state usually has proper soft tissue support with younger appearance. In undertaking any prosthetic work, it is important to examine certain aspects that can provide useful indica-tions for defining the most appropriate teeth positions. It is believed that the application of some anatomic landmarks can provide a reliable reference for arrang-ing and checking the position of the maxillary ante-rior teeth, especially in complete dentures. The most obvious landmark that seems to survive relatively intact from the dentate state is the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla.</b> When faced with an edentulous patient that does not provide any natural morphologic references, the use of the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> of the patient is indispensable for determining the suitable position of the maxillary teeth [1 – 3]...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the dental midline is necessary in most dental procedures. "nOne of the methods to fulfill this goal {{is to determine the}} facial midline based on the midpoints of the"nforehead, nose, upper lip and chin.

No significant difference was found neither in the tooth length nor the distance between the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> and foveola palatine between the dentulous and edentulous group (p > 0. 05), although the value was higher for the length of the upper central incisor (t = 1. 1) than for the distance from the incisal papillae to foveola palatine (t = 0. 16). The main reason for this fact is that the distance from the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> to foveola palatine does not change with age or teeth extraction, while the bigger length of artificialteeth,measuredinthisstudy,canbeattributedto elongation of the upper lip and reduced anterior face height in the edentulous patient.

40|$|The patent nasopalatine duct {{is a rare}} anomaly in the {{anterior}} maxilla. During the early fetal period, a bilateral and epithelium-lined duct is formed within the primary palatal process as an oro-nasal communication. However, the duct obliterates and degenerates before birth. A persisting patent or through-and-through nasoplatine duct is therefore considered a developmental anomaly. A patent nasopalatine duct normally presents as one (or two) tiny openings lateral or posterior to the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla.</b> In such a case, the ducts can be partially or completely probed with gutta-percha points with subsequent radiographic imaging. The patients report strange sensations such as squeaking noise, palatal drainage, nasal regurgitation, or airway communication between nasal and oral cavities; however, patients rarely complain about pain. About 40 cases have been documented in the literature. We describe two patients who have been referred to our department for evaluation of "sinus tracts" in {{the anterior}} palate. Since a patent nasopalatine duct can become a diagnostic pitfall, a thorough inspection of the mucosa around the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> is essential to avoid unnecessary endodontic or surgical interventions {{in the area of}} the central maxillary incisors.

We took scaled photos of all crania using support stand, with equal approximation, in three views (coronal view, lateral view, skull base view). Digital material was computer processed. Results. We developed craniometric technique to analyze the morphology and topography of HIP plane (Hamulus–Incisive Papilla). Transverse facial size was found to be 1. 2 times less compared to the transverse cranial diameter, and transverse facial size between zy–zy (zygion) points — 2. 5 times larger than the distance between H (hamular notcher) points right and left. Facial n–gn (nasion–gnation) size was found to have medium correlation relationship with the altitude of HIP triangle. Anthropometric ipp (<b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> posterior) point appeared to be by 10 % more stable than ip (<b>incisive</b> <b>papilla)</b> point. Therefore, for HIP-plane determination we recommend using not incisive papiila (ip), but the point, which is 3 mm distal (ipp point) and located on distal bony edge of the incisive canal opening. The analysis of the lateral view of cranium showed the relations of occlusal plane of maxilla and HIP-plane to be characterized by strong positive correlation.

Attention has been paid to the holocephalan head morphology, but there has been no mention of this particular organ in the literature. The PO is a soft-tissue mass located within a slight hollow in between the two vomerine toothplates, and it protrudes into the oral cavity, resembling the mammalian <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla.</b> It is characterized by dense connective tissue with abundant collagen and elastic fibers and no muscular tissue. The robust innervation but low density of taste buds suggest a role in gustation for the PO, but primary utility in general mechanical sensitivity likely implicated in food sorting. The presence of numerous multicellular serous glands in the anterior/dorsal part of the PO is quite surprising because, in gnathostome fish, the presence of multicellular glands within the mouth has been reported in only the rare case of teeth-associated venom glands. Hypothesized roles for these glands could include food lubrication, digestion and defense against pathogens. In the literature, the presence of a PO has been demonstrated in many published images of chimaeroid fishes, but has gone unnoticed.

The histological examinations revealed two types of lining epithelium; non sensory type lining the cranial portion and the lateral wall of the middle portion of the vomeronasal duct (VND), whereas an olfactory type was the lining epithelium of the medial wall of the middle and the whole caudal portions. The lamina propria submucosa exhibited vascular loose connective tissues, serous glands, nerve bundles and encapsulated by hyaline cartilage. Conclusion: The obtaining olfactory epithelium in VNO may indicate an essential role of this organ in sexual relationships and sociosexual behaviors through perception of pheromones...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroud/purposePalatal rugae (PR) are {{situated}} in the anterior part of the hard palate and possess unique and stable characteristics {{that can be used}} in human identification. Their pattern of orientation is established early in life and remains stable thereafter. The purposes of this study were to convert PRP into alphanumeric codes in order to generate scanable Quick Response (QR) codes, to demonstrate uniqueness of PRP using the codes in the study population, and to determine the sexual dimorphism of PRP in the study population. Materials and methodsOrthodontic dental casts of 256 Saudi male and female patients were photographed after ensuring standardization. Individual rugae characteristics, strength and their displacement from <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> and midpalatine raphe were recorded in the form of an alphanumeric code which was subsequently converted to a QR code. Computer assisted check was performed for possible match in the 256 alpha numeric codes while QR codes were scanned using a bar code scanner to determine uniqueness. Sexual dimorphism of palatal rugae (PR) was also analysed. ResultsAll alphanumeric codes of the study population were unique. Mean number of PR in males and females differed significantly (P =  0. 0001). Differences in rugae characteristics and strengths in males and females were also present. ConclusionThe alphanumeric and QR code of the rugae pattern are unique for each individual and can be used for digital record keeping and person identification. A high degree of sexual dimorphism in PR exists in the studied Arab population studied...|$|E
40|$|Context: Variations in palatal bone {{thickness}} (PBT) {{at various}} locations have caused considerable problems when using these sites for anchorage purposes. Aims: To find the comparative {{thickness of the}} palatal bone at different locations and to validate its morphology for anchorage purposes using mini-implants (MI). Settings and Design: This investigation was undertaken to compare the mean PBT and level of significance of differences {{between male and female}} subjects and between two different age-groups. Materials and Methods: The computed tomography (CT) data for 60 patients (30 males and 30 females) in two different age-groups (group A: 15 - 24 years; group B: 25 - 35 years) were imported into CAD-based medical software, (MIMICS®; Materialise, Belgium) for multiplanar reconstruction. The measurements were made in two planes- transverse and sagittal-and at different positions in each of the planes. Statistical Analysis: The mean and standard deviations of the PBT at different points were calculated. The Student′s t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for comparisons between the groups. Results: Significant variations were observed in the thickness of the palatal bone for both groups tested, with the anterior region at 4 mm behind the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> showing the maximum thickness. Conclusions: Despite the palatal bone being thickest in the mid-palatal suture (MPS) region, this is not the ideal site for anchorage purposes due to inadequate calcification and interposition of connective tissue, especially in young growing children. So, the alternate optimum position is the paramedian region, 3 mm lateral to the MPS and 4 mm from the incisive foramen (IF) ...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{in-vitro}} {{study was}} to assess the influence of shallow and deep palatal forms on the movement of teeth during the processing of complete denture prosthesis. Materials and Methods: Maxillary casts with shallow and deep palatal forms were selected and duplicated to make 10 casts of each palatal form. Base plates were constructed and teeth were arranged in their anatomic positions. Metal pins with true apex were placed on the central groove of the right and left first molars and one on the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> area as a reference point. Casts were scanned using i-CAT Vision Q 1. 9 (i-CAT cone beam 3 D dental imaging system by Imaging Sciences International, PA, USA), which has 360 ° rotational tomography. The distances between the apices of metallic pin inserts on the teeth and fitted point of reference were recorded in buccopalatal axes at waxed up stage, after deflasking, and after finishing and polishing. Results: Results showed a statistically significant movement of teeth in shallow and deep palatal forms during all stages of complete denture processing. In shallow palatal form dentures, there was a significant tooth movement in palatal direction between Stages 1 and 2 (P ≤ 0. 05) and buccal movement between Stages 2 and 3. In deep palatal form dentures, teeth showed a statistically significant (P ≤ 0. 05) movement in buccal direction during all stages of denture processing. Conclusion: Teeth showed significant movement during processing of acrylic resin dentures. Overall, the movement of teeth in shallow palatal form dentures was in palatal direction, whereas in deep palatal form dentures, the movement of teeth was in buccal direction...|$|E
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Acrylic resin {{complete}} dentures exhibit certain unavoidable dimensional changes. Processing shrinkage {{and expansion}} due to water uptake are 2 important aspects influencing dimensional accuracy. PURPOSE: This study investigated linear dimensional changes and water sorption of dentures processed by dry and wet heat with different rates of cooling. METHODS: Fine crosses marked on tinfoil inserts were {{placed at the}} <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> and tuberosity regions of edentulous maxillary casts and incorporated into the dentures during polymerization by 3 processing techniques. A traveling microscope {{was used to measure}} the distances between the reference points to determine dimensional changes. Water uptake and content were determined by the mass changes of the dentures with an electronic balance. Data of linear dimensional change and water sorption were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of variance, respectively. Bonferroni simultaneous confidence intervals (95 %) were applied for multiple comparison. RESULTS: Dry heat-processed and water bath-processed acrylic resin dentures did not exhibit significant differences in shrinkage (0. 42 % to 0. 58 %) at water saturation. Amounts of water sorption of dentures processed by dry and wet heat (0. 50 and 0. 48 mass%, respectively) were not significantly different, and their associated expansion did not entirely compensate for the processing shrinkage. The initial water content of dry heat-processed dentures (1. 77 mass%) was unexpectedly slightly higher than that of wet heat-processed dentures (1. 68 mass%). The rate at which the dentures cooled did not affect their initial water content and subsequent water uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Water uptake of dry and wet heat-processed acrylic resin dentures after deflasking was in both cases low, and the dentures did not reveal significant differences in shrinkage at water saturation. Air oven-processed and water bath-processed acrylic resin dentures show similar dimensional shrinkage at water saturation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: Identification is the {{establishment}} of identity of an individual. The basis of dental identification {{is based on the}} observation that no two individuals can have same dentition. Palatal rugae are irregular, asymmetric ridges of the mucous membrane extending laterally from the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> and the anterior part of the palatal raphe. The location of palatal rugae inside the oral cavity confers them with stability even when exposed to high temperatures or trauma. Their resistance to trauma and their apparent unique appearance has suggested their use as a tool for forensic identification. Aims: To record the biometric characteristics of shape, size, direction, number and position of palatal rugae and analyze whether palatal rugoscopy {{can be used as a}} tool for personal identification and for sex determination. Settings and Design: A cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of 100 subjects (50 males, 50 females) between 18 and 25 years. Maxillary impressions were made with elastomeric impression material and dental stone was used to make models. The palatal rugae patterns were traced and analyzed with a magnifying hand lens. The biometric characteristics of number, size, shape, and direction were analyzed using Thomaz and Kotz classification (1983). The casts were coded to blind the examiners about the identity of the subjects. Statistical Analysis Used: Unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA using SPSS 19. 0 statistical program for Windows. Results: The average number of rugae was slightly more in females. Wavy (44. 9 %) and curved (41. 8 %) shapes were more prevalent. Maximum number of rugae was found in E quadrant (40. 73 %). The average size was 9. 221 mm. Most rugae were forwardly directed in both groups. Conclusion: This study concluded that rugae pattern are highly individualistic and can be used as a supplementary method for personal identification and sex determination. Further inter-observer and intra-observer variability were not found to be significant, which further validates the use of rugoscopy as a forensic tool...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of gingival papillae in the anterior maxilla {{is essential to}} the aesthetics of the smile. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate alterations in the height of the upper central <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla,</b> before and after orthodontic movement, using study casts and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Sixteen patients between the ages of 13 and 18 years underwent orthodontic treatment. The height of the papillae was calculated in both initial and fi nal study casts by drawing a horizontal line tangent to the zenith of the central incisors and inscribing a vertical line perpendicular to the horizontal line. Papilla height was defi ned as the distance from the tip of the papilla to the point of intersection between the two lines. Initial and fi nal (after orthodontic treatment) CBCT images were analyzed, and the height of interproximal papillae was calculated by measuring the distance from the tip of the papilla to the alveolar bone crest. This measurement was performed in both sagittal and coronal plane views. Data were statistically analyzed using the Student t test. The level of signifi cance was 5 %. Initial mean papilla height was 4. 6 ± 0. 8 mm, and the fi nal value in study casts was 4. 3 ± 1. 2 mm; there was not a statistically signifi cant difference between initial and fi nal values (p = 0. 309). In the CBCT coronal sections, initial mean papilla height was 3. 5 ± 1. 2 mm vs. 3. 1 ± 0. 7 mm after treatment (p = 0. 094); again, no statistically signifi cant differences were observed. In the sagittal plane, there was a signifi cant difference (p = 0. 05) between initial (3. 7 ± 1. 1 mm) and fi nal (3. 1 ± 0. 6 mm) mean papilla height. According to our fi ndings, and to the different measuring techniques employed, the height of the papilla changed little as a result of orthodontic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Anchorage {{control is}} a {{critical}} consideration when planning treatment for patients with dental and skeletal malocclusions. To obtain sufficient stability of implants, {{the thickness of the}} soft tissue and the cortical-bone in the placement site must be considered; so as to provide an anatomical map in order to assist the clinician in the placement of the implants. Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the thickness of soft- and hard-tissue. Materials and Methods: To measure soft tissue and cortical-bone thicknesses, 12 maxillary cross-sectional specimens were obtained from the cadavers, which were made at three maxillary mid-palatal suture areas: The interdental area between the first and second premolars (Group 1), the second premolar and the first molar (Group 2), and the first and second molars (Group 3). Sectioned samples along with reference rulers were digitally scanned. Scanned images were calibrated and measurements were made with image-analysis software. We measured the thickness of soft and hard-tissues at five sectional areas parallel to the buccopalatal cementoenamel junction (CEJ) line at 2 -mm intervals and also thickness of soft tissue at the six landmarks including the <b>incisive</b> <b>papilla</b> (IP) on the palate. The line perpendicular to the occlusal plane was made and measurement was taken at 4 -mm intervals from the closest five points to IP. Results: (1) Group 1 : 6 mm from CEJ in buccal side and 2 mm from CEJ in palatal side. (2) Group 2 : 8 mm from CEJ in buccal side and 4 mm from CEJ in palatal side. (3) Group 3 : 8 mm from CEJ in buccal side and 8 mm from CEJ in palatal side. Conclusions: The best site for placement of implant is with thinnest soft tissue and thickest hard tissue, which is in the middle from CEJ in buccal side and closest from CEJ in palatal side in Group 1 and faraway from CEJ in buccal side and closest from CEJ in palatal side in Group 2 and faraway from CEJ in buccal side and faraway from CEJ in palatal side in Group 3...|$|E
