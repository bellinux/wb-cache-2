25|$|Bradman was hurried by Gilbert, but {{he somehow}} managed to keep the first ball out. The second was a {{harmless}} one, just outside leg. The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one. Bradman tried to counterattack, {{but it was too}} quick. The top-edge went up in the air, and Waterman took it easily.|$|E

He continued (without paying), forced his way through the locks at Harpers Ferry and Lock 5, until Georgetown, where he was served notice for $120 in fees plus $4.08 for the waybill.

25|$|The {{first of}} United's {{last two games}} was at home to West Ham United at midday on Saturday, 3 May. Needing the win, United {{got off to a}} great start, as Ronaldo put them ahead in the third minute with a {{deflected}} shot. 20 minutes later, he got his second of the game and 30th league goal of the season. West Ham failed to deal with Owen Hargreaves' left-footed cross, which dropped onto Ronaldo's thigh and bounced over the line. Former West Ham player Carlos Tevez made it 3–0 in the 26th minute, rifling a 25-yard shot over Robert Green in the Hammers goal. However, Dean Ashton pulled one back for West Ham with an audacious bicycle kick after Wes Brown's clearing header only went straight upwards. Just before half-time, as West Ham were looking to be settling into a rhythm, an altercation between Lucas Neill and Nani resulted in the Portuguese international headbutting the Australian, before going to ground himself, only to find a red card waiting for him when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his feet. This left United a man down, with a whole half left to play. Nevertheless, despite the man advantage, West Ham were unable to capitalise, and ended up going 4–1 down in the 59th minute. Michael Carrick picked the ball up in midfield off a poor West Ham clearance, before letting rip from 30yards. His shot took a large deflection off Lucas Neill, wrong-footing Robert Green, and the ball nestled in the bottom-left corner of the net. Darren Fletcher also came close to scoring late in the game, after coming on as a substitute, but his shot deflected back off the inside of the post. The match finished 4–1 to United, but Chelsea's win against Newcastle United two days later kept the two teams level on points, meaning that the title race would go to {{the last day of the}} season for the first time since 1999.|$|E
500|$|Hecht-Hill-Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to {{familiarize}} himself with New York City before shooting the movie. In Notes on Sweet Smell of Success, Mackendrick said, [...] "One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly {{of the area}} between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks. This was, I argued, essential {{to the story of}} characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed".

500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city. After waiting {{for a long time to}} hear from him, and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, went to jail, attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E

500|$|After the race, Simpson {{prepared}} for the world road championships with distance training and criteriums. At the world championships on 3 September, the [...] road race consisted of twenty-four laps of a varying circuit at Sallanches in the French Alps. Simpson crashed on the third lap while descending in wet conditions, damaging a pedal. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the peloton, launching a solo attack on a descent; he then chased down the group of four leaders with two laps to go. On the last lap he was dropped by three riders, finishing six seconds behind. On 17 October, Simpson rode in the Giro di Lombardia. Halfway through the race {{he was given the}} wrong musette (bag) by his team in the feed zone, and threw it away. With the head of the race reduced to five riders, Molteni's Gianni Motta attacked. Simpson {{was the only one who}} could follow, but he began to feel the effects of not eating. Motta gave him part of his food, which sustained him for a while.

[...] bought the contract from Louviot, which ran {{until the end of}} the season. Simpson's season opened with Paris–Nice; he fell out of contention after a series of tyre punctures in the opening stages, using the rest of the race as training. He withdrew from the race on the final stage to rest for his next race, Milan–San Remo; after breaking away by himself he stopped beside the road, which annoyed his fellow riders. At Milan–San Remo, Simpson was in a four-rider breakaway; his tyre punctured, and although <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the front, he finished nineteenth. He placed third in the Tour of Flanders in a three-rider sprint. In Paris–Roubaix Simpson worked for teammate, and winner, Emile Daems, finishing ninth. In the one-day Paris–Brussels he was in a breakaway near the Belgian border; with [...] remaining he was left with world road race champion Jean Stablinski of St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani, who attacked on a cobbled climb in Alsemberg outside Brussels. Simpson's bike slipped a gear, and Stablinski stayed away for the victory.

500|$|The Day the Earth Stood Still: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was orchestrated and {{conducted}} by Timothy Williams. Tyler Bates {{was brought in}} to compose the score for The Day the Earth Stood Still after Derrickson heard his work on The Devil's Rejects and Slither. Instead of imitating the original score by Bernard Herrmann, Bates decided to try to convey the updated message of the new film, and he assumed that most people would not even realize it was a remake. Bates said, [...] "People revere an original property and feel that it's sacred, but frankly, there's a good story to be retold, as it applies to the climate of the world now. If that's something beyond the scope of a person's ability to take in, on a new level, without necessarily using the original as a criteria for whether or not they're going to enjoy it, then they probably shouldn't bother themselves with it." [...] The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith. When <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> L.A., he created a sound loop on his GuitarViol to which Derrickson responded, [...] "I think that's the score!", when it was played for him. Bates utilized the theremin, which Herrmann heavily used for the original film's score. Bates and the theremin player he hired used the instrument in a manner reminiscent of a sound effect, especially during Klaatu's surgery. A short segment from Bach's Goldberg Variations is heard playing in the background of the Professor's home when Klaatu visits the Professor which {{was not included in the}} film's accompanying soundtrack release.|$|E
