As a result, increasing electric technologies contribute promotion of electric loads in automobiles. These substantially increase <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> consumption in automobiles. However, there is a limit of supplying <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> generated by the alternator.

In such circumstances decisions with regard to the connectablilty of further electrical generators or loads at particular parts and zones of an <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> distribution system can be quantified by reference to the actual fault level rather than the theoretical worse case scenario level and therefore avoid unnecessary upgrading of transmission equipment or denying access to the <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> system...|$|R
