40|$|AbstractThe {{proposed}} {{experimental work}} intends to analyse the thermal {{performance of a}} TES unit incorporated into a ventilation system under different working conditions. The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for the solidification process of the RT 25. Contrary, for the melting of the RT 25, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity does not reduce the temperature difference linearly, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature furthermore from 36 °C to 38 °C did not affect the melting time. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature plays a significant role on the melting process, reducing linearly the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate, however does not influence the solidification process, similar <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate were obtained for all condition.

2500|$|Diesel fuel [...] {{in general}} is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines, whose fuel {{ignition}} takes place, without any spark, {{as a result of}} compression of the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> mixture and then injection of fuel.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. <b>Air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities of 0. 6 m/s, 1. 6 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time. For lower <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity the cooling and heating loads achieve lower values but remain nearly constant {{over a longer period}} of time. The effectiveness reaches its highest values for the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity of 0. 6 m/s for the charging and discharging processes. It has been concluded that discharging time can be extended by reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity and making the technology more suitable for heating and cooling applications for the buildings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size on (i) the flowfield {{generated}} in a dry powder inhaler, and (ii) the device-specific resistance, and the subsequent effect on powder deagglomeration. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{analysis was used to}} simulate the flowfield generated in an Aerolizer 1 with different <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> sizes at 30, 45, and 60 l/min. Dispersion performance of the modified inhalers was measured using mannitol powder and a multistage liquid impinger at the same flow rates. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size had a varying effect on powder dispersion depending on the flow rate. At low flow rates (30 and 45 l/min), reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size increased the inhaler dispersion performance by increasing the flow turbulence and particle impaction velocities above their critical levels for maximal powder dispersion. At 60 l/min, re-ducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size reduced the inhaler dispersion performance by releasing a large amount of powder from the device before the turbulence levels and particle impaction velocities could be fully developed. The results demonstrate that the maximal inhaler dispersion performance can be predicted if details of the device flowfield are known...|$|R
