5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

25|$|Modern buried pipe drains often {{consist of}} corrugated, flexible, and {{perforated}} plastic (PE or PVC) pipe lines wrapped with an envelope or <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> {{to improve the}} permeability around the pipes and to prevent entry of soil particles, which is especially important in fine sandy and silty soils. The surround may consist of synthetic fibre (geotextile).|$|E
25|$|If the wet/dry filter {{is placed}} {{on top of the}} aquarium, water is pumped over a number of {{perforated}} trays containing filter wool or some other <b>filter</b> <b>material.</b> The water trickles through the trays, keeping the filter wool wet but not completely submerged, allowing aerobic bacteria to grow and aiding biological filtration. The water returns to the aquarium like rain.|$|E
40|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>materials</b> are {{required}} to be cohesionless. They ensure safety of embankment dams against fault movement. At present, {{from this point of}} view, we have the criterion that the percentage of the filters passing the # 200 sieve (0. 074 mm) should be less than 5 %. However we can use any soil for filters, if we can confirm their high permeability and non-cohesion. We have performed Sand Castle tests proposed by P.

25|$|Mechanical filter {{respirators}} retain {{particulate matter}} such as dust created during woodworking or metal processing, when contaminated air is {{passed through the}} <b>filter</b> <b>material.</b> Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations {{of two or more}} of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.|$|E
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{manufacture}} a color filter for large-sized TFT LCD panels, the ink-jet printing {{technology has been}} extensively used since it affords a facile and economic production process. To apply ink-jet printing technology, dye-type color <b>filter</b> <b>materials</b> are preferred to pigment-type compounds because dye color filters are cheaper and have an easy control of fabrication process and a superior chromatic property, whereas the ink-jet nozzle is often blocked by insoluble pigment particles. However, dye-type color <b>filter</b> <b>materials</b> are needed to overcome the poor thermal stability for the high durability of TFT LCDs.|$|R
500|$|While {{the fire}} bore marked {{similarities}} to the 1957 fire, {{the level of}} contamination was less severe because the HEPA filters in the exhaust system did not burn through (After the 1957 fire, the <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> was changed from cellulose to nonflammable fiberglass).

40|$|Filter {{treatment}} {{may be a}} viable means for removing the nitrate (NO 3 โ), phosphate (PO 43 โ), and pesticides discharged with agricultural drainage waters that cause adverse environmental impacts within the U. S. on local, regional, and national scales. Laboratory batch test screening for agricultural drainage water treatment potential was conducted on 58 industrial product/byproduct <b>filter</b> <b>materials</b> grouped into six categories: (1) high carbon content media; (2) high iron content media; (3) high aluminum content media; (4) surfactant modified clay/zeolite; (5) coal combustion residuals; and (6) spent foundry sands. Based on a percent contaminant removal criteria of 75 % or greater, seven industrial products/byproducts were found to meet this standard for NO 3 โ alone, 44 met this standard for PO 43 โ, and 25 met this standard for the chlorinated triazine herbicide, atrazine. Using a 50 % or greater contaminant removal criteria, five of the industrial product/byproduct <b>filter</b> <b>materials</b> exhibited potential for removing NO 3 โ, PO 43 โ, and atrazine together; eight showed capability for combined NO 3 โ and PO 43 โ removal; 21 showed capability for combined PO 43 โ and atrazine removal; and nine showed capability for combined NO 3 โ and atrazine removal.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the removal of iron and manganese in water treatment. The main goal is to determine applicability and suitability of commercially available <b>filter</b> <b>materials</b> for the process for removing iron and manganese from water. The issue of iron and manganese removal water treatment was investigated {{on the basis of}} a literature review that summarizes the possible methods of removing iron and manganese from water. Subsequently, four industrially produced <b>filter</b> <b>materials</b> were selected and tested in laboratory. Condition for selection was that the materials did not require regeneration. This work has shown that the use of industrially produced <b>filter</b> <b>materials</b> is advantageous in appropriately defined operating conditions. Removing iron and manganese with these materials may be a suitable alternative to the methods used today. Their advantage lies in the long life cycle without requiring dosage of oxidizing agent. The other advantage is the possibility to remove the seasonally occurring increased concentration of iron and manganese. Their use is likely to be suitable for automatic operation of the drinking water treatment plant...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{class of}} UV {{fluorescent}} bulb {{is designed for}} use in [...] "bug zapper" [...] flying insect traps. [...] Insects are attracted to the UV light, which {{they are able to}} see, and are then electrocuted by the device. These bulbs use the same UV-A emitting phosphor blend as the filtered blacklight, but since they do not need to suppress visible light output, they do not use a purple <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> in the bulb. Plain glass blocks out less of the visible mercury emission spectrum, making them appear light blue-violet to the naked eye. These lamps are referred to by the designation [...] "blacklight" [...] or [...] "BL" [...] in some North American lighting catalogs. [...] These types are not suitable for applications which require the low visible light output of [...] "BLB" [...] tubes lamps.|$|E
2500|$|Benefits of {{this type}} of filter are that they can provide a high volume of <b>filter</b> <b>material</b> without {{reducing}} the internal space in the aquarium, and that they can be disconnected from the tank for cleaning/maintenance and replaced without disturbing the aquarium interior or occupants. Also, as a filter with external plumbing, it supports in-line installation of other aquarium equipment, such as water heaters and carbon dioxide diffusers. Such equipment can be removed from the tank and installed in-line into the return pipe of the filter. [...] Disadvantages of canister filters include the increased cost and complexity relative to internal filters and difficulties in cleaning the tubes which transfer water to and from the aquarium. There is also the risk of a leak, which naturally is an issue for any filter placed outside of the aquarium.|$|E
