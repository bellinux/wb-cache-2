5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style.

5|$|Between 1845 and 1847, Belgian-French {{composer}} César Franck {{wrote an}} orchestral piece based on Victor Hugo's poem Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne.

However, Franck did not publish or perform his piece; neither did he set about defining the <b>genre.</b> Liszt's determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre's inventor.|$|E

5|$|Classical thinkers {{employed}} classification {{as a way}} {{to define}} and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each <b>genre,</b> based on the underlying purposes of the <b>genre.</b> Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Problem of Speech Genres" [...] {{deals with}} the {{difference}} between Saussurean linguistics and language as a living dialogue (translinguistics). In a relatively short space, this essay takes up a topic about which Bakhtin had planned to write a book, making the essay a rather dense and complex read. It is here that Bakhtin distinguishes between literary and everyday language. According to Bakhtin, <b>genres</b> exist not merely in language, but rather in communication. In dealing with <b>genres,</b> Bakhtin indicates {{that they have been}} studied only within the realm of rhetoric and literature, but each discipline draws largely on <b>genres</b> that exist outside both rhetoric and literature. These extraliterary <b>genres</b> have remained largely unexplored. Bakhtin makes the distinction between primary <b>genres</b> and secondary <b>genres,</b> whereby primary <b>genres</b> legislate those words, phrases, and expressions that are acceptable in everyday life, and secondary <b>genres</b> are characterized by various types of text such as legal, scientific, etc.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Resident Evil 4 {{attempted}} {{to redefine the}} <b>genre</b> by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming, broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action <b>genre.</b> Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers {{to suggest that the}} Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror <b>genre,</b> by demolishing the <b>genre</b> conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming, and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the <b>genre</b> has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the <b>genre</b> lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror.|$|E

The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36million viewers, and the finale was the second most watched television broadcast of the year, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of Friends and Frasier, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom <b>genre.</b> Expressed opinions varied between a signaling {{of the end of the}} sitcom <b>genre,</b> a small decline in the large history of the <b>genre,</b> and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.|$|E

50|$|New <b>genres</b> {{can arise}} by the {{development}} of new forms and styles of music and also simply by creating a new categorization.

If two or more existing <b>genres</b> influence the emergence of a new one, a fusion between them can be said to have taken place.

Overall, the application of alternative <b>genres</b> {{is considered to be}} a generative act that provides an opportunity to take a fresh look and to gain deeper understanding of the subject matter. Nonetheless, paradoxically the prevailing <b>genres</b> have much inertia, in spite of the inherent boundary spanning nature of alternative <b>genres.</b> Building on their own recent empirical research, the panelists will debate the potential value of alternative <b>genres</b> as unconventional modality of IS scholarship and how alternative <b>genres</b> might be utilized to support the discipline's the next leap forward...|$|R
