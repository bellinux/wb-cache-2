40|$|Bibliography: pages 69 - 71. The {{design and}} use of a {{portable}} dynamic hardness tester is described. The thesis begins {{with a description of}} the more common <b>static</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> and the usefulness of such tests in industry. It shows a correlation between the different types of hardness and also between hardness and other material parameters such as tensile strength. A thorough investigation of the principles involved in the indentation processes using conical and spherical indenters under static and dynamic loading is given so that the reasons for the correlations may be more clearly understood. A series of test specimens <b>tested</b> by conventional <b>static</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> (Brinell, Vickers and Rockwell) are used as calibration specimens for the dynamic tester. Both a spherical and conical tip are used. The results of these tests are compared and analyzed. The dynamic tester may then be programmed so that it correlates with the results of the <b>static</b> <b>tests.</b> A set of guidelines for the use of such a portable tester is then given...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{relationships}} between the kinetics of precipitation and growth of the intermetallic phase γ’ [Ni 3 (Al,Ti) ] and the strengthening magnitude obtained in a high-temperature Fe–Ni alloy of the A- 286 type has been studied. In order to accomplish {{the goal of the}} study, the author used the LSW coagulation theory and Brown and Ham’s conventional analysis of strengthening by ordered particles. Design/methodology/approach: The samples were subjected to a solution heat treatment at 980 °C/ 2 h/water and then aged at 715, 750, and 780 °C, with holding times 0. 5 - 500 h. The heat-treated samples were subjected to structural analyses (TEM, X-ray diffraction) and analyses of mechanical properties (<b>hardness</b> <b>test,</b> <b>static</b> tensile <b>test,</b> and impact test). Findings: Direct measurements on the electron micrographs allowed to calculate the structural parameters of the γ’ phase, i. e. mean diameter, volume fraction and mean distance between particles. In accordance with the LSW theory, linear dependencies of changes in mean diameter as a function of aging time (t 1 / 3) were elaborated. The author carried out analyses of strengthening and flow stress (Δτ) increases {{as a function of the}} particle size of the γ’ phase and determined the value of the antiphase boundary energy (γAPB) for the analyzed Fe–Ni alloy. Practical implications: The obtained relationships of the growth of the γ’ phase particles as a function of temperature and aging time can be used to determine the magnitude of strengthening and flow stress in high-temperature Fe–Ni alloys during extended aging or usage. Originality/value: This study exploits LSW coagulation theory and Brown and Ham’s conventional analysis to describe precipitation strengthening by ordered particles of the intermetallic phase γ’ in a high temperature Fe–Ni alloy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Microstructural and {{mechanical}} characteristics of Al- 6 Si- 2 Cu alloy for engine mount bracket prepared by gravity casting (as-cast) and die-casting (as-diecast) process have been investigated. For the microstructural characterization, the {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), optical microscope (OM), scan-ning electron microscope (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) analyses are conducted. For the inter-metallic phases, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) are also conducted with quantitative and qualitative analysis. Micro Vickers <b>hardness</b> and <b>static</b> tensile <b>test</b> are achieved in order to mea-sure mechanical properties of alloys. Secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of as-cast and as-diecast show 37 um and 18 um, respectively. A large amount of coarsen eutectic Si, Al 2 Cu intermetallic phase and Fe-rich phases are identified in the Al- 6 Si- 2 Cu alloy. Mechanical properties of gravity casting alloy are much {{higher than those of}} die-casting alloy. Especially, yield strength and elongation of gravity casting alloy show 2 times higher than die-casting alloy.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve trainees’ {{operational}} quality of <b>static</b> <b>test</b> of guidance station of one antiaircraft missile, a <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulator is necessary to gain the goal. It {{is obvious that the}} key problem of developing the simulator is how to generate the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> signals of the simulator. Aiming to solve the problem, at first, the paper adopts a standard called signal testing definition(STD), which is applied to describe simulating signals used for <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulation of guidance station of one antiaircraft missile; then those simulating signals for the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulation are implemented based on the platform Labwindows/CVI, and D/A converters are employed for generating physical <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> signals, which are outputted through operational panels or interfaces of the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulator.

40|$|Substrate {{hardness}} {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} guide to the wear resistance of alloys. However, it been documented that there is often much less correlation between particle erosion resistance and hardness. This has been attributed to the high strain rates of erosion impacts compared with those involved in a <b>static</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>test.</b> Under erosion-corrosion conditions, where formation of oxide scales in a gaseous environment can influence markedly the extents of material damage, material hardness may influence the interactions of oxidation and impact damage. The present study has investigated this phenomenon. It has involved testing, in a fluidized-bed erosion-corrosion rig, a range of materials of various hardnesses, including mild steel, 310 stainless steel, a duplex 22 % Cr- 8 % Ni- 3 % Mo alloy (under two heat-treatment conditions) and two cobalt-based alloys, Ultimet and Castolin 906. The alloys were exposed at temperatures up to 560 -degrees-C and at a velocity of 5. 8 m s- 1 in a fluidized-bed containing 100 mum alumina erodent particles. This paper is concerned primarily with the general trends of erosion resistance as a function of material hardness under erosion-dominated, erosion-corrosion-dominated and corrosion-dominated conditions. At relatively low temperatures, where erosion dominates, there is no obvious correlation between the two parameters. However, at higher temperatures where oxidation plays a more significant role, the rate of erosion generally increases with increasing substrate hardness. Possible reasons for these observations are proposed and discussed in relation to earlier results from the literature...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{fan rotor}} inlet noise taken during <b>static</b> <b>test</b> {{situations}} are {{at variance with}} aircraft engine flight data.

To explain this discrepancy, {{the extent of the}} influence of inlet ground vortices and large-scale inlet turbulence on the forward-radiated fan noise measured at a <b>static</b> <b>test</b> facility was investigated. While such inlet disturbances were generated intentionally in an anechoic test chamber, far-field acoustic measurements and inlet flow-field hot-film mappings of a fan rotor were obtained. Experimental results indicate that the acoustic effect of such disturbances appears to be less severe for supersonic than for subsonic tip speeds. Further, a reverse flow that occurs on the exterior cowl in <b>static</b> <b>test</b> facilities appears to be an additional prime candidate for creating inlet disturbances and causing variance between flight and static acoustic data...|$|R

40|$|Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM) are <b>static</b> <b>tested</b> at two ATK Thiokol Propulsion {{facilities}} in Utah, T- 24 and T- 97. The newer T- 97 <b>static</b> <b>test</b> facility was recently upgraded to allow thrust measurement capability. All previous <b>static</b> <b>test</b> motor thrust measurements {{have been taken}} at T- 24; data from these tests were used to characterize thrust parameters and requirement limits for flight motors. Validation of the new T- 97 thrust measurement system is required prior to use for official RSRM performance assessments. Since thrust cannot be measured on RSRM flight motors, flight motor measured chamber pressure and a nominal thrust-to-pressure relationship (based on <b>static</b> <b>test</b> motor thrust and pressure measurements) are used to reconstruct flight motor performance. Historical <b>static</b> <b>test</b> and flight motor performance data are {{used in conjunction with}} production subscale test data to predict RSRM performance. The predicted motor performance is provided to support Space Shuttle trajectory and system loads analyses. Therefore, an accurate nominal thrust-to-pressure (F/P) relationship is critical for accurate RSRM flight motor performance and Space Shuttle analyses. Flight Support Motors (FSM) 7, 8, and 9 provided thrust data for the validation of the T- 97 thrust measurement system. The T- 97 thrust data were analyzed and compared to thrust previously measured at T- 24 to verify measured thrust data and identify any test-stand bias.
