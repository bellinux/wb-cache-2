5000|$|Fletcher was {{the second}} son of Thomas Fletcher. He was educated privately and while a student he won the 1st prize given by the Institute of Architects in London. He became an {{architect}} and surveyor, and was based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, designing industrial buildings, until he moved to London in about 1870. He published Model Houses for the Industrial Classes the following year, {{the first of many}} books, several of which were handbooks for architects, surveyors, and the building trade. From 1875 he was district surveyor for West Newington and part of Lambeth. He was also a major in the 1st Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteer Brigade. Fletcher became a Fellow of the RIBA and was the author of several architectural text-books. [...] Fletcher was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Chippenham on 24 November 1885, making his maiden speech the following year on the topic of excise duties on <b>herb</b> <b>beer.</b> The following election cut short his parliamentary career, and he was defeated on 1 July 1886 by Lord Henry Bruce, a Conservative. Fletcher made five speeches during the time he was in parliament. At the 1892 General Election he made an unsuccessful attempt at a return to parliament as Liberal candidate at Christchurch.|$|E

50|$|Fruits {{and spices}} are key {{ingredients}} in some beer styles. While fruit <b>beers</b> and <b>herb</b> <b>beers</b> are often listed as style categories unto themselves, fruits and spices are sometimes used {{to contribute to}} the flavour and aroma profile of other styles. Vegetables have also been used in beers. Honey, molasses, candy sugar, or other fermentable sugars may be added to impart their distinct flavours to a beer. While not an ingredient per se, some brewers have experimented with aging their beer in barrels previously used for bourbon or other distilled spirits, imparting the flavour of both the wood and the spirit to the beer.|$|R
