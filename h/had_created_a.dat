5|$|After {{the success}} of their debut, Korn decided to enter the studio again for a second album. By then, the band <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> large fan base, and the {{expectations}} for their follow-up album were high. They went back into the studio in early April 1996 at Indigo Ranch Studios, Malibu, California.|$|E
5|$|Attrition by 1942 <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> {{shortage}} of experienced combat leaders. No special training was {{made available for}} this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards.|$|E
50|$|The Internet <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> {{new channel}} for groups to spread their messages. This <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> cycle of {{measures}} and counter measures by groups {{in support of}} and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations <b>has</b> <b>created</b> its own online counter-terrorism resource.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the Greenwood {{neighborhood}} of Tulsa {{was one of}} the most prosperous African-American communities in the United States. Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation since before the start of the 20th century, but the blacks <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> thriving area.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar period, Belgium <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> gold-based currency, {{called the}} Belga, which ran {{parallel}} to the Belgian franc. The Belga was intended for international trading and meant that the National Bank of Belgium amassed considerable gold reserves, amounting to some 600 tonnes by 1940.|$|E
5|$|It was {{estimated}} that a complete lockout had cost an upwards of $1 billion in lost television advertisement revenue. The lockout had dealt a sizable {{blow to the}} current licensed product market which {{was estimated}} at $2.7 billion, and <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> big loss in television ratings for networks that cover NBA games such as the regional sports networks, TNT and ESPN.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Camelot {{planned to}} create a single title instead of a series, and in the {{extremely}} early stages of their project they <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> game design document for the one Golden Sun game {{to be on the}} Nintendo 64 console. When it became apparent the N64 was to be superseded by the GameCube, Camelot shifted their focus to making a game on the handheld Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|Posey <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> rift in the {{politics}} of the territory by supporting slavery, much to the chagrin of opponents like Jennings, Dennis Pennington, and others who dominated the Territorial Legislature and who sought to use the bid for statehood to permanently end slavery in the territory.|$|E
5|$|After the {{approval}} of the legislation, the Vermont Sesquicentennial Commission moved quickly to secure designs to be used for the half dollar. Members decided to have the coin show Ira Allen on the obverse, and the Battle of Bennington Monument on the reverse. They commissioned Sherry Fry, who <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> statue of Allen for the University of Vermont, to design the coin. On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins), informing him that the models would be ready in about a week.|$|E

5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|At this point, McCormack {{had become}} {{apprehensive}} about his career, but in early 1947 {{a new and}} exciting opportunity opened up. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 had created the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee {{research and development of}} nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The Act <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> statutory position inside the AEC called the Director of Military Applications, which the AEC commissioners envisaged as a staff post responsible for military planning and policy formulation. By law, the Director of Military Applications had to be a serving armed forces officer.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{troubles}} delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials {{worried that}} high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds {{to complete the}} Green Line, forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be sped up.|$|E

5|$|In 1949-1950, Tzara {{answered}} Aragon's {{call and}} become {{active in the}} international campaign to liberate Nazım Hikmet, a Turkish poet whose 1938 arrest for communist activities <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> cause célèbre for the pro-Soviet public opinion. Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical pieces by Louis Durey and Serge Nigg). Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons {{at a number}} of sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{typewriter}} received an unenthusiastic reception from the public. Lack of an established market, high cost, {{and the need}} for trained operators slowed its adoption. Additionally, recipients of typewritten messages found the mechanical, all upper-case writing to be impersonal and even insulting. The new communication technologies and expanding businesses of the late 19th century, however, <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> need for expedient, legible correspondence, and so the Sholes and Glidden and its contemporaries soon became common office fixtures. The typewriter is credited with assisting the entrance of women into the clerical workplace, as many were hired to operate the new devices.|$|E

5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's {{decision}} was correct because Bowman <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> new product that infringed on their patent. They further argued {{that this was not}} an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1931 Heydrich {{began his}} job as chief of the new 'Ic Service' (intelligence service). He set up office at the Brown House, the Nazi Party {{headquarters}} in Munich. By October he <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering purposes and to obtain information {{to be used as}} blackmail to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House. To mark the occasion of Heydrich's December wedding, Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer (major).|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees <b>had</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> thread on Valve's website forums for players {{to list the}} problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it {{made no mention of}} fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times.|$|E
