500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
2500|$|A few home-studio {{recordings}} (most likely {{from the}} late 1980s) with Stone's voice and keyboards over a drum machine have made their way onto a bootleg. One Stone-penned demo called [...] "Coming Back for More" [...] appears to be autobiographical and includes the verse: [...] "Been so high, <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> sky and the sky says 'Sly, why you tryin' to get by?' Comin' back for more." [...] His son, Sylvester Jr., told People Magazine in 1997 {{that his father had}} composed an album's worth of material, including a tribute to Miles Davis called [...] "Miles and Miles." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Beastly. <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball exactly four times. If I wasn't so awfully ornamental, I don't {{see what}} would be the use of my turning out at all. I'm no {{practical}} good to the team.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] I said, [...] "I will do it, {{provided}} {{there is}} nothing in this paper to make me change my mind," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> envelope he had put upon the table by the keys.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the next}} thing I became {{conscious}} of was that the cart was at a standstill, and that the pony stood cropping the thyme-sweet turf by the wayside. <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> cold dark hand. [...] "Hush, my dear, we are here!" ...|$|E

60|$|Behind her, {{depending}} {{from the}} roof upon rawhide thongs, and stretching entirely across the cave, was a row of human skeletons.

60|$|Such hiding would easily deceive even a trout, for I {{have often}} taken my {{position}} {{at the edge of}} a jam and after lying perfectly still for ten minutes have seen the wary fish rise from under the logs to investigate a straw or twig that I held in my fingers and with which <b>I</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> water here and there, like an insect at play.|$|E
6000|$|... "My mind {{is lost in}} confusion," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{can suggest}} nothing and explain nothing. My {{thoughts}} are all bent on the one question of what I am to do next.
