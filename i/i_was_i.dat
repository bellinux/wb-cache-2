Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how <b>I</b> <b>was...</b> <b>I,</b> Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted the {{extraordinary}} development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines {{to the fact that}} Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: [...] "Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> checked out the songs with her." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times spent a full {{paragraph}} on a vignette {{about two}} high school prom dresses. [...] The junior prom dress was a conservative powder blue gown to wear with a nerdy date. The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} really cute guy.

500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E

And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along.

All of it is on the money, performed from the heart..." [...] Loup Garou featured a duet with Brenda Lee; DeVille said: [...] "She didn't know who the hell <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> just called her up, played the song for her, and she loved it.

Sessions has always defended his civil rights record, saying that [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> , <b>I</b> signed 10 pleadings attacking segregation or the remnants of segregation, where we as part of the Department of Justice, we sought desegregation remedies". Critics later argued that Sessions had exaggerated his involvement in civil rights cases. Michigan Law professor Samuel Bagenstos, reviewing Sessions's claims, argued that [...] "ll this shows is that Sessions didn't completely refuse to participate in or have his name on pleadings in cases that the civil rights division brought during his tenure ...
