25|$|After {{working up}} in Bermuda, Beacon Hill was {{assigned}} to Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) EG 26, a Canadian support group that would assist any convoy under attack. During her time with EG 26, she was sporadically detached to Plymouth and Portsmouth commands. EG 26 is among the escort groups deployed to counter snorkel-equipped U-boats in British coastal waters beginning in mid-December 1944. Deploying from Derry, the groups operated in overlapping patrols in the Shetland-Faroes narrows, off Hebrides, in the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>west</b> of Ireland and in St. George's Channel. In March 1945, EG 26 deployed from Portsmouth. From at least 14 March to 20 April, Beacon Hill was the Senior Officer's ship of the group. She remained in European waters until May 1945, when she departed for Canada. Intended {{to be used in}} the ongoing Pacific campaign, Beacon Hill began her tropicalization refit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia in June. The refit ended in November 1945, and she sailed for Esquimalt.

40|$|Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) are an {{economically}} important flatfish in European waters. However, there remains {{much to be}} learned about the life history of this fish especially for the earliest stages. This chapter presents an analysis of temporal and spatial variation in two aspects of the early life history of plaice: length of the larval life and larval growth rate. Archived otoliths (earstones) from adult fish {{were used for the}} investigation. Samples were obtained from collections held by the Marine Institute in Ireland, Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) in England and the Animal Science Group in Wageningen University in the Netherlands. Three randomly selected year classes of plaice were examined; 1990, 1997 and 2001. Three areas in Western Europe were chosen for the investigation of spatial variability. These regions were based on international fishing divisions; ICES area Vila (<b>Irish</b> <b>Sea),</b> Vllb (<b>west</b> of Ireland) and IVb (North Sea). Otoliths were polished and image analysis conducted. Statistical analysis of the otolith microstructure revealed that there was no significant temporal difference in larval growth rate and duration over the ten year study period at any location. With regards to spatial differences, {{there was no significant difference}} between plaice from the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> and <b>west</b> of Ireland for both larval growth rate and duration. However, Vila (<b>Irish</b> <b>Sea)</b> and Vllb (<b>west</b> of Ireland) differed significantly from the North Sea plaice. Larval duration is shorter and growth rate is faster in plaice from Vila and Vllb. A possible link with sea temperature and food quantity is explored and the results are discussed in the context of climate change...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{models for}} planktonic fish eggs and larvae often use {{temperature}} to drive growth because temperature data are readily available. This pragmatic {{approach can be}} criticised as too simplistic as it ignores additional factors, such as food availability and growth-rate-dependent mortality. We examined {{the extent to which}} temperature could explain the larval duration and growth variability in post-settlement plaice from the southern North <b>Sea,</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> and <b>west</b> of Ireland. Larval duration and individual growth were estimated from the otolith microstructure of juvenile plaice collected from nursery grounds in each region, and average sea surface temperatures were reconstructed for each region from satellite data. Hatch dates, larval duration and settlement dates all differed among the regions, reflecting the timing of spawning and the physical characteristics of each region. Models incorporating presumed temperature history and region explained 73 % of variability in individual larval growth (as estimated from otolith microincrement widths), again demonstrating important differences among the regions. The results suggest that sea temperature can be used to drive growth models of plaice larvae, although allowance must then be made for inter-regional differences. However, larval duration can be estimated using a pan-regional model based on the average temperature experienced during the larval phase...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{variation}} of populations and their assemblages {{is an important}} component of many aspects of ecology, including the maintenance of species diversity. In nature, organisms are generally aggregated in patches or form gradients or other spatially related patterns. This investigation quantified the degree of spatial structure in benthic invertebrate assemblages. It examined the distribution of infaunal assemblages of different size, mobility and contrasting life-history strategies (i. e. meiofaunal nematodes and macrofaunal polychaetes) in two offshore muddy habitats in the Celtic Deep and the NW <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> off the <b>west</b> coast of the United Kingdom. The more heterogeneous habitat in the NW <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea</b> was characterised by higher tidal stress and bottom temperature while greater water depth, mean particle diameter and organic carbon content was typical for the comparatively homogeneous environment in the Celtic Deep. In both habitats, the environmental conditions became increasingly dissimilar with separation. A total of 125 nematode and 88 polychaete species were recorded with 69 % of the nematode and 49 % of polychaete species present at both study sites. Occurrence frequency of species, species diversity and average similarity of assemblage composition was higher in the Celtic Deep than in the NW <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea.</b> Results from correlation analyses revealed statistically robust relationships of community similarity and sample distance. Given their small size and low mobility, nematodes were more susceptible to within-habitat physical variability than larger-sized, more mobile polychaetes. This, coupled with limits to long-distance dispersal and likely restrictions in gene flow, resulted in a significant decrease in community similarity with distance at the spatial scales sampled (i. e. within 0. 1 - 23 km). Polychaetes, in contrast, combined a higher dispersal potential (> 23 km) with a relatively high tolerance to within-habitat environmental variability and these were the most likely causes for non-significant relationships between the similarity of their assemblages and sample distance. The potential mechanisms causing the observed variation and implications of results for environmental management strategies are discussed. © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

This is navigable to Glasgow which is the heartland of industrial Scotland and was for a time world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre. Greater Glasgow has a population of 1,200,000. The main coastal town of Northern Ireland bordering this sea is Derry which is on the northern coast and has a population of 237,000. County Donegal had a total population of 137,575 in 2002.

There is a deficit compared to the rest of Scotland in the 20-30 age group and a smaller one in the 30-40 group but, for school-age children and for those over 40 there is a net surplus. A possible explanation is that Scots leave rural areas for higher education and first job experience but these movements are compensated by English people in their 40s arriving to raise a family in wholesome surroundings.

The USS Kearsarge was flying French colors as it exited the <b>Irish</b> <b>Sea,</b> but a passing Liverpool steamer saw the battle damage and passed the information on to a vengeful British Navy, which flew to destroy the American ship. On September 12, the HMS Undaunted caught up with the Kearsarge, {{but it was not until}} 15 September that the HMS Undaunted came into firing range. Winslow turned hard to rake the Undaunted, but the Undaunted matched the action, firing two mildly ineffective broadsides before the Kearsarge began to fire at 900 yards. Winslow's XI-inch Dahlgren guns wreaked havoc on the lower decks of the Undaunted, killing the captain and allowing the USS Kearsarge to continue its flight. Unfortunately for the Americans, a British battle group followed close behind the HMS Undaunted, made up of the frigates HMS Topaze and HMS Dauntless and the sloops HMS Alert and HMS Gannet led by the captain of the Topaze, John Welbore Sunderland Spencer. The British attempted to hem the Kearsarge into a net, but Winslow ducked into a storm and sailed south, managing to evade his pursuers. On September 21, the USS Kearsarge unexpectedly met the Russian screw frigates HIMS Aleksandr Nevksy and HIMS Peresvet led by Rear Admiral Stepan Lisovsky. Winslow quickly filled in the curious Russians as to the Battle of Moelfre Bay and asked for their assistance. Lisovsky, on Imperial orders to help the Americans if attacked by a European power, took up the American plea and sailed behind the wounded Kearsarge to escort her to New York City, assuming that the British would not fire upon the Russian ships.|$|R
