5|$|The {{indirect}} {{exchange of}} goods on land along the Silk Road and sea routes included Chinese silk, Roman <b>glassware</b> and high-quality cloth. Roman coins minted from the 1st century AD onwards {{have been found in}} China, as well as a coin of Maximian and medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius in Jiaozhi in modern Vietnam, the same region at which Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed. Roman <b>glassware</b> and silverware have been discovered at Chinese archaeological sites dated to the Han period. Roman coins and glass beads have also been found in Japan.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman <b>glassware</b> discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang. Roman and Persian <b>glassware</b> {{has been found in}} a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th-century AD Kofun-era Utsukushi burial mound near Kyoto.|$|E
5|$|Housed within University College, the University of Toronto Art Centre {{contains}} {{three major}} art collections. The Malcove Collection is primarily represented by Early Christian and Byzantine sculptures, bronzeware, furniture, icons and liturgical items. It also includes <b>glassware</b> and stone reliefs from the Greco-Roman period, and the painting Adam and Eve by Lucas Cranach the Elder, dated from 1538. The University of Toronto Collection features Canadian contemporary art, while the University College Art Collection holds significant {{works by the}} Group of Seven and 19th century landscape artists.|$|E
5|$|Roman provinces traded among themselves, but trade {{extended}} {{outside the}} frontiers to regions {{as far away}} as China and India. The main commodity was grain. Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the Silk Road; Indian trade, however, also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports on the Red Sea. Also traded were olive oil, various foodstuffs, garum (fish sauce), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, pottery, <b>glassware,</b> marble, papyrus, spices and materia medica, ivory, pearls, and gemstones.|$|E
5|$|This smaller room {{may have}} been used by Henry and Thomas Lyte for their studies. It too has later {{paneling}} and an alcove in which are displayed a collection of early <b>glassware.</b> Above this room is the Little Chamber, used by Sir Walter Jenner as his bedroom. The bed came from Burton Pynsent House in Somerset, a house given to William Pitt the Elder by an admirer of his achievements as prime minister.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded <b>glassware</b> intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E
5|$|Decorative {{arts for}} luxury {{consumers}} included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and <b>glassware.</b> The {{manufacture of pottery}} {{in a wide range}} of quality was important to trade and employment, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (terra sigillata) that was a major item of trade in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative <b>glassware</b> made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery {{houses a}} {{collection}} encompassing natural history, archaeology, local <b>glassware,</b> Chinese ceramics and art. The M Shed museum opened in 2011 {{on the site}} of the former Bristol Industrial Museum. Both are operated by Bristol Museums, Galleries and Archives, which also runs three historic housesthe Tudor Red Lodge, the Georgian House and Blaise Castle Houseand Bristol Archives. The 18th- and 19th-century portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, 19th-century architect Francis Greenway (designer of many of Sydney's first buildings) were born in the city. The graffiti artist Banksy is believed to be from Bristol, and many of his works are on display in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by <b>glassware</b> due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|The major global industrial-scale use {{of boron}} {{compounds}} (about 46% of end-use) is in production of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron {{is added to}} the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength <b>glassware.</b> About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate <b>glassware</b> production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
5|$|Trade {{items such}} as spice and silk had {{to be paid for}} with Roman gold coinage. There was some demand in China for Roman glass; the Han Chinese also {{produced}} glass in certain locations. Chinese-produced <b>glassware</b> date back to the Western Han era (202 BC – 9 AD). In dealing with foreign states such as the Parthian Empire, the Han Chinese were perhaps more concerned with diplomatically outmaneuvering their chief enemies, the nomadic Xiongnu, than with establishing trade, since mercantile pursuits and the merchant class were frowned upon by the gentry who dominated the Han government.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, a {{gold medal}} {{competition}} {{was sponsored by the}} Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own <b>glassware,</b> creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and <b>glassware,</b> on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{small number}} of Roman and Byzantine coins found during {{excavations}} of Central Asian and Chinese archaeological sites from this era suggests that direct trade with the Sogdians remained limited. This was {{despite the fact that}} ancient Romans imported Han Chinese silk, and discoveries in contemporary tombs indicate that the Han-dynasty Chinese imported Roman <b>glassware.</b> Valerie Hansen wrote in 2012 that no Roman coins from the Roman Republic (507–27 BC) or the Principate (27 BC – 284 AD) era of the Roman Empire have been found in China. Warwick Ball (2016) highlights a discovery at Xi'an, China (the site of the Han capital Chang'an) where a hoard of sixteen Roman coins from the reigns of Tiberius (14–37 AD) to Aurelian (270–275 AD) have been discovered. The Roman coins found at Óc Eo, Vietnam, near Chinese-controlled Jiaozhou, date to the mid-2nd century AD. A coin of Maximian (r. 286–305 AD) was also discovered in Tonkin. Roman coins of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD have been discovered in Japan; they were unearthed from Katsuren Castle (in Uruma, Okinawa), which was built from the 12th to 15th centuries AD.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other <b>glassware.</b> It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemistry}} laboratory stereotypically uses {{various forms}} of laboratory <b>glassware.</b> However <b>glassware</b> is not central to chemistry, {{and a great deal}} of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glassware</b> {{should always}} be labeled as to its contents.|$|E
25|$|Correct eye {{protection}} should be worn in most experiments involving <b>glassware.</b>|$|E
25|$|All U.S. Presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower through Ronald Reagan ordered <b>glassware</b> from Fostoria.|$|E
25|$|Municipal Museum: Earthenware, <b>glassware,</b> 18th and 19th century paintings, archeology, {{religious}} art and maritime folklore.|$|E
25|$|Redlands Historical Glass Museum holds {{displays}} of American <b>Glassware</b> {{dating from the}} early 19th century to contemporary times. Displays include, glass from Heisey, Cambridge, Fenton Art Glass Company, Fostoria, and Sandwich factories {{as well as those}} that produced depression-era <b>glassware.</b> Items on display include candlesticks, compotes, milk glass, stems, bowls, historical plates, salts, kerosene lamps-and even several items from the estate of Liberace.|$|E
25|$|Hot glass {{looks like}} cold glass, so a person {{must be careful}} to avoid {{grabbing}} hot <b>glassware.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rapid heating (or cooling) {{may cause}} uneven thermal {{expansion}} putting too much mechanical {{stress on the}} surface and cause it to fracture. Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat <b>glassware,</b> especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of <b>glassware</b> should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as heated baths, heating mantles or laboratory grade hot plates to avoid fracturing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glassware</b> {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered <b>glassware</b> to replace broken and stolen <b>glassware</b> for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne glasses, claret glasses, burgundy glasses, madeira glasses, sherry glasses, hock glasses, and cordial glasses. The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glasses—which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock glasses were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|E
25|$|Al-Idrisi {{mentioned}} that Chinese junks carried leather, swords, iron and silk. He mentions the <b>glassware</b> {{of the city}} of Hangzhou and labels Quanzhou's silk as the best.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, if {{positive}} pressures are required, standard <b>glassware</b> {{can not be}} used, energy must be used for pressurization {{and there is a}} higher chance of side reactions occurring in the distillation, such as decomposition, due to the higher temperatures required to effect boiling.|$|E
25|$|Museum aan het Vrijthof {{is a local}} art {{and history}} museum based in the 16th-century Spanish Government building, {{featuring}} some period rooms with 17th- and 18th-century furniture, clocks, Maastricht silver, porcelain, <b>glassware</b> and Maastricht pistols, and temporary exhibitions of local artists and designers.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, Prop 65 has led {{to consent}} {{agreements}} {{for a variety of}} consumer products, such as bibs, bicycles, products containing brass, cookware, cosmetics, exercise mats, ceramic ware and <b>glassware,</b> clothing, fake leather upholstery, headphone cables, jewelry, lunchboxes, poker chips, luggage, and accessories.|$|E
25|$|Jaina Island's notability {{is tied to}} its {{estimated}} 20,000 graves, {{of which}} over 1,000 have been archaeologically excavated. Within each grave, the human remains are accompanied by <b>glassware,</b> slateware, or pottery {{as well as one}} or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands.|$|E
25|$|Two-thirds of the {{settlers}} died before ships arrived in 1608 with supplies and German, Polish, and Slovak craftsmen, who helped {{to establish the}} first manufactories in the colony. As a result, <b>glassware</b> became the foremost American products to be exported to Europe at the time. Clapboard had already been sent back to England beginning with the first returning ship.|$|E
