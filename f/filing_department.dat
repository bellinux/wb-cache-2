40|$|Background: Employees’ {{productivity}} {{is closely related}} with nutritional condition. Nutritional condition can be physically assessed by determining nutrition status. One’s nutrition status is directly influenced by nutrient intake. However, health and nutrition status of an employee in general have not got proper attention that lead to decreasing productivity. Productivity is not only influenced by nutrition status but also by psychological factor that involves motivation. Objectives: To identify association between nutrient intake, nutrition status and motivation and productivity of female workers at production department of Bakpia Pathuk 25 Factory Yogyakarta. Method: The study was a survey that used cross sectional design. Subject {{of the study were}} female workers at production department as many as 40 people taken through proportional stratified random sampling technique. Data of subject assessed were nutrient intake (energy, carbohydrate, fat, protein, and Fe), nutrition status, motivation, and productivity. Nutrient intake was assessed using food recall 24 hours within 4 days, nutrition status was specified using anthropometric approach using body mass index (weight/height), motivation was assessed through motivation questionnaire and productivity through quantity of production (raw bakpia) produced by the worker at a time observation (44 minutes for workers at crust production and 1 hour for workers at <b>filing</b> <b>department)</b> within 3 times observation. Result: The result of linear regression analysis showed that association between nutrient intake (energy, carbohydrate, fat, protein and Fe), nutrition status and productivity was r 0. 05 whereas between motivation and productivity was r= 0. 901; R 2 = 0. 812; and p= 0. 000 for variables of wages, intake of energy, Fe and motivation and productivity. Conclusion: There was no significant association between nutrient intake (energy, carbohydrate, fat, protein and Fe) and nutrition status and productivity; there was signifiant association between motivation and productivity. Concurrently only motivation had significant association with productivity...|$|E

H 577 P COMP 2016 ZhangQxvi, 128 pages :color illustrationsA genomic signal {{track is}} a set of genomic {{intervals}} associated with values of various types, such as measurements from high-throughput experiments. Analysis of signal tracks requires complex computational methods, which often make the analysts focus too much on the detailed computational steps rather than on their biological questions. This thesis presents Signal Track Analytical Research Tool (START) and Signal Track Query Language (STQL) for easy analysis of signal tracks. STQL is an SQL-like declarative language, which means one only specifies what computations need to be done but not how these computations are to be carried out. STQL provides a rich set of constructs for manipulating genomic intervals and their values. To run STQL queries, we have developed the Signal Track Analytical Research Tool (START), a MapReduce-based system that includes a Web-based user interface and a back-end execution system. By running some typical analyses tasks, we show that the START+STQL solution is usually the simplest, and the parallel execution achieves significant speed-up with large data <b>files.</b> <b>Department</b> of ComputingPh.
