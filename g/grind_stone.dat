While leading his brigade to the Red River Colony, Alexander Macdonell dispatched Cuthbert Grant and 25 Métis to plunder the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Brandon House. On June 1, Grant’s men broke open the gates and stole literally everything inside, even the fort’s <b>grind</b> <b>stone.</b> The stolen goods were divided among the raiders except the furs and ammunition which were claimed by the NWC. On June 16 the Qu’Appelle brigade arrived at Portage la Prairie and encamped. Expecting an attack, their stock of provisions and stolen furs were landed and formed into a defensive square on which two swivel guns were mounted. The next day 2 Métis went to Fort Douglas and warned Governor Semple that a large party was at Portage la Prairies and would attack the colony within 2 days. Semple did not believe the NWC had the strength to accomplish it, but began to keep a 24-hour watch at Fort Douglas. Peguis, chief of the local Swampy Indians offered his services to protect the Red River against the Nor’Westers, but Semple declined. Peguis then encamped with his men along the river opposite the colony. On June 18, the HBC’s Patrick Corcoran, who escaped imprisonment at Fort Qu’Appelle arrived at Fort Douglas and informed Semple that a large NWC and Métis force was gathering there to attack the colony. This was Semple’s second warning. Meanwhile, Cuthbert Grant and a party of Canadians departed Portage des Prairie by canoe followed by a number of Métis on horseback, numbering around 50 men total, to deliver 20 bags of much needed pemmican to Bas de la Rivière. Because of the HBC blockades, the party was forced to land 10 miles from the colony at a place called the “Passage” where they loaded the pemmican onto two carts to take them overland past Fort Douglas and re-embark them at Frog Plain. Part of the force remained to rendezvous with the NWC forces from Fort William and Swan River; around 50 continued towards Frog Plain, but not before being ordered to keep as far away from Fort Douglas and the colony as the terrain would allow to avoid a confrontation. This order was given as there was a swamp about three-quarters of a mile opposite Fort Douglas that left only a narrow plain which allowed passage. Before reaching Fort Douglas, around 24 Métis broke off and rode ahead to set up camp at the Frog Plains. The remaining 26 men continued with the carts. The Métis that were included in this party were covered with paint and wore feathers in their hair as the Indians did; not a typical Métis practice. The paint was supposedly given to them by the Canadians {{in order for them to}} appear more intimidating to the Red River settlers.|$|E

40|$|Osteometric and paleopathological {{studies of}} Neolithic {{material}} from Western Ligurian caves {{have shown a}} high degree of robusticity of the forelimb in these populations. In this study we intend to test previous results by means of a biomechanical approach. The cross-sectional geometry (CSG) properties of the humerus of a sample composed of 17 Neolithic individuals (NEOL), nine males and eight females, from three caves (Arene Candide, Arma dell’Aquila, and Pollera) located in the Finalese region (Savona, Italy), have been analysed. The comparison with a European Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP) sample showed unchanged humeral robusticity in females, and increased humeral robusticity in males. Both sexes show a more rounded humeral diaphyseal circumference and decrease of lateralization. It has been supposed, on the base of faunal and archaeological evidence, that NEOL were prevalently pastoralist, and not committed agriculturalists. In the uneven, wooded and poor of pastures territory of Finalese region, NEOL people likely turned to pollarding – recurrently chopping of branches - in order to provide animal’s fodder. Such a laborious activity may have been a cause for the great robusticity of male humerus. The difference in humeral robusticity between males and females leads to an increase in sexual dimorphism, which may indicate different activity levels between genders, probably as a consequence of sexual division of labour. The decrease of lateralisation in both sexes may be related to an increase in activities that stressed both limbs in a similar way. In particular, the finding of <b>grind</b> <b>stone</b> in the archaeological record seems to explain the absence of lateralization in females, which might be related to the processing of cereals in the traditional fashion, by means of a <b>grind</b> <b>stone</b> held with both hands. CSG results seem to confirm previous results and furnish further evidence for the hypothesis of a prevalently pastoral economy of the Neolithic people of Western Liguria...|$|E

40|$|Although Rauvolfia {{serpentine}} Benth. can be propagated by both {{seeds and}} vegetative propagules, growth {{of plant and}} root yield are better in those raised from seeds (Badhwar et al. 1956).

40|$|Summary] Grinding (or milling) grain was an {{important}} activity {{that took place in}} nearly every ancient Egyptian home. Grinding was necessary to process emmer or barley grain into flour, and thus was a key step in manufacturing bread, the most important food in ancient Egypt. Grinding in ancient Egypt is well-attested archaeologically, and is the most commonly depicted activity of the grain processing sequence in Egyptian art and texts. Indeed, it was the step that likely took the most time and labour. Despite their significance to daily life in ancient Egypt, grinding implements and activities have often been ignored in archaeological reports and historical studies. However, recent investigations of contemporary ancient cultures as well as modern ethnographic work has brought grind stones and grinding to the fore. This has resulted in new archaeological and ethnographic information, and has refined theories regarding grain grinding and those who performed it. Using this cross-cultural body of evidence and theoretical discussion as a starting point, this presentation will investigate grinding in the domestic, non-elite sphere of New Kingdom Egypt. Using the grinding quern as a focus, this study will explore how association with a <b>grind</b> <b>stone,</b> as well as the act of grinding, created or impacted the miller’s identity and contributed to their role in the household. Archaeological data, 2 D and 3 D artistic representations of grinding, and literary and non-literary texts discussing grinding will be examined in conversation with evidence from other cultures. This paper will argue that grinding grain was particularly associated with females, and was a low-prestige activity. However, it was {{an important}} maintenance activity in the household, and contributed significantly to the labour force and economy of New Kingdom Egypt...|$|E
