For an n Θ n matrix, the required {{number of operations}} is around 10 = 3 n 3.

One popular approach is to use the Pad'e approximation together with a scaling and squaring strategy. Another method is based on the Schur decomposition and evaluating the exponential of a triangular matrix. The Schur approach is significantly simplified when the matrix is real symmetric or Hermitian. When the spectral decomposition A = V V T is calculated (where A is real symmetric, is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues and V is the orthogonal matrix of the eigenvectors), we simply evaluate e A by V <b>e</b> <b>V</b> <b>T.</b> The [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The Development of the Soviet Scientific Intelligentsia in the Russian Far Elena Vasilieva's article {{investigates the}} {{development}} of the Soviet technical intelligentsia in the Russian Far East during the first three decades of Soviet power and gives insight into the fate of many local institutions and personalities. The very limited amount of scholars working in the Far East — mainly professors of the Vladivostok State University and Polytechnic Institute — grew noticeably during the civil war. During the 1920 s, they responded to the relatively tolerant attitude of the authorities and security organs by an attitude made of apolitical expectation and growing concern about their usefulness. Starting with the proletarization of its students in 1923, the Sovietization of the Far-Eastern intelligentsia increased {{at the end of the}} 1920 s when the fallout of the Shakhty Trial and the overall assault on the 'bourgeois intelligentsia' reached the region. The stratification of this particular group of the population deepened, gaining momentum during the purges, when institutes were closed and hundreds of scientific collaborators were shot or sent to labor camps. One of the consequences of the expansion and proximity of the labor camp system in the Far East was that the frontier between freedom and imprisonment was blurred. Although the consequences of the Sovietization of the technical intelligentsia undoubtedly had a negative result in terms of professionalism and level of knowledge, the way it adapted to the specific historical circumstances shows the limitations of Soviet totalitarianism.

40|$|In 1994 the Commonwealth Government {{allocated}} {{funds for}} the design and development {{of a number of}} Rural Access Community Training Centres throughout Australia. This program derives from the strategic plan, A Bridge to the Future: Australias National Strategy for <b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.</b> and specifically, objective number three (3); achieving equitable outcomes in <b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.</b> The key question for this thesis is; how successful has vocational education and training (<b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.)</b> reform been in empowering one local community to plan for, manage and deliver new education and training services? The focus of this thesis is a case-study of how one community is coping with vocational education and training (<b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.)</b> reform and an analysis of the critical factors involved in facilitating change within communities, community organisations and the Australian vocational education and training system. A case-study approach was utilised to research Glassy Waters, a small rural community with a population of some 650 residents situated on a system of rivers and lakes in Victoria. The methodology utilised in gathering information for the case-study is mixed-mode relying on some of the principles of participatory action research and specifically the participant observations of the researcher. The research also relies on interviews with key stakeholders to ascertain information, views and experiences of a community in the process of creating a new vocational education and training centre. This thesis reveals that Glassy Waters Advisory Corporation (G. W. A. C.), a community managed organisation, has been successful in meeting the primary objectives of Commonwealth policy to establish a Rural Access Community Training Centre and increase access to <b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.</b> programs for some disadvantaged groups living in the local community. However, both the policy and the implementation process has had limited impact on the prevailing management and employment culture and practices within the Glassy Waters community. The Glassy Waters case-study provides indicators that certain factors act as barriers to the implementation of a new learning culture within the community and therefore act as barriers to disadvantaged people accessing <b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.</b> programs. The need for a new learning culture within the community was identified by government representatives as crucial {{to the success of the}} new training centre and the development of new learning cultures has been identified by a policy mix implied by Commonwealth and State/Territory governments as central to the <b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.</b> reform process in Australia. The Glassy Waters case-study reflects that although change is occurring on the edges of the vocational education and training (<b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.)</b> sector in terms of the key tenets of national vocational education and training (<b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.)</b> reform, the actual communities that are the target of these new services are a long way from being receptive of new learning cultures in either a theoretical or practical sense. The concepts of learning communities/regions and learning organisations are still just concepts and many individuals, communities and organisations are struggling to implement new principles of learning within long established community structures. Therefore, there is evidence that it is timely for governments and local communities to review the philosophy, people and processes of national vocational education and training (<b>V.</b> <b>E.</b> <b>T.)</b> reform to ensure that all stakeholders, including governments, industries and communities are on the same track. There is also evidence that communities want government resources to be allocated toward the kinds of community development projects and programs that address the philosophy, people and process of vocational education and training and not just products and outcomes...|$|R

Methods Nine male subjects (19 – 25 yr; 83. 3 ± 3. 1 kg; 184 ± 2 cm), underwent three testing sessions administered in a randomized and double-blind fashion. During each session, subjects were provided 4 oz of water and a gelatin capsule containing a placebo, 1. 5 mg/kg caffeine, or 3. 0 mg/kg caffeine. After thirty minutes of rest, a warm-up (30 Watts for 2 min) the pedal rate of 60 rpm was maintained at a steady-state output of 60 watts for five minutes; increased to 120 watts for five minutes and to 180 watts for five minutes. After a 2 min rest the workload was 180 watts for one minute and increased by 30 watts every minute until exhaustion. Heart rate (HR) was measured during the last 15 -seconds of each minute of submaximal exercise. Systolic blood pressure (BP) was measured at rest and during each of the three sub-maximal steady state power outputs. Minute ventilation (V E), Tidal volume (V T), Breathing frequency (Bf), Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), Respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and Oxygen consumption (VO 2) were measured at rest and during each minute of exercise. Results Caffeine at 1. 5 and 3. 0 mg/kg body weight significantly lowered (p <b>E,</b> <b>V</b> <b>T,</b> VO 2, RPE, maximal power output or time to exhaustion.

In addition, this caffeine dose also only appears to affect systolic blood pressure at rest but not during cycling exercise. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is to analyze the {{degradation}} mechanisms induced on industrial HVOF cermet coatings by tribocorrosion. Tribocorrosion of cermet coatings is a subject {{that has not been}} widely analyzed in research studies: in fact, while many works dealing with wear or corrosion of HVOF cermet coatings are published, studies relevant to the combined processes (wear and corrosion) are relatively few. The tribocorrosion mechanisms of the cermet coatings were studied in a sodium chloride solution under sliding wear, trying to combine and integrate differently produced mechanical and electrochemical damage phenomena. Electrochemical techniques such as potentiodynamic polarization curves as well as potentiostatic (I <b>vs</b> <b>t)</b> or galvanostatic (<b>E</b> <b>vs</b> <b>t)</b> methods were used in order to stimulate and to interprete tribocorrosion degradation mechanisms. It was shown that coating post grinding, which is a mechanical operation usually performed after the deposition of conventional cermet coatings in order to obtain a desired roughness, could produce structural damages, which can greatly affect the mechano-chemical behaviour of the cermet coatings. Mainly abrasive–adhesive wear mechanisms were observed on the coating surface and sometimes, depending on coatings mechanical properties (fracture toughness), cracks developed during wear causing the coating continuity breaking. In the latter case, the degradation mechanism is no longer governed only by surface tribocorrosion, but undermining corrosion can occur, greatly affecting sample performances and promoting coating detachment. Cr 3 C 2 –NiCr coatings, under all the selected experimental conditions, showed good barrier properties and substrate corrosion was never observed. Moreover, when chromium was added to the metal matrix of WC–Co based systems, tribocorrosion behaviour was enhanced and the lower tribocorrosion rates were measured. Finally, it was shown that electrochemical techniques can be used to govern the coating corrosion processes and to interpret the main degradation mechanisms, even though they seem not to provide a precise quantitative analysis of tribocorrosion...|$|R

A key ingredient is a reduction of the original Cauchy problem {{to the study of the}} semiclassical pseudo-differential operator M = M(t, iε∂t) with compact operator-valued symbol M(t, <b>E)</b> = <b>V</b> 1 (<b>t)</b> (A 0 − EI) − 1 <b>V</b> 2 (<b>t),</b> <b>V</b> (<b>t)</b> = <b>V</b> 2 (<b>t)</b> <b>V</b> 1 (<b>t),</b> and an asymptotic analysis of its spectral properties. We illustrate our approach with a detailed presentation of the example of the Schrödinger equation on the axis with the δ-function potential: A(t) = −∂xx + α(t) δ(x) ...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of LaAl 2 and of two dilute (La, Ce) Al 2 alloys {{was measured in}} the normal state between 0. 4 and 8 K. From the lattice conductivity of LaAl 2 a high dislocation densityN d caused by the arc melting process can be inferred. After annealingN d is reduced by an order of magnitude. For the (La, Ce) Al 2 samples minima are observed at 5 K in theW <b>e</b> ·T <b>vs.</b> <b>T</b> curves (W <b>e</b> =electronic thermal resistivity). Below 1 K the quantityW e ·T is linear in (— lnT). The electronic Lorenz ratioL e (T) =ρ(T) /W e (T) ·T shows a maximum at 2 K with a value 23 % aboveL e (0). It is {{for the first time}} that this Kondo anomaly is established in its full temperature dependence...|$|R
