5|$|<b>Film</b> <b>noir</b> {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into {{a life of crime}} (Gun Crazy), or simply a victim of circumstance (D.O.A.). Although <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> was originally associated with American productions, films now so described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E

5|$|<b>Film</b> <b>noir</b> is {{also known}} for its use of low-angle, wide-angle, and skewed, or Dutch angle shots. Other devices of {{disorientation}} relatively common in <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> include shots of people reflected {{in one or more}} mirrors, shots through curved or frosted glass or other distorting objects (such as during the strangulation scene in Strangers on a Train), and special effects sequences of a sometimes bizarre nature. Night-for-night shooting, as opposed to the Hollywood norm of day-for-night, was often employed. From the mid-1940s forward, location shooting became increasingly frequent in noir.|$|E

5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E

5|$|In other media, the {{television}} series Sledge Hammer! (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with {{such topics as}} capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. Sesame Street (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; the sketches refer {{to some of the}} typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as Garfield's Babes and Bullets (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of Calvin and Hobbes have parodied both <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> sprang and which it now overshadows.|$|E

5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no such thing. While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E

5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E

Since Bungie was aiming for a smaller, detective story feel, O'Donnell felt that a jazz-influenced approach worked best in echoing the <b>film</b> <b>noir</b> atmosphere.|$|E
