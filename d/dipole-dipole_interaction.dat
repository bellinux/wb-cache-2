The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waals interaction, electrostatic interaction, <b>dipole-dipole</b> <b>interaction,</b> hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond.

Because of the weak, induced <b>dipole–dipole</b> <b>interaction</b> between helium atoms, their macroscopic physical properties are mainly determined by their zero-point energy. Also, the microscopic properties of helium-3 cause it to have a higher zero-point energy than helium-4. This implies that helium-3 can overcome dipole–dipole interactions with less thermal energy than helium-4 can.|$|E

2500|$|Haloalkanes {{generally}} {{resemble the}} parent alkanes in being colorless, relatively odorless, and hydrophobic. Their boiling points {{are higher than}} the corresponding alkanes and scale with the atomic weight and number of halides. This {{is due to the}} increased strength of the intermolecular forces—from London dispersion to <b>dipole-dipole</b> <b>interaction</b> because of the increased polarity. Thus carbon tetraiodide (...) is a solid whereas carbon tetrafluoride (...) is a gas. As they contain fewer C–H bonds, halocarbons are less flammable than alkanes, and some are used in fire extinguishers. Haloalkanes are better solvents than the corresponding alkanes because of their increased polarity. Haloalkanes containing halogens other than fluorine are more reactive than the parent alkanes—it is this reactivity that is the basis of most controversies. Many are alkylating agents, with primary haloalkanes and those containing heavier halogens being the most active (fluoroalkanes do not act as alkylating agents under normal conditions). The ozone-depleting abilities of the CFCs arises from the photolability of the C–Cl bond.|$|E
2500|$|The precessing nuclei {{can also}} {{fall out of}} {{alignment}} with each other (returning the net magnetization vector to a non-precessing field) and stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation. Because {{of the difference in}} the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions [...] ), T1 is usually (except in rare cases) longer than T2 (that is, slower spin-lattice relaxation, for example because of smaller <b>dipole-dipole</b> <b>interaction</b> effects). In practice, the value of T2* which is the actually observed decay time of the observed NMR signal, or free induction decay (to [...] of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF inhomogeneity of the resonant pulse). In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum—meaning the Fourier transform of the free induction decay—the T2* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long T2 relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous ("well-shimmed") static magnetic field, whereas nuclei with shorter T2 values give rise to broad FT-NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both T1 and T2 depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance.|$|E

Our approach allows us to highlight the tradeoff between finite-size effects and <b>dipole-dipole</b> <b>interactions</b> in superradiance/subradiance.
