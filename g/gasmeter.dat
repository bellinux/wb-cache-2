5000|$|A three-station {{trial was}} held in {{conjunction}} with a large-scale assault and landing exercise in the Moray Firth in February/March 1944. The success of the trials and the relative ease of use and accuracy of the system resulted in Decca receiving an order for 27 Admiralty Outfit QM receivers. The receiver consisted of an electronics unit with two dials and was known to its operators as the [...] "Blue <b>Gasmeter</b> Job". A Decca chain was set up, consisting of a master station at Chichester and slaves at Swanage and Beachy Head. A fourth decoy transmitter was located in the Thames Estuary as part of the deception that the invasion would be focussed on the Calais area.|$|E

Sensors are deploying and are connecting {{with each other}} in environment dynamically. In this paper we present a model for processes which are related to user of water, electricity and <b>gas(meter</b> reading, distribution of bills, sending notice, cutting and reconnection of flow) by using wireless sensor network. We are using VB software and embedded c for our result. Keywords- wireless sensor network, user process, electricity, water, gas. I...|$|E

He found, using a graduated rebreather with a demand apparatus (1922), that there were very great variations in ventilation, including considerable under-ventilation, during ether anaesthesia (1928). There was little further work involving measure-ment of respiratory volumes until Ament, Suskind, and Rahn (1949) described the measurement of minute volume by expir-ing through unidirectional valves into a <b>gasmeter,</b> during thiopentone anaesthesia. Ridley and Faulconer (1952) and late...|$|E
40|$|There is good {{evidence}} that the respiratory depressant action of 1 - 3 -hydroxy N-methyhnorphinan (levorphan) is wholly or partially antagonized by subse quent administration of its closely related compound l- 3 -hydroxy-N-allyl morphinan (levallorphan). The major part of this work {{has been carried out}} in animals (Fromherz and Pellmont, 1952; Benson, O'Gara and Van Winkle, 1952), although there is one clinical report of observations on the respiratory effect in man (Hamilton and Cullen, 1953). Quantitative evaluation of the respiratory effect of these substances either alone or in combination is lacking, and it was for this reason that the present study was initiated. METHODS. Nine healthy male volunteers between the ages 21 and 33 were used as sub jects. All observations were made while the subject was in the reclining position. A nose clip and rubber mouthpiece were worn, the latter connected to a check-valve arrangement the input of which led from a Douglas bag and the output to a <b>gasmeter.</b> Respiratory fre quency was recorded on continuously moving paper by a galvanometer which was acti vated by a strain gauge pneumograph device. Observations were made on each inspired ga...|$|E
40|$|Conformity {{assessment}} is the activity {{to determine whether}} specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled. Often measurements are used {{to show that the}} measurand is within (legal) tolerances. Currently analytical methods are available to test whether tolerances are met with a preset level of confidence, e. g. 95 %. The test requires the availability of the overall measurement uncertainty and the statistical distribution of the measurand. In absence of better information this distribution is assumed to be Gaussian. The new point in this paper is that Monte Carlo methods can be applied directly to perform the conformity assessment. The reason is that the Monte Carlo process generates the cumulative distribution, whereby the (legal) tolerances can be compared directly. The advantage of this process is that the type of distribution {{does not need to be}} known and the (worst case) assumption of the distribution being Gaussian can be avoided. Consequently, for a Monte Carlo method the difference between tolerances and acceptance criteria is slightly smaller than for analytical methods. A test of the Monte Carlo method applied to a calibration of a high-pressure <b>gasmeter</b> meeting MID tolerances demonstrates the applicability of the method in practice...|$|E
