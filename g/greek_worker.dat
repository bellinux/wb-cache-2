50|$|During the Classical period an {{important}} public building, the Pompeion, stood {{inside the walls}} in the area between the two gates. This served a key function in the procession (pompē - πομπή) in honour of Athena during the Panathenaic Festival. It consisted of a large courtyard surrounded by columns and banquet rooms, where the nobility of Athens would eat the sacrificial meat for the festival. According to ancient Greek sources, a hecatomb (a sacrifice of 100 cows) was carried out for the festival and the people received the meat in the Kerameikos, possibly in the Dipylon courtyard; excavators have found heaps of bones {{in front of the}} city wall. The Pompeion and many other buildings {{in the vicinity of the}} Sacred Gate were razed to the ground by the marauding army of the Roman dictator Sulla, during his sacking of Athens in 86 BC; an episode that Plutarch described as a bloodbath. During the 2nd century AD, a storehouse was constructed on the site of the Pompeion, but it was destroyed during the invasion of the Heruli in 267 AD. The ruins became the site of potters' workshops until about 500 AD, when two parallel colonnades were built behind the city gates, overrunning the old city walls. A new Festival Gate was constructed to the east with three entrances leading into the city. This was in turn destroyed in raids by the invading Avars and Slavs at the end of the 6th century, and the Kerameikos fell into obscurity. It was not rediscovered until a <b>Greek</b> <b>worker</b> dug up a stele in April 1863.|$|E

50|$|The {{background}} of KKE has roots {{in more than}} 60 years of small socialist, anarchist and communist groups, mainly in industrialized areas.

Inspired by the Paris Commune and the communist revolutionary efforts in the United States, Germany and Russia {{at the beginning of the}} century, and the destruction that almost 20 years of wars had brought upon the <b>Greek</b> <b>workers,</b> a unified Social-Communist party was founded in Greece.|$|R

The main objective is to explore {{how much of the}} differential is explained by differences in observed characteristics. We also investigate the effect that assimilation has on the immigrants’ earnings. Our results provide empirical evidence that the part of the wage gap due to differences in the coefficients is largest for immigrants originating from non-EU countries and negative for those immigrants who terminated education in Greece. ...|$|R

These are the Greek Orthodox Communities and the <b>Greek</b> <b>workers</b> leagues that have operated in Australian cities for most of the twentieth century. In our discussion we explain the strengths and limits of the concept of ethnicity for organisational purposes, through an analysis of its uses as the basis of members’ organisational unity...|$|R
