5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} typhoid fever in flooded areas. In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a <b>gas</b> <b>plant</b> becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} for {{the first}} few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes <b>gas</b> <b>plant</b> location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with a pad rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative aiming system that is activated upon pressing the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E
5|$|By 1951, Dawson Creek {{had more}} than 3,500 residents. In 1952, the John Hart Highway linked the town {{to the rest of}} the British Columbia Interior and Lower Mainland through the Rocky Mountains; a new {{southbound}} route, known locally as Tupper Highway, made the town a crossroads with neighbouring Alberta. The next year, western Canada's largest propane <b>gas</b> <b>plant</b> was built and federal government offices were established in town. In 1958, the extension of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway to the Peace from Prince George was completed, and the village was re-incorporated as a city. Between 1951 and 1961, the population of Dawson Creek more than tripled. The RCAF center reemerged on 1 October 1956 and was declared functional in 1958. It was disbanded a final time in March 1964.|$|E

40|$|The cost {{of loss of}} {{production}} in oil and <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> is on average 6. 5 times {{higher than that of}} plants in any other industry. Thus the reliability performance and analysis of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> are unique. There have been many studies that have produced reliability indices for equipment that is used in industrial distribution networks, but these are all industry generic and none are specifi c to the oil and gas industry. This paper presents a set of equipment reliability indices that has been established from data collected from oil and <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> and is suitable for use in reliability evaluations of the distribution networks of oil and <b>gas</b> <b>plants.</b> In the design of distribution networks for new oil and <b>gas</b> <b>plants,</b> engineers either do not have enough operational data, enough time or {{do not know how to}} perform the analysis required for establishing what type of network topology to use. This paper recommends the optimal network topology to use in such cases and provides evidence to support this proposal. [URL] Electronic and Computer Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural <b>gas</b> <b>plant</b> would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor, Armstrong oversaw many issues that {{concerned}} the city. In March 1911, he expressed his support for a new city hall building to be built, expressing his dissatisfaction with the existing building that housed the council and civic employees, mentioning the ever-expanding number of staff. Later in that year, a committee would be formed concerning the issue, and a new structure would be planned with a planned cost of one million dollars. In July of that same year, he would sign a bylaw that would allow an American entrepreneur to establish a <b>gas</b> <b>plant</b> in the city, an issue that had been presented to council for debate several months prior. Later that year, {{the prospect of a}} municipal <b>gas</b> <b>plant</b> would also be supplied to city council. In July 1911, when, along with the city council, he dismissed a pair of city commissioners after months of debate. The firing triggered a by-election when alderman James H. McKinley would resign in protest to the action. In 1911, he also served as {{a vice president of the}} Union of Alberta Municipalities. Involved in national and provincial affairs, he voiced his support for a canal to be constructed in the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, stating that the presence of such canal would improve the trading relations of Canada with the United States by allowing an easier route between the two countries. He also was in favour of a hydroelectric project in the Athabasca River. Additionally, during t{{his first term}} as mayor, Armstrong also oversaw the city's festivities on George V's coronation and moved to form a municipal purchasing department.|$|E
5|$|Salvin {{aimed to}} create a castle that would appear to have grown up {{organically}} over time, but still appeal to Victorian aesthetic taste. Accordingly, a large, square tower {{was built on the}} west side of the castle and another smaller tower on the east, both creating additional space but also making the castle deliberately asymmetrical. The 18th-century chapel at the rear was demolished and replaced with another tower, alongside a modern conservatory. A variety of windows in the styles of different historical periods were inserted in the walls, while modern Victorian technology, including gas lighting-supported by a <b>gas</b> <b>plant</b> in the basement-central heating and new kitchens were installed within the castle. The roof of the Great Gatehouse was raised {{to create a}} more uniform sequence of battlements, and a large hall for gatherings of the local farmers installed. A new wing of servants' quarters and offices were sunk into the hill, spread over two floors leading away from the main part of the mansion.|$|E

25|$|From its {{original}} development until the wide-scale adoption of natural gas, more than 50,000 manufactured <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> {{were in existence}} in the United States alone. The process of manufacturing gas usually produced a number of by-products that contaminated the soil and groundwater {{in and around the}} manufacturing plant, so many former town <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> are a serious environmental concern, and cleanup and remediation costs are often high. Manufactured <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> (MGPs) were typically sited near or adjacent to waterways that were used to transport in coal and for the discharge of wastewater contaminated with tar, ammonia and/or drip oils, as well as outright waste tars and tar-water emulsions.|$|R

40|$|Natural gas {{processing}} {{is a major}} industry in Alberta, Canada, and {{a significant source of}} fugitive emissions of both methane and volatile organic hydrocarbon (VOCs). This project investigated fugitive emissions at natural <b>gas</b> processing <b>plants</b> in Alberta using two complementary optical measurement methods. At five <b>gas</b> <b>plants,</b> the fugitive emissions of methane and hydrocarbons ethane and larger (C 2 + hydrocarbons) were measured and quantified using Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL). The DIAL was also used to measure emissions from process flares at two of the <b>gas</b> <b>plants.</b> At two of the <b>plants,</b> a <b>gas</b> leak imaging camera was used to locate individual hydrocarbon leaks. For the five <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> surveyed in Alberta, DIAL measured methane emissions ranged from 100 to 146 kg/hr and C 2 + hydrocarbon emissions ranged from 38 to 342 kg/hr. Compressors and condensate storage tanks were two significant emission sources at all of the <b>gas</b> <b>plants.</b> Process flares operating on pilot were typically responsible for 10 to 15 % of the total methane emissions. At two <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> the DIAL measured emissions of methane, VOCs and benzene were compared with values calculated using emission factor methods. Measured emissions of methane and VOCs were four to eight times higher than the emission factor estimates. The largest differences between measured values and estimates were for the flares and storage tanks. DIAL measured values gave a more realistic evaluation of revenue lost as fugitives than the industry accepted estimation methods, leading to an increased incentive to improve leak detection and repair...|$|R
