5|$|There was {{widespread}} dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally {{at the side}} of Lucius Antonius, who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from Clodia Pulchra, the daughter of Fulvia (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> defensive siege at Perusia (modern Perugia), where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40BC.|$|E
