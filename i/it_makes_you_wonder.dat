Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter claimed that the show would be able to stand [...] "in a world without Archer" [...] and called it thin and with limited potential. Bob Sassone of The A.V. Club gave it a C+, calling it [...] "more clever than funny with Archer vibes". Brian Lowry of Variety claims that the show settles more for being puerile than clever, making it [...] "less than dazzling".

5000|$|Digital Spy {{awarded the}} song 3 stars and said: [...] "It's {{essentially}} a classic boyband ballad given some trendy, rave-tinged production - lyrics to please Louis Walsh, synth sounds {{to satisfy the}} Kiss FM playlist team. Decent enough then, but as with most of their album, <b>it</b> does <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how far JLS might go with some really good tunes?" [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Chart blog gave the song a positive review stating [...] "You've got to love a song with two tempos. I mean most songs have just the one. They begin, tick away the minutes, sometimes stopping, sometimes starting up again, but they really don't ever tend to deviate from their one central pulse. But this has got TWO. TWO! The opening verse is wafty and slow, Aston calmly explaining that he's got his eye on a special someone and he's trying to screw his courage up into a little ball {{so that he can}} go and ask her out. Then there's some ravey synth action, which is whizzy and fast and we're into the chorus, which is - and this is where the genius lies - BOTH OF THESE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME!" ...|$|R

However, according to a 2014 Pew poll, Americans now prefer rehabilitation to prison time.According to Miller We have a system sanction and punishment that has become excessive by historical and global standards...And when you see the potential of people Anderson who have made terrible errors and caused harm and nonetheless succeed as a member of society, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> how many other people can do that, and whether harsh sanctions remove opportunities for mercy and redemption.|$|E

This book shows another aspect of Heumann’s way of seeing, the subtlety of his still life which capture the moment but show that the moment is moving on; himself, the photographer, by essence a ‘voyeur’ {{catching}} lights and shadows in moments many are not aware of; a single stem placed in a glass of water; the black cat leaping across one’s path; the hounds waiting for {{the call of the}} huntsman; a beautiful woman caught in the shower. Indeed Blue Shower, exhibited at the Royal Academy, was much featured in the BBC’s recent coverage of this year’s Summer Exhibition. The work is so versatile, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what you have missed and what you might see, if you look for that “Augenblick”. - Some pictures make you aware about ironies in life without shouting too loud.

5000|$|In 2012 Mendler {{joined the}} {{anthropology}} {{class at the}} University of Southern California. She decided to study art after two members of her band joined her at USC. In an interview with Brian Mansfield of USA Today, Mendler said: [...] "My plan right now is just to do one class {{at a time and}} see how that goes. I'm just going to study something that will be interesting and doable from the road and just take care of my general education courses for now. I want to know something outside of what I do." [...] In 2013, she chose anthropology and studied Medieval Visual Culture, and medical Anthropology. To the University Star, Mendler said the USC was important so that she doesn't have a formulaic career: [...] "I think seeing that college life and what that would've been like, <b>it</b> does <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what sort of lifestyle that would be, but I'm really grateful for what I have, and I think it's cool that, because my career path is not as formulaic, I can kind of decide when I want to take time off to do certain things." [...] In 2016 she graduated as an anthropologist. Mendler has doctorate plans, inspired by her mother, doctor of public policy.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of her fourth album, Walker had been working with producer Salaam Remi on a side-project entitled Champagne Flutes. In 2008, the duo's song [...] "Hey Baby" [...] was featured on the Sex and the City, Vol. 2: More Music soundtrack. During her {{time away from the}} spotlight, Walker also provided backing vocals for Jennifer Hudson and Fergie. She explained that [...] "I wasn't really thinking about coming back with another album because I thought, 'You know what? I'm not really trying to do the artist thing anymore. I love to sing but let me just work alongside people." [...] She explained her hiatus from the music industry by saying [...] "If you're an artist doing something else you feel like people aren't really trying to buy into it because these artists have flooded the market so much. <b>It</b> just <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder,</b> 'Why should I bother? No one's going to be interested in what I'm trying to do. I was locked into that industry.

5000|$|IGN {{contributor}} Matt Fowler {{commented that}} the Jenna and Danny story [...] "felt weak" [...] but that Angie getting her own show [...] "more than made up for it." [...] Fowler gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student commented that [...] "Mrs. Donaghy" [...] had a [...] "solid comeback", while Entertainment Weeklys Breia Brissey was glad that the show returned. [...] "The strength of Donaghy' was that, however silly, all of the illogical circumstances of the show can be explained {{with a bit of}} reason", reported Caitlin Smith of The Atlantic. Smith said her favorite scene was when Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with Jeffrey, and [...] "he's counseling the newly married couple to avoid bringing their personal relationship into work and reads off a lengthy checklist of things to avoid." [...] Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times explained that the reason the series is having a strong season is due to it returning to the basics with the Jack and Liz friendship; [...] "Somehow, Liz and Jack are such a perfect, if unexpected, pair that this theme manages not to wear thin. Their accidental marriage ... was almost inevitable, the logical end to which the writers could stretch the relationship. <b>It</b> does <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder</b> what the writers can possibly do next, but I have faith." [...] New York magazine's Willa Paskin enjoyed Tina Fey's impression of Edith Bouvier Beale during her press conference. Elliott Hammer of The Collegian wrote that Angie's tagline for her reality show [...] "I'm Angie and I think elegance and attitude are the same thing" [...] was brilliant.|$|R

The book followed her career and her own personal struggles over the years. Zimmer believed that the book will make the public see her for who she truly is and said, [...] "When you’re with a character that long, sometimes <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>wonder,</b> Who am I? The book will correlate Reva to Kim, hopefully with humor." [...] The actress has also been appearing in numerous stage productions including Sunset Boulevard, Blood Brothers, Gypsy, The Rainmaker, Love, Loss and What I Wore, Odysseus D.O.A. and Lost Boy Found in Whole Foods which raised funds for the awareness in Darfur. Zimmer also participated in ABC Daytime Salutes Broadway Cares in 2010 and appeared with former co-star Robert Newman, who played Josh Lewis {{in the production of}} Curtains in 2011. In 2012, Zimmer, along with several other daytime actors, began filming for the movie 23 Blast in Corbin, Kentucky.

[...] Perhaps Framework and Symphony represented the peak of integrated software products, amid questions about the genre's viability under the new graphical user interfaces. The GUI on a Macintosh or Microsoft Windows, based around a desktop metaphor and typically enforcing a set of user interface guidelines for developers, enjoyed much greater consistency between standalone applications, removing one of the main motivations behind integrated packages. Microsoft stated in 1985 that hardware limited the power of all-in-one programs, and that simultaneously using multiple applications like Excel under Switcher on the Macintosh—with common user interfaces and ability to share data—was preferable to [...] "fully integrated" [...] software. Jerry Pournelle agreed, adding that [...] "it's going to be difficult to sell full integration to users. There's just too much to learn. Old hands looking for an improved text editor may not care to change spreadsheets. Newcomers almost certainly won't want to learn about spreadsheets, databases, text editors, and communications all at once."
