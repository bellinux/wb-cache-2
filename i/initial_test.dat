5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important <b>initial</b> <b>test</b> is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its <b>initial</b> <b>test</b> phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets {{began to}} roll off the {{production}} lines in 1984. The first two aircraft (serial numbers A21-101 and A21-102) were entirely built at McDonnell Douglas' factory in St. Louis, and were {{handed over to the}} RAAF on 29 October 1984. These aircraft remained in the United States until May 1985 for training and trials purposes. The next two Australian Hornets (A21-103 and A21-104) were also built at St. Louis, but were then disassembled and flown to Avalon in June 1984 on board a USAF Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. The aircraft were then reassembled, and A21-103 was rolled out at a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal David Evans, on 16 November. However, the aircraft's <b>initial</b> <b>test</b> flight was delayed until 26 February 1985 by a demarcation dispute over which category of pilot was permitted to fly the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the design, planning, <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> {{and evaluation of}} a pipe flow loop. The pipe flow loop will later be used in experiments on fluid transients, meaning that the design must be suitable for this purpose. The design of the flow loop is mainly based on simulations in LVTrans and FloMASTER. The design was completed and tested in May 2017 in combination with some simple experiments. The experimental setup mainly worked as expected and the <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> was completed with satisfying results. Experience from the <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> is the foundation for experimental procedures developed for further experimental work in the flow loop. Analysis of the results obtained from the <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> has revealed some deficiencies in the experimental setup. The deficiencies have been identified, and measures for improving the flow loop has been suggested...|$|R
5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The <b>initial</b> <b>test</b> designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E

40|$|Eyewitnesses {{typically}} recount {{their experiences}} {{many times before}} trial. Such repeated retrieval can enhance memory retention of the witnessed event. However, recent studies (e. g., Chan, Thomas, 2 ̆ 6 Bulevich, 2009) have found that initial retrieval can exacerbate eyewitness suggestibility to later misleading information—a finding termed retrieval-enhanced suggestibility (RES). Here we examined the influence of multiple retrieval attempts on eyewitness suggestibility to subsequent misinformation. In four experiments, we systematically varied the number of <b>initial</b> <b>tests</b> taken (between zero and six), the delay between <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> and misinformation exposure (30 min or 1 week), and whether <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> was manipulated between- or within-subjects. University undergraduate students were used as participants. Overall, we found that eyewitness suggestibility increased {{as the number of}} <b>initial</b> <b>tests</b> increased, but this RES effect was qualified by the delay and by whether <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> occurred in a within- or between-subjects manner. Specifically, the within-subjects RES effect was smaller than the between-subjects RES effect, possibly because of the influence of retrieval-induced forgetting/facilitation (Chan, 2009) when <b>initial</b> <b>testing</b> was manipulated within subjects. Moreover, consistent with the testing effect literature (Roediger 2 ̆ 6 Karpicke, 2006), the benefits of repeated testing on later memory were stronger after a 1 -week delay than after a 30 -min delay, thus reducing the negative impact of RES in long-term situations. These findings suggest that conditions that are likely to occur in criminal investigations can either increase (repeated testing) or reduce (delay) the influence of RES, thus further demonstrating the complex relationship between eyewitness memory and repeated retrieval.

25|$|DNA profiling, {{based on}} typing {{individual}} highly variable minisatellites {{in the human}} genome, was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985, with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the <b>initial</b> <b>test</b> that types many minisatellites simultaneously. By focusing on {{just a few of}} these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases.

25|$|The {{design team}} also {{attempted}} to minimize {{changes in the}} aircraft's trim at varying speeds, thus reducing the pilot's workload. They were so successful in this regard that they found in-flight-adjustable aileron and rudder trim tabs were not necessary. Small, fixed tabs were fitted to control surfaces and adjusted for proper balance during <b>initial</b> <b>test</b> flights. Only the elevator trim needed to be adjusted in flight (a feature common to all aircraft). This was accomplished by tilting the entire horizontal tailplane with an electric motor, with an angle of incidence ranging from −3° to +5°.|$|E
