This interest has inspired open source communities to produce {{a large amount of}} software, including simple function libraries, development frameworks (e.g. the Spring Framework, Apache Wicket, Dojo Toolkit, Hibernate), and open source implementations of standards and tools (e.g. Apache Tomcat, the <b>GlassFish</b> application server, the Mule and Apache ServiceMix Enterprise service buses).|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, about 375 {{species of}} fishes are known from {{freshwater}} habitats in New Guinea. Of these, 217 are strictly freshwater and 149 are endemic to New Guinea. In general, {{there is a}} strong connection in the fauna of New Guinea and Australia, and 33 freshwater fish species from New Guinea are also found in northern Australia. The most speciose families in New Guinea are the rainbowfish, blue-eyes, gudgeons and gobies, but there are also several species of Old World silverside, grunters, <b>glassfish,</b> ariid catfish, eeltail catfish and more.|$|E

50|$|On 10 December 2009 <b>GlassFish</b> 3.0 (a.k.a. Sun <b>GlassFish</b> Enterprise Server 3.0) was released. Being the Java EE {{reference}} implementation, {{this was}} the first application server to completely implement Java EE 6 JSR 316. JSR 316 was however approved with reservations. In this version <b>GlassFish</b> adds new features to ease migration from Tomcat to <b>GlassFish.</b> The other main new features are around modularity (<b>GlassFish</b> v3 Prelude already shipped with an Apache Felix OSGi runtime), startup time (a few seconds), deploy-on-change (provided by NetBeans and Eclipse plugins), and session preservation across redeployments.|$|E
50|$|Open-source <b>GlassFish</b> {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{at least through}} version 5, and the Java EE 8 Reference Implementation will be derived from <b>GlassFish</b> Server Open Source Edition 5.

40|$|India is {{blessed with}} a rich {{diversity}} of freshwater fishes both in the Western Ghats and North Eastern Hills. The Western Ghats of India {{is one of the}} 34 - biodiversity ‘hotspot’ areas of the world. The rate of endemism is well reflected in the case of lower vertebrates especially with regard to fishes. Of the 300 species of freshwater fishes in the Western Ghats, 155 are considered ornamental fishes, of which 117 are endemic to the Western Ghats (Gopalakrishnan & Ponniah, 2000). At present, {{only a small fraction of}} the endemic fish diversity is utilized in ornamental fish trade. All the ornamental fishes marketed in India are exotic. Eventhough there are quite a lot of indigenous fishes, having high potential as ornamental fishes, they have not been properly exploited. The fish fauna of the Western Ghats include variety of barbs, rasboras, killifishes, <b>glassfishes,</b> catfishes, catopra, hill trouts, and danios, which are ideal candidates for ornamental fish industry. They are exceptionally beautiful with a wide variety of bands, blotches, spots, and colourful fins on their body. In spite of the fact that the Western Ghats of India is a gold mine of endemic freshwater fishes suitable for the ornamental fish trade, no concerted efforts have so far been undertaken for the development of sustainable market for these resources. Lack of scientific information on these native aquatic fauna is the main reason for the poor performance of this sector...|$|R
