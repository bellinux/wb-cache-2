Aiming at the existing multistage {{hydraulic cylinder}} design method's insufficiency, the CAD/CAE technology is introduced into the domains of multistage hydraulic cylinder design. In this paper push-forwarding five-stage hydraulic cylinder is designed, and virtual assembly is established based on three-dimensional digital model using PRO/E sofeware. The multistage hydraulic cylinder's load-supporting characteristics are analyzed by ANSYS. The result of finite element analysis shows that the stress on the top front part of three down hydraulic cylinder is biggest, those on the trunnion and the cylinder's bottom are also bigger.

40|$|Abstract- Wear plate welding {{machines}} requires some special raw {{material handling system}} as they are heavy to handle. Wear plate welding requires 4 - 5 workers for handling and clamping of raw material. This paper reviews different material handling equipment used by various industries. As the raw material is heavy, {{it is very difficult}} to handle manually. Hence there is requirement of integrated material handling and clamping system to do this heavy task. An integrated approach for material handling and clamping is suggested. In this paper, various handling mechanisms like scissor lifting mechanism, hydraulic lift platform in scissors type mechanism, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> based on multistage telescopic cylinder are discussed. Their analysis is done by using various software. Some failure diagnosis points are also discussed by mathematical calculations.

40|$|In this dissertation, motion {{synchronization}} of multi-cylinder electro-hydraulic (EH) <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> is investigated. Among {{the different}} methods of synchronizing {{the displacement of}} multiple cylinders in a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> with unknown but bounded load, EH control presents a set of attractive trade-offs. A general model for an n-cylinder EH lift is developed that includes the vertical displacement, pitch and row motion of the load. It {{can be seen that}} without external synchronization control, the lift is an unstable system where the difference in cylinder displacements will increase under unbalanced load, and will result in significant pitch and row motion that will topple the load. Two prototype EH <b>lift</b> <b>systems,</b> a two-post and a four-post lift, are constructed to evaluate different motion synchronization control strategies. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Cross-Coupled Controller (CCC) approaches are applied using the linearlized lift model. Experimental results show noticeable improvement over existing mechanical constraint solution. ^ Due to the inherent nonlinear dynamics and uncertainties associated with the hydraulic system, a nonlinear perturbation observer is proposed to estimate the perturbation that combines the effect of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. A nonlinear force/pressure control algorithm is then designed to improve force/pressure tracking using the result of the perturbation observer. By exploiting the unique structure of the <b>lift</b> <b>system,</b> an inner and outer loop control is realized through a two-step back-stepping synthesis approach. The outer loop motion synchronization control is achieved using linear MIMO robust control techniques and the inner force control loop is achieved using the previously developed perturbation observer based nonlinear force control. The overall system stability is shown under the assumption of bounded lumped perturbation. The feasibility of the proposed two-loop control strategy is verified using both simulation and experimental results. Experimental results show that the proposed controller achieves steady-state synchronization down to the sensor resolution level as well as demonstrates improved transient performance compared to the linear designs. Valve dynamics are ignored in the current design. Experimental data show that sensor noise and valve dynamics (bandwidth) are the two most significant factors that limit the performance of the system. ...|$|R

The system {{is comprised of}} a professionally designed hydraulic and chain driven mechanism, encased within the platform frame, powered by an electrical pump.

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was {{investigated}} among native {{plants in the}} Mojave Desert using in situ thermocouple psychrometers. Night lighting and day shading experiments were used to verify the phenomenon. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was detected for all species examined: five shrub species with different rooting depths and leaf phenologies and one perennial grass species. This study {{was the first to}} document <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> for a CAM species, Yucca schidigera. The pattern of diel flux in soil water potential for the CAM species was temporally opposite to that of C 3 species: for the CAM plant, soil water potential increased in shallow soils during the day when the plant was not transpiring and decreased at night when transpiration began. Because CAM plants transport water to shallow soils during the day when surrounding C 3 and C 4 plants transpire, CAM species that hydraulically lift water may influence water relations of surrounding species {{to a greater extent than}} hydraulically lifting C 3 or C 4 species. A strong, negative relationship between the percent sand in the study site soils at the 0. 35 m soil depth and the frequency that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was observed at that depth suggests that the occurrence of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> is negatively influenced by coarse-textured soils, perhaps due to less root–soil contact in sandy soils relative to finer-textured soils. Differences in soil texture among study sites may explain, in part, differences in the frequency that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was detected among these species. Further investigations are needed to elucidate species versus soil texture effects on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift...</b>|$|R
