5|$|Munden Point Park is a rural park {{located in}} the deep {{southern}} end of the city, right on The North Landing River. It is owned and maintained by the city of Virginia Beach. The park features five shelters, three baseball fields, a boat ramp, boat rentals, three playgrounds, six horseshoe pits, volleyball nets, and light hiking trails. An outdoor amphitheatre is fully equipped with <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> and is available for reservations of weddings, outside classroom activities and other events. Restrooms, parking, vending machines, playgrounds, gardens, and barbecue grills are also available for use. Canoes, boat ramps, and disc golf courses may also be rented to go.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. <b>Electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, {{and in the case of}} EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E

In colder climates, block heaters are often standard equipment in new vehicles. In extremely cold climates, <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> are sometimes found in public or private parking lots, especially in multi-storey car parks. Some parking lots cycle the power on for 20 minutes and off for 20 minutes, to reduce electricity costs.|$|E

The park is maintained by the Greater Huntington Park and Recreation District. It was created in 1913 by Rufus Switzer, a city council member of West Virginia. It consists of numerous lengthy walking and cycling trails along Four Pole Creek, which runs {{the entire length of}} the park and is crossed by many wooden and stone footbridges.There are also restroom facilities, picnic tables, a shelter with grills and <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets,</b> a children's playground, an amphitheater for small concerts and plays, an award-winning rose garden, and a new dog park.|$|E

25|$|The State of Oregon Law Library on {{the second}} floor of the {{building}} was created in 1848 when Oregon Territory was created. In 1851 the legislature passed an act to provide a librarian for this library that mainly served Oregon government officials. Then in 1855 a capitol building was nearly complete when it burned down on December 29, 1855. This building included the law library {{on the second}} floor. In 1905 control of the library was changed to the Oregon Supreme Court and both moved into the Supreme Court Building in 1914. In 2002 the library name was changed from the Oregon Supreme Court Library to the State of Oregon Law Library after the completion of renovations that among other items increased the number of <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> from just two.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{because the}} concept of Internet of things entails adding {{electronics}} to mundane devices (for example, simple light switches), and because the major driver for replacement of electronic components is often technological obsolescence rather than actual failure to function, {{it is reasonable to}} expect that items that previously were kept in service for many decades would see an accelerated replacement cycle if {{they were part of the}} IoT. For example, a traditional house built with 30 light switches and 30 <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> might stand for 50 years, with all those components still original at the end of that period. But a modern house built with the same number of switches and outlets set up for IoT might see each switch and outlet replaced at five-year intervals, in order to keep up to date with technological changes. This translates into a ten-fold increase in waste requiring disposal.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} {{to get used to the}} idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E
500|$|The novel uses a third-person {{narrative}} {{in the present}} tense with a somber tone reminiscent of a [...] "low-level post-apocalypticism". Cayce's memories of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which briefly use the future tense, are told by Gibson as [...] "a Benjaminian seed of time", as one reviewer calls it, because of the monistic and lyrical descriptions of Cayce's relationship to objects with the attacks in the background. Two neologisms appear in the novel: gender-bait and mirror-world. Gibson created the term mirror-world to acknowledge a locational-specific distinction in a manufactured object that emerged from a parallel development process, for example opposite-side driving or varied <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets.</b> Gender-bait refers to a male posing as a female online to elicit positive responses. The term coolhunter, not coined by Gibson but used in the marketing industry for several years, is used to describe Cayce's profession of identifying the roots of emerging trends.|$|E

The massager provides two vibration rates5,000 and 6,000rpm, which are equivalent to 83Hz and 100Hzthat are controlled by a switch on its body. Specifically, research published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy determined that the Magic Wand operated on its low setting at a frequency of 89Hz and at 101Hz on its high setting. Its displacement was measured as , with an acceleration of [...] Because the device was not originally designed as a sexual stimulation aid, it exhibits some deficiencies when used for this purpose. Apart from its size, bulk, and its reliance on a mains power supply that limits its portability, it is not waterproof or water-resistant, and it overheats when used for more than 25 minutes. It does not work well in <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> in all countries internationally.|$|E

2500|$|A toggle {{light switch}} is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets</b> whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle light switch is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle light switch into the on/off position. The design for the toggle light switch was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of Quebec, all Canadian provinces have banned smoking indoors and outdoors in all their prison facilities. Prison officials and guards are sometimes worried due to previous events in other prisons concerning riots, fostering a cigarette black market within the prison, and other problems resulting from total prison smoking restrictions. Prisons have experienced riots when placing smoking restrictions into effect resulting in prisoners setting fires, destroying prison property, persons being assaulted, injured, and stabbed. One prison in Canada had some guards reporting breathing difficulties from the fumes of prisoners smoking artificial cigarettes made from nicotine patches lit by creating sparks from inserting metal objects into <b>electrical</b> <b>outlets.</b> [...] For example in 2008, the Orsainville Detention Centre near Quebec City, withdrew its smoke-free provision following a riot. But the feared increase in tension and violence expected in association with smoking restrictions has generally not been experienced in practice.|$|E
