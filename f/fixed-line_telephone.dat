5|$|Hurricane Beta reached Providencia Island, on October 29, 2005. Rainfall {{from the}} storm were {{estimated}} over 12in (304mm). Roofs were damaged all over the island, and the island's main communications tower was knocked over. A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in repair costs. This disrupted <b>fixed-line</b> <b>telephone</b> service and as the island has no cellular telephone service, it caused a total cessation of communication with the mainland. Beta's arrival on the island {{was accompanied by a}} seven-foot storm surge, which damaged beaches, coastal houses and roads, and washed out a tourist footbridge. Coral reefs around the island were, for the most part, untouched, as only 1percent of the coral sustained minor damage. Minor effects were also found around areas of sea grass. Beaches all around the island lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage over the island.|$|E

50|$|Overall, China's {{telecommunications}} services improved enormously during the 1980s, and, {{the pace of}} telecommunications growth and technology upgrading increased even more rapidly after 1990, especially as fiber-optics systems and digital technology were installed. After 1997, China's {{telecommunications services}} were enhanced further with the acquisition of Hong Kong's highly advanced systems. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, foreign investment in the country's telecommunications sector further encouraged growth. Notable has been the tremendous increase in Internet and cellular phone usage. China became the world leader in the early 21st century, in terms of number of cell phone subscribers.

40|$|Abstract Background Households with <b>fixed-line</b> <b>telephones</b> have {{decreased}} while mobile (cell) phone ownership has increased. We therefore sought {{to examine the}} feasibility of recruiting young women for a national health survey through random digit dialling mobile phones. Methods Two samples of women aged 18 to 39 years were surveyed by random digit dialling fixed and mobile numbers. We compared participation rates and responses to a questionnaire between women surveyed by each contact method. Results After dialling 5, 390 fixed-lines and 3, 697 mobile numbers, 140 and 128 women were recruited respectively. Among women contacted and found to be eligible, participation rates were 74 % for fixed-lines and 88 % for mobiles. Taking into account calls to numbers where eligibility was unknown (e. g. unanswered calls) the estimated response rates were 54 % and 45 % respectively. Of women contacted by fixed-line, 97 % reported having a mobile while 61 % of those contacted by mobile reported having a fixed-line at home. After adjusting for age, {{there were no significant}} differences between mobile-only and fixed-line responders with respect to education, residence, and various health behaviours; however compared to those with fixed-lines, mobile-only women were more likely to identify as Indigenous (OR 4. 99, 95 %CI 1. 52 - 16. 34) and less likely to live at home with their parents (OR 0. 09, 95 %CI 0. 03 - 0. 29). Conclusions Random digit dialling mobile phones to conduct a health survey in young Australian women is feasible, gives a comparable response rate and a more representative sample than dialling <b>fixed-lines</b> only. <b>Telephone</b> surveys of young women should include mobile dialling. </p...|$|R

50|$|The public {{switched}} {{telephone network}} (PSTN) is {{the aggregate of}} the world's circuit-switched telephone networks that are operated by national, regional, or local telephony operators, providing infrastructure and services for public telecommunication. The PSTN consists of telephone lines, fiber optic cables, microwave transmission links, cellular networks, communications satellites, and undersea telephone cables, all interconnected by switching centers, thus allowing most telephones to communicate with each other. Originally a network of <b>fixed-line</b> analog <b>telephone</b> systems, the PSTN is now almost entirely digital in its core network and includes mobile and other networks, as well as fixed telephones.|$|R

50|$|Angola Telecom, the {{state-owned}} telecom, held a monopoly for <b>fixed-line</b> <b>telephone</b> service until 2005. Demand outstripped capacity, prices were high, and services poor.

By 2010, the number of fixed-line providers had expanded to five; Angola Telecom established mobile-cellular service in Luanda in 1993 and the network has been extended to larger towns.

40|$|The paper's {{objective}} is to explain factors underlying Africa's weak infrastructure endowment and to identify suitable infrastructure goals for the region based on benchmarking against international peers. The authors use a dataset covering the stocks of key infrastructure-including information and communication technology (ICT), power, roads, and water-across 155 developing countries over the period 1960 to 2005. The paper also examines subregional differences within Africa. They make use of regression techniques to control for a comprehensive set of economic, demographic, geographic, and historic conditioning factors, as well as adjusting for potential endogeneities. Results show that Africa lags behind all {{other regions of the}} developing world in its infrastructure endowment, except in ICT. By far the largest gaps arise in the power sector, with generating capacity and household access to electricity at half the levels observed in South Asia. While it is often assumed that Africa's infrastructure deficit is largely a reflection of its relatively low income levels, the authors find that African countries have much more limited infrastructure than income peers {{in other parts of the}} developing world. Countries that face the most challenging environment, with low population density, weak governance, and history of conflict, have the poorest infrastructure endowments. At the outset of the data series, Africa was doing significantly better than other developing regions for road density, generation capacity, and <b>fixed-line</b> <b>telephones,</b> but Africa's relative position has deteriorated over time. The most dramatic loss of ground has come in electrical generating capacity, which has stagnated since 1980.

40|$|Broadband {{telecommunication}} services are growing rapidly and spreading at a remarkable pace. Globally, mobile phones {{are one of}} the most universally available technologies today that have most affected people’s lives, both in developed and developing countries. This mode of communication has spread at such an astonishing rate that it has leapfrogged certain stages of communication in some developing countries. The introduction and use of mobile phones in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a new phenomenon. Many people, both in rural and urban parts of the country, have come to embrace this wholeheartedly. The mobile phone has become a necessity in every home and can be found almost everywhere in the country, whether in urban centres or the most isolated parts of the country. In rural areas where basic government services have progressively ceased to exist, people perceive the mobile phone as a beacon of hope that keeps them in touch with the outside world, giving them a new lease of life. The mobile phone has in a remarkable way lessened the ever increasing 'digital divide' between the haves and have-nots in a country where computers and <b>fixed-line</b> <b>telephones</b> were viewed as luxury items affordable only by the well-to-do and working people. Research shows that mobile phones are useful for people both in developed and developing countries. It is a means of conducting business and a potential tool for delivery of basic services. This development communication case study is based around the Closed User Group (CUG) service, a telecommunication product introduced to the country by Ireland-based mobile communication transnational, Digicel. This CUG service was introduced to the provincial health sector by the Western Highlands Provincial Health Authority (WHPHA), by equipping health care workers (HCW) with mobile phones to enable ease of communication among the workers and between health facilities in the province. This study using, phenomenology as part of the research framework, was undertaken to discover if the flow of communication through mobile phones can assist to meet the unique challenges of delivering health services to the rural areas...|$|R
