5|$|Jedi Knight uses both 3D <b>graphics</b> and {{surround}} sound. It {{is one of}} {{the early}} games to adopt the use of 3D <b>graphics</b> hardware acceleration using Microsoft Direct3D. The 3D sound technology was tweaked extensively to give an immersive feel to the game. This was achieved by experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles. Between levels Jedi Knight features full motion video cutscenes. The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre-rendered <b>graphics.</b> The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Many reviews {{commented on}} the <b>graphics,</b> citing there were other games with better <b>graphics</b> at the time. GamePro rated the <b>graphics</b> at 3.5 out of 5. Though the <b>graphics</b> were not well received, the {{character}} animations were very well received. The lack of audio dialog, which forced the player to read text for the story mode, was also a negative when many other games on the PS2 {{at the time were}} adding in voice overs. GamePro rated the overall sound a 3 out of 5. Other reviews rated the audio better, particularly the music and sound effects during the fights.|$|E

5|$|Space Invaders {{was first}} {{released}} in a cocktail-table format {{with black and}} white <b>graphics,</b> while the Western release by Midway was in an upright cabinet format. The upright cabinet uses strips of orange and green cellophane over the screen to simulate color <b>graphics.</b> The <b>graphics</b> are reflected onto a painted backdrop of a moon against a starry background. Later Japanese releases used rainbow-colored cellophane, such as T.T. Space Invaders in 1978, followed by a version with a full-color display. The cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters not present in the game. Nishikado attributes this to the artist basing the designs on the original title, Space Monsters, rather than referring to the in-game <b>graphics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Space was {{a popular}} setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the {{abstract}} setting would help obscure simple <b>graphics</b> that lacked realism. Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4months developing color variations of Taito's Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids. First inspired by Space Invaders, he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it lacked enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari's Asteroids, but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defenders proposed specifications were problematic. Asteroids displays vector <b>graphics</b> on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use pixel <b>graphics</b> on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel <b>graphics,</b> but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.|$|E
40|$|Open AccessWe {{demonstrate}} a unique shear-induced crystallization phenomenon above the equilibrium freezing temperature <b>Graphic</b> in weakly swollen isotropic <b>Graphic</b> and lamellar <b>Graphic</b> mesophases with bilayers formed in a cationic-anionic mixed surfactant system. Synchrotron rheological X-ray diffraction study reveals the crystallization transition to be reversible under shear (i. e., on stopping the shear, the nonequilibrium crystalline phase <b>Graphic</b> melts {{back to the}} equilibrium mesophase). This {{is different from the}} shear-driven crystallization below <b>Graphic,</b> which is irreversible. Rheological optical observations show that the growth of the crystalline phase occurs through a preordering of the <b>Graphic</b> phase to an <b>Graphic</b> phase induced by shear flow, before the nucleation of the <b>Graphic</b> phase.

5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to create setpiece <b>graphics</b> for key story moments, similar to {{simulation}} titles on PC games. Among the scenes initially planned were Marth kneeling next to the character Jagen {{in a pool of}} blood, and two characters escaping from an ambush. To try and accommodate the advanced <b>graphics,</b> the team opted to use an MMC3 memory chip. The adoption of the MMC3 was influenced by memory space difficulties experienced by the team during the development of Famicom Wars. When it was discovered that the chip only had one megabite of memory, the team were forced to streamline the <b>graphics</b> and visuals, resulting in the setpiece <b>graphics</b> being cut. The reduced emphasis on <b>graphics</b> meant that the game was not visually impressive, which was later regretted by Kaga and other team members.|$|E

40|$|<b>Graphic</b> design {{history can}} be a {{valuable}} resource, contributing to <b>graphic</b> design students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of design theories, and applied to problem solving exploration. According to many <b>graphic</b> design educators, current history courses are too often taught as superficial surveys of <b>graphic</b> style with no examinations of social, cultural, and political contexts, and have little interaction with practical studio courses. It is essential {{to bridge the gap}} between <b>graphic</b> design history and practical studio classes to further enhance <b>graphic</b> design education. This thesis will develop a means by which to show the tangible connection between <b>graphic</b> design history and applied problem-solving in a <b>graphic</b> design curriculum. The main goal of this thesis is to find a way to deliver <b>graphic</b> design history so as to enable students to apply useful historic knowledge to <b>graphic</b> design projects.

Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro.
