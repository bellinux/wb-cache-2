50|$|Although {{this was}} not one of the {{recommendations}} of the Board of Trade report, it became the practice for steep inclines to be fitted with runaway catchpoints so that runaway vehicles would be <b>derailed</b> and <b>stopped</b> before they had a chance to collide with following trains. These catchpoints became widespread, and only diminished in numbers when all rolling stock was fitted with continuous automatic brakes in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Whilst he was crossing, he saw {{the train}} {{approaching}} and attempted {{to attract the attention}} of the train driver as he continued to cross in an attempt to clear the crossing before the train arrived. The train driver would only have realised that the crossing was obstructed at a distance of 175 m, but the train would have required a distance of 800 m to stop at the speed it was travelling at (140 km/h). The driver activated the emergency brakes within a second of seeing the obstruction, slowing the train to 107 km/h at the point of impact. The platform was pushed 15 m along the line until it collided with a pole supporting the overhead line. The impact caused the platform to break into its three main parts and lifted the front of the train, which <b>derailed,</b> <b>stopping</b> a further 150 m further along the line. The cab of the train was destroyed, killing the driver. The platform operator jumped from the vehicle shortly before the collision, sustaining minor injuries.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{system for}} {{preventing}} trains fromderailing and colliding with hazards on railways is disclose. According to the innovation, the system includes a safety vehicle (i. e., “trolley”) that travels along a railway {{a head of}} a train. Railway safety is a crucial aspect of rail operation the world over. Malfunctions follow-on in accidents usually get wide media coverage even when the railway is not at fault and give to rail transport, among the unaware public, an unjustified image of inefficiency often fueling calls for immediate reforms. This paper is designed at helping the railway administrations concerned to strengthen their safety culture and develop the monitoring tools required by modern safety management. The train and trolley each include GPS receivers which constantly provide GPS location information to a microcontroller in the train. The CPU calculates {{the space between the}} trolley and the train, rate at which the train is roaming, and the distance required for the train to stop. The microcontroller transmit speeding up and deceleration commands to the trolley and/or train to maintain a safe distance between the trolley and a train. If the trolley <b>derail,</b> <b>stop</b> or slow downward due to a hazard on the railway or another difficulty, the CPU generates guidelines to slow down or end the train, as needed, to avoid the train from derailing or colliding with the trolley or a hazard on the railway. The wireless communication can be possible using ZigBee or RF transmitter...|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} and {{the first}} nine cars of No. 12 were derailed. A separation occurred between the locomotives {{and the first}} car. The locomotive units stopped in diagonal positions with {{the front end of}} the first unit south of the westward main tracks and about 95 feet east of the point of accident. The second unit stopped at right angles to the tracks and with the front end against the left rear corner of the first unit. Both units were badly damaged. The first four cars stopped in diagonal positions intermingled with the derailed cars of the other two trains and the other <b>derailed</b> cars <b>stopped</b> about in line with the track. The first two cars were destroyed and the other derailed cars of this train were badly damaged.|$|R
5000|$|A {{separation}} {{occurred between}} the locomotive {{and the first}} car of No. 5. The diesel-electric units remained coupled and stopped about {{in line with the}} track and with the front end about 740 feet west of the point of accident. Both diesel-electric units were badly damaged. A separation occurred at each end of each of the first six cars and these cars stopped in various positions on and across the tracks and intermingled with the derailed equipment of Extra 1736 West. The seventh car stopped with the front end against derailed equipment on track No. 3 and the rear end on the train structure of track No. 1 end the other <b>derailed</b> cars <b>stopped</b> in line with that track. The first six cars were destroyed and the other derailed cars of this train were badly damaged.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of faster trains, however, faced indirect regulatory hurdles. After a 1921 crash at Porter, Indiana, {{in which a}} <b>derail</b> failed to <b>stop</b> one passenger train that had already passed through two red lights from crashing into another at a Level junction, killing 37, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ordered almost a hundred railroads to install automatic train stops {{by the end of}} 1925. [...] The railroads opposed the ICC vigorously, noting that stopping longer freights that way might lead to derailments. As a result, the requirement was revised to allow waivers for certain lines, and rarely enforced as the debate continued without any real resolution over the next two decades; in the meantime passenger fatalities began declining as the automobile emerged as a transportation option.|$|R
50|$|Momo, however, is {{a wrench}} in the {{plans of the}} Men in Grey and the Timesavings Bank, thanks to her special personality. The Men in Grey try various plans to deal with her, to <b>derail</b> her from <b>stopping</b> their scheme, but they all fail. When even her closest friends fall under the {{influence}} of the Men in Grey in one way or another, Momo's only hope to save the time of mankind are the administrator of Time, Master Secundus Minutus Hora, and Cassiopeia, a tortoise who can communicate through writing on her shell and can see thirty minutes into the future. Momo's adventure takes her from the depths of her heart, where her own time flows from in the form of lovely hour-lilies, to the lair of the Men in Grey themselves, where the time people believe they save is hoarded.|$|R
50|$|In January a train {{headed for}} Bankstown {{overshot}} the platform at Homebush, passed the signal at <b>stop</b> and <b>derailed</b> on the catchpoints. One passenger was injured {{climbing the stairs}} to exit the station. The investigation found that the SPAD and subsequent derailment was a consequence of an error by the Driver who misinterpreted which signal applied to his line. The Driver was relatively inexperienced and {{it is probable that}} his driving and situational awareness were adversely affected by fatigue brought on by insufficient quality rest and sleep. It was also found that the position of the two signals, ST265L and S261S, increased the probability of a driver misinterpreting which signal applied to the line. Associated with the Signal ST 265L were two safety features: the first, a train stop which automatically applied the brakes as the train passed the signal without authority (this reduction in speed as the train derailed mitigated the consequences of the SPAD) and the second, catch-points associated with the signal operated correctly and derailed the train away from the adjacent line. However, the position in the track layout of these two safety devices resulted in the <b>derailed</b> train <b>stopping</b> foul of the adjacent line. It was also found that the formation and ballast adjacent to the catch-points was sufficient to stop the train turning onto its side but not sufficient to stop it tilting to a 10 degree angle.|$|R
5000|$|After {{these two}} strong stories were either <b>derailed</b> or <b>stopped</b> in their tracks, the show lost its momentum, {{although}} {{into the first}} few months of 1994 things seemed to be okay, although not great, as such events as Nicks former girlfriend from the fictional island of Cambrai, Dr. Eve Guthrie went insane and tried to kill Mindy, until Eve went to a mental institution and when she got out started a relationship with the lonely Ed (Eve and Ed would later marry, but Eve was killed off from a chemical warfare induced leukemia in May 1995). Of course Ed didnt get off the hook for the way Mo had died, for it turned out that Mo had discovered that Ed had a one-night stand with her best friend, nurse Lillian Raines, when Lillian had a breast cancer scare, and Mo accused Holly of the affair (since Holly and Ed had an affair back in the first half of 1989), until Mo discovered a letter that Lillian had written to Ed right while Mo was cleaning her kitchen (Ed had apparently dropped the letter near the sink while he was trying to repair some pipes). After Mo died, headwriter Curlee presented a wonderful and powerful scene where Roger Thorpe visited Mos grave, because Mo was the only one who treated Roger with any sympathy. But later when Roger had decided to fire Holly at WSPR television station, and hooked up with an English woman, and former jewel thief, Jenna Bradshaw, who at first claimed she was another daughter of Henry Chamberlains and later Jenna got involved with and had a child with the re-married to Nadine, Buzz Cooper), it would be Holly who would become the sympathetic character as she helped Michelle through her first period, and later found out from Ed that he had a one-night stand with another woman (which totally shocked Holly and isolated the two of them, from each other, for a great while; Holly would later find herself falling for and marrying Fletcher Reade and they would have a daughter with Down syndrome named Meg). (Roger and Jenna married in the summer of 1993 in a rather gothic setting, with a divorced Jenna later telling Vanessa that she was the [...] "Bride of Thorpestein"). Roger also saved Eds life, in almost a reversal of what happened in April 1980 when Ed nearly fell off a cliff at a hideaway that Michelle and Holly were staying at. (Of course the person who set this up to happen was, Roger himself). And a little later, in November 1993, Roger threatened Jenna not to leave him while she was pregnant with his child (a child shed later miscarry). Roger would crash Nick and Mindys engagement party (with some great scenes of Alexandra and Roger going after each other, vocally, at the Country Club ballroom). And a little later a great mystery would be had, when Roger was shot, and left for dead (he later showed up back alive after getting Holly to treat his wounds and coercing Eve Guthrie to attend to him), at the Country Clubs potting shed (this would later be revealed to be Billy Lewis, at the time being played by Geoffrey Scott, after Clarke had been arrested for drunk driving in Florida and was then fired by Procter & Gamble; Clarke would return in 1996). Billy would mention to his half-brother Josh Lewis at this time that Josh was the only brother Billy had left living indicating that Billys other half-brother Kyle Sampson comatose in a Swiss Clinic since 1987 had indeed died sometime prior to 1994. One other actress who later became famous that was on during this time, was one of the Spauldings maids (originally started out as Jennas), who played comic relief on the show, Ginger (played by Allison Janney—later, C.J. Cregg of The West Wing fame) with one of the other Spaulding maids, Donna.|$|R
