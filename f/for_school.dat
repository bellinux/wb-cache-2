40|$|The {{debate about}} the Australian Government’s funding <b>for</b> <b>schools</b> has been reinvigorated by its school funding review—the first {{comprehensive}} government appraisal of school funding since the early 1970 s. In 2009, the Australian Government restructured its funding <b>for</b> <b>schools,</b> particularly <b>for</b> government <b>schools,</b> {{as a result of}} a new federal financial relations framework established by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) through the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. The Government has also implemented new programs which have resulted in increased funding <b>for</b> <b>schools.</b> Of these initiatives, it is the Building the Education Revolution (BER) economic stimulus programs that have produced the greatest increase in funding. Although the Labor Government has significantly increased funding <b>for</b> <b>schools,</b> the majority of this increased funding (that is, the BER funding) is not ongoing and much of the remainder is the result of automatic increases as the result of indexation. The underlying historic pattern of ongoing government funding <b>for</b> <b>schools</b> remains—the Australian Government provides the majority of its funding to non‐government schools, and state and territory governments provide the majority of their funding to government schools. Overall, the majority of total public expenditure (Australian, state and territory) is allocated to government schools. The purpose of this Background Note is to explain the Australian Government’s funding <b>for</b> <b>schools</b> by answering some commonly asked questions. In doing this, the Background Note provides: a brief history of the Australian Government’s funding <b>for</b> <b>schools,</b> explains the system of Australian Government funding <b>for</b> <b>schools,</b> and examines expenditure trends.

5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing <b>for</b> <b>school</b> districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E
5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave <b>for</b> <b>school</b> in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
