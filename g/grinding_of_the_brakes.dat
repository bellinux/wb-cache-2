High thermomechanical loads at braking lead to substantial local plastification and also induce tensile residual stresses in certain areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc. This contributes to shortening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc by possible initiation and growth <b>of</b> cracks. In <b>the</b> present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of brake disc designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and applied. Brake disc performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model for grey cast iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine. The thermal loading consists of consecutive severe braking cycles at a constant brake power and a constant speed, with cooling between <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cycles. Based on a previous experimental study, three different assumptions are made regarding <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal load at braking. A standard commercial brake disc made from grey cast iron having straight vanes is used as the reference case. Geometrical modifications are introduced in the ventilation arrangement using a design-of-experiments approach, studying both straight cooling vanes and different pillar layouts. A preliminary assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> discs is carried out.

40|$|Abstract: Analyzing {{thermal load}} of {{friction}} pair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc <b>brakes</b> {{was not only}} an indispensable part but also a key theoretical basis for choosing materials of friction pair. In this paper, a brake disc of a mining dump truck with 220 t loads was researched. In accordance with <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> test requirements <b>of</b> ISO 3450 - 1996 standard, the finite element model was built using ANSYS software and then the transient simulation analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature field for <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc was conducted. Finally the temperature distribution and its variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc were analyzed in detail based on the simulation results. Huge total weight of a 220 t mining dump truck with full loaded and few numbers of axles and discs lead to <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc loading greatly and absorbing a large sum of energy on per unit area. At the same time, because of its 390 t full load and its 1 : 2 load ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front axle to the rear axle, the weight undertaken by the rear axle is much heavier than the front bridge.
