In this examination abundance of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> and the price of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> are the two variables of our major interest. We assume that countries with an abundance of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> or relatively low costs of extraction show smaller degrees of efficiency than countries with poor deposits of this resource because the latter nations have a stronger dependency on efficient power plants than the former. Furthermore, higher prices should lead to more efficient electricity generation since production costs increase with growing <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> prices.
