40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Motivational Interviewing (MI) via Co-Active Life Coaching (CALC) {{research}} program in tobacco control {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of this individualized, interactive intervention. This was achieved through a critical appraisal and literature review of the individual dimensions of MI currently used in cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation interventions, as well as MI applied via CALC intervention studies at both the individual- and population-levels. Article 1 provides the critically appraised and systematic review of literature exploring three dimensions of MI (social support, motivation, and tailored interventions) which were implemented independently in cognitive-behavioural cessation interventions. The effectiveness of these dimensions at promoting cessation was assessed and yielded mixed results. The purpose of Article 2 was {{to assess the impact of}} MI-via-CALC on selected cessation outcomes among young adults (19 - 25 years) and found the immediate intervention group, compared to the waitlist group, had a significant reduction in smoking behaviours (number of cigarettes smoked per day and cigarette dependency) and significant increases in personal competency (self-esteem and self-efficacy). Additionally, at 12 -months post-intervention a cessation rate of 31. 4 % was reported and biochemically verified. Lastly, Article 3 assessed the impact of a full-day application-based MI-via-CALC training on the perceived competency of employees of a national smokers’ telephone hotline to facilitate behaviour change among callers. Post- training participants described skill development, increased competency at facilitating behaviour change, and desire for additional training. This research program was comprised of three unique studies. This was the first critical appraisal and literature review to assess cognitive-behavioural cessation interventions through an MI lens. The core components of MI-via-CALC are similar to components already utilized individually in cessation interventions; however, unique to MI-via-CALC is the incorporation of these components into one intervention. Moreover, this was the largest individual MI-via-CALC <b>intervention</b> <b>tobacco</b> study to date and the only one with a control group. Furthermore, the cessation rates observed in this intervention study are beyond those currently observed in other cognitive-behavioural interventions as well as nicotine replacement therapy studies. Lastly, the MI-via-CALC training offered to employees of a national smoker’s hotline was also a first, as the hotline typically does not allow outside researchers within their organization. Overwhelmingly, the training was well received, and the impact was self-reported behaviour change resulting in ameliorated client interactions to promote cessation. Together, the important findings of these ground-breaking studies underscore the need for continued investigation of MI-via-CALC as an intervention for tobacco control...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis focused on how to capture the complexity {{in the implementation of}} a community health promotion programme. The thesis is based on experiences of Stockholm diabetes prevention programme (SDPP), which was implemented in 1995 - 2004 in three municipalities, and include documentation within the programme, annual local governmental reports, local news cuttings, questionnaires and group discussions with the local steering committees members. The material have been analysed by qualitative and quantitative content analysis. In study I, the planning model developed for SDPP was applied to study the programme development. It identified that the programme had been implemented mainly as planned. Physical activity was the risk factor that had become the major focus of <b>intervention.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> consumptions had been added as a fourth risk factor. In study II, the participatory spidergram methodology was applied to assess the extent and development of local intersectoral participation. Wide local intersectoral participation was achieved in planning and implementing activities whereas participation in allocating local resources, leadership and network were more restricted. Communication and shared responsibility appeared critical in influencing the development and perception of participation. In study III, a matrix with WHO s Health For All-targets was developed to identify health promotion activities within the local governments. Each target area was valued in relation to whether intersectoral collaboration and policy or monitoring systems had been established. It was found that almost all the target areas had been addressed, although main focus was given to environmental issues, unemployment, social care and welfare. Health promotion activities were often presented as environmental strategies. The social welfare administration and board for environment and health protection were most frequently involved in health promotion efforts. Policies or monitoring systems were developed within equality, alcohol and drugs, welfare, disability, and environmental and local Agenda 21 plans. In study IV, media monitoring and media analysis was applied to analyse the frequency, characteristics and content of newspaper coverage related to physical activity. Physical activity was reported both as a positive feature in the municipalities and an issue that created debate about priorities and resources. The public, local organisations and the authorities were involved in the debates. Health aspects were used as an argument when discussing the availability of activities, facilities and recreation areas. With the applied study design {{it was not possible to}} evaluate if the programme had had any impact on the health related content in the articles except for articles directly linked to the programme. In conclusion, the applied analytical tools enabled to study the implementation processes and analyse various actors roles or potentials in the implementation. A thorough documentation and monitoring of programme operations was found essential to capture the many activities and actors involved during such a long-term programme. The contributions of the analytical tools are that they have included several dimensions and data sources in the analysis. These methods would probably be more useful in formative evaluations to enable to adjust program operations during the implementation and to seize an important learning opportunity...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco {{use is a}} {{modifiable}} {{risk factor}} for oral disease. Dental professionals are able to reduce the burden of oral and overall health by influencing tobacco use. Results of electronic searches for literature indicated progress in <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> in dentistry.

40|$|Issues addressed: This {{study was}} {{motivated}} by the current need for <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> for inpatients and nursing staff within the hospital setting. In particular, whether inpatients considered quitting while in hospital, if they expected assistance and/or requested help from ward nurses was investigated. In addition, it sought to establish whether nurses considered they {{had a role in}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention</b> and if so, whether they felt adequately prepared. The willingness of nurses to participate in ongoing <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention</b> education and the type of educational program preferences was also explored in relation to current smoking status. Methods: A cohort of 60 patients and 100 nursing personnel were surveyed in the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane. Results: Of 569 inpatients, 19 per cent were current smokers and 39 per cent of ward nurses smoked. Of inpatients, 57 per cent considered quitting tobacco during hospital admission but only 5 per cent requested assistance.

40|$|Abstract Background Though {{screening}} and intervention for {{alcohol and tobacco}} misuse are effective, primary care {{screening and}} intervention rates remain low. Previous studies have increased intervention rates using vital signs screening for tobacco misuse and clinician prompts for screen-positive patients for both alcohol and tobacco misuse. This pilot study's aims were: (1) To determine the feasibility of combined vital signs screening for tobacco and alcohol misuse, (2) To {{assess the impact of}} vital signs screening on alcohol and <b>tobacco</b> screening and <b>intervention</b> rates, and (3) To assess the additional impact of tobacco assessment prompts on intervention rates. Methods In five outpatient practices, nurses measuring vital signs were trained to routinely ask a single tobacco question, a prescreening question that identified current drinkers, and the single alcohol screening question for current drinkers. After 4 - 8 weeks, clinicians were trained in <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention</b> and nurses were trained to give tobacco abusers a tobacco questionnaire which also served as a clinician intervention prompt. Screening and intervention rates were measured using patient exit interviews (n = 622) at baseline, during the "screening only" period, and during the tobacco prompting phase. Changes in screening and intervention rates were compared using chi square analyses and test of linear trends. Clinic staff were interviewed regarding patient and staff acceptability. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of nurse screening on clinician intervention, the impact of alcohol <b>intervention</b> on concurrent <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention,</b> and the impact of <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention</b> on concurrent alcohol intervention.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a qualitative systematic review of social marketing tobacco cessation programs identify {{the extent to}} which seven major components of social marketing are used in social marketing programs targeting tobacco cessation and to classify them according to social marketing stream: downstream midstream or upstream. Sixteen databases were examined to identify studies reporting the use of social marketing to address cigarette smoking cessation. Fourteen empirical studies were classified. Only one of 14 interventions used all seven of the major components of social marketing. The review identified that downstream (n = 11) interventions remain the dominant focus in social marketing <b>interventions</b> targeting <b>tobacco,</b> despite calls for social marketers to move upstream during this time. The current review was restricted to studies that self-identified as social marketing and studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language which is limiting. This study included all empirical studies published from 2002 to January, 2016; however only using published studies may bias results.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Smoking is {{the most}} {{preventable}} cause of death. Although effective, Web-assisted <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> are underutilized and recruitment is challenging. Understanding who participates in Web-assisted <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> may help in improving recruitment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Health care {{providers}} do not routinely carry out brief counseling for tobacco cessation despite {{the evidence for}} its effectiveness. For this intervention to be routinely used, it must be brief, be convenient, require little investment of resources, require little specialized training, and be perceived as efficacious by providers. Technological advances hold much potential for addressing the barriers preventing the integration of brief <b>interventions</b> for <b>tobacco</b> cessation into the health care setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the development and initial evaluation of the Computer-Assisted Brief <b>Intervention</b> for <b>Tobacco</b> (CABIT) program, a web-based, multimedia <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention</b> for use in opportunistic settings. METHODS: The CABIT uses a self-administered, computerized assessment to produce personalized health care provider and patient reports, and cue a stage-matched video intervention. Respondents interested in changing their tobacco use are offered a faxed referral to a 2 ̆ 2 best matched 2 ̆ 2 tobacco treatment provider (ie, dynamic referral). During 2008, the CABIT program was evaluated in an emergency department, an employee assistance program, and a tobacco dependence program in New Jersey. Participants and health {{care providers}} completed semistructured interviews and satisfaction ratings of the assessment, reports, video intervention, and referrals using a 5 -point scale. RESULTS: Mean patient satisfaction scores (n = 67) for all domains ranged from 4. 00 (Good) to 5. 00 (Excellent; Mean = 4. 48). Health care providers completed satisfaction forms for 39 patients.

40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} review of {{interventions}} to reduce the harm resulting from tobacco use among Indigenous Australians and to discuss the likely effect {{of a range of}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> if conducted in this population. Methods: A systematic review of medical literature and an audit of information from 32 government departments, non-government organisations and Indigenous health organisations, which was completed in March 2001. Results: A number of small tobacco programs had been conducted. Only four <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> had been evaluated in Indigenous communities: a trial of training health professionals in conducting a brief intervention for smoking cessation; a trial of a CD-ROM on tobacco for use with Indigenous schoolchildren; a qualitative evaluation of the effect of a mainstream advertising campaign on Indigenous people; and a pilot study of smoke-free workplaces, evaluated by qualitative methods. None of these studies assessed smoking cessation as an outcome. Two of these studies were unable to conclusively show any effect of the interventions; training health professionals in delivering a brief intervention resulted in some changes to practice and the evaluation of the mainstream advertising campaign showed that following the campaign, knowledge about tobacco had increased. Conclusions: There was a major lack of research on and evaluation of <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> for Indigenous Australians. Implications: More research and evaluation is required to ensure that <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> are appropriate and effective for Indigenous people. It is time to cease chronicling the ill health of Indigenous Australians and time to ensure the availability of well-evaluated, effective tobacco programs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Smoking is {{the number}} one {{preventable}} cause of death in the United States. Effective Web-assisted <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> are often underutilized and require new and innovative engagement approaches. Web-based peer-driven chain referrals successfully used outside health care have the potential for increasing the reach of Internet interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to describe the protocol for the development and testing of proactive Web-based chain-referral tools for increasing the access to Decide 2 Quit. org, a Web-assisted <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention</b> system. METHODS: We will build and refine proactive chain-referral tools, including email and Facebook referrals. In addition, we will implement respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a controlled chain-referral sampling technique designed to remove inherent biases in chain referrals and obtain a representative sample. We will begin our chain referrals with an initial recruitment of former and current smokers as seeds (initial participants) who will be trained to refer current smokers from their social network using the developed tools. In turn, these newly referred smokers will also be provided the tools to refer other smokers from their social networks. We will model predictors of referral success using sample weights from the RDS to estimate the success of the system in the targeted population. RESULTS: This protocol describes the evaluation of proactive Web-based chain-referral tools, which can be used in <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> to increase the access to hard-to-reach populations, for promoting smoking cessation.

40|$|PosterPurpose: To assess an {{evidence-based}} {{continuing education}} (CE) program for Indiana healthcare practitioners focusing on tobacco use and dependence which emphasized team-based tobacco dependence treatment. Methods: Program impact {{was assessed by}} changes in participants’ self-reported knowledge and clinical application of course concepts and strategies via a 26 -item immediate post- CE survey and a 19 -item 3 -month follow-up survey. Surveys included multiple-choice and 5 -point Likert-style scaled items. The three month follow-up surveys were mailed / delivered electronically to participants; non-responders were sent two reminders. De-identified data were analyzed in aggregate using descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation coefficients, and Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests. Results: CE programs were held in Tell City, Madison, Lafayette, Goshen, Richmond and Vincennes {{with a total of}} 252 participants. Initial survey response was 98. 4 % (n= 248) : dental assistants (2 %), dental hygienists (83 %), dentists (8. 5 %), and other healthcare professionals (6. 45 %). Overall, participants reported less knowledge before than immediately after (p<. 0001) and 3 months after (p<. 0001) the CE program. Reported knowledge at 3 months was less than immediately after the program (p<. 002). Participants planned to apply CE program communication strategies (99 %), implement brief <b>tobacco</b> <b>intervention</b> strategies (85 %), and refer patients to local cessation resources (95 %) or the Indiana Quitline (96 %). Response rate for the 3 month survey was 54 % (n= 136).

Finally, we consider office system strategies that appear necessary to inte-grate systematic tobacco support into routine care, making progress toward the year 2000 goals of reducing tobacco-use prevalence to 15 percent. The rationale, methods, and outcomes for brief <b>tobacco</b> <b>interventions</b> during routine health an...|$|R
40|$|Having {{friends who}} engage in {{disruptive}} behavior in childhood may be {{a risk factor for}} childhood tobacco experimentation. This study tested the role of friends' disruptive behavior as a mediator of the effects of a classroom based <b>intervention</b> on children's <b>tobacco</b> experimentation. 433 Children (52 % males) were randomly assigned to the Good Behavior Game (GBG) intervention, a universal preventive intervention targeting disruptive behavior, and facilitating positive prosocial peer interactions. Friends' disruptive behavior was assessed from age 7 - 10 years. Participants' experimentation with tobacco was assessed annually from age 10 - 13. Reduced rates in tobacco experimentation and friends' disruptive behavior were found among GBG children, as compared to controls. Support for friends' disruptive behavior as a mediator in the link between <b>intervention</b> status and <b>tobacco</b> experimentation was found. These results remained after controlling for friends' and parental smoking status, and child ADHD symptoms. The results support the role of friends' disruptive behavior in preadolescents' tobacco experimentation. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The causal {{associations}} between cigarette smoking and human diseases are irrefutable. In this review, {{we focus on}} the epidemiological pattern of cigarette smoking on cardiovascular risk, the underlying mechanistic process of such a causal link, how to prevent premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality particularly through smoking cessation, and the health benefits of such cessation measures. Finally, we conclude our review summarizing a few of the proven evidence-based tobacco control strategies and policies from across the globe. We did not conduct a systematic review but followed a similar structure. We abstracted the most relevant published literature on the electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library applying specific search terms. We also searched gray literature and consulted experts in the field for cross-references. Smoking has been estimated to cause about 11 &#x 0025; of all deaths due to cardiovascular disease. Smoking contributes to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and sudden death through a variety of mechanisms, including the promotion of atherosclerosis, the triggering of coronary thrombosis, coronary artery spasm, and cardiac arrhythmias, and through reduced capacity of the blood to deliver oxygen. Smoking cessation also confers substantial benefits on people with serious heart disease. Smoking cessation should be viewed as therapeutic rather than preventive intervention, similar to treating asymptomatic hypertension. Smoking cessation is highly cost-effective relative to other frequently used medical and surgical <b>interventions.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> related illnesses are important public health issues worldwide. It has been estimated that there are 1. 1 billion smokers worldwide and 250 million of them live in India...|$|R

40|$|Background: Tobacco use is {{the leading}} cause of {{preventable}} death in the United States. Purpose: To review the effectiveness and safety of pharmaco-therapy and behavioral <b>interventions</b> for <b>tobacco</b> cessation. Data Sources: 5 databases and 8 organizational Web sites were searched through 1 August 2014 for systematic reviews, and PubMed was searched through 1 March 2015 for trials on elec-tronic nicotine delivery systems. Study Selection: Two reviewers examined 114 articles to iden-tify English-language reviews that reported health, cessation, or adverse outcomes. Data Extraction:One reviewer abstracted data from good- and fair-quality reviews, and a second checked for accuracy. Data Synthesis: Fifty-four reviews were included. Behavioral in-terventions increased smoking cessation at 6 months or mor...|$|R
