The car featured a robust chassis providing above average side impact protection, an unusually short steering column with the steering <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> well back {{from the front of}} the car, and a fuel tank placed in a carefully protected location above the rear axle in order to minimize fire risk in the event of an accident.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{operator}} {{would then}} turn the entire receiver hut using a <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> connected to bicycle pedals, {{looking for the}} point when the signal disappeared, indicating that the target was now perfectly aligned between the two antennas. This null-seeking system was often used as it more sharply indicates locations; maximum signals tend to be spread out. If the target was not aligned, {{the presence of the}} signal could not indicate which direction to turn. To address this, an electrical switching system on the antenna feeds allowed them to be connected together in different phases, and by studying the way the blip changed as the switch was turned, the operator could determine which antenna was closer to the target, a process known as bracketing. The phasing system had been introduced by E.C. Slow, and became known as the Slowcock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Step-type {{compound}} planetary <b>gear</b> <b>sets</b> {{are widely}} applied in vehicle systems. Comprehensive dynamic model of step-type compound planetary <b>gear</b> <b>sets,</b> which includes translational, rotational vibrations and static transmission errors, was established. Natural vibration {{characteristics of the}} system, such as natural frequencies and vibration modes, were analyzed. Belt shape distribution characteristics of its natural frequencies was researched. According to vibration characteristics of both central components and planets, natural vibration modes of the system are classified into three types: central components translational vibration and planets random vibration, central components rotational vibration and planets identical vibration, central components static and adjacent planets reverse vibration mode. Instruction Compound planetary <b>gear</b> <b>sets</b> (CPGS) are widely used in automobile, heavy vehicles and mechanical transmission systems, especially in automatic transmissions, since they could obtained more transmission ratio and high power-weight ratio compared to other planetary <b>gear</b> <b>sets</b> [1 - 2] Compound planetary <b>gear</b> <b>sets</b> have two basic types, that is wide planet-type and step-type, an...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of form grinding, <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> error was the main factor that {{influenced}} the form grinding accuracy; we proposed an effective method to improve form grinding accuracy that corrected the error by controlling the machine operations. Based on establishing the geometry model of form grinding and representing the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> errors as homogeneous coordinate, tooth mathematic model was obtained and simplified under the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> error. Then, according to the gear standard of ISO 1328 - 1 : 1997 and the ANSI/AGMA 2015 - 1 -A 01 : 2002, the relationship was investigated by changing the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> errors with respect to tooth profile deviation, helix deviation, and cumulative pitch deviation, respectively, under the condition of gear eccentricity error, gear inclination error, and gear resultant error. An error compensation method was proposed based on solving sensitivity coefficient matrix of setting error in a five-axis CNC form grinding machine; simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the method can effectively correct the <b>gear</b> <b>setting</b> error, as well as further improving the forming grinding accuracy...|$|R
25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable gear ratios. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 gear ratios. The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest chainring to largest rear sprocket, smallest chainring to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gear ratios. It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct gear ratios, if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|E
500|$|The Volt {{operates}} as a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge.

500|$|The {{problem was}} finding a radar that was {{suitably}} small; CH radar's huge towers obviously {{could not be}} swung about in this fashion.

In 1938, RAF pilots noted they could avoid detection by CH while flying at low altitudes, so in August 1939, Watt ordered 24-CD sets under the name Chain Home Low (CHL), using them to fill gaps in CH coverage.

2500|$|Injustice 2 {{introduces}} a loot-dropping system, {{known as the}} [...] "Gear System", which offers character-specific costume pieces and equipment with status-altering effects. The Gear System uses RPG-like mechanics to reward players with experience and loot after every match. Every playable fighter is given four base stats: strength, defense, health, and ability, the latter of which impacts special attacks. As players collect experience points and subsequently level up, their characters' base stats will increase. Players can enhance their base stats even further by equipping gear obtained through loot drops, which also lets players customize the look of their characters. Rarer gear can include one or more bonus augmentations, which range from new visual effects for special moves to higher yields of in-game currency or experience points. Players can receive additional bonuses by equipping their characters with all five pieces of a single <b>gear</b> <b>set.</b> Gear comes in three varieties: equipment, shaders, and abilities. Besides the random loot earned {{at the end of}} a fight, all three types of gear are available to purchase in loot crates, known as [...] "Mother Boxes", using in-game currency. Each character has five equipment slots for donning new costume pieces, which include their head, torso, arms, legs, and an accessory; two ability slots for equipping new or modified special attacks; and one shader slot for altering their color scheme. The game will also include five separate gear loadouts for each character, allowing players to switch between their setups at the beginning of each match.|$|E
