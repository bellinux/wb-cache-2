40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between language brokering and its effects on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stress of the brokers. Specifically, the relationships between language brokering, parentification, stress, and gender were explored. Gender differences in the strength of this relationship were also examined. The following was expected: <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification would correlate with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress; and that both brokering and parentification were gender specific, with female subjects reporting <b>higher</b> <b>levels.</b> The participants were 90 Latino undergrad students attending universities in the New York City area. The students completed several self-report measures including a parentification questionnaire, a language-brokering questionnaire, and stress scales. ^ Results showed that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> language brokering were positively correlated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification. Although no gender differences were found for <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> language brokering, females reported <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification. Those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering did not report <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress. However, those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress. The {{results of the present study}} emphasized the need for understanding the ramifications and long-term consequences of language brokering, particularly for the Latino community. While brokering itself may not lead to a heightened degree of stress, cultural nuances within the Latino community serve to further perpetuate the pressures associated with brokering. As such, once a pattern of brokering has been established and identified, interventions must be developed to decrease the occurrence of long term impairment of individual and family functioning. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} perceptions of built and social residential characteristics and their association with behaviors such as physical activity (PA), nutrition and smoking and with cardiovascular risk factors (elevated BMI and fasting blood glucose). Among participants of a preventive medical checkup at an Austrian District Health Insurance Fund (n= 904, response rate = 82. 2 %, 42 % women, 18 - 91 years) self-reported and measured data were collected. Total PA was positively associated with the presence of trees along the streets and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pro-physical activity social modeling (SM) and it was negatively related to perceived safety from crime. More leisure-time PA was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cycling/walking infrastructure and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> SM. PA for transportation was positively related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> connectivity and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> SM. Better behavioral cardiovascular risk factor profiles (smoking and nutrition) were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> SM and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> total PA. Lower BMI values were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> SM. Both built and social residential characteristics are important correlates of PA as well as of major cardiovascular risk factors besides PA...|$|R

50|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA {{have been}} linked to <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> some mental health difficulties. For instance, it has been shown that, among {{university}} students, higher FA is associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> schizotypy. Depression scores {{have been found to be}} higher in men, but not women, with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA. One study by Shackelford and Larsen found that men and women with higher facial asymmetry reported more physiological complaints than those with lower facial asymmetry, and that both men and women with higher asymmetry experienced <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> psychological distress overall. For example, men with higher facial asymmetry experienced <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> depression compared to men with lower facial asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry has also been studied in relation to psychopathy. One study looking at offenders and non-offenders found that, although offenders had <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA overall, psychopathic offenders had lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA compared to offenders who did not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Additionally, offenders with the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> psychopathy were found to have similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA to non-offenders.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the relationships among}} professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) {{in the context of}} a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion. Moreover, we hypothesized that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion would lead to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> professional efficacy and that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy would lead to low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion; <b>high</b> control was longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
