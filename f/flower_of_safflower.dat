Evaluated the effect of compounds of natural origin on the cellular immune response in the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was determined by the method based on the intensity of their capture ink particles. We studied the functional activity of peritoneal macrophages by NBT test (spontaneous and stimulated).

On the other hand, it was found that Kharega 1, Kharega 2 and Line 8 were higher in plant height during the 2013 l 2014 season. In this study, mean comparison for the seed yield/plant within all the safflower genotypes and varieties were made using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference Test. The data showed that the varieties (Kharga 1, Kharga 1, Line 11, Line 4 and Giza 1) occupied from the first order up to the fifth order, respectively. Also the differences between all studied genotypes and varieties <b>of</b> <b>safflower</b> were very significant in case of weight seed yield/plant, seed yield/feddan...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Two {{group of}} kids (“Safflower cake ” and “Control”) were fed ad libitum with {{pelleted}} total mixed rations. After a 7 -days adaptation period, the diet of the “Safflower cake ” group were supplemented with 20 % <b>of</b> <b>safflower</b> cake. The kids were slaughtered at 96 days <b>of</b> age. Dietary <b>safflower</b> cake {{did not affect the}} growth traits of kids. In addition, kids fed experimental diet showed a lower feed intake and consequently a better feed conversion ratio in comparison to the “Control ” group. The use <b>of</b> <b>safflower</b> decreased the level of SFA and increased the level of MUFA in kid meat. The level of PUFA was higher in lipid extracted from animals feeding “Control “ diet even if the UFA level was lower. Furthermore, lipid extracted from animals feeding control diet contained more ω 6 fatty acids in comparison to kids feeding experimental diet while the opposite trend was observed for the level of ω 3 fatty acids. The ω 6 to ω 3 ratio was significantly affected by diet and in particular this ratio decreased in meat of kids fed experimental diet. Our results indicate that intramuscular fatty acid composition of kid meat can be improved from a human health perspective by inclusion <b>of</b> <b>safflower</b> cake in the diet.
