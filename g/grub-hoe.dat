60|$|Deering lighted {{the lantern}} {{and after a}} few minutes {{strapped}} a bag of food on his back. He pushed his folded blanket through the straps, gave Peter the rope, and picked up the <b>grub-hoe,</b> a Canadian digging tool very like a mountaineer's ice-ax. Then they put out the light, let the horse go, and went back quietly to the railroad. Nobody was about, and stealing across the line, they plunged into the gloom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why don't you get out, {{instead of}} {{worrying}} people?" [...] he asked. [...] "Anyway, it's {{only one of}} the little luxuries that Saunders and I are quite accustomed to. I've been eaten by mosquitoes, sandflies, and other insects of various kinds. You've 'most smashed my ankle, besides sticking a <b>grub-hoe</b> into me, and Saunders must work out a big stone just when I was under it. We've been living most of two months on his rancid pork and grindstone bread, and now you make a circus about a little smoke!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment for breath, and the keen sparkle in his dark eyes grew plainer. [...] "Well, we're going to provide it, and {{do what we can}} for the men with the axe and the <b>grub-hoe.</b> Some day this great Province will {{remember}} what it owes them. Here it's man against nature, and the fight is hard, while we'll do more than put money in our pockets if we make it a little easier. We want a fair deal--and we'll get it somehow--but we want no more; and if we can hold on long enough, it won't be only those who sent her out who will say, 'Speed the Shasta!'" ...|$|E
60|$|He went {{round the}} wheat and oats, and then spent several days ripping odd strips {{here and there}} across the prairie in the track of the {{prevalent}} winds. It was fiercely hot weather, but he was busy every hour from dawn to dusk, and at nights his men grinned as they mentioned it. Charley Leland was getting very afraid of fire, they said. When he was satisfied with the ploughing, he had the axes and <b>grub-hoes</b> ground, and set the men to work cutting out the smaller growth of willows of underbrush in the strip of birches that stretched close up to the homestead from the bluff. When Gallwey, who had other duties, found him busy at it the first morning, he smiled a little.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the neck}} they stopped and Deering frowned. He had been longer than he thought and a pale {{illumination}} behind a peak indicated that the sun was low. In the valley below, he saw a frozen lake and a dark, winding band he knew was timber on a river bank. He had food, and if he could reach the trees he need not bother about the frost. A Canadian <b>grub-hoe,</b> made for cutting roots, is a useful tool, and he could build a wall of bark and branches, light a fire and brew hot tea. The trouble was, {{to get down to the}} friendly pines.|$|E
60|$|Reaching the ranch, Geoffrey possessed {{himself of}} a <b>grub-hoe,</b> {{which is a}} pick with an adz-shaped blade with an ax and shovel; also he {{returned}} with the girls to the boulder. For {{an hour or two}} he toiled hard, grubbing out hundredweights of soil and gravel from round about the rock. Then cutting a young fir he inserted the butt of it as a lever, and spent another thirty minutes focusing his full strength on the opposite end. The rock, however, refused to move an inch, and, because a few crackers are not much for a hungry man to work on after an all-night march, Thurston became conscious that he had a headache and a distressful stitch in his side. Still, being obstinate and filled with an unreasoning desire to prove his trustworthiness to his fair employer, he continued doggedly, and after another hour's digging found the stone still immovable. Then it happened that while, with the perspiration dripping from him, he tugged at the lever, the rancher who had rebuffed him that morning, drew rein close beside.|$|E
60|$|Barbison's protests {{were not}} listened to, and, seeing no help for it, he also flung off his jacket, {{when the big}} rancher firmly led him down the stairway. Then {{they gave him a}} shovel, and his two companions saw that he used it while they plied the <b>grub-hoe.</b> There are, however, {{probably}} very few men reared in the city who could work with the tireless axemen of the Pacific Slope, and in ten minutes Barbison was visibly distressed. The perspiration dripped from his flushed face, and he gasped for breath, while his comrades inquired with ironical solicitude whether he were getting sleepy. When he had excavated enough to satisfy them, they made him crawl into the hole and claw out soil from among the roots with shortened shovel, most of the contents of which fell all over him. They kept him at it mercilessly for over half an hour, and when he crept out his hands were raw and he was aching in every limb. Even then there was no respite, for the rest insisted on his participating in their labors at the lever, and contrived to allow him to do considerably more than his share. At last, however, the great stump rose and tilted, and he was escorted back to the hotel amidst acclamation.|$|E
