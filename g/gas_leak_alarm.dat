40|$|Abstract—GasNet is {{a sensor}} network for real-timely moni-toring the gas leak in {{residential}} buildings, {{in order to}} efficiently protect the buildings from gas leak explosion. GasNet provides low-latency and reliable <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> <b>ALARM</b> message delivery in complicated RF environments. It does so through ROAP, a novel opportunistic forwarding mechanism considering link correlation. ROAP leverages a hop tree in opportunistic forwarder list selection to ensure the shortest hops to the sink. Furthermore, link correlation is used to obtain more accurate forwarding probability and to achieve fast retransmission. We implement the prototype of GasNet in campus testbed and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments. The experiment results show that ROAP achieves 100 % <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> <b>ALARM</b> message delivery in low latency. I...|$|E

50|$|The Aliso Canyon <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> (also called Porter Ranch <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> and Porter Ranch gas blowout) was {{a massive}} natural <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> that was {{discovered}} by SoCalGas employees on October 23, 2015. Gas was escaping from a well within the Aliso Canyon's underground storage facility in the Santa Susana Mountains near Porter Ranch, Los Angeles. This second-largest gas storage facility {{of its kind in}} the United States belongs to the Southern California Gas Company, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. On January 6, 2016, Governor Jerry Brown issued a state of emergency. The Aliso <b>gas</b> <b>leak's</b> carbon footprint is said to be larger than the Deepwater Horizon leak in the Gulf of Mexico. On February 11, 2016, the gas company reported that it had the leak under control. On February 18, 2016, state officials announced that the leak was permanently plugged.|$|R

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} considerations of <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> behaviour and leak detector design and use, {{with a view}} to improving the detection of low-pressure natural <b>gas</b> <b>leaks.</b> An atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel has been used to study ground–based releases of methane at full scale over distances of up to 3 m, under controlled conditions. These scales are relevant to the detection of natural <b>gas</b> <b>leaks</b> from mains and services using hand-portable gas detectors. The mean spatial distribution of the <b>leaking</b> <b>gas</b> plume was determined and used to test and fit a Gaussian dispersion model. This was used for subsequent analysis with respect to the ability of <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> detectors to confirm and locate a leak. For ground-based <b>leaks,</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations drop rapidly with height such that instruments should ideally sample the air from within 10 cm of ground level. The rapid dilution of gas with distance from the source means that instruments with lower limits of detection, ideally of a few parts per million, have much improved ability to detect a leak from greater distances downwind. Finally, observations showed the variable temporal nature of the gas and the potential for confusion when sampling gas at a single point in time and space.

50|$|Ultrasonic gas {{detectors}} use acoustic {{sensors to}} detect {{changes in the}} background noise of its environment. Since most high-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>leaks</b> generate sound in the ultrasonic range of 25 kHz to 10 MHz, the sensors are able to easily distinguish these frequencies from background acoustic noise which occurs in the audible range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The ultrasonic <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> detector then produces an alarm {{when there is an}} ultrasonic deviation from the normal condition of background noise. Ultrasonic <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> detectors cannot measure gas concentration, but the device is able to determine the leak rate of an escaping gas because the ultrasonic sound level depends on the gas pressure and size of the leak.|$|R
