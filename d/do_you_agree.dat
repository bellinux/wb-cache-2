500|$|MK Dons {{initially}} {{maintained that}} any debate was pointless as their club {{was simply a}} renamed Wimbledon F.C.. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004: [...] "MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon", he wrote. One reader asked: [...] "Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> that AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and [...] "left their team before their team left them". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had [...] "abdicated their right to it when they all walked away." [...] "The fans who have continued to support us from London—they're the ones who've {{had to put up}} with this shit for so long," [...] he concluded.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, I do {{want to talk to}} you about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Today, a senior member of Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, {{targeted}} assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing at a time when the United States seems absent in the peace-making process. What would your administration do? First of all, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why {{should one}} say what {{one does not}} think," [...] Mary said, sturdily, [...] "it {{would be much better}} if we all <b>did</b> so. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> with me, Mr. Hartington?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not--I ask why not? Some {{women have}} broken through prejudice, {{and why should}} not others? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>agree</b> with me, Fanny, that female medical men--I mean medical women--would be an {{infinite}} boon?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "As for seconds? Perish the thought. One second only, I entreat, {{and that}} one a lady--the most adorable--the most detestable--the most true--the most fickle amidst all her charming sex.... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree,</b> sir?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{take that}} as {{confirming}} me, Lady Lundie. Thank you. Now, as to the method of carrying out our friend's advice. The method seems plain.

6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} would be handy for you if we fixed it at the George, at Crawley.
