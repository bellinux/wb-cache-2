A critical size of the mother bubble determines the variation trend of the splitting ratio of bubble size with flow rates of both phases and the liquid viscosity, which is related to the different breakup mechanisms for long and short bubbles at the junction and the different additional resistances induced by long and short bubbles in <b>downstream</b> <b>channels.</b> A theoretical model is proposed to predict the tailoring size of bubbles at the T-junction by taking into account of the additional resistance in the presence of bubbles in <b>downstream</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R

50|$|Submerged Flow - {{when the}} water surface {{downstream}} of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, the flume is deemed to be submerged. Lacking the extended throat and discharge sections of the Parshall flume, the Montana flume has little resistance {{to the effects of}} submergence and as such it should be avoided. Where submerged flow is or may become present, there are several methods of correcting the situation: the flume may be raised above the channel floor, the <b>downstream</b> <b>channel</b> may be modified, or a different flume type may be used (typically a Parshall flume). Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions. In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the <b>downstream</b> <b>channel</b> banks, sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.|$|E

The proposed architecture supports dynamic setup of virtual circuits for inter-base station communication, over a dedicated λLAN channel.

40|$|A {{systematic}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) approach {{has been applied to}} design the geometry of the channels of a three-dimensional (thick-walled) screen comprising upstream and downstream sets of elongated channels positioned at an angle of 90 ° with respect to each other. Such a geometry of the thick-wall screen can effectively drop the ratio of the maximum flow velocity to mean flow velocity below 1. 005 in a downstream microstructured reactor at low Reynolds numbers. In this approach the problem of flow equalization reduces to that of flow equalization in the first and second <b>downstream</b> <b>channels</b> of the thick-walled screen. In turn, this requires flow equalization in the corresponding cross-sections of the upstream channels. The validity of the proposed design method was assessed through a case study. The effect of different design parameters on the flow non-uniformity in the <b>downstream</b> <b>channels</b> has been established. The design equation is proposed to calculate the optimum values of the screen parameters. The CFD results on flow distribution were experimentally validated by Laser Doppler Anemometry measurements in the range of Reynolds numbers from 6 to 113. The measured flow non-uniformity in the separate reactor channels was below 2 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Extraction {{of methane}} (natural gas) from coal {{deposits}} is facilitated by pumping of aquifer water. Coalbed methane (CBM) product water, produced from pumping groundwater, is discharged into associated unlined holding ponds or <b>downstream</b> <b>channels.</b> The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the chemistry of CBM discharge water reacting with an ephemeral stream channel sediment in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Water samples were collected bimonthly from three CBM discharge points and seven channel locations in Burger Draw and Sue draw, and Powder River, WY. Before sample collection, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured in the field. Samples were transported to the laboratory and analyzed for alkalinity, major cations and anions, and trace elements. Results suggest that pH of CBM discharge water ranged between 7 and 7. 1 and EC ranged between 4. 25 and 4. 35 dS/m. CBM discharge water within the Burger Draw watershed contains high sodium (Na) and alkalinity. The pH of CBM discharge water increased in <b>downstream</b> <b>channels</b> of Burger Draw and Sue Draw. However, pH of the channel sediment water interface (2 cm) was decreased. In addition...|$|R
