However, the Peyote ingredient makes anyone who drinks the juice hallucinate. Chief Wiggum catches on and soon the police surround the farm. Homer defends Seth, Munchie and the hippie honor by reminding the police of the morals taught by the 1960s, planting a <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> each of the officer's guns. However, Wiggum discharges his, lodging its <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> Homer's forehead and leaving him hospitalized.|$|E

5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it {{may be reluctant to}} <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{congregation}} had increased {{in size to}} approximately 300 families, and had outgrown its original facilities. The congregation moved to a more suburban location at Eleventh and <b>Flower</b> <b>in</b> 1949, and formalized {{its relationship with the}} Reform movement by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism). The Central Avenue and Culver Street building was sold to the Southern Baptist Convention, and housed the First Chinese Baptist Church until 1981, and then the Iglesia Bautista Central. By 2001 it was on the market again, and the Jewish community raised $540,000 (today $) to purchase it in 2002. The building is listed on both the city’s historic property register and the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E
5|$|Honeyeaters such as {{the eastern}} spinebill are {{attracted}} to the flowers. As the bird gathers the nectar, the pollen, which has fins, attaches itself to the feathers on {{the heads of the}} birds and is carried to other flowers, aiding cross pollination. A study in forests near Hobart in Tasmania found that the eastern spinebill arrived in the area {{at the same time the}} common heath was in <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> March, and left once flowering had finished. Other honeyeaters, {{such as the}} strong-billed, crescent and yellow-throated honeyeaters, fed occasionally at common heath flowers. Field work in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia recorded the white-plumed and New Holland honeyeaters, as well as the crescent honeyeater and the eastern spinebill.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E
5|$|Rouffaer {{reported}} that the gringsing pattern was already known by the 12th century in Kediri, East Java. He concluded that this delicate pattern could be created only by using the canting, an etching tool that holds a small reservoir of hot wax, and proposed that the canting was invented in Java around that time. The carving details of clothes worn by East Javanese Prajnaparamita statues from around the 13th century show intricate floral patterns within rounded margins, similar to today's traditional Javanese jlamprang or ceplok batik motif. The motif is thought to represent the lotus, a sacred <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> Hindu-Buddhist beliefs. This evidence suggests that intricate batik fabric patterns applied with the canting existed in 13th-century Java or even earlier.|$|E

Pandharpur's Vithoba holds a shankha (conch) {{in his left hand}} and a chakra (discus) or lotus <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> his right, all of which are symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu. Some images depict Vithoba's right hand making a gesture that has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image.

5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> order to remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts {{a secret from}} the rest of the kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E
