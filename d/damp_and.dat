40|$|Human {{presence}} {{can change}} the dynamic characteristics of human-structure interaction systems, i. e. particularly their <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> frequency. In many design codes, the pedestrian {{is regarded as a}} moving force (MF) while a more complete model, referred to as moving spring-mass-damper (MSMD) has received attention recently. Unlike the MF model, the MSMD model is able {{to take into account the}} human <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness effects. This paper is devoted to determining the instantaneous <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> frequency of the human-structure interaction (HSI) system subjected to a single and multiple pedestrians. Each pedestrian is modelled as a MSMD, and a methodology for determining the system <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> frequency properties is described. A simply supported beam structure is considered and modelled in modal space. The imparted pedestrian vertical force is modelled adopting the first four harmonics of Fourier representation using Young’s dynamic load factors. It is concluded that human presence can significantly increase <b>and</b> decrease <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> frequency of the structure, respectively and it is so important to consider human effect on the system’s <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> frequency in serviceability assessment of footbridges...|$|R

40|$|A {{prototype}} variable fluid <b>damper</b> <b>and</b> stiffness {{device is}} evaluated in this study. This damper {{is capable of}} providing continuous variation with different levels of system <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness. The <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness can be varied independent of each other or simultaneously. The following research is focussed on {{the evaluation of the}} effectiveness of such a device, and on determining the effectiveness of incorporation of such a device into a framed structure. The damper properties are determined under cyclic and ramp loadings, and the results are presented. Further experimental research is performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the afore mentioned device in a proposed Scissor-Jack energy dissipation system. This system is incorporated into a typical steel frame; whereupon the variable <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness system's effectiveness is enhanced by a factor of four. By means of test results of the damper it is shown that the damper is capable of producing continuously <b>and</b> independently variable <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness. It is shown that a similar variation in frame structure <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness can be achieved by using the damper in a Scissor-Jack system. The presented device can be an effective means for response reduction of structures under earthquake and/or wind excitation...|$|R

In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down.

5|$|King George Vs active naval {{career was}} {{terminated}} by the Royal Navy in June 1950, {{when she and}} her sister-ships went into reserve and were mothballed. King George V was the first large warship to be preserved in this fashion. This involved sealing the armament, machinery and boilers against <b>damp</b> <b>and</b> installing dehumidifiers throughout. In December 1955, she was downgraded to extended reserve and in 1957 the decision was taken to scrap the four ships. The following year King George V was moved from her berth in Gareloch to the ship breaking firm of Arnott Young and Co. in Dalmuir to undergo dismantling.|$|E

The location, on the corner of Market and Illinois Streets in Indianapolis, proved to be <b>damp</b> <b>and</b> unhealthy because of the wetland conditions of the area during that time. Governor James Whitcomb blamed the conditions for his wife's death. The home was abandoned in 1861 during the term of Oliver Morton, who briefly lived in the house but refused to stay.

40|$|We {{consider}} the zero viscosity limit of long time averages of solutions of <b>damped</b> <b>and</b> driven Navier-Stokes equations in R 2.

40|$|International audienceRandom {{uncertainties}} in {{finite element}} models in linear structural dynamics are usually modeled by using parametric models. This means that: (1) the uncertain local parameters occurring in the global mass, <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness matrices of the finite element model have to he identified; (2) appropriate probabilistic models of these uncertain parameters have to be constructed; and (3) functions mapping the domains of uncertain parameters into the global mass, <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness matrices have to be constructed. In the low-frequency range, a reduced matrix model can then be constructed using the generalized coordinates associated with the structural modes corresponding to the lowest eigenfrequencies. In this paper we propose an approach for constructing a random uncertainties model of the generalized mass, <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model does not require identifying the uncertain local parameters and consequently, obviates construction of functions that map the domains of uncertain local parameters into the generalized mass, <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness matrices. This nonparametric model of random uncertainties is based on direct construction of a probabilistic model of the generalized mass, <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness matrices, which uses only the available information constituted of the mean value of the generalized mass, <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness matrices. This paper describes the explicit construction {{of the theory of}} such a nonparametric model...|$|R

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the rotordynamic system of equations are the off-diagonal terms of stiffness, <b>damping,</b> <b>and</b> mass. These terms are called cross-coupled stiffness, cross-coupled <b>damping,</b> <b>and</b> cross-coupled mass. When {{there is a positive}} cross-coupled stiffness, a deflection will cause a reaction force opposite the direction of deflection to react the load, and also a reaction force in the direction of positive whirl. If this force is large enough compared with the available direct <b>damping</b> <b>and</b> stiffness, the rotor will be unstable. When a rotor is unstable it will typically require immediate shutdown of the machine to avoid catastrophic failure.|$|R
