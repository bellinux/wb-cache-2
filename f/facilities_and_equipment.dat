5|$|Meanwhile, the Citizen Forces {{deteriorated}} {{during the}} war as the AIF was given precedence for manpower and other resources. While {{the size of the}} force increased during 1915, a high proportion volunteered for overseas service with the AIF. Many officers were used to train AIF recruits, and camp <b>facilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> were also assigned to the expeditionary force. This greatly disrupted the Citizen Forces training activities, with few units conducting camps during late 1915 or 1916. While there were intakes of conscripts to the Citizen Forces during 1916 and 1917, few were ever required to undertake periods of training or active service. In October 1916 approximately 37,000 reservists were called up {{for a short period of}} compulsory training ahead of the first plebiscite on conscription. By 1918 the Citizen Forces were close to collapse as many of its best members had transferred to the AIF and the remaining personnel were largely untrained. Attempts were made to revive the Citizen Forces during the last months of the war. The initially successful German Spring Offensive, which began in March, led to concerns Japan could attack Australia. In response, regular training camps for militia units were reinstated. A scheme to set up a reserve force manned by returned AIF veterans attracted 17,000 volunteers, yet they received no training.|$|E

25|$|During {{his second}} term, {{economic}} depression, low wages in industry and unemployment, following the industrial {{boom of the}} early 1870s, resulted in national labor unrest and strikes culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. Serious civil disturbances included riots associated with the railroad and general strikes of 1877 in several industrial cities: including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Reading and Scranton. There were other incidents with the Molly Maguires in the anthracite coal regions. Hartranft called out the state militia and then Regular Army troops to maintain order. In Philadelphia, Reading, and Pittsburgh, fires were set and extensive railroad <b>facilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> burned, especially in Pittsburgh. Eleven people died along the Schuylkill River before Federal troops restored the peace. Hartranft later proposed recognition of labor unions and arbitration of claims.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor was}} the Chinese Civil War. After the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese capitalists bought {{huge numbers of}} {{machines}} and facilities to restore their pre-war production. As the Civil War broke out, many capitalists moved those facilities to Hong Kong warehouses to continue production. Furthermore, industrialists from Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou relocated to Hong Kong because of the Chinese Civil War. They brought skilled labour, technology and capital to the city. Many Mainlanders also fled to Hong Kong, contributing to the city's labour supply. Altogether, some US$100,000,000 were brought to Hong Kong because of the war. After the war, the <b>facilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> stayed in Hong Kong, causing the rise of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry. From 1946 to 1948, the number of factories increased by 1211 and 81,700 workers employed in the manufacturing sector.|$|E

After World War II, the college developed a reputation for internationalism under the presidency of Charles Turck (later the namesake of Turck Hall), who recruited overseas and created a more diverse student body.

25|$|The {{expansion}} of rapid transit was greatly {{facilitated by the}} signing of the Dual Contracts on March 19, 1913. Contract 3 was signed between the IRT and the City; the contract between the BRT and the City was Contract 4. The majority of the present-day subway system was either built or improved under these contracts, which not only built new lines but added tracks and connections to existing lines of both companies. The Astoria Line and Flushing Lines were built at this time, and were for some time operated by both companies. Under the terms of Contracts 3 and 4, the city would build new subway and elevated lines, rehabilitate and expand certain existing elevated lines, and lease them to the private companies for operation. The cost would be borne more-or-less equally by the City and the companies. The City's contribution was in cash raised by bond offerings, while the companies' contributions were variously by supplying cash, <b>facilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to run the lines.|$|E

Rumors began circulating in May 1935 that Cohen's company, along with Batchellor's, were to merge with Republic Pictures. Cohen denied those rumors. In December 1936, it was reported that Cohen was seeking to sell Invincible and begin producing for one of the major studios. Less than two weeks later, Cohen had signed agreements with Samuel J. Briskin to leave Invincible and had signed on with RKO to produce, which led to Invincible being disbanded. The remnants of Invincible were {{one of a number of}} Poverty Row studios taken over by Herbert Yates in 1936 and merged into his newly formed Republic Pictures in an attempt to create a dominant low-budget producer with enough power to take on the major studios. His first film at his new studio was 1937's Living on Love (originally titled Love in a Basement), directed by Lew Landers.

500|$|The TD absorbed its subsidiary, the Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad (TC), in March 1882, {{and took}} its name as more {{descriptive}} {{of the growing}} system, which hoped {{to become part of}} a nationwide narrow gauge network stretching southwest to Mexico City. One year later, in May 1883, the Cincinnati Northern and the SGA were consolidated into the TC However, the TC was constructed cheaply, with poor drainage and little ballast. While the Cincinnati Northern had been built to better standards, the connecting line between Lebanon Junction and Dodds was just as bad. The inadequate <b>facilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as difficulties in interchanging equipment with [...] lines, contributed to its entering receivership in August 1883. [...] The TC had six divisions at this time. [...] Four of the five TC divisions south of Delphos were sold to their bondholders at auction in June 1884, and separate companies were soon organized for three of those: the Dayton and Toledo Railroad, Dayton and Ironton Railroad, and Iron Railway (named Iron Railroad prior to TC receivership). [...] The Toledo-St. Louis line was sold in December 1885 and reorganized as the Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad, commonly known as the Clover Leaf Route. [...] In July, George Hafer of Avondale replaced William J. Craig of Toledo as receiver of the Cincinnati Northern Division, allowing it to recover from Craig's deferred maintenance. Hafer obtained a short-term lease from the trustees of the Dodds-Lebanon Junction line (officially the Cincinnati Division), allowing continued access to Dayton. Finally, on June 27, 1885, the Cincinnati Northern Division was sold for $200,000 to its bondholders, who incorporated the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, with Hafer as president, on July 14 and transferred operations on August 1, 1885. The narrow gauge movement of the 1870s had failed, and all of the ex-TC lines were converted to standard gauge within the next ten years.|$|E
