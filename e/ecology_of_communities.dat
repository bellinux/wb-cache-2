40|$|Abstract This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} {{processes}} that structure desmid communities. Phylogenetic structure of communities helps to reveal those processes. Phylogenetic structures links <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> and evolutionary history of species in those communities. Totally I analysed 89 desmid communities. Most {{of them were}} phylogenetically structured, which agrees with the hypothesis that communities are structured by classical niche-related processes, such as competition and environmental filtering. Usage of environmental information showed the influence of pH on the community structure. Low pH acts as a strong environmental filter. Under the influence of this filter communities are composed of closely relates species. In the absence of this filter communities are structured by competition. Localities with higher pH host communities of distantly related species - phylogenetically overdispersed. There was found no influence of conductivity and geographical distance on phylogenetic structure of desmids communities. Key words: phylogenetic structure, desmids, Desmidiales, environmental filtering, p...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{phylogeny}} and <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> along environmental gradients helps to disentangle {{the role of}} competition-driven processes and environmental filtering for community assembly. In this study, we evaluated patterns in species richness, phylogenetic structure and life-history traits of bee communities along altitudinal gradients in the Alps, Germany. We found a linear decline in species richness and abundance but increasing phylogenetic clustering in communities with increasing altitude. The proportion of social- and ground-nesting species, as well as mean body size and altitudinal range of bee communities, increased with increasing altitude, whereas the mean geographical distribution decreased. Our results suggest that community assembly at high altitudes is dominated by environmental filtering effects, whereas {{the relative importance of}} competition increases at low altitudes. We conclude that inherent phylogenetic and ecological species attributes at high altitudes pose a threat for less competitive alpine specialists with ongoing climate change...|$|E

Four variants were distinguished: typicum, Viscaria vulgaris, Astragalus danicus and Carex flacca. Ellenberg ind&igrave;cator values were calculated to study the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities.</b> Floristic differences among variants are associated mainly with soil reaction (Ellenberg indicator values for soil pH range from 6. 0 to 7. 6), but conditions of moisture and fertility are similar among the variants. The {{calcareous grassland}} vegetation in Latvia represents transition vegetation between the c 1 asses Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Festuco-Brometea. However, ecologically and floristically, these communities are closer to the class Festuco-Brometea and could be assigned to the order Brometalia. For designation to alliance and associations, more data is required. The results are compared with similar communities in other European countries...|$|E

40|$|A smooth {{transition}} towards sustainability {{calls for a}} profound change in agriculture and its relationships with cities: {{there will be no}} sustainable agriculture and no sustainable cities without a redefinition of their mutual interactions; that is, without a new <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> and places. This new territorial ecology is already appearing at the interfaces between cities and countryside, driven by a wave of social innovation. This is generating unprecedented food communities – producers and consumers defined by a place of origin and reflecting a new idea of ‘local economy’ based on food, agriculture, tradition and culture – where multifunctional farming, de-mediated food chains and urban activism merge. A project about Milano, the Feeding Milano Project {{is a good example of}} this emerging trend. It shows what a mix of bottom-up initiatives as well as design-led initiatives can do. This example, with other similar ones around the world, represents an innovative design process (planning by projects or also ‘acupuncture’ planning) capable of promoting and sustaining a new territorial ecology...|$|E

PESTOLIVE aims at producing knowledge and tools for a new and efficient management ofplant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) and plant-pathogenic fungi (PPF) in olive (Olea europaea L.) cropping systems and nurseries, while reducing the use of pesticides. Because of the anthropiccontinuum from Olea post-glacial refuges to Oleasters (domestication) and then to olive-trees(breeding and cropping), the fragmentation of the PPN and PPF communities and of theirnatural enemies could explain the scattered diversity of the control techniques (especiallyresistance rootstocks, biocontrol, cropping strategies) developed and applied all around theMediterranean Basin. The novelty of PESTOLIVE is based on: i) the analysis and themanagement of the parasite diversity (<b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities)</b> instead of controllingemblematic species (population approach), and ii) the involvement of knowledge about thehistorical co-adaptation of soil-borne parasite and natural enemies communities to olive-treedomestication (origins and past assemblages) and breeding that follows the history of O. europaea around the Mediterranean Basin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWood {{falls on}} the ocean floor form chemosynthetic {{ecosystems}} that remain poorly studied compared with features such as hydrothermal vents or whale falls. In particular, the microbes forming the base of this unique ecosystem are not well characterized and the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> is not known. Here we use wood as a model to study microorganisms that establish and maintain a chemosynthetic ecosystem. We conducted both aquaria and in situ deep-sea experiments to test how different environmental constraints structure the assembly of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities. We also measured changes in wood lipid concentrations and monitored sulfide production as a way to detect potential microbial activity. We show that wood falls are dynamic ecosystems with high spatial and temporal community turnover, and that the patterns of microbial colonization change depending on the scale of observation. The most illustrative example was the difference observed between pine and oak wood community dynamics. In pine, communities changed spatially, with strong differences in community composition between wood microhabitats, whereas in oak, communities changed more significantly with time of incubation. Changes in community assembly were reflected by changes in phylogenetic diversity that could be interpreted as shifts between assemblies ruled by species sorting to assemblies structured by competitive exclusion. These ecological interactions followed the dynamics of the potential microbial metabolisms accompanying wood degradation in the sea. Our work showed that wood is a good model for creating and manipulating chemosynthetic ecosystems in the laboratory, and attracting not only typical chemosynthetic microbes but also emblematic macrofaunal species...|$|E

40|$|Peter Calthorpe codified {{the concept}} of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) in the late 1980 ’s and, while others had {{promoted}} similar concepts {{and contributed to the}} design, TOD became a fixture of modern planning when Calthorpe published “The New American Metropolis” in 1993. TOD has been defined generally as “a mixed-use community that encourages people to live near transit services and to decrease their dependence on driving. ” Calthorpe saw it as a neo-traditional guide to sustainable community design. Beyond its definition of built form, it was also a community design theory that promised to address a myriad of social issues. Calthorpe, a student of the environmental sustainability movement, developed TOD to address the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities.</b> He also saw TOD as an easily comprehensible solution for regional growth. It also met the need of transit agencies for alternative revenue sources. And it was a natural evolutionary next-step from many familiar community design precedents. In its most bold promise, TOD was to help “redefine the American Dream. ” As later TOD analysts explained, “These Transit-oriented developments have the potential to provide residents with improved quality of life and reduced household transportation expense while providing the region with stable mixed-income neighborhoods that reduce environmental impacts and provide real alternatives to traffic congestion. ” This paper looks at the development of the TOD vision from multiple perspectives. First, the paper looks at a long history of transit served real estate development. Second, it evaluates TOD’s position in a long history of social and urban theory. Lastly, it tracks Calthorpe’s TOD concept through his lifetime of work up to the publication of “The New American Metropolis. ” This paper is meant to serve as a foundation for further work that will seek to define the term TOD in its many uses across the fields of planning, design, transportation, and policy...|$|E
40|$|The logical {{conclusion}} of the short analysis of criteria on natural resource planning and management in situ and ex situ (scale, number, intraspecific variability, <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities,</b> policy, economy, organisation of research, recreation), referring to active biological protection of trees, is as follows: biological resources of trees in situ and ex situ should be large, diverse and geographically and ecologically distributed throughout the country. Their number and scale depend on our potentials. At {{the beginning of the}} new century, we have to create an active (functional) strategy of the protection of tree biology, especially endemic and relic species. Accordingly, the biologists interested in tree resource protection should already exercise their influence in solving these issues (organisation of active protection, more or less directed reproduction, of economically significant species, etc). The biological protection of trees has an intensive development in the developed countries of the world, while the developing countries are trying to follow the trend, depending on their material sources, culture and attitude of their state government Biological protection of trees is an open, new, and very wide area of further research in already set aside natural resources in situ and ex situ. This is a new field of research, without a long tradition. Along with the scientific value of this approach of the systematic and systemic solution of more or less directed tree reproduction, we also need an economic stimulation. The scope and the complexity of this field of research requires further scientific work of a greater number of teams, some of which should be supported by forestry profession and the society in general The introduction of the model of tree recombination system enables a completely new approach to quality control of the successive generations of trees. This means that all current and planned measures in the model must be clearly scientifically defined, integrally (ecosystem) understood and, most importantly, efficiently realized. Also, their definition and realisation must be synchronised and continual both in case of short-term and long-term measures, which are interdependent and inter-conditioned...|$|E
40|$|We {{revealed}} the functional {{groups of the}} animals of sod pinewood soils (arena of the river Dnepr in the "Dneprovsko-Orelsky" Nature Reserve) {{on the basis of}} cluster analysis of the RLQ-axes received as result of interaction of matrix of community, matrix of edaphic parameters and matrix of ecomorphs of soil animals. The quantitative account of soil mesofauna has allowed us to establish that the community of animals inhabiting sod pinewood soils is represented by 20 species at a density of 68. 9 ± 14. 6 ind. /m 2, 8 forms were identified at the level of genus, family or order. Two species were represented by their larval and imago phases (Anatolica eremita (Steven, 1829) and Calathus ambiguus (Paykull, 1790)). A count of animals conducted in an alternative way has allowed us to expand the list to 38 species or forms at species level. The level of abundance and diversity for sod pinewood soils on the arena is not high compared with other types of soils of the arena of the river Dnepr. This result shows that the community has a simplified ecological structure. The prevailing ecological structure of the community can be characterised as steppe, xerophilous, oligotrophocoenomorphic. Anecic animals are absent from the topomorphic structure and saprophagous animals absent from the trophic structure. Only additional collection by alternative methods has allowed us to establish the presence in the community of saprophagous and anecic animals. The latter ecological group is represented by the extremely mobile vertebrate species Pelobates fuscus. The foromorphic structure of the community differs by its great variety. In this structure various strategies of animals’ movement through the soil are proportionately represented. On the one hand, we see various ways of movement of herpetobiont animals, mainly insect imagoes, which as a whole differ in their considerable migratory potential. This circumstance staticizes the historical reasons for the formation of the studied community. On the other hand, in the community there are various strategies of movement in the soil that allow us to assume or determine the reasons or causes of structurization of an ecological niche. Environmental factors are described by two groups of indicators, edaphic properties and values of phytoindicator scales. The mesopedobionts community structure is presented as a classical matrix of species/sampling points. The <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> is principally focused not on taxonomic features but on biological properties (traits) of species. Such features can act on ecomorphs of soil animals. The direct functional analysis of relationship of biological properties of species with variables of environment by means of data on the abundance of species demands association of three matrixes of data. Such problem can be tackled by means of the RLQ-analysis. A key aspect of structurization of communities of soil mesofauna is differentiation in trophic traits. The organisation of a community of soil animals in an ecological space set by axes RLQ can be displayed {{in the form of a}} natural variation of RLQ-axes in geographical space. Everything in the RLQ is represented, as follows from the mathematical nature of this generalisation, an independent aspect of the coordinated variation of structure of a community of soil animals, properties of environment and ecomorphic features of mesopedobionts...|$|E
