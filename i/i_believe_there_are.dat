2500|$|Obama {{has said}} that the death penalty is used too {{frequently}} and inconsistently. However, he favors it for cases in which [...] "the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage." [...] Speaking as a state senator about the Illinois legislature's constant additions to the list of factors that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty, Obama said, [...] "We certainly don't think that we should [...] have this laundry list that does not make any distinctions between the run-of-the-mill armed robbery that results in death and systematic killings by a terrorist organization. And I think essentially what the reduction of aggravating factors does is, it says, 'Here's a narrower set of crimes that we think potentially at least could deserve the death penalty.'" [...] In his own words, [...] "While the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime; <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some crimes – mass murder, the rape and murder of a child – so heinous that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment. On the other hand, the way capital cases were tried in Illinois at the time was so rife with error, questionable police tactics, racial bias, and shoddy lawyering, that 13 death row inmates had been exonerated." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Slyness-—aye, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was.</b> Tell me, Ada, had you {{any notion}} that that lad, Gerald Underwood, {{was engaged to}} Dolores Mohun?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it. We {{will not}} quarrel about terms. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no lease?--though, of course, {{that is no}} {{business}} of mine." ...|$|R
60|$|AUSTIN. Good God, sir, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> {{you are in}} the right; <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> upon my soul <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} in what you say.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Cecil suggested, [...] "you {{would like}} to try the golf links. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some quite decent ones not far away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, you {{can begin}} to-morrow. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some blasting-tools in the store. Take the gunner with you; this work comes within his province.” ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Stop! You {{want me to}} {{withdraw}} the report {{and to make a}} short speech stating that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> possibilities in the scheme? ...|$|E
6000|$|Fellows, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a camp over there, {{and if we}} {{can manage}} to get across perhaps we'll learn {{something}} about our belongings." ...|$|R
6000|$|ROWLEY. Or, rather at his Tongue's end Sir Oliver; for <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{sentiment}} he {{has more}} faith in than that 'Charity begins at Home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I trust nothing, Laura, {{but my own}} {{observation}} of your husband's conduct. I judge Anne Catherick's words by his actions, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None," [...] he answered. [...] "They are {{dragging}} the slate quarry again to-day. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some very deep holes {{where the body}} may have drifted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the land}} is of the same quality. Of course Walker is a {{different}} sort of man from Darvell. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> nearly four hundred acres in Brownriggs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, my dear, {{nobody said}} there were; but as to not meeting with {{many people in}} this neighbourhood, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{tell you}} <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} of the sort brewing again," [...] the woman said. [...] "I'll tell you more about it later on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That makes {{but little}} difference. He {{was obliged to}} marry money, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{no doubt that he}} did at one time propose to Miss Dunstable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you can't do that," [...] {{answered}} the little creature quickly. [...] "Mortals can't become fairies, you know--although <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> once a mortal who was made immortal." ...|$|R
6000|$|This was a {{question}} for which Dr Thorne was hardly prepared. [...] "Go to?" [...] he repeated. [...] "Oh, some member of the family, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> plenty of nephews and nieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|Haldane smiled dryly. [...] "It {{would depend}} on circumstances; but {{in a general way}} I hardly think I should," [...] he said. [...] "You will, however, {{remember}} advice was mentioned, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> men who would value my counsel." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Acton laughed. [...] "Oh, no!" [...] she contradicted. [...] "We are {{all going}} for a sail on the straits to-morrow, and we {{certainly}} expect you to join us. In the meanwhile, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two young women waiting for partners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XIII. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{little else}} to be noted of general laws of {{ornament}} respecting the wall veil. We have next to consider its concentration in the shaft.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not that I trust much to that," [...] said Julius. [...] "Poor Fanny is soft, {{and likes}} {{to produce an}} effect; but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{sterling}} stuff in Drake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{must be some}} art {{required}} to find the end," [...] rejoined Mr. George, [...] "and then <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some preparation which is necessary to make the cocoons unwind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{it is so}} noble {{to teach}} people everything! And then a man who writes for a {{newspaper}} must know so many things himself! <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> women who do it, but very few. One or two have done it, I know." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{place is}} beautiful--a burst of roses. Your friend Beaucourt (who will not {{put on his}} hat), has thinned the trees and greatly {{improved}} the garden. Upon my life, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> at least twenty distinct smoking-spots expressly made in it.|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! {{those things}} are very sad, no doubt, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take things very, very easily.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Macumazahn. I will go and ask {{the lady}} Nandie at once, for, if you can, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no time to lose." [...] And he left the hut.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Earl, the Vicar of Arnscombe. He {{has promised}} {{to tell me how}} we can be of use here. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> great want of a lady at the Sunday school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} about the name. It is a foreign lady, and her step-daughter, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> a clergy-man--or a Roman Catholic priest, rather--too; but he may be only a visitor." ...|$|R
60|$|The Mouth is {{directed}} towards the ventral {{surface of the}} thorax. The Labrum is {{far removed from the}} adductor muscle, with the upper part forming an overhanging projection; <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some very minute bead-like teeth on the crest. Palpi, small, narrow, thinly clothed with bristles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know at all. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a {{great many}} women journalists and {{sanitary}} inspectors, and black-and-white artists. But I suppose it takes time. Women, you know, edit most papers nowadays, George Egerton says. I ought, I suppose, to communicate with a literary agent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, how wet {{and cold}} you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> bad folks about. There {{has been a}} beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone yet!--laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are obliged}} {{to put up with}} what we've got, you know;--not but what <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a better general head of game in Norfolk than in any other county in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} imagine that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> at present any decline in her {{preference}} of you, Fred. Set your heart at rest, that if you keep right, other things will keep right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All business-men are not {{tired and}} all wives <b>are</b> not fat. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a public ready {{to pay their}} money to see good American drama. I have found {{a man who can}} write--" ...|$|R
