The magic eye (also called a cat's eye, or tuning eye in North America) is {{a specific type of}} such a tube with a circular display similar to the EM34 illustrated.

With high clinical suspicion for tuberculosis (figures 1 and 2), the aspirated sample was plated on Löwenstein-Jensen me-dium and cultured using the Mycobacteria Growth <b>Indicator</b> <b>Tube</b> 960 automated system (Becton Dickinson). Liquid me-dium systems, such as the Mycobacteria Growth <b>Indicator</b> <b>Tube</b> 960 automated system and the MB Redox tube system (Biotest), are known to expedite the identification of mycobacterial growth [1, 2].

50|$|The color <b>indicator</b> <b>tube</b> (also {{referred}} to as the Draeger Tube or Stain Tube) is a device many natural gas pipelines use for a quick and rough measurement of moisture. Each tube contains chemicals that react to a specific compound to form a stain or color when passed through the gas. The tubes are used once and discarded. A manufacturer calibrates the tubes, but since the measurement is directly related to exposure time, the flow rate, and the extractive technique, it is susceptible to error. In practice, the error can be as high as 25 percent. The color <b>indicator</b> <b>tubes</b> are well suited for infrequent, rough estimations of moisture in natural gas; for example, if the tube indicates 30 pounds of water, there is a high degree of certainty that it is over 10 pounds.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) {{continues}} to be a significant health problem worldwide. Pulmonary TB is a contagious disease. To control the spread of TB, the disease must be diagnosed early and treated effectively. Materials and Methods: In this study, we determined the rates and periods of TB bacterial reproduction using the Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) and the Mycobacterium Growth <b>Indicator</b> <b>Tube</b> (MGIT) culture systems in respiratory specimens obtained from 105 suspected TB cases that applied to our service. Results: Using either the LJ or MGIT method, the reproduction rates of TB cultures from 91 positively diagnosed cases were determined to be 69. 2 % and 92. 3 % (p= 0. 116), respectively. The reproduction period for these same cultures was determined to be 29. 7 ± 10. 0 days and 12. 1 ± 6. 1 days (p< 0. 0001), respectively. The culture positivity rate determined using both the LJ and MGIT methods together was found to be significantly higher than the rate determined using either LJ or MGIT separately (p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: For the early diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, which is essential for controlling the spread of TB, the routine use of the MGIT system, which is a rapid, automated and non-radiometric method, combined with the LJ method would effectively increase the diagnosis rate in order to control tuberculosis outbreaks.
