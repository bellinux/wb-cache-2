40|$|Evaluation of the {{manufacturing}} process industry confirms {{that there is still}} manual <b>exchange</b> of product <b>data</b> between design and procurement engineers and equipment <b>suppliers.</b> Manual <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> incurs human error, increases the cost, and takes more time. Also manual <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> prevents designers from automatically evaluating a larger pool of suppliers and verifying supplier requirements. Even current PLM software faces difficulties with flow of requirements information from different suppliers. This thesis proposes to develop a collaborative requirements framework using a Model Based System Engineering approach to representing, communicating, and verifying requirements. Collaborative requirements entail that equipment data and process system requirements are shared in a common way to encourage automated of equipment tradeoff and requirement traceability. The collaborative requirement framework includes SysML to represent the multiple views of requirements and their relation to the system structure and behavior, Multilevel Flow Model functional diagrams to depict the high level qualitative functionality with relation to requirements, and lastly an optimization tool to verify requirements. Overall, this thesis shows the benefits of using the collaborative requirements framework automating <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> between design engineers and equipment suppliers...|$|R

The method used was tosupplement the social requirement of SA 8000 : 2008 standard with the additional requirements of BSCI and SEDEX. The results are based on a correspondence between the requirements of SA 8000 : 2008 standard and therequirements of BSCI and SEDEX codes of conducts, because some of BSCI and SEDEX requirements are moredetailed than SA 8000 : 2008 standard requirements which are the base for the implementation of socialrequirements of the quality-social accountability-health and safety integrated management system. A check list waselaborated with the integrated social requirements of SA 8000 : 2008, BSCI and SEDEX. The check list is related tochild labour, forced and compulsory labour, health and safety, freedom of association & right to collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours, remuneration and management system. Theconclusion of the paper is that the elaborated check list allows the quality-social accountability-health and safety integrated management system audit to match to the requirements of BSCI and SEDEX...|$|R

To fulfill the rapid development of high-speed large-capacity optical communications with emerging multiplexing/demultiplexing techniques and advanced modulation formats, a laudable goal would be to achieve <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> in different degrees of freedom (wavelength, time, polarization), for different modulation formats (OOK, DPSK, DQPSK, pol-muxed), and at different granularities (entire data, groups of bits, tributary channels).

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Data</b> <b>exchange</b> is {{the problem}} of finding an {{instance}} of atarget schema, given an instance of a source schema and a specification {{of the relationship between the}} source andthe target. Theoretical foundations of <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> have recently been investigated for relational data. In this paper, we start looking into the basic propertiesof XML <b>data</b> <b>exchange,</b> that is, restructuring of XML doc- uments that conform to a source DTD under a target DTD,and answering queries written over the target schema. We define XML <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> settings in which source-to-target dependencies refer to the hierarchical structure of the data. Combining DTDs and dependencies makes someXML <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> settings inconsistent. We investigate the consistency problem and determine its exact complex-ity. We then move to query answering, and prove a di-chotomy theorem that classifies <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> settings into those over which query answering is tractable, and thoseover which it is coNP-complete, depending on classes of regular expressions used in DTDs. Furthermore, for alltractable cases we give polynomial-time algorithms that compute target XML documents over which queries canbe answered. 1...|$|R
