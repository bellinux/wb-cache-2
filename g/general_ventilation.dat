50|$|If {{equipped}} with internal combustion or turbine engines, engine rooms employ some means of providing air {{for the operation}} of the engines and associated ventilation. If individuals are normally present in these rooms, additional ventilation should be available to keep engine room temperatures to acceptable limits.

This would require an unrestricted hull opening of {{the same size as the}} intake area of the engine itself, assuming the hull opening is in the engine room itself.

40|$|Abstract: According to the Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC, {{one of the}} {{essential}} requirements relating to {{occupational safety and health}} hazards is to prevent dust pollution emitted by machinery during the implementation processes. Research on evaluation of emissions from machinery, according to the method of test bench using tracer gases, are currently being conducted in CIOP-PIB. This article presents some aspects of dust emission and efficiency of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) during metal grinding. Studies were performed with 10 sources of dust emissions during grinding. To evaluate the pollutants emission in the process of grinding metal products sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) was selected as a tracer gas. The results show that wherever dust is emitted, the LEV should be supported by the <b>general</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Ensure good interaction between all elements of modifying the air flow and the spread of pollutants in the surroundings of the LEV is essential to effective protection of human working zone against pollutants.

40|$|Background: Although {{the merits}} of {{ventilating}} operating theatres and isolation rooms are well known, the clinical benefits derivedfrom ventilating hospital wards and patient rooms are unclear. This is because relatively little research {{work has been done}} in the ventilation of these areas compared with that done in operating theatres and isolation rooms. Consequently, there is a paucity of good quality data from which to make important decisions regarding hospital infrastructure. This review evaluates the role of <b>general</b> ward <b>ventilation</b> to assess whether or not it affects the transmission of infection. Methods: A critical review was undertaken of guidelines in the United Kingdom and United States governing the design of ventilation systems for hospital wards and other multibed rooms. In addition, an analytical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} various ventilation strategies in removing airborne pathogens from ward spaces. Results: The CFD simulation showed the bioaerosol concentration in the study room to be substantially lower (2467 cfu/m 3) when air was supplied and extracted through the ceiling compared with other simulated ventilations strategies, which achieved bioaerosol concentrations of 12487 and 10601 cfu/m 3, respectively. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence that the aerial dispersion of some nosocomial pathogens can seed widespread environmental contamination, and that this may be contributing to the spread infection in hospital wards. Acinetobacter spp in particular appear to conform to this model, with numerous outbreaks attributed to aerial dissemination. This suggests that the clinical role of <b>general</b> ward <b>ventilation</b> may have been underestimated and that through improved ward ventilation, it may be possible to reduce environmental contamination and thus reduce nosocomial infection rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{part of the}} {{refining}} of {{gold and}} silver molten metal, silver dust and fumes are released into the atmosphere. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) enforces an 8 -hour, equivalent Time Weighted Average concentration limit for silver dust and fumes of 10 µg/m 3. MSHA initiated a program to assess the controls that were being used to control silver dust and fume exposure. Refineries were visited at six mines. The layout of each refinery and the controls used varied at each refinery. At each operation, personal and area silver fume and dust samples were collected to assess worker exposures and to determine sources of fume. Primary source of silver dust and fume exposure was the pouring of molten metal from the furnace. Secondary sources of exposure included: precipitate mixing, bar cooling, and housekeeping. Guidelines were developed addressing housekeeping, exhaust ventilation, <b>general</b> <b>ventilation,</b> administrative controls, and system monitoring.

40|$|Objectives: This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of an evidence database {{on the effectiveness of}} risk management measures (RMMs) to control inhalation exposure. This database is referred to as Exposure Control Efficacy Library (ECEL). Methods: A comprehensive review of scientific journals in the occupational hygiene field was undertaken. Efficacy values for RMMs in conjunction with contextual information on study design, sampling strategy and measurement type (among other parameters) were stored in an MS Access database. In total, 433 efficacy values for six RMM groups (i. e. enclosure, local exhaust ventilation, specialized ventilation, <b>general</b> <b>ventilation,</b> suppression techniques and separation of the worker) were collected from 90 peer-reviewed publications. These RMM categories were subdivided into more specific categories. Results: Estimated average efficacy values ranged from 87 % for specialized ventilation to 43 % for <b>general</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Substantial variation in efficacy values was observed within RMM categories based on differences in selected covariables within each study (i. e. study design, sampling strategy, measurement type and others). More contrast in efficacy values was observed when evaluating more detailed subcategories. Conclusions: It is envisaged that ECEL will contribute to exposure modelling, but should be supplemented with expert opinion, preferably in a formal expert elicitation procedure. The work presented here should be considered as a first attempt to collate and analyse RMM efficacy values and inclusion of additional (unpublished) exposure data is highly warranted. © The Author 2008.

40|$|Abstract: Glutaraldehyde is a {{potential}} sensitizer and has been implicated in the literature {{as a cause of}} respiratory irritation and asthma among health care workers. In order to evaluate the effect of work practices and <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> system on employees ’ peak exposure to glutaraldehyde, 42 breathing zone personal air samples were taken in five hospitals. In addition, work practices were observed and recorded during the course of sampling and were classified into three categories. Presence of local or <b>general</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, air change per hour, and quantity of glutaraldehyde used were also recorded. Geometric mean concentration of all samples was 0. 025 ppm (GSD= 3. 05). Statistical analysis indicated that work practice was the most important factor affecting the level of exposure to glutaraldehyde. In locations where “poor ” or “unsafe ” work practices were employed, the geometric mean concentrations were much higher (GM= 0. 05, GSD= 2. 11 and GM 0. 08, GSD= 1. 52, respectively). The result has indicated higher prevalence of headache and itchy eyes among employees who worked where unsafe work practices were observed. Employing proper work practices can significantly reduce exposure to glutaraldehyde among health care workers. It has been recently proposed that the current occupational exposure limit of 0. 2 ppm shall be reduced to either 0. 1 or 0. 05 ppm in the province of Québec (Canada). In this case, it is likely that concentration levels higher than these levels be experienced in some workplaces.
