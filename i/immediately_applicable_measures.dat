The formulae are <b>immediately</b> <b>applicable</b> to Rotation <b>Measure</b> and Circular Polarization (CP) production in jets and hot accretion flows. We show the recipe and results for arbitrary isotropic particle distributions, in particular thermal and power-law. The exact Faraday conversion coefficient {{is found to}} approach zero with the increasing particle energy. The non-linear corrections of Faraday conversion and rotation coefficients are found essential for reliable CP inter- pretation of Sgr A*. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figues, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
