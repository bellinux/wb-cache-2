This criterion, at least as interpreted in terms of the average austenite composition, is shown to be unnecessarily restrictive. The carbon fluxes evaluated from Brandt’s solution are sufficient to allow pearlite growth {{both inside and outside the}} Hultgren Extrapolation. As for the feasibility of the nucleation events leading to pearlite, the only criterion is that there are some local regions of austenite inside the Hultgren Extrapolation, even if the average austenite composition is outside.

40|$|Grain growth during {{austenitization}} has {{a negative}} effect on fatigue strength. Several methods have been investigated in order to determine an accurate method of measuring the austenite grain size of 4340 steel. The McQuaid-Ehn method, an industry standard for evaluating austenite grain size, has been recognized to produce inaccurate results due to the coarsening of grains during extended austenitizing. A method utilized for <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steels,</b> outlined by the ASTM-E 112 standard, is investigated to potentially obtain more accurate results by reducing the duration of austenitizing. Studies regarding effective etching procedures for revealing austenite grains without austenitizing are also addressed. Samples are prepared by heat treating to induce temper embrittlement in order to improve etching at these grain boundaries. Although temper embrittlement is undesirable for components in service, the process proved to effectively delineate austenite grain boundaries when etched with a picric acid based reagent. This method may be utilized to acquire an accurate measurement of austenite grain size during processing. The picric acid reagent was unsuccessful when applied to the McQuaid-Ehn and Hypoeutectoid samples.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{morphological}} features of pearlite were revealed through {{scanning electron microscopy}} using deeply etched specimens. These include cementite branching, bridging, gaps, holes and curvature. The presence of cementite thin films or networks along the austenite grain boundaries in eutectoid steel and at the interface between pearlite and proeutectoid ferrite in hypoeutectoid steel is another characteristic of pearlite. Further-more, ferrite thin films surrounding the proeutectoid cementite in hypereutectoid steels are also observed. Hence, it is considered that in <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> the nucleus for pearlite is a film of cementite rather than the expected proeutectoid ferrite and, similarly, in hypereutectoid steels pearlite forms from a ferrite film rather than from proeutectoid cementite. Convergent beam Kikuchi line diffraction was used to accurately determine the orientation relationships between pearlitic constituents and parent austenite in a Hadfields steel. The results show that neither the pearlitic ferrite nor the cementite is crystallographically related to the austenite grain into which the pearlite was growing and to that into which it was not growing. in addition, a new orientation relationship between pearlitic cementite and ferrite in the Hadfield steel was also observed.

In addition to the classical Brinell hardness measurement, data  of Jagar hardness, Shore, the width of lines on sclerometry Martens, weight loss during grinding on sandpaper are   given. Selecting tendentiously experimental data we demonstrate the plateaus on the curves of hardness of annealed <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> vs. % of C at ~ 0. 5 % С. Similar plateaus were discovered by N. S.

For the three states described (melt, austenite, mixed phase) the anomalies of properties at ~ 0. 5 % С should be denoted in some compact way, ascribing them, for example the formula of interim phase of ~ Fe 42 C.

Furthermore, the average size of pearlitic colonies increased with increasing AGS, and it appears that the interlamellar spacing of the pearlite does not depend on AGS, but instead, is controlled by the isothermal decomposition temperature.

40|$|This is a <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> (one {{that has}} a carbon {{composition}} below that of the eutectoid).

5000|$|An {{important}} aspect {{in the development}} of the European sword between the early and high medieval periods is the availability of high-quality steel.Migration period as well as early medieval sword blades were primarily produced by the technique of pattern welding, also known as [...] "false Damascus" [...] steel.Blooms of high-quality steel large enough to produce an entire sword blade were only rarely available in Europe at the time, mostly via import from Central Asia, where a crucible steel industry began to establish itself from c. the 8th century.Higher quality swords made after AD 1000 are increasingly likely to have crucible steel blades. The group of Ulfberht swords includes a wide spectrum of steel and production method. One example from a 10th-century grave in Nemilany, Moravia, has a pattern-welded core with welded-on hardened cutting edges. Another example appears to have been made from high-quality <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> possibly imported from Central Asia.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work a {{comprehensive}} model of the continuous hardening of 3 D-axisymmetric steel components by induction heating has been developed. In the model, the Maxwell and heat flow equations are solved using a mixed numerical formulation : the inductor and the workpiece are enmeshed with finite elements (FE) but boundary elements (BE) are used for the solution of the electromagnetic equations in the ambient air. This method allows the inductor to be moved with respect to the workpiece without any remeshing procedure. The heat flow equation is solved for the workpiece using the same FE mesh. For the thermal boundary conditions, a net radiation method has been implemented to account for grey diffuse bodies and the viewing factors of the element facets are calculated using a "shooting" technique. These calculations have been coupled to a metallurgical model describing the solid state transformations that occur during both heating and cooling. From the local thermal history, the evolution of the various phase fractions are predicted from TTT-diagrams using an additivity principle. A micro-enthalpy method has been implemented in the heat flow calculations in order to account for the latent heat released by the various transformations. At each time step, the local properties of the material, in particular its magnetic permeability, are updated according to the new temperatures and magnetic field. Special attention has been taken for the description of the boundary conditions associated with the water spraying below the inductor. The heat transfer coefficient has been deduced from the inverse modelling of temperatures measured at various locations of a test piece. This preliminary work has been complemented with measurements of the magnetic permeability of the 42 CrMo 4 steel from which the workpieces are made. This part of the study also includes dilatometric measurements for the verification of the additivity principle used in the simulation. The model has been applied to three cases of increasing complexity : induction stream heating of a steel cylinder without quenching, stream quenching of a steel cylinder and, finally, stream quenching of a non-cylindrical workpiece. The results of the simulation have been compared with experimental cooling curves, microstructures and hardness profiles. In the second part of this work, the phase transformations that occur in <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> during heating have been investigated at the scale of the microstructure according to a microscopic approach. Several models have been developed in order to describe the various steps of the austenitisation process : (i) pearlite dissolution, (ii) transformation of ferrite into austenite and homogenization, (iii) grain growth in austenite. In a first approach, each step has been modeled separately. The dissolution of pearlite has been described using a two-dimensional finite element model with a deforming mesh and a remeshing procedure. The diffusion equation has been solved in austenite (γ) for a typical domain representative of a periodic structure of ferrite (α) and cementite (θ) lamellae. The α/γ and θ/γ interfaces are allowed to move with respect to the local equilibrium condition, including curvature effects via the Gibbs-Thompson coefficient. The model has been used to predict the concentration field and the shape of the interface at different stages of the pearlite dissolution. Maps representing the steady state dissolution rate as a function of the temperature and lamellae spacing have been obtained for small values of overheating. The appearance of a non-steady state regime at higher temperature has been discussed. The transformation of ferrite into austenite has been described using a pseudo-front tracking finite volume approach for solving the diffusion equation in a 1 D, 2 D or 3 D domain. At the start of the computation, the volume is made of ferritic particles and austenitic zones resulting from the pearlite dissolution. The model allows to calculate the kinetics of the phase transformation as a function of the temperature and the initial microstructure. Although the comparison of the transformation kinetics with experimental results was quite satisfactory, it appeared that the calculated kinetics were slightly slower. This effect has been attributed to the other alloying elements which are contained in the Ck 45 steel used for the experiments. This discrepancy has also been explained by a stereological effect which is due to the calculation in a 2 D section instead of a 3 D domain as demonstrated by a comparison of 2 D and 3 D simulations. The austenitic grain growth has been described with two models based respectively on a Monte Carlo technique and a mechanical approach. A methodology for obtaining a correspondence between the simulation time scale and real time has been presented and applied to the Ck 45 steel. The value of the exponent n of the grain growth law d = Κ t 1 /n (where d is the mean diameter and t the time) has been determined for both models. The mechanical model (n= 2) turned out to describe perfectly the case of normal grain growth as it occurs in liquid-gas systems. However the results of the Monte Carlo simulation (n= 2. 3) are in better agreement with the non-ideal behaviour of the Ck 45 steel. The influence of the impurities and particles which are present in real materials should be taken into account in both models if a more quantitative agreement is to be obtained. Finally, a combined model coupling the various steps of the austenitisation process has been proposed. It allowed to show that the assumption consisting in dividing the process in three separate steps is valid in most cases. This combined model is a first attempt for a comprehensive modelling of the austenitisation process...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of heavily drawn pearlitic wires can reach values exceeding 4 GPa. However, to obtain this effect a careful {{control of the}} drawing process and of the pearlite microstructure is necessary. In the latter case, microstructural investigations should provide information allowing for an optimal design of a failure-free production process. Yet, the number of methods for the characterization of pearlite, despite a large variety of its possible microstructure forms, is limited. This, in turn, causes problems for further improvements of the pearlite properties. It {{is the goal of}} this work to create a tool for extended characterization of the eutectoid. Before this tool is presented, an overview of the possible pearlite microstructures is given. It begins with a review of nucleation and growth models, followed by information about a broadly understood relation between applied heat treatment and its effect on the microstructure of the eutectoid. The subject of pearlite microstructures is then supplemented with information about other variants of the eutectoid, namely hypoeutectoid and globularized pearlite. Subsequently, the currently used methods for microstructure characterization are presented. The chapter closes with a survey of the reports on the link between pearlite microstructure and its performance. After having presented the microstructure-property relationships, the new tool for the description of the eutectoid microstructures is introduced. This begins with an account of the application of the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique for the determination of the link between the ferrite microtexture and the corresponding microstructure as depicted by scanning electron microscope micrographs. This was meant to serve as the base for the application of EBSD for determination of the mean pearlite colony size. The obtained results showed, however, that the pearlite boundary network is far more complex than the concept of pearlite colony. It also became clear that the crystallographic orientation of the ferrite matrix inside a pearlite colony is not constant. In most of the examined colonies orientation gradients were found, often including changes of the orientation of the misorientation axis. Those gradients were found in as-transformed, as well as in severely globularized pearlite. The picture of the eutectoid given by EBSD is further supplemented by examination of <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steels.</b> Inspection of the continuity of the proeutectoid and the eutectoid ferrite showed that two variants can be found: continuous passage and separation by a high angle boundary. Subsequently, a new image analysis method for characterization of pearlite microstructures is presented. This begins with a new routine for the description of the soundness of fully lamellar pearlite. The performed experiments showed that this tool is capable of capturing the effect of carbon content and the austenite decomposition temperature upon the parameter in question. Further, morphologies other than lamellar are considered. For mixed, i. e. globular-lamellar pearlite, a new, automated procedure is proposed for separation of the two morphological components. Additionally a routine is presented for a comprehensive description of the globularized pearlite. Next, results of the experimental validation of the program are presented. This comprised of a microstructural investigation of globularized pearlite, tensile tests and hardness measurements. The performed analysis confirmed the close microstructure-property relationship and supported the application of the Hall-Petch relationship for mixed morphologies. The analysis also pointed out a direct link between the ultimate tensile strength and the hardness of the material.

The paper presents metallographic research, measurements of the average diameter of austenite grain, as well as hardness measurements. Design/methodology/approach: The austenitising temperature was defined in a standard way i. e. 30 - 50 °C higher than Ac 3 temperature for model alloy. A technique of full annealing was proposed for the model alloy. Metallographic examinations were performed on a Carl Zeiss light microscope Axiovert 200 MAT. Hardness measurements was performed with a Vickers apparatus of HPO 250 type, which imposes a force equal to 30 kG. Findings: Material for investigations was 37 MnMo 6 - 3 steel delivered in as-cast condition after casting in the Faculty of Foundry Engineering of AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow then reforged in INTECH-MET S. C. in Gliwice. Research limitations/implications: The new Mn-Mo iron based model alloy. Practical implications: The paper contains a description of one from a group of iron based model alloys with 0. 35 - 0. 40 % carbon content.

The results of the work include the determination of the main laws of diffusion processes governing the formation of carbon steel structure and properties at laser hardening and {{development of}} calculation methods for predicting the structure at laser hardening. Diagrams are plotted for selecting the conditions of laser thermal treatment to the prescribed depth of the hardened layer without fusion of the surface. Methods are developed for laser thermal hardening of large-length parts and parts like bodies of rotation. The method of large-length parts laser thermal hardening with continuous decrease of the degree of the laser radiation defocusing is put into practice. The economic effect is achieved at the expense of reduction of expenditure for bringing the production process to a commercial level and provision for stability of large-length parts hardening qualityAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|There {{the study}} object is the surface layer of {{articles}} in carbon steels, which are subject to heating with the strong induction pulse with following self-hardening. The physico-mathematical simulator, which describes the processes of non-stationary heat exchange in the surface layer in heating with the square induction pulse, the processes of decay of initial structure of <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> and of formation of two-phase field in the temperature interval up to the liquidus point of steel, has been developed. The results of numerical simulation allowed to determine the holding periods of different points of surface layer more than the critical temperatures, to predict the average size of grain of surface to be hardened in the wide span of pulse durations and of its specific power. The data of numerical simulation of dynamics of heating - cooling were used in optimization of process of induction pulse hardening of steel parts; it allowed to increase the strength and life characteristics of these parts several times.

40|$|Several {{important}} {{industrial material}} processes, such as welding and surface treatments with high energy beams, incorporate rapid thermal cycles characterized by high heating/cooling rates and short dwell times. Computational simulation {{of the evolution}} of microstructure under these extreme conditions has received rather limited attention. With the advent of modern computational tools regarding alloy thermodynamics and kinetics, it is possible to simulate the progress of diffusional phase transformations and thus to predict microstructural development. In the present work, moving boundary diffusion problems have been simulated for two cases. In the first case the rapid austenitization during laser transformation hardening of a <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> was examined. The effects of heating rate, maximum temperature, dwell time and initial microstructure fineness were analyzed. In the second case the aging, dissolution and coarsening of strengthening precipitates in the heat affected zone of laser welds in Al-Mg-Si alloys was examined. The simulation provided the variation of the volume fraction and average size of the strengthening phase during the weld thermal cycle. In both cases the calculations were performed by applying the coupled thermodynamics and kinetics approach, incorporated in the DICTRA program. This kind of simulation provides useful information for the design of the above processes. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} heat {{treating}} carbon steel {{is to change}} the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, Young's modulus (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) to precipitate leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the eutectoid temperature (about 727°C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained pearlite and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a <b>hypoeutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with α-ferrite (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of cementite formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible: ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a recent}} stray find of a sword fragment {{with a possible}} stamp from Masuria in NE Poland. It was found close to a Roman Period cemetery of the Bogaczewo Culture. On typological grounds, the sword can be classified as a Roman Period weapon. However, the results of metallographic examinations suggest that the find may have been made either from very clean bloomery <b>steel</b> (or <b>hypoeutectoid</b> crucible <b>steel)</b> or from mass-made Industrial Age steel (Bessemer, Thomas, Siemens-Martin, etc.). On the other hand, the chemical composition of the sword would rather imply a pre-Industrial Period steel. In conclusion, it is carefully suggested that the weapon may be a genuine Ancient sword, although its final recognition as a Roman Period weapon could only be verified by finds made from similar metal in undoubted Roman Period contexts...|$|R
40|$|A {{carbon dioxide}} laser {{with a power}} of 1. 5 KW was {{employed}} for surface hardening of a <b>hypoeutectoid</b> Ck- 60 <b>steel.</b> The microstructures and hardness profiles were determined {{as a function of}} power density and laser beam travel speed. The microstructure in the laser-beam hardened zone depended on power density and consisted of plate martensite (for high power density) or autotempered martensite (for low power density). In the transition zone of the laser-beam treated specimens, martensite and ferrite were observed. Case depth and maximum hardness were found to depend on power density and travel speed. A simple one-dimensional heat flow model has been used for the selection of process parameters and for the prediction of case depth. Calculated and experimentally determined case depths are in good agreement for medium values of power density...|$|R
40|$|Annealing (at {{multiple}} cooling rates) and quenching (with tempering) {{was performed}} on specimens of cast steel of varying composition. The aim was to devise a method for selecting the steel with the highest permeability, from any given range of steels, and then increasing the permeability by heat treatment. Metallographic samples were imaged using optical microscopy to show {{the effect of the}} applied heat treatments on the microstructure. Commonly cast steels can have DC permeability altered by the careful selection of a heat treatment. Increases of up to 381 % were achieved by annealing using a cooling rate of 6. 0 °C/min. Annealing was found to cause the carbon present in the steel to migrate from grain boundaries and from within ferrite crystals into adjacent pearlite crystals. The migration of the carbon resulted in less carbon at grain boundaries and within ferrite crystals reducing the number of pinning sites between magnetic domains. This gives rise to a higher permeability. Quenching then tempering was found to cause the formation of small ferrite crystals with the carbon content of the steel predominately held in the martensitic crystal structures. The results show that with any given range of steel compositions the highest baseline DC permeability will be found with the steel that has the highest iron content and the lowest carbon content. For the samples tested in this paper a cooling rate of 4. 5 °C/min resulted in the relative permeability of the sample with the highest baseline permeability, AS 4, increasing from 783 to 1479 at 0. 5 T. This paper shows how heat treatments commonly applied to <b>hypoeutectoid</b> cast <b>steels,</b> to improve their mechanical performance, can be used to also enhance electromagnetic properties of these alloys. The use of cast steels allows the creation of DC components for electrical machines not possible by the widely used method of stacking of electrical grade sheet steels...|$|R
