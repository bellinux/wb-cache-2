25|$|Type V is used where sulfate {{resistance}} is important. Its typical compound composition is: 38% (C3S), 43% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 9% (C4AF), 1.9% MgO, 1.8% (SO3), 0.9% <b>ignition</b> <b>loss,</b> and 0.8% free CaO. This cement {{has a very}} low (C3A) composition which accounts for its high sulfate resistance. The maximum content of (C3A) allowed is 5% for type V Portland cement. Another limitation is that the (C4AF) + 2(C3A) composition cannot exceed 20%. This type is used in concrete {{to be exposed to}} alkali soil and ground water sulfates which react with (C3A) causing disruptive expansion. It is unavailable in many places, although its use is common in the western United States and Canada. As with type IV, type V Portland cement has mainly been supplanted by the use of ordinary cement with added ground granulated blast furnace slag or tertiary blended cements containing slag and fly ash.|$|E
25|$|Type III has {{relatively}} high early strength. Its typical compound composition is: 57% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 3.0% MgO, 3.1% (SO3), 0.9% <b>ignition</b> <b>loss,</b> and 1.3% free CaO. This cement {{is similar to}} type I, but ground finer. Some manufacturers make a separate clinker with higher C3S and/or C3A content, but this is increasingly rare, and the general purpose clinker is usually used, ground to a specific surface area typically 50–80% higher. The gypsum level may also be increased a small amount. This gives the concrete using this type of cement a three-day compressive strength equal to the seven-day compressive strength of types I and II. Its seven-day compressive strength is almost equal to 28-day compressive strengths of types I and II. The only downside is that the six-month strength of type III is the same or slightly {{less than that of}} types I and II. Therefore, the long-term strength is sacrificed. It is usually used for precast concrete manufacture, where high one-day strength allows fast turnover of molds. It may also be used in emergency construction and repairs, and construction of machine bases and gate installations.|$|E
25|$|Type IV Portland cement is {{generally}} {{known for its}} low heat of hydration. Its typical compound composition is: 28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% <b>ignition</b> <b>loss,</b> and 0.8% free CaO. The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. However, as a consequence {{the strength of the}} concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low surface to volume ratio. This type of cement {{is generally}} not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order. This type of cement has not been made for many years, because Portland-pozzolan cements and ground granulated blast furnace slag addition offer a cheaper and more reliable alternative.|$|E

Today, despite a higher cost to acquire, the number of applications involving silicones continues to increase, in some instances driven by Moore’s law (chip complexity doubling approximately every two years), but also by tighter specifications. The presence of more and smaller components (e. g., sometimes thousands in today’s cars) requires resistance to higher temperatures to ensure reliability and to avoid increasing the probability of failure.

The combustion gas was 10 % oxygen in nitrogen, which was supplemented {{in the case of the}} fixed bed with other gases found in diesel exhausts. The temperatures of initiation of combustion Tin were measured in the DTG and in the fixed bed. The kinetic rates of oxidation were calculated from the DTG results taking into account the influence of oxygen transport. The effect of gas composition on ignition and burnout in the fixed bed was determined. Ignition did not occur in the DTG, but rather burning progressed steadily. There was a large increase in the kinetic rate constants with cerium present, but the activation energy was unchanged. There was no difference in rates between the two cerium additives. No consistent differences were observed between the combustion kinetics of soots generated under different engine conditions. At temperatures above 600 °C a decline in the catalytic effect of the doped samples appeared. In the fixed bed the catalysed samples tended to partly burn and then ignite and be totally consumed.
