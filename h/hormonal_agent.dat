MECHANISM OF ACTION: Buserelin is a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. It is a synthetic analog of LHRH (also known as gonadotropin releasing hormone [GnRH]). 1 LHRH agonists (LHRHa) initially stimulate {{the release of}} luteinizing hormone (LH, gonadotropin), resulting in a transient elevation in serum androgen in men and serum estradiol in women. However, chronic administration can cause down-regulation of the LHRH receptors, thus inhibiting the secretion of LH and ultimately the sex hormones (androgen, estradiol). By decreasing the testicular production of androgen in men, LHRHa can inhibit the growth of androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Similarly, LHRHa reduce the ovarian secretion of estradiol and progesterone in women, 2 leading to inhibition of estrogen-dependent cancers. In men, LHRHa can reduce serum androgen to castrate level about 21 days after initiation of therapy. Similarly, serum estradiol level is suppressed in women around 4 weeks after initiation of treatment. LHRHa are 50 - 100 times more potent than LHRH. 3 In addition, they have a longer duration of action due to increased receptor affinity and greater biological stability. PHARMACOKINETICS...|$|E

40|$|The antiestrogens {{represent}} {{a group of}} compounds, not necessarily steroidal, which are able to decrease the specific uptake of estrogens in vitro and in vivo by various target tissues in the rat and in man. This action is explained either by competitive binding to estrogen receptor sites or, more probably, by failure of the antiestrogen complex, translocated into the nucleus, to stimulate neoformation of receptors in the cytoplasm. This explains the transient estrogenic effect of antiestrogen. Antiestrogens used in humans are hormone specific and antagonize also non-steroidal estrogens, like stilbestrol. Three compounds {{have been used in}} advanced breast cancer with the same indications as the older hormonal treatments. They are clomiphene citrate, nafoxidine and tamoxifen. Nafoxidine and tamoxifen are probably equally active. The response rate is between 28 and 35 %, with a median duration of nine months. Nafoxidine is toxic for the skin and tamoxifen is the preferred compound. A randomized trial comparing ethinyl estradiol and an antiestrogen showed similar rates of response with the two compounds in advanced breast cancer. The uniformity of results of treatment of advanced breast cancer by <b>hormonal</b> <b>agents</b> including antiestrogens and their limitations, probably justifies the present day concept which assigns hormonal treatment a secondary role, either as a supplement to cytotoxic chemotherapy or for old and debilitated patients. However, as a supplement to chemotherapy, <b>hormonal</b> <b>agents</b> are probably important since recent studies have shown that apparently all breast cancers have positive receptor sites, albeit in variable amounts.

For this purpose, procedures for concentration and fractionation of plasma and urine samples and a sensi-tive bioassay for demonstrating changes in renal sodium excretion were developed. The natriuretic assay utilized rats with mild diabetes insipidus which were maintained in salt and water balance. Using these approaches a natriuretic humoral sub-stance was demonstrated in plasma and urine from nor-mal man and sheep, and in patients with primary al-dosteronism or essential hypertension. It seems likely that this substance participates in day to day regulation of sodium balance because it was not detectable in sodium-depleted subjects and it con-sistently appeared in the sodium-loaded subjects.

GABA and GABA receptors are widely distributed throughout the GI tract, constituting a complex network likely regulating the diverse GI behaviour patterns, cooperating with other major neurotransmitters and mediators for maintaining GI homeostasis in physiologic and pathologic conditions. GABA is involved in the circuitry of the enteric nervous system, controlling GI secretion and motility, {{as well as in the}} GI endocrine system, possibly acting as a autocrine/paracrine or <b>hormonal</b> <b>agent.</b> Furthermore, a series of investigations addresses the GABAergic system as a potential powerful modulator of GI visceral pain processing, enteric immune system and carcinogenesis.
