A fuelwood demand and supply model is presented which projects likely fuelwood supply deficits to the year 2000 AD. Fuelwood demand in underdeveloped rural areas is calculated from fuelwood consumption measurements combined with demographic data for 1980 and projections for 2000 AD. Fuelwood is obtained primarily from natural woodland and shrubland. Detailed analyses are made of above ground woody biomass production for the different areas. A fuelwood supply model is constructed based on these data and taking into account current consumption patterns.

Therefore, Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP-Systems) are used to support the production planning process. These systems strongly focus on dates, inventory and capacities. Due to the German exit from nuclear and fossil-fuel energy, a new variable gains in importance throughout all areas of production: Energy. As a reaction, energy and power demands of the manufacturing systems are more and more monitored within the factories in order to enable energy-efficient operations. The <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> of a factory is currently not recognized in the planning process.

This manuscript details {{efforts to develop}} an <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and demand analysis tool to help urban planners and designers evaluate and compare schemes to satisfy the electric, heating, and cooling demands of urban areas. Current simulation tools {{tend to focus on}} either the demand- or supply-side aspect of the energy challenges cities face. Additionally, these tools are often overly simplistic or complex with steep learning curves, rendering analyses directionally incorrect or inaccessible. The developed framework integrates a 3 D modeling platform, an industry-standard energy simulation engine, and variable-efficiency supply models to increase the accessibility and usability of results. This will help municipalities, developers, and urban planners make informed decisions related to energy supply schemes at the neighborhood level regarding estimated energy consumption, carbon emissions, and energy costs. The approach is applied to case studies from six mixed-use neighborhood designs in three cities: Boston, Lisbon, and Kuwait City. The results illustrate the significance of using load- and temperature-dependent supply models instead of constant COP models. The results underscore the influence that weather, equipment, and regional power generation characteristics have on the optimal energy supply strategy for a given neighborhood design. by Bradley J.

40|$|Large scale {{solar energy}} {{conversion}} {{for a variety}} of residential, agricultural and industrial uses may emerge as a significant part of future energy supply mix on a global scale. The timing for reaching such potential depends upon the management of solar technology, the economics of the various solar options, and upon the organization of their diffusion in the productive areas of their integration as a viable energy source. The contemporary management of solar technology is often too fragmented and/or departmentalized, allowing a large variety of concepts to enter the market prior to sensible standardization and quality control measures. Retrofit installations to existing buildings are receiving primary attention, although the fully <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> systems will offer decisively better performance and economy. In fact, several preliminary studies indicate that large scale integration of solar energy could be instrumental in decoupling future energy demands from the desired economic growth trends, which ought to be the ultimate objective of future energy policies. Solar technology, is however, still in the developmental stage, which makes projections of its competitiveness and utility in the future too speculative. The lack of actual experiences with long term reliability of solar systems, their operating and maintenance cost, and the absence of data for realistic comparison with other alternate energy systems, are among the constraining factors for pragmatic evaluation of economics.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the ' 00, new generation displays were introduced by the corporations E-INK and Gyricon. Common point of the developed technologies is the use of microencapsulated, electrically polarized particles which are specifically aligned on a pixel array. While E-INK uses differently polarized particles with a different colour (e. g. black and white), the Gyricon technology focuses on a spherical particle in which the two hemispheres are differently polarized and coloured. Both technologies are characterized by a very good resolution, competitive relative energy efficiency in comparison to other display technologies and low-priced production costs. The biggest drawbacks are certainly the limited capacity to display more than two colours as well as the need for electrodes and circuits. The technologies application field is therefore reduced to simple displays, for example electronic books (cf. Amazon Kindle) or electronic labelling. Fraunhofer researchers together with the research group of Professor Yadong Yin from the University of California Riverside have now developed a microcapsules based technology allowing a system which is tuneable in its colour scale without the need for an <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply,</b> electrodes or circuits. A further characteristic of the encapsulated system is its memory effect thus leading to broad applicability. The approach, called "MikroMem - microcapsules with memory effect", is a patented technology from Fraunhofer-Society. Aim of the collaborative network research project MikroMem is to prove the system feasibility and its transfer into different industrial application. The collaborative research model imported from The U. S. has high potentiality and is moreover characterized by a great flexibility.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop dynamic mathematical models of the major energy use and recovery operations within the New Zealand meat industry. Ordinary differential equation based models were developed for the five most common rendering systems, for hot water use, generation and storage, and for the refrigeration system. These cover about 90 % of process heat use and about two-thirds of electricity demand. Each model was constructed so that ultimately it could be linked to the others to develop an <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and demand model. Strong linkages to product flow were developed for the rendering models, but those for hot water and refrigeration are less developed, although there is no technological impediment. In developing the models for rendering it was assumed that cookers and dryers are perfectly mixed vessels and that time delays in materials transport are negligible. Model predictions could be improved by removing these assumptions, but taking into account the possible extent of data uncertainties, the present accuracy may be adequate for the overall meat plant energy model. A major consequence of the development of a hot water demand model was that areas of low efficiency were identified. By attention to equipment designs for hand tool sterilisers and cleanup systems substantial heat savings are possible. Although not tested, both the model for heat recovery and the model for hot water storage and supply are expected to be accurate as few major assumptions were required in their development. The main novel feature of the refrigeration model is that it treats the refrigeration applications in abstract terms rather than performing a room by room analysis. As a consequence data demands are lower than for refrigeration models which use a room-based approach, and the actual data needed are more easily obtainable. In spite of the lower data requirements good accuracy was demonstrated. The models developed will have major benefits to the NZ meat industry, initially as stand-alone entities, but later as an integrated package to help in reducing energy use...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} data center {{computing}} increased significantly {{in recent years}} resulting in huge energy consumption. Data centers typically comprise three main subsystems: IT equipment provides services to customers; power infrastructure supports the IT and cooling equipment; and the cooling infrastructure removes the generated heat. This work presents a novel approach to model the energy flows in a data center and optimize its holistic operation. Traditionally, supply-side constraints such as energy or cooling availability were largely treated independently from IT workload management. This work reduces cost and environmental impact using a holistic approach that <b>integrates</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply,</b> e. g., renewable supply and dynamic pricing, and cooling supply, e. g., chiller and outside air cooling, with IT workload planning to improve the overall attainability of data center operations.

We have implemented and evaluated our approach using traces from real data centers and production systems.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to <b>integrate</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> with the electricity demand of inductively charged city buses is investigated in this paper. Rising CO 2 levels due to transport put {{a strain on}} the environment in urban areas. One method to attend to this problem is by electrifying city buses. City buses {{with an electric motor}} do not exhaust CO 2 and other greenhouse gases. To make the use of electrified buses sustainable though, the source of the electricity should be a clean source, without CO 2 or greenhouse gas emissions. However, the sources of clean renewable energy, solar PV and on- and offshore wind, are intermittent. Their variable production scheme can pose problems for charging and storage. For that reason, inductive charging is introduced. It is a new method to charge a vehicle contactless, by making use of electromagnetism. The aim of this research is to see whether supply and demand can be integrated, as to make sure there is minimal need of storage. Both daily renewable <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> patterns from solar PV, on- and offshore wind and the electricity demand from city buses in four medium-sized cities is reviewed. To determine the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> patterns, wind speeds and solar irradiation data are obtained from the database of the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI). These input values are used for the current and the future production scenarios. To define the electricity demand from the buses, four medium-sized cities were chosen and their bus activity was analysed. The amount of kilometres driven per hour resulted in the activity for the entire city. Combined with the energy use per kilometre, the total hourly electricity demand was calculated. A smart grid can be utilized to supply the generated electricity at the place where it is necessary. This study finds that for all seasons, the average curves for supply and demand match. This means that inductive charging could be a solution to drive an electric motor, without needing a large storage capacity, to diminish CO 2 exhaust in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|A brief {{account of}} the methodological {{approach}} developed {{for the construction of}} an <b>integrated</b> regional <b>energy</b> and economic plan for the Cyclades region is given. A integrated, twofold procedure is described: a planning process has been designed, having as a goal the active participation of local administration and representatives of social groups; and a simulation modeling system has been developed, in order to examine thoroughly <b>energy</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>energy</b> demand and economic aspects of the region. The approach has been found useful for the explicit definition of alternative policy recommendations for <b>integrated</b> regional <b>energy</b> and economic development...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{security}} of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> in Europe and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions led {{to the introduction of}} the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EBPD). A key requirement within the EPBD is that Member States will need to adopt a methodology for calculating the <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> performance of buildings. This thesis is concerned with the use of detailed energy simulation programs to address this requirement of the EPBD and its possible future evolution.
