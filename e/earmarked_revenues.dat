40|$|This article {{provides}} {{estimates of the}} impact of <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> on the level and composition of state expenditures. Examined are four types of state spending &mdash;total, elementary and secondary education, highways, and aid to nonschool local govern-ments-and two measures of earmarking-earmarked revenues per capita and <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> as a share of the favored expenditure category. An extra dollar of <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> results in either no change in expenditures or in increases in expenditures that are much smaller than a dollar. A greater reliance on earmarking as a share of expenditures results in either no change in spending or lower expenditures. The earmarking of state and local revenues for specific spending purposes is an old tradition, especially for revenues that are gener-ated by activities closely linked to the favored spending category, such as the earmarking of gasoline tax revenues for highways. In recent years, state and local officials have often earmarked new revenue sources, like lotteries, or increases in existing taxes to unrelated, but popular, expenditure categories such as education or crime prevention (see Snell 1990 for commentary and recent trends). The discussion in the popular press of the attractiveness of earmarking to elected officials implies that earmarking makes the increased taxes more palatable to the voters (see Mandel et al. 1990), possibly resulting in higher spending levels in jurisdictions that rely more heavily on <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues.</b> AUTHORS ’ NOTE: We are grateful to William Oakland for valuable comments on earlier drafts, Robert Porter for his generous advice on econometric issues, and Christine Lidbury fo...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies that}} compare the {{efficiency}} and distributional impacts of alternative instruments to curb sprawl typically ignore {{what to do with}} the revenues from anti-sprawl policies, such as development taxes. This paper extends first-best analysis of development taxes aimed at preserving land at the urban fringe to account for interactions with other distortions within the urban system. By incorporating urban decline at the city core, which in turn, generates negative neighborhood spillover effects and extra pressure for development at the urban fringe, we provide a more complete framework to evaluate {{the efficiency and}} distributional impacts of development taxes. We consider three potential alternative schemes to recycle the revenues: lump sum recycling, <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> to purchase conservation easements that permanently save open space and <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> to subsidize a revitalization program at the city core. In this setting, when revenues from the development tax are earmarked to fund a conservation easement there is an additional welfare gain (relative to the lump sum case) because the threat of future conversation of open space is fully eliminated. Similarly, when revenues are earmarked to fund a revitalization program at the city core, there are additional sources of welfare that make this policy preferred relative to the lump-sum recycling scheme. Finally, we also explore the spatial distributional impacts of these three alternative recycling schemes.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} {{events have}} created severe budget problems for state governments, and one area seemingly {{affected by this}} fiscal crisis is state funding for higher education. State governments {{have the ability to}} alter funding to higher education mostly through general fund contributions and <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenue.</b> This paper examines trends in state higher education appropriations, with a specific focus on the relationship between these two funding sources. We find that on average, total appropriations have actually increased over the past decade, and moreover, <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenue</b> has constituted an increasing share of higher education funding, while general fund contributions have been declining. Our regression analysis suggests that the magnitude of the fungibility between the two sources is substantial, but somewhat surprisingly, does not differ across recessions and expansions.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, state governments have {{experienced}} two recessions (including the recent “Great Recession”) which {{have resulted in}} significant disruptions in state budgets and highlighted the volatility of the personal income tax and general sales tax. Since infrastructure maintenance funding may be particularly vulnerable to budget cuts during recessions, {{it is important to}} identify more stable revenue sources and budgetary institutions. One of the distinguishing characteristics of highway finance in the United States is the heavy use of <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> linked to highway users. Our key research question is whether an increase in the share of highway funding from <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> will reduce the volatility of highway budgets. To answer this research question, we have collected extensive data on state highways, state finances, and other socio-politico-economic characteristics of state governments over a 30 -year period, and developed an empirical model drawing from previous research in state and local public finance. We found that earmarking of revenue in state highway funds is significantly related to highway expenditure; however, the relationship is more nuanced than we originally hypothesized. An increase in the share of highway funding from transportation-related revenue sources or an increase in the share of transportation-related revenue from motor fuel taxes are associated with a decrease in volatility of state highway spending. On the other hand, an increase in the share of transportation-related revenue used for highways is associated with an increase in budget volatility. Since the major alternative use of state transportation-related revenue is to fund local roads, this result indicates the importance of examining state-local intergovernmental finance on highway spending volatility in future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impact of {{earmarking}} on central government environment protection expenditure. Since central government spending for the environment relies on <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues,</b> which is not the case of the local government, it is expected that central government expenditure is to a lesser degree affected by macroeconomic developments. The analysis indicates that this is the case because correlation between GDP change and the change in central government expenditure for environment protection is smaller than that of the local government. It is also found that increasing revenues from earmarked environmental charges have contributed to growing expenditure. However, the analysis also suggests that the main driver of this growth is the expansion is EU funds.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two sections. In {{the first section}} we analyze some {{macroeconomic}} effects of extra-budgetary expenditures. We show that these expenditures as opposed to budgetary outlays introduce a source of uncertainty {{in terms of the}} future tax path and, consequently, are able to influence saving and investment decisions. We present a model where the uncertainty in tax payments leads to a lower capital accumulation than in the case of certainty. The second section analyses the case of <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> by presenting a simple growth model where earmarking implies both a suboptimal balanced growth rate and a suboptimal transitional path. In addition, a preliminary empirical analysis shows two important aspects related to earmarking. First, growth enhancing government expenditures, such as the share of education and health in government outlays, have a positive association with per capita income. Second, the share of these expenditures in the government´s budgets is associated with the institutional development of the countries. These two aspects raise doubts on the policy pursued by many developing countries consisting of fixing these expenditures in terms of GDP. Such fixing, which implies a corresponding earmarking of revenues, could determine a government expenditure policy inconsistent with the countries ’ institutional framework. In this regard, we test the institutional and geographic determinants of the intensity of education and health outlays in government expenditures...|$|E

40|$|Non-wage {{labour costs}} are {{relatively}} high in Austria. This is due, above all, {{to the level}} of employer contributions to social security, payroll-dependent charges, and the extent of non-productive times. If – in the interest of logical coherence – bonus payments (13 th and 14 th monthly salaries) are added to base pay, the rate of non-wage labour costs amounts to 61. 4 percent of the hourly wage. Relative to the yearly income (corrected for non-productive times), non-wage labour costs (social charges) account for approximately one third of total labour costs. If the anticipated surpluses of the existing funds in the field of social security are used to reduce contributions rather than increase spending, there ought to be some scope for a lowering of non-wage labour costs in the years to come. This applies, in particular, to contributions to the family relief fund, the fund to secure wage and salary payments in the event of insolvency, accident insurance, subsidised housing construction, and – in view of the expected economic upswing – unemployment insurance. Reducing non-productive times is yet another way to lower non-wage labour costs. If all possibilities to reduce contributions are fully utilised in the coming years, non-wage labour costs can be cut by up to ATS 16 billion. In addition, the related reduction of employees' contributions by up to ATS 6 billion would not only result in higher net wages and stronger consumer demand, but also have a moderating effect on the increase of gross wages. However, a reduction of contributions requires a departure from the past practice of using potential surpluses to increase spending and/or transfer payments or redistributing them to the old-age pension system – which in turn limits the scope for budget consolidation. Moreover, the margin available for reductions of contributions cannot be fully utilised, unless appropriate reforms are implemented {{at the same time to}} take account of the changing priorities of economic and social policy. Reducing contributions has the added benefit of imposing a more stringent spending discipline, whereas surpluses from <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues</b> tend to generate further expenditure increases. The effects of a reduction of non-wage labour costs on the economy and the labour market have been calculated on the basis of the WIFO macro-model: • The impact largely depends on whether and to what extent enterprises are willing to pass on the reduction of non-wage labour costs in the form of lower prices, which in turn would have a moderating effect on collective bargaining agreements. If the entire ATS 16 billion margin is used to lower non-wage labour costs and enterprises partly adjust their prices accordingly (as assumed in the model), this will translate into a growth of real GDP by 0. 3 percent and an increase in the number of persons in employment by 6, 400 (over baseline) after no more than two years. These effects continue to increase in subsequent years. • If the reduction of non-wage labour costs were passed on fully to prices, the effect would be about twice as strong: after two years, real GDP would be about 0. 7 percent higher, and the number of jobs would increase by 12, 300. The faster the cost reduction is passed on to buyers in Austria and abroad, the more favourable the effects on economic growth and employment.

40|$|The {{preliminary}} budget outturn for 1996 constitutes an important intermediate step in fiscal consolidation. It shows {{to what extent}} both expenditure cuts and additional revenues envisaged for 1996 were actually achieved. From this it may be judged whether the 1996 budget provides a sound base for the Federal government household in 1997 which {{will serve as the}} benchmark for successful consolidation and eligibility to participate in the European Monetary Union. Actual expenditure and revenues in 1996 were closely in line with the budget draft. Indeed, the net deficit of ATS 89. 4 billion was slightly lower than planned – {{for the first time since}} 1991. The deficit/GDP ratio fell from 5 percent in 1995 to 3. 7 percent, the cut being achieved to roughly equal extent by expenditure restraint and higher revenues – in line with government intentions. Relevant for the "Maastricht criteria" is not only the Federal government deficit, but also those of the states (Länder) and local communities (Gemeinden). These lower-level territorial authorities, by making their own efforts at improving the general government balance, have not imposed further constraints on the Federations's fiscal room for maneuver. As the Federal government expenditure, the wage and salary bill for active personnel (adjusted for the postal services which were moved off-budget) rose by around 1 percent in 1996. The respective spending limits set in the consolidation "package" were on the whole not exceeded, as overruns in some items were offset by shortfalls in others. Federal retirement benefit expenditure turned out lower than budgeted. However, as for the government transfers to the social security pension scheme, the desired savings were not fully implemented. Net overruns amounted to ATS 1. 8 billion, weakening also the prospects for 1997. The objective for the family allowance scheme, i. e. to bring expenditure in line with <b>earmarked</b> <b>revenues,</b> was also not achieved. The Federal government had to pay ATS 0. 85 billion in subsidies to cover the deficit. Upward pressure on expenditure slackened not only as a result of discretionary measures, but also for other reasons. Thus, falling interest rates lowered the interest on outstanding debt by around ATS 1 billion vis-à-vis the budget draft. Taxation policy in 1996 - 97 is shaped by budgetary constraints. Gross tax revenues in 1996 rose by 12. 4 percent to a total ATS 585. 7 billion, thereby pushing up their ratio to GDP to 24. 2 percent, the highest mark since 1992. Apart from the measures included in the consolidation "package" the second stage of the tax reform also had some revenue-raising effect, albeit with a lag. Taxes on enterprises rose strongly (income tax + 23. 7 percent, corporate tax + 50 percent), in line with expectations. Wage tax revenues (+ 6. 8 percent) increased rather more than suggested by the advance of the wage and salary bill, owing to the discretionary consolidation measures. Other tax revenues show no clear pattern of development. Yields from V. A. T. of ATS 204. 1 billion, while being pushed up 13. 4 percent by special, non-recurring factors, still remained below expectations. Energy tax receipts of ATS 2. 0 billion also disappointed somewhat. In all, however, the projection of 1996 tax revenues proved highly accurate, deviating from actual figures by only 0. 3 percent. Federal government financial debt increased by some ATS 67 billion in 1996, markedly less than the net deficit (ATS 89. 4 billion). This was due partly to some financing having been carried forward into 1995 (around ATS 11 billion), partly to exchange rate gains on foreign-currency debt (roughly ATS 12 billion).
