25|$|When Liu Bei was {{appointed}} as the Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Dezhou, Shandong), Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were appointed as Majors of Separate Command (别部司马), each commanding detachments of soldiers under Liu. The {{three of them}} shared a brotherly-like relationship, {{to the point of}} sharing the same room. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu also stood guard beside Liu Bei when <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> meetings. They followed him on his exploits and protected him from danger.|$|E
25|$|Elgar {{described}} how {{on the evening}} of 21 October 1898, after a tiring day's teaching, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the piano. A melody he played caught the attention of his wife, and he began to improvise variations on it in styles which reflected the character of some of his friends. These improvisations, expanded and orchestrated, became the Enigma Variations. Elgar considered including variations portraying Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, but was unable to assimilate their musical styles without pastiche, and dropped the idea.|$|E
25|$|Zhang Fei {{was from}} Zhuo Commandery (涿郡), {{which is in}} present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei. In the 180s, {{towards the end of}} the Han dynasty, he and Guan Yu became Liu Bei's followers. As Guan Yu was many years older than Zhang Fei, Zhang {{regarded}} him as an elder brother. When Liu Bei was later appointed as the Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan (平原; present-day Pingyuan County, Dezhou, Shandong) by the Han imperial court, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu served as Majors of Separate Command (別部司馬) under him. The three of them shared a brotherly-like relationship, to the point of sharing the same room. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu also stood guard beside Liu Bei when <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> meetings. They followed him on his exploits and protected him from danger.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henchy {{returned}} with the candlestick {{and put it on}} the table. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> the fire. There was silence for a few moments.|$|R
60|$|She jumped down, {{and came}} {{across the room to}} where <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him with the round, grey eyes that always {{reminded}} him of a kitten's.|$|R
50|$|Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1955, Kirkland was six when <b>he</b> first <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a piano keyboard. After {{years of}} Catholic schooling, Kirkland {{enrolled}} at the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied classical piano performance, classical theory and composition.|$|R
500|$|Presley's {{singing to}} his own [...] "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," [...] piano accompaniment, such as can be heard on the 1967 {{recording}} of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions, because [...] "it was always a measure of his engagement when <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the keyboard to play." [...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it {{to a level of}} spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 5, 2011, Ocean {{performed}} [...] "I Miss You" [...] at the House of Blues in New Orleans. Dressed in a {{black suit}} with a red-and-white bandana around his head, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> an electric piano to perform it live to end the evening. The crowd also sang along. Alex Rawls of Rolling Stone found his performance to be [...] "warm and soulful". British indie pop band The xx covered the song on February 14, 2013 during their concert in Austin, Texas and later posted the cover on their official blog. Their cover of the song was a duet between Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim accompanied by spare guitar and bass. Their cover of the song was described as [...] "great" [...] by Jenn Pelly of Pitchfork Media, while Sam Weiss of Complex magazine praised the performance saying that the band made the song sound similar to their own material from the album Coexist (2012). Chris Martins of Spin magazine commented that [...] "It's exactly what you'd expect to hear, and it's exactly as beautiful as you'd hope it would be." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> once in {{the same}} place and the old perilous attitude.|$|E
60|$|Tottie obeyed. The baby, true to his principles, {{refused to}} stand. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and stared <b>at</b> {{those around him}} in jovial defiance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nor ever will, Aunt Kitty. There are {{obstacles}} in the way. You must be granny, and mother, and sister and wife, {{and all my}} womankind, a little longer, if you please.' And <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> fondly <b>at</b> her feet, on a footstool which had been his childish perch.|$|R
60|$|Romayne's doubts were {{confirmed}} by {{the manner in which}} Penrose left him. Something had unquestionably happened, which his friend shrank from communicating to him. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> his desk and tried to read. The time passed--and he was still left alone. When the door was at last opened it was only Stella who entered the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the open}} window, {{and looked out}} leaning on the sill.|$|E
60|$|The Captain nodded impatiently. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{his desk}} and folded his hands.|$|E
60|$|The remark was {{unpleasant}} in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored it. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{little earlier}} than usual, Fancy," [...] the keeper said, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and looked <b>at</b> the clocks. [...] "That Ezekiel Saunders o' thine is tearing on afore Thomas Wood again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nonsense. By-the-by, {{would you}} mind telling Thompson to bring those papers to me which I gave him yesterday? I promised Optimist I would read them before three, and it's past two now." [...] So saying <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> himself <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his table, and Crosbie {{felt that he was}} bound to leave the room.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} Sunday evening Arnold Sherman {{walked to}} church with Theodora, {{and sat with}} her. When they came in Ludovic Speed suddenly stood up in his pew under the gallery. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> once, but everybody in view had seen him, and that night folks in all the length and breadth of Grafton River discussed the dramatic occurrence with keen enjoyment.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a piano, {{and began}} to touch the keys. Harz poured out some wine. Sarelli nodded.|$|E
60|$|The florid woman {{brought him}} a chair, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table, as Endicott once more began to deal.|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} the house and Mrs. Austin went after him. When <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a writing table, she stood opposite.|$|E
60|$|He dragged {{his feet}} across the room, wiping {{his face on}} his sleeve. As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>he</b> glanced <b>at</b> her furtively, his eyes still redder. Now he looked like some beaten rat.|$|R
60|$|Then she did sit down, {{knowing that}} she would want the {{strength}} which rest would give her. The conversation with Mr. Moss might probably be prolonged. <b>He</b> also <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a little distance, and held his shining new hat dangling between his knees. It was part of her quarrel with {{him that he had}} always on a new hat.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{and stared}} <b>at</b> the {{spectacle}} of the sea. The sun came out, increasing the sultriness of the day, while the dead calm still held. The seas continued to increase in magnitude.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{moved away}} from her. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table and {{buried his face in}} his hands. He felt dreadfully humiliated.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the table}} again, and taking up his pen took some papers from a pigeon-hole and eyed them with severe thoughtfulness.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table, and, {{squaring}} his shoulders, took a noisy dip of ink, and {{scratching his}} head, looked pensively at the paper.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> his desk, with sullen {{submission}} {{to the new}} disaster. [...] "All I can say is you're at liberty to look for it," [...] he replied. [...] "I must have dropped it somewhere." [...] He turned impatiently to the foreman, [...] "Now then! What is the next check wanted? I shall go mad if I wait in this damned place much longer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me, what's that?" [...] exclaimed Gluck, jumping up. There {{was nobody}} there. He looked round {{the room and}} {{under the table and}} a great many times behind him, but there was {{certainly}} nobody there, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> the window. This time he didn't speak, but he couldn't help thinking again that it would be very convenient if the river were really all gold.|$|R
60|$|Her hat {{was in her}} way, and Philip took it off for her. He {{placed her}} head more comfortably in the chair, and then <b>he</b> went and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table and looked at her.|$|R
60|$|The {{carpenter}} {{knew nothing}} about being ill; he only thought that he wanted something to eat, so <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table and began his dinner.|$|E
60|$|Bradley {{looked at}} the {{sleeping}} dog, and back at the meditative Judge, and smiled. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his work and said no more upon the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By the bye,' said Mr. Kendal, waking as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the bottom}} of the table, 'how was it that the Drurys did not stay to luncheon?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wot! {{begin to}} spin the whole yarn o' the voyage afore I've {{had time to}} say `How d'ye do?'" [...] exclaimed Buzzby, {{at the same time}} {{grasping}} his two uproarious sons, who had, the instant <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> rushed <b>at</b> his legs like two miniature midshipmen, climbed up them {{as if they had been}} two masts, and settled on his knees as if they had been their own favourite cross-trees! ...|$|R
60|$|So Sir Launcelot bathed {{his face}} and {{his hands in the}} water and he dried them upon the napkins. And <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> him <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the table and he ate and drank with great {{appetite}} and the Lady Elouise the Fair served him. And so Sir Launcelot was greatly comforted in body and in spirit by that refreshment which she had prepared for him.|$|R
60|$|As {{the door}} closed on them, Allan picked up the last {{fragment}} of the broken figure. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> alone <b>at</b> the table, and hid {{his face in his}} hands. The self-control which he had bravely preserved under exasperation renewed again and again now failed him at last in the friendless solitude of his room, and, in the first bitterness of feeling that Midwinter had turned against him like the rest, he burst into tears.|$|R
