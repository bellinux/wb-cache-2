40|$|Avoiding {{negative}} effects of conventional lubrication in forming operations stimulates research on lubricant <b>free</b> <b>forming</b> processes. Increased friction and wear due to direct contact between tool and workpiece surface lead to insufficient forming results in dry forming operations. Dry deep drawing of rectangular cups with conventional tools reveals cracks and wrinkles. This necessitates the development of tool sided surface modifications which face the challenges of lubricant <b>free</b> <b>forming.</b> As former results of tribological investigations have shown, adhesion is the dominant friction and wear mechanism. Therefore, diamond-like carbon coatings are applied to decrease adhesion. The mechanical properties of a-C:H:W- and ta-C-coatings are systematically analyzed to reduce friction and wear. Additionally, micro features are generated by laser texturing of a-C:H:W coatings to control material flow by locally adapted frictional conditions. The effects of different feature edge geometries and the feature orientation are investigated in ring-on-disc tribometer tests. Depending on the deposition parameters some a-C:H:W coating variants show reduction of adhesion for DC 04. However, in contact with aluminum alloys no improve of tribological conditions could be achieved. ta-C coatings affect the reduction of friction and wear in contact with DC 04 and aluminum and show high potential for application in dry forming processes. Depending on adhesion affinity of the workpiece material, micro features can increase friction by adjusting their edge geometry, orientation and area coverage. The tribological behavior of selected surface modifications is finally analyzed in the strip drawing test. The obtained results gain basic knowledge for development of surface modifications towards realization of lubricant free deep drawing by a tailored tool concept...|$|E

40|$|The {{explosive}} forming is a characteristic method. An underwater shock wave {{is generated by}} underwater explosion of an explosive. A metal plate is affected high strain rate by the shock loading and is formed along a metal die. Although this method {{has the advantage of}} mirroring the shape of the die, a <b>free</b> <b>forming</b> was used in this paper. An expensive metal die is not necessary for this <b>free</b> <b>forming.</b> It is possible that a metal plate is formed with simple supporting parts. However, the forming shape is depend on the shock pressure distribution act on the metal plate. This pressure distribution is able to change by the shape of explosive, a mass of explosive and a shape of pressure vessel. On the other hand, we need the pressure vessel for food processing by the underwater shock wave. Therefore, we propose making the pressure vessel by this {{explosive forming}}. One design suggestion of pressure vessel made of stainless steel was considered. However, we cannot decide suitable conditions, the mass of the explosive and the distance between the explosive and the metal plate to make the pressure vessel. In order to decide these conditions, we have tried the numerical simulation on this explosive forming. The basic simulation method was ALE (Arbitrary Laglangian Eulerian) method including with Mie-Grümeisen EOS (equation of state), JWL EOS, Johnson-Cook constitutive equation for a material model. In this paper, the underwater pressure contours to clear the propagations of the underwater shock wave, forming processes and deformation velocity of the metal plate is shown and it will be discussed about those results...|$|E

Three-dimensional <b>free</b> <b>form</b> shape matching {{is a fundamental}} problem in both the machine vision and pattern recognition literatures. However, the automatic approach to 3 D <b>free</b> <b>form</b> shape matching still remains open. In this paper, we propose using k closest {{points in the second}} view for the automatic 3 D <b>free</b> <b>form</b> shape matching. For the sake of computational efficiency, the optimised k-D tree is employed for the search of the k closest points. Since occlusion and appearance and disappearance of points almost always occur, slack variables have to be employed, explicitly modelling outliers in the process of matching. Then the relative quality of each possible point match is estimated using the graduated assignment algorithm, leading the camera motion parameters to be estimated by the quaternion method in the weighted least-squares sense. The experimental results based on both synthetic data and real images without any pre-processing show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the automatic matching of overlapping 3 D <b>free</b> <b>form</b> shapes with either sparse or dense points.

For economical and ecological reasons {{the use of}} lubricants for massive forming has to be avoided. Both, lubricant <b>free</b> <b>forming</b> and processing of high strength materials are big challenges that can be realized by using coated tools with functional surfaces that show high wear resistance, low friction and low adhesion to aluminium [1 - 7].
