Stennis was so embarrassed by the <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators {{and a lack of}} support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. The Poverty Subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work.|$|E

25|$|The {{commission}} {{found evidence}} that in 1970, Seedman had accepted a free dinner worth $84.30 ($ in modern dollars) from the New York Hilton Midtown, for himself, {{his wife and two}} guests. Since it was relatively minor compared to many of the allegations it was investigating, it notified Murphy's office before it began <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> it would not be raising the check. Murphy, distrustful of the commission and fearing that it had an ulterior motive, sent out a press release announcing that Seedman had been relieved of his position as chief of detectives. After it made headlines on all the city's newspapers, the commissioner reinstated him five days later.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, the Cox/Knight/Trammell {{partnership}} {{was stripped}} of its broadcast licenses due to violations of the Federal Communications Commission's licensing rules and ethics violations. In <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> began in June 1960, {{it was found that}} some of the principals of Biscayne Television, {{as well as some of}} James Cox's personal friends, had made improper contact with FCC commissioner Richard Mack in order to influence the awarding of the construction permit and licenses. Biscayne had competed for the license with two other applicants, East Coast Television and South Florida TV. Mack had also been found guilty of taking payoffs and was forced to resign by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as the rest of the FCC commissioners.|$|E

25|$|After {{a year of}} {{planning}} and data collection, MDMA was proposed for scheduling by the DEA on 27 July 1984 with a request for comments and objections. The DEA was surprised when a number of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and researchers objected to the proposed scheduling and requested a hearing. In a Newsweek article published the next year, a DEA pharmacologist stated that the agency had been unaware of its use among psychiatrists. An initial hearing was held on 1 February 1985 at the DEA offices in Washington, D.C. with administrative law judge Francis L. Young presiding. It was decided there to hold three more <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> year: Los Angeles on 10 June, Kansas City, Missouri on 10–11 July, and Washington, D.C. on 8–11 October.|$|E
25|$|The Tandragee killings {{took place}} {{in the early hours of}} Saturday 19 February 2000 on an {{isolated}} country road outside Tandragee, County Armagh, Northern Ireland. Two young Protestant men, Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine, were beaten and repeatedly stabbed to death in what was part of a Loyalist feud between the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and their rivals, the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). The men were not members of any loyalist paramilitary organisation. It later emerged in court <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> Robb had made disparaging remarks about the killing of UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade leader Richard Jameson by an LVF gunman the previous month. This had angered the killers, themselves members of the Mid-Ulster UVF, and in retaliation they had lured the two men to the remote lane on the outskirts of town, where they killed and mutilated them.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Air Force {{scrambled}} to bring BOMARC to operational status, and on 1 September 1959 declared the 46th Air Defense Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base operational. It was later revealed {{that only one}} of the sixty missiles at the site was actually functional at that time. Engineers continued work on getting a second missile operational at McGuire, but the Air Force went ahead with plans to open the Suffolk County Missile Annex by 1 January 1960. In January only four missiles were operational at Suffolk, and during House appropriation <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> month, the DoD proved rather subdued when Congress attacked the design, especially in light of several failed tests of the BOMARC B missile. In February Air Force Chief of Staff Thomas D. White shocked everyone when he requested that BOMARC deployments be reduced to eight US and two Canadian sites, essentially killing the program.|$|E

5|$|Another {{argument}} presented {{during the}} Saxbe nomination <b>hearings</b> was <b>that</b> the constitutional framers wrote the Ineligibility Clause to prevent Congress from enacting laws to benefit {{one of its}} own members.

50|$|The {{statement}} {{assumes the}} truth of any allegation. A fundamental part of due process and Education Law §3020-a <b>hearings</b> was <b>that</b> charged teachers possessed the absolute right to cross-examine witnesses against them and present a defense if they wished. The changes to the UFT contract modified the ATR teacher's right of due process.|$|R
25|$|While much of {{the debate}} focused on the law's precise language, there was {{considerable}} opposition in the Senate, almost entirely from Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge and Hiram Johnson, the former speaking in defense of free speech and the latter assailing the administration for failing to use the laws already in place. Former President Theodore Roosevelt voiced opposition as well. President Wilson and his Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory viewed the bill as a political compromise. They hoped to avoid <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> would embarrass the administration for its failure to prosecute offensive speech. They also feared other proposals that would have withdrawn prosecutorial authority from the Justice Department {{and placed it in}} the War Department, creating a sort of civilian court-martial process of questionable constitutionality. The final vote for passage was 48 to 26 in the Senate and 293 to 1 in the House of Representatives, with the sole dissenting vote in the House cast by Meyer London of New York.|$|E
500|$|The Genesis {{version of}} Mortal Kombat was well {{received}} by gaming press, {{as well as}} fans, outselling the SNES version three- or four-to-one, while Nintendo was criticized for censoring the SNES version of the game.

500|$|The 1953 fiction novel [...] "Mr. Costello, Hero" [...] by Theodore Sturgeon was {{described}} by noted journalist and author Paul Williams as [...] "the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, {{who he was and}} how he did what he did." [...] The novel was adapted in 1958 by X Minus One into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956. In a 1977 interview Sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing McCarthy <b>Hearings</b> <b>that</b> prompted him to write the story.|$|E

The agency’s first Administrator, William Ruckelshaus, took the oath of office on December 4, 1970.|$|R
50|$|By September 1973, {{there was}} a sense that Nixon had regained some {{political}} strength, the American public had become burned out by the Watergate <b>hearings,</b> and <b>that</b> Congress was not willing to undertake impeachment absent some major revelation from the Nixon White House tapes or some major new action by the president against the investigation.|$|R
500|$|As a bench {{ruling in}} Avery v Pierce neared, Shiller [...] {{proposed}} an ordinance that directed {{the city to}} settle and accept a consent decree. The consent decree would have put most vacant parcels in Uptown into a land bank for future affordable housing, administered by a community development corporation, funded by the City with $100,000 over two years. The consent decree also {{would have made a}} [...] "desirable" [...] goal of 3,000 low-income housing units in Uptown. On November 16, 1987, the Committee on Finance of the Chicago City Council, chaired at the time by Shiller ally Alderman Timothy Evans, voted 21 to 2 to recommend the consent decree. Shiller gloated during committee <b>hearings</b> <b>that,</b> with Mayor Harold Washington's backing, the decree could not be stopped. Pulitzer Prize-winning commentator Mike Royko wrote in the Chicago Tribune: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of superhero comic books declined following World WarII, while comic book sales {{continued to increase}} as other genres proliferated, such as romance, westerns, crime, horror, and humour. [...] Following a sales peak in the early 1950s, the content of comic books (particularly crime and horror) was subjected to scrutiny from parent groups and government agencies, which culminated in Senate <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> led {{to the establishment of}} the Comics Code Authority self-censoring body. [...] The Code has been blamed for stunting the growth of American comics and maintaining its low status in American society for much of the remainder of the century. [...] Superheroes re-established themselves as the most prominent comic book genre by the early 1960s. [...] Underground comix challenged the Code and readers with adult, countercultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [...] The underground gave birth to the alternative comics movement in the 1980s and its mature, often experimental content in non-superhero genres.|$|E
500|$|After {{the initial}} wave of suburbanization, which built homes in former {{strawberry}} fields {{to the north}} and east of Marysville, the city's population totaled 5,544 in 1980. The city's growth was concentrated in outlying areas, leaving downtown to weaken economically. In 1981, the Marysville City Council declared that the downtown area was [...] "blighted" [...] and in need of a facelift. The council presented a $30 million urban renewal plan in November 1982 that would add new retail and office space, mixed-use development, public parks and improve pedestrian conditions in downtown, along with a large public parking lot and an expanded public marina. The plan was opposed by the marina's owner and other downtown property owners and produced lengthy public <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> lasted until the following year. Mayor Daryl Brennick vetoed the plan in June 1983, citing public outcry and the high cost of the proposal, and the city council failed to overturn the decision. The city instead developed a downtown shopping mall that involved the demolition of a water tower (one of two in the city) and several historic buildings in 1987.|$|E

500|$|The Vietnamese {{judicial}} system {{is based upon}} Socialist legality. The country's highest judicial organ is the Supreme People's Court (SPC). The composition of the SCP includes the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SCP (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, Central Military Court, Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SCP is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic {{has the power to}} nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge's request. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front introduces People's Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the operating principles of the courts are, during <b>hearings,</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws." [...] Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the right of defence and to hire a lawyer.|$|E
500|$|On June 26, 1996, Clinger's Government Reform and Oversight Committee held {{hearings}} on the matter. [...] Livingstone, who announced his resignation {{at the start of}} his testimony that day, and his assistant, Anthony Marceca, insisted during the committee's <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> the mishandled files were a result of a bureaucratic mixup and that no improper motivations were behind it. [...] They said that when the George H. W. Bush administrative staff left the White House in January 1993, they had taken all the files of the Office of Personnel Security with them for use in the Bush Library, as they were permitted to do under law. [...] The OPS staff were trying to rebuild these records to include those of permanent White House employees who remained to work in the Clinton administration; Marceca, a civilian investigator for the Army, had been hired for this task. In doing so, they received an outdated list from the Secret Service of White House employees, which included many names who were no longer employees. This list was then given to the FBI and the personnel background files returned as a result. [...] Lisa Wetzl, another assistant, testified that she discovered the mistake in mid-1994 and destroyed the request list.|$|E
500|$|In {{testimony}} before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 1989, Schwarzkopf maintained that the Soviet Union {{was a threat to}} the region, but when giving an overview of the countries in the region, noted that Iraq posed a threat to its weaker neighbors. He implored that the U.S. [...] "seek to assert a moderating influence in Iraq." [...] With regional turmoil growing, Schwarzkopf became concerned about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, focusing the attention of his command to prepare to respond to {{what he thought was a}} [...] "more realistic scenario." [...] That year, his command began planning to counter an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, seeing it as a likely conflict which would threaten the interests of the United States. In early 1990 he testified again before the Senate Armed Services Committee in threat-assessment <b>hearings</b> <b>that</b> the Cold War was ending and it was less likely the Soviet Union would exert military force in the region. Though he declined to identify Iraq specifically as a threat, he noted a regional conflict was the most likely event to destabilize the region, and noted Iraq's ceasefire with Iran meant it was continuing to grow and modernize its military. In early 1990, he drafted a war plan, Operations Plan 1002-90, titled [...] "Defense of the Arabian Peninsula," [...] which envisioned an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia through Kuwait.|$|E
