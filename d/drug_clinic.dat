40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{investments}} in providing free government health services in Uganda, many caretakers still seek treatment from the <b>drug</b> shops/private <b>clinics.</b> The study aimed to assess determinants {{for use of}} government facilities or <b>drug</b> shops/private <b>clinics</b> for febrile illnesses in children under five. Methods Structured questionnaires were administered to caretakers in 1078 randomly selected households in the Iganga – Mayuge Demographic Surveillance site. Those with children who had had fever in the previous two weeks and who had sought care from outside the home were interviewed on presenting symptoms and why they chose the provider they went to. Symptoms children presented with and reasons for seeking care from government facilities were {{compared with those of}} <b>drug</b> shops/private <b>clinics.</b> Results Of those who sought care outside the home, 62. 7 % (286 / 456) had first gone to <b>drug</b> shops/private <b>clinics</b> and 33. 1 % (151 / 456) first went to government facilities. Predictors of having gone to government facilities with a febrile child were child presenting with vomiting (OR 2. 07; 95 % CI 1. 10 – 3. 89) and perceiving that the health providers were qualified (OR 10. 32; 95 % CI 5. 84 – 18. 26) or experienced (OR 1. 93; 95 % CI 1. 07 – 3. 48). Those who took the febrile child to <b>drug</b> shops/private <b>clinics</b> did so because they were going there to get first aid (OR 0. 20; 95 % CI 0. 08 – 0. 52). Conclusion Private providers offer 'first aid' to caretakers with febrile children. Government financial assistance to health care providers should not stop at government facilities. Multi-faceted interventions in the private sector and implementation of community case management of febrile children through community medicine distributors could increase the proportion of children who access quality care promptly. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} characteristics associated with unprotected heterosexual intercourse in HIV infected adults in an urban area. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of sexual risk transmission behaviour between HIV infected {{men and women from}} a drug treatment site and between women from the drug site and HIV infected women from an urban medical centre. METHODS: HIV infected women and men were asked questions on sexual behaviour for a 1 year period before enrollment. The outcome variable was heterosexual risk behaviour (HRB) defined as having vaginal sex at least once in the previous year and not always using condoms. RESULTS: 73 % of the <b>drug</b> <b>clinic</b> females, 72 % of the <b>drug</b> <b>clinic</b> males, and 42 % of the medical centre female engaged in HRB. Using logistic regression analysis, women and men in drug treatment engaged in similar rates of HRB; however, women in drug treatment were four times (95 % CI = 2. 0 - 8. 3) {{more likely to engage in}} HRB risk behaviour than women from the medical centre. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that a surprisingly large portion of HIV infected patients under treatment engaged in HRB, especially former drug users. Without specifically targeted interventions, the heterosexual spread of HIV in urban areas will continue to be a serious problem...|$|E

In a four-year follow-up study of 60 men attending a <b>drug</b> <b>clinic</b> a history of repeated convictions for drug offences {{was found to be}} strongly related to patterns of delinquency. The following variables were associated with a history of repeated drug offences: a higher conviction rate for "non-drug" offences; younger age at first conviction; conviction preceding drug use; convictions for offences of sex and violence; longer prison sentences; and regular narcotic use and continued dependency at follow-up. Receiving a clinic prescription was not associated with a lower incidence of drug offences. Repeated drug offences identified a subgroup of drug users who were characterised by extensive sociopathic behaviour. Such offences should not be dismissed as an unavoidable, unimportant part of addiction...|$|E

A., Madrid, Spain Background: There {{is a need}} to {{evaluate}} the professionals’ perception about the consequences of the lack of therapeutic adherence in the evolution of patients with co-occurring disorders. Methods: An online survey, released on the Socidrogalcohol [Spanish Scientific Society for Research on Alcohol, Alcoholism and other Drug Addic­tions] and Sociedad Española de Patología Dual [the Spanish Society of Dual Pathology] web pages, was answered by 250 professionals who work in different types of Spanish health centers where dual diagnosis patients are assisted. Results: Most professionals perceived the existence of noncompliance among dual diagnosis patients. Almost all of these professionals (99 %) perceived that noncompliance leads to a worsening of the progression of the patient’s disorder, in both the exacerbation of mental disorders and the consumption of addictive substances. Most of the professionals (69. 2 %) considered therapeutic alliance as the main aspect to take into account to improve the prognosis in this population. The primary purpose of treatment must be the improvement of psychotic-phase positive symptoms, followed by the control of behavior disorders, reduction of craving, improvement of social and personal performances, and reduction of psychotic-phase negative symptoms. Conclusion: Most professionals perceived low adherence among dual diagnosis patients. This lack of adherence is associated with a worsening of their disease evolution, which is reflected in exacerbations of the psychopathology and relapse in substance use. Therefore, we propose to identify strategies to improve adherence. Keywords: dual diagnosis, professionals’ perception, noncompliance, decompensation, relaps...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the antecedents of community satisfaction towards an Australian <b>drug</b> <b>clinic,</b> with the aim of developing a general model of community stakeholder satisfaction that may apply to other clinics. A structured survey was administered via the telephone and face to face with 490 community stakeholders including residents, businesses and other health and community service providers. Multilingual interviewers were used because a large percentage of participants were from a non-English-speaking background. Community stakeholder satisfaction was found to correlate positively with variables such as stakeholder's perception of the importance of services, understanding of community needs, contribution to community, usefulness of communication, and staff skill. The antecedents related to quality of service, rather than to knowledge of the clinic, showed consistently stronger correlations with overall satisfaction. Stakeholders were least aware of the clinic's services that were rated the most important and given the highest satisfaction scores. It is concluded that regular surveying of community attitudes helps a clinic to modify its services to meet the needs of its community more accurately. Surveying can also provide early warning of growing problems that may, if left unresolved, impede future survival or growth of the clinic. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{are increasingly}} urged {{to become more}} involved in the care and treatment of drug misusers. Little information is available about the effectiveness of treatments delivered in primary health care or specialist settings. The impact of treatment setting is investigated as part of the National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS). This is the largest study of treatment outcome for drug misusers ever conducted in the United Kingdom (UK). AIM: This paper presents six-month treatment outcomes for patients who received community-based methadone treatment in either a specialist <b>drug</b> <b>clinic</b> or a general practice setting. METHOD: A prospective, multisite follow-up study of treatment outcome was conducted with 452 opiate addicts who had been given methadone treatment in primary health care and specialist clinic settings. Outcome data are presented for substance use behaviours, health, and crime. RESULTS: Improvements at follow-up were found among both the GP and the clinic-treated groups in drug-related problems, health, and social functioning. Problems at intake were broadly comparable among the clinic-based and the GP patients. Similar levels and types of improvement were found for both groups at six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate the feasibility of treating opiate addicts using methadone in primary health care settings, and show that treatment outcomes for such patients can be as satisfactory as for patients in specialist drug clinics. The GPs in our study are unrepresentative in their willingness to be actively involved with problem drug users; moreover, several services treated relatively large numbers of drug users. Issues surrounding the growth of 'GP specialists' are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To examine {{patterns}} {{of drug use}} amongst a cohort of drug treatment-seeking drug-using gay men and other {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), and whether these behaviours differ between, or predict, HIV status. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Specialist club <b>drug</b> <b>clinic</b> in London. Participants: 407 consecutive attendees who identified as MSM. Measurements: Substance use, including injecting drug use (IDU), associated sexual activity, and self-reported HIV status were measured by clinical interview and National Drug Treatment Monitoring System data tool. Findings: Over a 45 month period, 407 MSM attended the clinic. 62. 1 % were HIV positive, 48. 9 % had injected drugs, 14. 9 % reported needle sharing and 73. 3 % used drugs to facilitate sex. The most commonly reported problem drugs were GHB/GBL (54. 3 %), methamphetamine (47. 7 %) and mephedrone (37. 8 %). HIV status was associated with methamphetamine, mephedrone, IDU, sharing equipment, using drugs to facilitate sex, older age and older age of drug initiation, as well as Hepatitis C (HCV) status. Use of methamphetamine, HCV infection, older age and IDU predicted HIV positive status in a logistic regression model. Conclusions: The findings describe a constellation of risk factors including high levels of IDU, sharing of equipment and high-risk sexual activity in a population with high rates of HIV positive serology. They also provide further evidence for a link between HIV infection and use of methamphetamine. We suggest a need for greater awareness of HIV-related risk behaviours and promotion of HIV prevention strategies for MSM by both sexual health and drug treatment services...|$|E

After 8 1 / 2 years of follow-up at 12 university-affiliated treatment centers, 2 ̆ 2 The findings of the study indicate that the combination of diet and tolbutamide therapy is no more effective than diet alone in prolonging life. Moreover, the findings suggest that tolbutamide and diet may be less effective than diet alone or diet and insulin, at least insofar as cardiovascular mortality is concerned. 2 ̆ 2 The debate on the validity of this study still rages. A number of the criticisms leveled against the study by diabetologists, other clinicians, epidemiologists, and statisticians are discussed. These include inappropriate patient selection and randomization, higher risk factors at the outset of the study, manipulation of electrocardiographic data, risk factors such as smoking and hypertension not measured or monitored, use of fixed dosage of <b>drug,</b> <b>clinic</b> preponderance regarding mortality (it has been alleged that the bulk of tolbutamide mortality occurred in four clinics, Birmingham, Boston, Cincinnati, and Minneapolis), use of 2 ̆ 2 patient data 2 ̆ 2 against 2 ̆ 2 computerized data, 2 ̆ 2 neglect of appropriate 2 ̆ 2 vascular 2 ̆ 2 history, neglect of 2 ̆ 2 co-morbidity, 2 ̆ 2 contradictory clinical studies here and abroad, and the danger of extrapolation of the UGDP findings to other sulfonylurea agents...|$|E
40|$|Background: Non-attendance in {{drug service}} {{hepatitis}} C outreach clinics means clients miss {{the opportunity of}} being given lifestyle advice and referral to hospital for assessment and treatment. A similar problem is experienced in other services throughout the UK. A qualitative study was undertaken to investigate the problem. Methods: Clients {{with a history of}} not attending the outreach clinic were invited to participate during a routine <b>drug</b> <b>clinic</b> appointment. A contact details sheet with a preferred telephone number was completed by those agreeing to take part. Verbal consent was taken and a telephone interview took place. The participants were remunerated for taking part with a five pounds high street voucher. The ‘framework method’ was used to analyse the data with key themes identified. Results: Twenty-eight telephone interviews were undertaken from April to June 2012. All the clients gave ‘prima-facie’ reasons for non-attendance including ‘not a priority’ and ‘forgot’. However, the study indicates these are insufficient to explain the various experiences and influences. Underlying reasons that impacted upon attendance were identified. These reasons relate to (i) client characteristics e. g. ‘priority’ to score drugs and the ‘cost of travel’ (ii) clinic service e. g. ‘difficult journey’ to the clinic and timing of the ‘appointment’. The reasons operated within a complex context where other factors had an impact including addiction, welfare policy, stigma and the nature of hepatitis C itself. Conclusion: The study revealed that beneath apparently simple explanations for non-attendance, such as clients’ chaotic lifestyle resulting in them forgetting or not being bothered to attend, there were far more complex and varied underlying reasons. This has important implications for drug policy including the need to better incorporate clients’ perspectives. Policy that is based only on the simple, surface reasons is unlikely to be effective.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about drug misusers' views of the care they receive from general practitioners. AIM: This study set out to {{determine}} drug users' views about primary health care and their relationship with their general practitioners. METHOD: A semi-structured interview was conducted with 180 drug users who were consecutive attenders at five treatment services in north east London [...] a general practice with {{a special interest in}} treating drug users, a private <b>drug</b> <b>clinic,</b> a community drug team, a drug dependence unit and a street agency for drug users. RESULTS: The majority of the 145 London-based drug users attending the four treatment centres other than the general practice with a special interest were registered with a general practitioner (88 %). Forty-two per cent of users sought out a general practitioner prepared to treat them, rather than register with a local or the family doctor. Most drug users reported that their general practitioners were aware of their drug problems (88 %) but half of the general practitioners were not prescribing replacement drugs with almost 20 % of the users not receiving prescriptions claiming that this was due to lack of knowledge or trust {{on the part of the}} doctor. Sixty per cent of the drug users attending the four centres perceived that their general practitioners held negative or neutral views about them. However, 34 of the 35 drug users interviewed in the specialist general practice believed their doctors had a positive view of drug users. CONCLUSION: Most drug users were registered with general practitioners but the relationship between doctor and patient was not always easy or productive. There is a need to clarify the role of general practitioners in this field and provide them with better educational opportunities...|$|E
