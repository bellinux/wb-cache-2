50|$|The reactor uses a {{total of}} four control rods. Three of these control rods are used for coarse power control and <b>emergency</b> <b>SCRAM</b> shutdowns, and utilize a {{combination}} of stainless steel and boron. The other control rod is used for fine power control, and simply uses stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|In {{steady state}} operation, a {{significant}} fraction (over 6%) {{of the power}} from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products. This heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped (e.g., following an <b>emergency</b> <b>SCRAM)</b> and active cooling {{may be required to}} prevent core damage. RBMK reactors like those at Chernobyl use water as a coolant. Reactor 4 at Chernobyl consisted of about 1,600 individual fuel channels; each required a coolant flow of 28 metric tons (28000 L) per hour.|$|E
5000|$|All {{these actions}} {{led to an}} {{extremely}} unstable reactor configuration. Nearly all of the control rods were removed manually, including all but 18 of the [...] "fail-safe" [...] manually operated rods of the minimal 28 which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even {{in the event of}} a loss of coolant, out of a total 211 control rods. While the <b>emergency</b> <b>SCRAM</b> system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually (through the [...] "AZ-5" [...] button), the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level, and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed. Further, the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced, which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling, thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water. The reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers. If anything pushed it into supercriticality, it was unable to recover automatically.|$|E
25|$|Coolant {{temperatures}} below 100°C (cold shutdown) were {{reached in}} reactor 2 about 34 {{hours after the}} <b>emergency</b> shut down (<b>scram).</b>|$|R
25|$|With {{the steam}} {{generators}} no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure {{increased in the}} reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an <b>emergency</b> shutdown (<b>SCRAM).</b> Within eight seconds, control rods were inserted into the core to halt the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor continued to generate decay heat and, because steam was no longer {{being used by the}} turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.|$|R
50|$|CROCUS is {{controlled}} by two control rods and by adjusting the water level in the moderator tank. A neutron source is placed under the core to aid startup. In addition, there are two safety control rods and four surge tanks, making six independent safety systems. Any one of these six is capable of producing a complete <b>emergency</b> shutdown (<b>scram)</b> in less than one second, and is triggered automatically should power exceed the authorised level.|$|R
40|$|Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), {{which is}} under {{construction}} at Kalpakkam has three numbers of Diverse Safety Rods (DSRs) {{to shut down the}} reactor in case of an <b>emergency</b> (<b>SCRAM).</b> Whenever there is a SCRAM signal, the electro-magnet holding the DSR gets de-energized and it falls under gravity. The designed fall time of DSR is less than one second. As a safety requirement, it is required to measure the total fall time of DSRs, to ensure the proper insertion of rods in the core. Acoustic technique was employed for the measurement of fall time of DSR, with piezo-electric accelerometers as the primary sensing element. Experiments were carried out in various test facilities for establishing the measurement technology. Based on the experimental results and observation, configuration of a dedicated online system for drop time measurement has been arrived at and finally an online prototype system for DSR drop time measurement has been developed. This paper discusses the development of online DSR drop time measurement system for PFBR based on acoustic technique, its features and performance test results. 1...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{models for}} the study of a small Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) {{demonstrator}} (DEMO) core dynamics, in a control-oriented perspective, have been developed aimed at providing a useful, very flexible and straightforward tool allowing relatively quick transient design-basis and stability analyses. A simplified approach has been developed consisting in a lumped-parameter modeling of the coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. The reactor transient responses following both postulated accident initiators such as Unprotected Transient of OverPower (UTOP), Loss of Heat Sink (ULOHS) and Loss of Flow (ULOF), and an <b>emergency</b> <b>SCRAM</b> event have been studied in MATLAB/SIMULINK® environment. A benchmark analysis has been then performed by means of the SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 Liquid Metal Reactor Code System with the purpose of providing verification for the analytical outcomes of the nonlinear model and indicating how the latter relate to more realistic one-dimensional calculations. As a general result, responses concerning the main core characteristics (namely, power, reactivity, etc.) {{have turned out to be}} mutually consistent in terms of both steady-state absolute figures and transient developments, showing discrepancies of the order of only few per cents. DEMO dynamic behavior has been studied through a linear approach as well, so as to enable the use of linear analysis tools allowing to verify the system stability, thanks to the possibility of expressing a physical model in terms of transfer functions or state–space representation. The impact of linearization and point-kinetics one-precursor-group approximation has been further evaluated by examining the respective transient predictions, which have been compared to the nonlinear reference ones for increasing perturbations. An asymptotic stability analysis, according to Lyapunov's definition, is finally presented...|$|E

He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief.|$|R

50|$|Sceptre has {{suffered}} several severe accidents in her career. On 23 May 1981 she {{collided with a}} Russian submarine (K-211) and her reactor's protection systems would have performed an automatic <b>emergency</b> shutdown (<b>scrammed</b> the reactor), but her captain ordered the safety mechanisms overridden (battleshort enabled). The crew were told {{to say that they}} had hit an iceberg. Much of Sceptres forward outer casing was torn away; there was damage to the fin with the bridge no longer there; and the propeller of the Russian boat had cut into the pressure hull.This incident was disclosed when David Forghan, Sceptres former weapons officer, gave a television interview which was broadcast on 19 September 1991.

50|$|At 1:23:40, as {{recorded}} by the SKALA centralized control system, a <b>SCRAM</b> (<b>emergency</b> shutdown) of the reactor was initiated. The SCRAM was started when the EPS-5 button (also known as the AZ-5 button) of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed: this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier. The reason why the EPS-5 button was pressed is not known, whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures, or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor {{upon completion of the}} experiment.|$|R
50|$|When {{a vessel}} is moving backwards, her rudder {{and in the}} case of a submarine, her planes, {{function}} in the opposite manner than when she is moving forwards. The stern planesman failed to compensate for this phenomenon and continued to try to trim the boat as if they still were making headway. When the stern began to rise, he raised the stern planes, which would have depressed the stern if they had been moving forward. While making sternway, it had the opposite effect, increasing the down-angle. The stern continued to rise, more rapidly as the boat accelerated backwards. Before the problem could be corrected, Houston had attained a 70 degree down-angle and her screw broached the surface while still turning at a high rpm. The control team performed a partial emergency ballast tank blow and safely surfaced the boat, and the engineering team safely <b>scrammed</b> (<b>emergency</b> shutdown) the reactor plant to prevent damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{heat sink}} was restored when the service seawater system pumps in the pump room were repaired in units 1, 2 and 4 starting March 13 restoring the normal ECCS and heat removal systems to operable status and cooling was switched to the Residual Heat Removal System (RHR) portion of the ECCS. The RHR systems were first activated to cool down the suppression pools (torus) and drywells to operable status, and water injections {{were made to the}} reactors using the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode as needed. When the suppression pool was cooled down to below 100 degrees, the RHR was switched to the shutdown cooling mode and brought the reactors to a cold shutdown. Coolant temperatures below 100 °C (cold shutdown) were reached in reactor 2 about 34 hours after the <b>emergency</b> shut down (<b>SCRAM)</b> restoring the ability to lower the pressure of the reactor via the torus.Reactors 1 and 3 followed at 1:24 and 3:52 on March 14 and Reactor 4 at 7:00 on March 15. By March 15, all four reactors of Fukushima II reached cold shutdown, which remained non-threatening.|$|R
