40|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> {{vegetables}} are {{important parts of}} the human diet. The consumer demand for <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables is increasing due to their rich nutritional value, appealing taste, and healthy perception. However, due to their highly perishable nature, appropriate preservation technologies must be developed to meet the consumer&# 039;s demand for healthy, additive-free, microbiologically safe, <b>and</b> high quality <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables. The preservation technologies based on modification or control of pressure alters the normal atmospheric pressure of the preservation environment. The materials to be preserved are subjected to either very high or low pressure to extend their shelf life. The mechanism, advantages, and limitations of pressure modification-based preservation methods such as high hydrostatic pressure, hyperbaric treatment, vacuum cooling, hypobaric storage, and vacuum packaging focusing on their applicability to <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables have been reviewed.

The Farm Stores brand originally consisted of a small number of food only products, including fresh pies and quiches, pre-packed cooked meats, dairy products such as pre-packed cheeses, yogurt and cottage cheese and a selection of frozen foods such as frozen chips, burgers, ice cream and a small range of ready meals.

25|$|Drosophila {{species are}} found {{all around the}} world, with more species in the {{tropical}} regions. They {{can be found in}} deserts, tropical rainforest, cities, swamps, and alpine zones. Some northern species hibernate. Most species breed in various kinds of decaying plant and fungal material, including fruit, bark, slime fluxes, flowers, and mushrooms. The larvae of at least one species, D. suzukii, can also feed in <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> can sometimes be a pest. A few species have switched to being parasites or predators. Many species can be attracted to baits of fermented bananas or mushrooms, but others are not attracted to any kind of baits. Males may congregate at patches of suitable breeding substrate to compete for the females, or form leks, conducting courtship in an area separate from breeding sites.|$|E

40|$|If {{producers}} {{can improve}} the quality {{and the safety of}} their <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables, they stand a much better chance of selling them to wider markets, be they wholesalers, supermarkets or export markets. Food quality is an increasingly important issue for consumer protection, and hence an essential marketing criterion, while safety is a key issue for a growing range of markets. The FAO has a long track record of helping developing countries through technical cooperation projects and consultancies to develop food safety policies and to build local capacities for producing better quality <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables. As part of this policy, it has now published a manual on CD-ROM, aimed at trainers in the public and private sectors, who are responsible for capacity building, research, project formulation, projects and programmes for ensuring quality <b>and</b> safety of <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables.

25|$|While the {{earliest}} documented case of scurvy {{was described by}} Hippocrates around 400 BC, the first attempt to give scientific basis {{for the cause of}} this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the British Royal Navy, James Lind. Scurvy was common among those with poor access to <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables, such as remote, isolated sailors and soldiers. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on cider, vinegar, sulfuric acid or seawater, along with their normal rations. In the history of science, this is considered to be the first occurrence of a controlled experiment. The results conclusively showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease. Lind published his work in 1753 in his Treatise on the Scurvy.|$|E
25|$|A morning {{market is}} {{held on the}} central square during weekends. These are the only days when the {{residents}} of Thimphu can buy <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables.

A number of cheap souvenirs from Nepal are also sold at the market. Behind the open market, several shops sell Chinese and Bangladeshi crockery, appliances, shoes, silks and carpets. For many years merchants {{would come to the}} central square from all over Bhutan and market their goods and would sleep in the open air. However, in 1986, platforms were erected and in 1989 covered market halls were built over the platforms. A special building for meat products was constructed {{on the north side of}} the market. In 2006, the handicrafts section was moved to the new stalls on the other side of the new bridge, built in the traditional style in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} {{pioneering}} {{a program that}} has now {{become part of the}} World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.|$|E
