40|$|The EU {{directives}} on {{ambient air}} quality define a series of reference methods, which have {{to be used by}} the Member States to monitor {{ambient air quality}}. These methods have been standarised by CEN and their analytical uncertainties have been determined to be in line with the data quality objectives of the directives. The use of equivalence methods for reporting ambient air monitoring data to the 	 Commission should be guaranteed by a robust procedure, which is capable of evaluating the uncertainty associated with the candidate method under similar operational field conditions. 	 The grade of complexity of the procedure for <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> depends on how much the candidate method differs from the reference method. Such a variation ranges from a modification of the minor part of the standardised method to a method that could work with a completely different principle. The "Guideline on Demonstration of Equivalence" deals with these matters, first by defining 	 equivalence as " [...] . a method meeting the Data Quality Objectives for continuous or fixed measurements specified in the relevant air quality directive" and, secondly, by establishing a procedure for <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> based on specific programmes for laboratory and field tests with the ultimate goal of determining the uncertainty of the candidate method in comparison to the reference method. 	 This publication collates the proceedings of the Workshop on <b>Demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equivalence</b> between Ambient Air Monitoring Methods, which was held at the JRC in Ispra (VA) from 2 - 4 May 2007 and the major discussions vis-à-vis the last version of the "Guideline on Demonstration of Equivalence" (included as an annex). 	 During the workshop in Ispra, a series of relevant items were discussed including the same approaching principle, practical discussions on experimental design, QAQC requirements and other statistical approaches. All this information has been collected in the current proceedings and the different presentations slides {{can be found on the}} following website of the Joint Research Centre: 	 [URL] should be understood that the articles included in these proceedings do not represent any official position of the European Commission, rather the point of view of the corresponding authors.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{equivalence}} to the reference methods of the Radiello samplers for ozone (O 3) and benzene {{as well as the}} membrane-closed Palmes tube (MCPT) for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) is presented. These samplers benefit from new model equations capable of estimating their uptake rate. For O 3, the aim here was to demonstrate the equivalence for the reference period of 8 hours and 120 µg m-³, the target value stated in the 3 rd Daughter Directive. For benzene, the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> to the annual limit value of 5 µg. m- 3 as stated in the 2 nd Daughter Directive was examined. In the case of NO 2, the equivalence to the annual limit value as stated in the 1 st Daughter Directive (40 µg m-³) was considered. Results show that the radial sampler for O 3 fails to meet the Data Quality Objective (DQO) for continuous monitoring. However, with an expanded uncertainty of less than 30 %, the O 3 diffusive sampler fulfils the DQO for indicative measurements. For benzene, the Radiello sampler exposed for 7 days gave satisfying results showing the ability of the sampler to meet the DQO of the reference method. Nevertheless, the field tests should be complemented by measurements for a wider range of benzene concentrations. In the case of NO 2, all the results of the laboratory and field experiments respected the requirements of the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence.</b> Overall, these findings thus show that the Radiello sampler and the MCPT are equivalent to the reference methods only for assessment of benzene and NO 2 respectively.

The object {{of this study was}} to evaluate the pharmaceutical equivalence of 14 generic clarithromycin products marketed in Nairobi County, Kenya, to the innovator products, using in vitro dissolution profiles and similarity factors (f 2). Further, dissolution profiles of four innovator formulations manufactured in different sites were compared. Fourteen clarithromycin tablets/capsules and four suspensions were subjected to assay and comparative dissolution runs at pH 1. 2, 4. 5 and 6. 8, for 60 and 90 min, respectively. All products complied with pharmacopoeial assay specifications. However, significant differences were observed in their dissolution profiles. The non-compliance rates for tablets/capsules were 50 % at pH 1. 2, 33 % at pH 4. 5 and 50 % at pH 6. 8, while none of the four suspensions were compliant. Overall, only four (25 %) products complied with the specifications for similarity factor.

40|$|Estimating {{measurement}} uncertainty for NO 2 and PM 10 {{is a complex}} issue that is normally addressed by experimentalists specifically for every type of instrument and measurement. On the other hand, {{an estimate of the}} maximum expected measurements uncertainty is needed when a numerical model is to be evaluated against observations, as proposed in Thunis et al. (2012, referred to as T 2012). In a companion paper a simplified formulation of the {{measurement uncertainty}} in function of the measured concentration is proposed and applied to the simpler case of Ozone. In this paper the same approach is applied for NO 2 and PM 10, but using different techniques for the uncertainty estimation. For NO 2 the Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement JCGM (2008, referred to as GUM) approach is used and applied on each urban AirBase (1997) measurement over the year 2009. For PM 10, the method of the Guide for the <b>Demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equivalence</b> (ECWG, 2010) is used on data obtained with two different PM samplers used in parallel either during specific monitoring campaign or as available within the AirBase database.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an initial {{review of the}} state-of-the-art nuclear and non-nuclear well logging methods and seeks to understand the technical and economic issues if AmBe, and potentially other isotope sources, are reduced or even eliminated in the oil-field services industry. Prior to considering alternative logging technologies, there is a definite need to open up discussions with industry regarding the feasibility and acceptability of source replacement. Industry views appear to range from those who see AmBe as vital and irreplaceable to those who believe that, with research and investment, {{it may be possible}} to transition to electronic neutron sources and employ combinations of non-nuclear technologies to acquire the desired petro-physical parameters. In one sense, the simple answer to the question as to whether petro-physical parameters can be sensed with technologies other than AmBe is probably "Yes".

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine {{the question of whether}} stimulus classes between stimuli formed at reaching to criterion in a matching-to-sample discrimination had two properties of stimulus equivalence relation in rats: symmetry and transitivity. In Experiment 1, two thirds of the rats were trained to associate both a particular sample (CONV) with one of comparisons (H) and another particular sample (0) with the other comparison (V) to criterion, or were overtrained. Then they were given two backward association tasks. The remaining rats received a pseudo matching-to-sample discrimination training in Phase 1, but were given the same training as the other rats in Phase 2. The rats trained with the matching-to-sample discrimination learned the shift problem faster than the rats trained with the pseudo matching-to-sample discrimination. Overtrained rats learned backward associations faster than nonovertrained ones. In Experiment 2, rats were trained to associate a particular comparison stimulus (C) with either of two sample stimuli (Con or Cr). Then they were trained to associate a new comparison (V) with one of the samples (Con). Rats required to choose the new comparison (V) when sample stimulus (Cr) was presented mastered a subsequent task faster than those required to choose the other comparison (H).

40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with different groups of 6 students each to explore the effects of training class-inconsistent relations and naming on <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> emergent arbitrary stimulus relations. In all studies, two three-member <b>equivalence</b> classes <b>of</b> Greek symbols (A 1 B 1 C 1 and A 2 B 2 C 2) emerged {{as a result of}} training in conditional discriminations. Two new symbols were introduced (X and Y), and additional conditional discriminations were trained, whereby X was designated as the positive discriminative stimulus (S+) and Y was designated as the negative discriminative stimulus (S-) for A 1 and B 2. Conversely, Y was designated as the S+ and X as the S- for B 1 and A 2. This introduced conflicting sources of control within and between classes. In Study 1, subjects were not provided with names for the stimuli. In Study 2, the experimenter provided common names for the stimuli within each class. In Study 3, the subjects were required to use the common names during conditional discrimination training and test-trial blocks. In all experiments, equivalence responding with respect to the original classes was disrupted for some subjects subsequent to learning the new relations. Furthermore, in Studies 2 and 3, there were frequent examples of noncorrespondence between observed (listener or speaker) naming patterns and derived relations.

40|$|In the Dutch National Air Monitoring Network (LML) {{particulate}} matter (PM 10) is measured at various locations across the Netherlands. In {{order to ensure}} the quality of these PM 10 -measurements two major activities have been carried out. First, in the course of 2006 procedures, device configurations and settings in the Monitoring Network have been checked thoroughly. The observations have led to a revalidation of measurement results. The effect of this revalidation on earlier reported measurement values is minor. However, the measurement uncertainty is reduced due to the revalidation. Secondly, an equivalence study has been carried out to determine the equivalence between automatic PM 10 -measurements and the EU reference method. Based on this study the automatic PM 10 -measurements in the Dutch National Air Monitoring Network have been calibrated. Hence, making use of the interim EU calibration factor is no longer needed.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a {{comprehensive}} overview of the outcomes of marketing authorisation applications via the mutual recognition and decentralised procedures (MRP/DCP) and assess determinants of licensing failure during CMDh referral procedures. METHODS: All MRP/DCP procedures to the Co-ordination group for Mutual recognition and Decentralised procedures-human (CMDh) during the period from January 2006 to December 2013 were analysed. Reasons for starting referral procedures were scored. In addition, a survey under pharmaceutical companies was performed to estimate the frequency of licensing failure prior to CMDh referrals. RESULTS: During the study period, 10392 MRP/DCP procedures were finalized. Three hundred seventy-seven (3. 6 %) resulted in a referral procedure, of which 70 (19 %) resulted in licensing failure, defined as refusal or withdrawal of the application. The frequency of CMDh referrals decreased from 14. 5 % in 2006 to 1. 6 % in 2013. Of all referrals, 272 (72 %) were resolved through consensus within the CMDh, the remaining 105 (28 %) were resolved at the level of the CHMP. Most referrals were started because of objections raised about the clinical development program. Study design issues and objections about the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> were most likely to result in licensing failure. An estimated 11 % of all MRP/DCP procedures resulted in licensing failure prior to CMDh referral. CONCLUSION: Whereas the absolute number of MRP/DCP procedures resulting in a referral has reduced substantially over the past years, no specific time trend could be observed regarding the frequency of referrals resulting in licensing failure. Increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via the MRP/DCP...|$|E
40|$|Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a depth imaging {{technique}} that {{takes advantage of}} the full information contained in recorded seismic data. FWI provide high resolution images of subsurface properties, usually seismic velocities or related parameters, although in theory it could image any property used to formulate the wave equation. The computational cost of the methodology has historically limited its application to 3 D acoustic approximations but recent developments in hardware capabilities have increased computer power to the point that more realistic approximations are viable. In this work the traditional acoustic approximation is extended to include elastic effects by introducing the elastic wave equation as the governing law that describes wave propagation. I have developed a software based on finite-differences to solve the elastic wave equation in 3 D, which I applied {{in the development of a}} full-waveform inversion algorithm. The software is fully parallelised for both distributed and shared-memory systems. The first level of parallelisation distributes seismic sources across cluster nodes. Each node solves the 3 D elastic wave equation in the whole computational domain. The second level of parallelisation takes advantage of present multi-core computer processor units (CPU) to decompose the computational domain into different volumes that are solved independently by each core. Such parallel design allows the algorithm to handle models of realistic sizes, increasing the computational times only a factor of two compared to those of 3 D acoustic full-waveform inversion on the same mesh. I have also implemented a perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary condition to reproduce a semi-infinite model geometry and prevent spurious reflections from the model boundaries from contaminating the modelled wavefields. The inversion algorithm is based upon the adjoint-state method, which I reformulated for the wave equation that I implemented, which was based on particle-velocities and stresses, providing a comparison and <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> with previous developments. To examine the performance of the code, I have inverted several synthetic problems of increasing realism. I have principally used only pressure sources and receivers to assess the potential of the method's application to the most common industry surveys: streamer data for offshore and vertical geophones (only one component) for onshore exploration surveys. The results show that the imaged properties increase with the heterogeneity of the models, due to the increase in P-S-P conversions which provides the main source of information to invert shear-wave velocity models from pressure sources and receivers. It remains to demonstrate the inversion of field datasets and my future research project will focused on achieving this goal. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

This map provides a direct <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equivalence</b> <b>of</b> the cohomologies of the RNS and the EPS formalisms and is expected to be useful for better understanding of various properties of the PS and EPS formalisms. Furthermore, the method of construction, which makes systematic use of the nilpotency of the BRST charges, should find a variety of applications.
