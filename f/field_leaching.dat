30|$|Over {{the past}} 30  years, many {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} gain a better prediction of the complex interactions occurring in weathering mine spoils via a variety of techniques and some of the more notable examples are discussed below. Caruccio et al. (1993) performed an overburden analysis and leachate prediction study comparing acid–base accounting, humidity weathering cells, column tests (large and small), and Soxhlet reactors for the purpose of predicting <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> conditions. They concluded that the leaching columns provided the best approximations of field weathering conditions. Historically, column leaching studies have been favored for the more accurate prediction of pH/acidity generation via pyrite oxidation, TDS release from mine spoil, and the kinetics of trace metal leaching (Hood and Oertel 1984; Halverson and Gentry 1990; Caruccio et al. 1993; Daniels et al. 2009; Orndorff et al. 2010). However, column leaching studies are labor intensive and take many months to complete while static tests such as the components of ABA (pyritic-S, neutralization potentials, etc.) are completed quickly at much lower relative cost. It is also {{important to point out that}} while certain authors (e.g. Vengosh et al. 2013) refer to short-term solution: solid extracts of crushed spoils as “leaching tests”, such procedures are short-term lab extractions and do not provide the kinetic/temporal data of column or <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> trials.|$|E

40|$|The {{medium-term}} (5 - 10 years) elemental leaching {{from five}} different {{materials used in}} full-scale road applications was evaluated. Two materials, fayalite slag and blast-furnace slag, leached high concentrations of trace metals such as Cu and Zn throughout the study period. At several occasions, the blast-furnace slag generated leachates with acidic pH-values (< 4). Leachate from crushed concrete and MSWI bottom ash contained elevated concentrations of e. g. Cr and Cu during the first 2 - 3 years. Enrichment of trace elements occurred in sediments of roadside drainage ditches, but the respective contribution from leachate and road surface runoff is unclear. Migration of the elements through subsoil and plants in the ditches was limited, but clear anthropogenic signals were observed for e. g. Cu and Zn at the BA section. Further studies are recommended to verify if laboratory tests used for impact assessments are able to predict the observed <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> and how the road environment is affected by leaching from the road materials in the longer term.

The objective was to measure the N leaching to shallow groundwater from a tropical paddy field to assess the consequences of agricultural management practices. Mass balance approach was used to estimate the contribution of nitrogen fertilizer to the water environment. The N inputs to and outputs from field were measured by direct method. Inputs of N to the site came from commercial fertilizer, precipitation, irrigation water and soils. Outputs of N from the site were leached to groundwater, harvested crops, in surface runoff, soils and loss from the <b>field.</b> <b>Leaching</b> loss was calculated from daily fluxes of water percolation and soil water N concentrations extracted by vacuum lysimeter.

In this study SWAP and LEACHC models were used for the simulation of soil moisture profile and salinity, and the results were compared with those of a <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> experiment. The SWAP model gave better results in simulating soil moisture movement and profile, compared to LEACHC model, but statistical indexes showed that both models produced satisfactory results in predicting soil moisture profile. LEACHC model gave better results in comparison to SWAP model for the prediction of soil salinity profile at different time, possibly because it takes into account different solute transport mechanisms such as advection, diffusion, dispersion and also chemical interactions such as adsorption, precipitation and dissolution. In spite of the differences between predicted and measured values of salinity in the initial stages of leaching process, both models were able to predict the trend of leaching process with an acceptable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Water washing or {{leaching}} of biomass, {{especially of}} straws and other grasses, {{has been demonstrated}} to reduce the fouling and slagging characteristics and greatly improve combustion properties by removing large fractions of alkali and chloride [1 - 5]. In some instances the leaching {{can be carried out}} in the field by leaving the biomass exposed to precipitation and then harvesting once dry. This technique, although generally inexpensive, is at best poorly controlled and suffers from weather variability and the risk of contamination of fuel with soil, organic matter loss and degradation of fuel quality, and unpredictable scheduling of cultural operations for subsequent crops. An alternate technique is to leach biomass in controlled operations at the industrial site. In the latter case, the fuel quality can be improved rela tive to <b>field</b> <b>leaching,</b> but fuel dewatering and drying become more difficult and expensive, and a large volume of leachate is produced. Where a biomass facility is suitably located, leachate may be disposed of through land application, thereby returning valuable nutrients to the field.

40|$|Background: As {{part of the}} Dutch {{authorisation}} procedure for pesticides, {{an assessment of the}} effects on aquatic organisms in surface waters adjacent to agricultural fields is required. The peak concentration is considered {{to be the most important}} exposure endpoint for the ecotoxicological effect assessment. Macropore flow is an important driver for the peak concentration, so the leaching model PEARL was extended with a macropore module. The new model has two macropore domains: a bypass domain and an internal catchment domain. The model was tested against data from a <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> study on a cracking clay soil in the Netherlands. Results: Most parameters of the model could be obtained from site-specific measurements, pedotransfer functions and general soil structural knowledge; only three macropore-flow-related parameters needed calibration. The flow-related macropore parameters could not be calibrated without using the concentration in drain water. Sequential calibration strategies, in which firstly the water flow model and then the pesticide fate model are calibrated, may therefore be less suitable for preferential flow models. Conclusion: After calibration, PEARL could simulate well the observed rapid movement towards drains of two pesticides with contrasting sorption and degradation rate properties. The calibrated value for the fraction of the internal catchment domain was high (90 %). This means that a large fraction of water entering the macropores infiltrates into the soil matrix, thus reducing the fraction of rapid flow...|$|E

In this paper, we examine three applications of EM surveying used in arid southwestern US agriculture: repetitive salinity mapping, soil texture mapping, and locating buried tile lines. The basic statistical modeling techniques {{associated with each}} application are described and then demonstrated using data from three different field survey projects. In the first study, pre- and post-EM surveys are used to quantify the degree of salt removal from a <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> event.

The second study demonstrates the use of EM survey data for precision soil texture mapping under non-saline conditions, and illustrates how texture prediction maps can be generated from EM survey data. The final study represents an example of how EM survey data can be used to precisely locate the positions of buried tile lines.

The percentages of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn removed by column leaching were 90 %, 88 %, 90 %, and 67 %, respectively, when 3. 9 bed volumes of 50 mM EDTA were used. At the pilot scale, on-site metal removal efficiencies using the selected leaching procedure were 80 %, 69 %, 73 % and 62 % for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, respectively.

Physiochemical and biological analyses included biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, turbidity, human sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (HSBB), fecal coliforms (FC) and total coliforms (TC) tests. Membrane filtration was used to isolate human sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (HSBB), fecal coliforms (FC) and total coliforms (TC).

The successful reduction in sulfuric acid deposition since the 1980 s {{has been shown to}} enhance the mobility {{of organic matter}} in the soil, with more terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) reaching aquatic systems. Changes in soil acidity also affect the quality of the DOM. In this study we explore the consequences this may have on the reactivity and turnover of the terrestrially derived DOM as it reaches the aquatic system. DOM of different quality (estimated by absorbance, fluorescence and size exclusion chromatography) was produced through extraction of boreal forest O-horizon soils from podzol at two sulfuric acid concentrations corresponding to natural throughfall in spruce forest in Southern Sweden around 1980 and today. Extraction was done using two different methods, i. e. <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> and laboratory extraction. The DOM extracts were used to assess if differences in acidity generate DOM of different reactivity. Three reactivity experiments were performed: photodegradation by UV exposure, biodegradation by bacteria, and biodegradation after UV exposure. Reactivity was assessed by measuring loss of dissolved organic carbon and absorbance, change in fluorescence and molecular weight, and bacterial production. DOM extracted at lower sulfuric acid concentration was more susceptible to photooxidation, and less susceptible to bacterial degradation, than DOM extracted at a higher sulfuric acid concentration. Thus the relative importance of these two turnover processes may be altered with changes in acid deposition...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the minimization of chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide, in leachate after spraying onto plants by agricultural by-product. Agricultural by-product samples including coconut husk, peat moss, rice husk and peanut shell were investigated in comparison to a sandy soil sample taken from orange grove. Batch partitioning experiments were initially conducted to evaluate sorption capacity of these sorbents. The experiments revealed that peat moss could sorp chlorpyrifos higher than coconut husk, rice husk and peanut shell, respectively. For soil, sorption obviously gave lower values than all agricultural-by product samples. Sorption coefficient (K D) values were increased with increasing organic carbon contents in sorbent, which indicated that organic carbon {{played an important role in}} sorption of chlorpyrifos. Half-life (t 1 / 2) of chlorpyrifos in coconut husk was 8. 6 days, which was reported to be the fastest among the tested biomass, whereas; its half-life was 56. 8 days in soil. The results suggested that the sorped chlopyrifos could be degraded afterward.

In these assessments, measured lysimeter leachate concentrations are usually used directly for decision making. When doing so, one assumes (i) that the lysimeter bottom boundary condition itself did not lead to underestimating <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> concentrations, (ii) that the number of application years and the duration of the lysimeter study were adequate to measure the maximum concentration in time, and (iii) that the pesticide-lysimeter system considered was sufficiently vulnerable with respect to leaching. These assumptions were tested using simulations with a Darcian water flow model combined with a chromatographic pesticide leaching model. The scenario consisted of a layered light-textured soil cropped with cereals and of multiyear weather data. The groundwater level in the field usually fluctuated between 0. 7 and 2. 5 m depth. The lysimeter bottom boundary condition resulted in pesticide leaching concentrations lower than those calculated for the field system. Simulations showed that a lysimeter study of 2 yr was too short to measure the maximum leaching concentration for pesticides with organic-matter/water distribution coefficient values exceeding 40 L kg¿ 1. The probability that a lysimeter study results in a leaching concentration below 0. 1 µg L¿ 1 by a coincidental favorable combination of pesticide¿soil parameters was assessed by Monte Carlo simulations. This probability exceeded 20 % for pesticides that would give leaching concentrations of 1 µg L¿ 1 under field conditions.

Soil mineral N after harvest is consequently the major source of nitrate pollution of groundwater. To reduce losses of nitrate to groundwater, a national leaching threshold value of 35 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 is defined based on the maximum nitrate concentration in groundwater of 50 mg l− 1 and the average annual precipitation surplus of 300 mm. Based on local weather conditions in the study area in the Northern part of the country, the leaching limit should be set at 42 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1. In this paper, N profiles after harvest are defined which do not result in leaching quantities exceeding the national and local leaching thresholds. The spatial and temporal variability of N leaching is quantified using dynamic simulation for 65 soil profiles in a farmer's <b>field.</b> <b>Leaching</b> is simulated for five different N profiles {{at the end of the}} growing season for a 20 -year period.

The chemical composition of P in crop stubble may {{play an important role}} in the rate of stubble P release. Crop stubble sampled after grain maturity in 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12 contained 1 - 5 kg P/ha. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine the different forms of P present in the stubble. On average 50 % of the total stubble P was orthophosphate which is water soluble and readily available to plants and microorganisms. The remaining P forms were identified as phospholipids, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and pyrophosphate. The majority (65 - 90 %) of P in the major stubble component (stems) was water-soluble, and most of this was detected as orthophosphate. However, this includes organic P forms that may have been hydrolysed during the water extraction. Results from a <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> experiment show between 0 and 7. 5 % of stubble P was released from 52 mm (collected after 11 mm and 41. 4 mm) of summer rainfall. That indicated crop stubbles in the field release some P into soil solution which could be readily accessed by plant roots. However, the slower release of stubble P in the field compared to the laboratory suggests that residues potentially play a more important role as a long term P supply to subsequent crops.

Flow and transport processes were simulated in a 2 D vertical cross-section perpendicular to the plant rows. The 1 D simulation was limited to the open inter-bed areas. Several simulation scenarios were proposed to evaluate the effect of plastic mulch on bromacil transport in soil. In our simplified approach, the water and solute boundary fluxes for the non-covered areas were increased to simulate the water and solute contribution from the plastic mulch surface. The simulation results were compared with field observations of soil water potentials and resident bromacil concentration profiles. The field and laboratory-measured hydraulic and transport parameters were used for all simulation scenarios. Reasonably good agreement between the model-predicted and observed soil water potentials and bromacil concentration profiles was obtained. Biased 1 D and 2 D results were predicted when the water runoff from plastic mulch was neglected.

The chromatographic PEARL model was tested against {{the results of a}} <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> study on a cracking clay soil with a tracer (bromide), a mobile pesticide (bentazone) and a moderately sorbing, persistent pesticide (imidacloprid). Input parameters for water flow and solute transport were obtained from site-specific measurements and from literature. The model was tested using a stepwise approach in which each sub-model was sequentially and separately tested. Uncalibrated simulations for the water flow resulted in moisture profiles that were too wet. Calibration of the hydraulic relationships resulted in a good description of the moisture profiles. Calibration of the dispersion length was necessary to obtain a good description of bromide leaching. The calibrated dispersion length was 61 cm, which is very long and indicates a large non-uniformity of solute transport. The half-life of bentazone had to be calibrated to obtain a good description of its field persistence. The calibrated half-life was 2. 5 times shorter than the half-life derived from the laboratory studies. Concentrations of bentazone in drain water and groundwater were described reasonably well by PEARL. Although measured and simulated persistence of imidacloprid in soil corresponded well, the bulk of the imidacloprid movement was overestimated by PEARL. However, imidacloprid concentrations in drain water were underestimated. In spite of the extensive calibration of water flow and tracer movement, the behaviour of the moderately sorbing pesticide imidacloprid could not be simulated. This indicates that the convection-dispersion equation cannot be used for accurate simulation {{of pesticide}} transport in cracking clay soils (even if extremely long dispersion length is used).

An essential first step is the calibration of the processes concerning clay leaching (lessivage) in this model, for which we propose a reproducible method consisting of a screening for a realistic parameter range, a sensitivity analysis and finally a model calibration. To be able to separate the effects of natural soil evolution and more recent agricultural activities, we calibrated the model firstly on natural soils still under forest. Four parameters were the most sensitive and in need of calibration, representing the volume fraction of the soil in contact with macropores, a filter coefficient and physical weathering producing clay-sized particles. These parameters were successfully calibrated, but independent validations at Belgian and Norwegian sites with Albeluvisols and Stagnosols developed in loess and marine clay did not always show an improvement on earlier calibrations. This can be related to several factors, most importantly the dominance of processes other than lessivage in Albeluvisols and uncertain reconstructions of the climate. After calibration, a functional sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of agricultural management on lessivage. Clear effects on clay loss in the topsoil were found for the length of the crop-cover period and the ploughing depth {{and to a lesser extent}} for the intensity of soil mixing and the interception evaporation of the crops. As it is not feasible to reconstruct these factors for the entire period of agriculture in this region (several millennia), further analysis should take the form of scenario studies, but this should be preceded by use of <b>field</b> <b>leaching</b> experiments to calibrate SoilGen 2 over short time-scales...|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports a}} {{fundamental}} study into {{the influence of}} microwave energy on the dissolution of sulphide minerals. Chalcopyrite and sphalerite were chosen as model materials due to their economic importance and the diversity of their heating behaviour in a microwave <b>field.</b> <b>Leaching</b> of both chalcopyrite and sphalerite in ferric sulphate under microwave conditions has shown enhanced recoveries of metal values compared to that produced conventionally. The enhanced copper recovery from chalcopyrite during microwave treatment {{is believed to be}} {{as a result of the}} selective heating of the mineral particles over the solution and also due to the superheated layer of the leaching solution close to the periphery of the reaction vessel which creates higher temperatures compared to the bulk solution temperature. The enhanced recovery of zinc from sphalerite seems to occur as a result of only the presence of the superheated layer. If leaching takes place within this layer, an apparent rate increase will be noted with respect to the measured bulk temperature. Negligible differences between the activation energy values under microwave and conventional conditions for both chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Furthermore, measurements of the dielectric properties of the leaching solutions have shown that such solutions are highly lossy and characterised by a penetration depth of an order of about 3  mm suggesting that most microwave power dissipate within the thin outer layer of the reactor. Finally, numerical electromagnetic simulations showed that chalcopyrite particles could be heated selectively when microwaved within highly lossy leaching solutions due to their high conductivity. It is concluded that the dielectric properties of both the solid and liquid phases, the dimensions of the reactor and the position of solid particles within the reactor determine the leaching outcome. More importantly, it is likely that the enhanced recoveries observed are not likely to be as a result of a so called "non-thermal microwave effect" but rather as a result of thermal effects. © 2006 Elsevier B.

50|$|A {{percolation}} test {{consists of}} digging {{one or more}} holes in the soil of the proposed <b>leach</b> <b>field</b> to a specified depth, presoaking the holes by maintaining a high water level in the holes, then running the test by filling the holes to a specific level and timing the drop of the water level as the water percolates into the surrounding soil. There are various empirical formulae for determining the required size of a <b>leach</b> <b>field</b> based {{on the size of}} facility, the percolation test results, and other parameters.|$|R
50|$|For leach line testing, {{a minimum}} of three test holes are drilled, most {{commonly}} six to eight inches in diameter. Ideally, these should be drilled to different depths from three to six feet below the surface. For better, more conclusive results, five drill holes are used in a pattern of one hole at each corner of the proposed <b>leach</b> <b>field</b> and one test hole in the center. Testing of these holes will result in a value with units of minutes per inch. This value is then correlated to a predetermined county health code to establish the exact size of the <b>leach</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R
