5|$|After {{arriving}} at Seringapatam, the Christian captives {{were made to}} forcibly <b>embrace</b> Islam, were tortured, or sentenced to death.. The young men who refused to <b>embrace</b> Islam were disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears. They were seated on asses, paraded through the city, and thrown into the dungeons of Seringapatam. Historian Praxy Fernandes, author of Storm over Seringapatam: The Incredible Story of Hyder Ali & Tippu Sultan, states that contrary to popular belief, 40,000 Christians were not kept manacled in the dungeons of Seringapatam.|$|E

40|$|<b>Embracing,</b> one of {{the most}} {{widespread}} forms of human affiliation, plays important roles in other primates as well. Human <b>embracing</b> occurs in a great variety of social contexts. It can be a greeting display to announce the recognition of one another, it can provide comfort to others (e. g. consolation) and reduce anxiety in the receiver. Human <b>embraces</b> favour subsequent social contacts and are generally preceded by affiliative facial displays (e. g. smiling). Moreover, <b>embracing</b> morphology can be predictive of the intimacy of the relationship between subjects. To explore the biological roots and test some hypotheses on the function of <b>embracing</b> at an evolutionary level, a comparative approach is necessary. To reach the goal, we selected Theropithecus gelada as a model species. Geladas live in one-male society whose components (especially females!) show high levels of affiliation and cohesion. In geladas, <b>embraces</b> are performed in four different ways, two involving frontal contact and two directed to the posterior. Our data show that, as in humans, gelada <b>embraces</b> are mainly associated with a positive facial expression (lip-smacking) and favour the onset of social interactions (grooming). It is performed almost exclusively by adult females especially when they share a good relationship. Moreover, the most intimate forms of <b>embraces,</b> the frontal ones, highly reflect the strength of the bond between subjects thus suggesting that morphology of <b>embraces</b> can be predictive of their function. Finally, a linkage between <b>embracing</b> and other-oriented behaviours seems to exist: the best embracers were also the best consolers. In conclusion, even though the "embracing issue" remains open, some features of this behaviour seem to be shared between human and non-human primates...|$|R

5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then <b>embrace</b> the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to <b>embrace</b> her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

40|$|Relatively little {{information}} is available regarding the role of social grooming and <b>embraces</b> in spider monkeys that live in fission-fusion societies in which individuals are usually split into subgroups. We investigated whether <b>embraces</b> and grooming have similar roles in captive spider monkeys by examining their occurrence in two contexts. One context was fusion, i. e. when the monkeys moved into {{an area of the}} enclosure where other monkeys were present, in which individuals from different subgroups were expected to exchange greeting behavior. The other context was the access to young infants, in which females were expected increase their friendly behavior toward mothers. We collected data by observing all individuals within a subgroup and via focal animal sampling. We found that overall <b>embraces</b> occurred more frequently than grooming and that their distributions were not correlated. The frequency of <b>embraces</b> was positively associated with the number of fusion events per observation, whereas the frequency of grooming bouts was not. Furthermore, <b>embraces</b> were more frequent following initial approaches after fusion versus subsequent approaches, and the figure was higher than the corresponding one for grooming. Mothers received more <b>embraces</b> after than before the birth of their infants, whereas there was no such effect for grooming. <b>Embraces,</b> but not grooming, {{play a role in the}} regulation of social relationships in spider monkeys. <b>Embraces</b> may serve as signals of benign disposition in contexts that are likely to be associated with tension, such as fusion and access to infants...|$|R
