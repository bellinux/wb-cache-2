40|$|Abstract-In {{order to}} provide cost {{effective}} transport services for highly demanding dataintensive grid applications, National Research Networks (NRNs) are considering additional types of access to their network infrastructures. Next to traditional IP access, NRNs like to provide automated, grid application driven access to their underlying connection-oriented network infrastructure. This combination is called hybrid networking. Recently, both NRNs and grid communities started to acquire their own global optical network connections. A Lambda Grid was created when these organizations decided to interconnect these links via <b>interconnection</b> <b>points</b> such as Starlight and Netherlight. Apart from supporting scientific applications, the Lambda Grid allows network research. Within this context, this paper will present a novel token-based path selection mechanism that will enable authorized access to Lambda Grid links. The token-based approach allows temporal separation of the path authorization process from obtaining access to a Lambda Grid link. The path authorization process may involve many parties and complex, time consuming decisions whereas path access requires a fast real-time implementation. We will describe {{the application of the}} tokenbased approach for an <b>interconnection</b> <b>point</b> between a Hybrid Network and a Lambd...|$|R
