25|$|The English {{music critic}} John Steane, {{reviewing}} Simon Keenlyside's performance of this aria, wrote:Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and {{brings out the}} best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism we <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tenor solos in Mignon, adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{investigation}} of eastern women’s lives, {{they found that}} though the GDR’s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, {{there had been no}} women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler’s, has allowed women’s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn’t too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> works.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} Einstein brings into play the first screen {{as well and}} argues as follows: since the {{incident}} particles have velocities (practically) perpendicular to the screen S1, and since {{it is only the}} interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation, by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved, if the incident particle is deviated toward the top, the screen will recoil toward the bottom and vice versa. In realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary, but, in principle, it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil. If we imagine taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction X after every single particle has passed, we can <b>know,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that the screen will be found recoiled toward the top (bottom), whether the particle in question has been deviated toward the bottom or top, and therefore through which slit in S2 the particle has passed. But since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process, we will still have an interference figure on the screenF. The interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the superposition of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits. On the other hand, if every particle passes through only the slit b or the slit c, then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states, which means that interference is not possible. If Einstein is correct, then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy.|$|E

500|$|The {{protective}} sign of {{the hammer}} was worn by women, as we <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that it has}} been found in women's graves. It seems to have been used by the warrior also, {{in the form of the}} swastika. [...] Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the episodes}} open with Bathurst portraying Mark Taylor, a sitcom writer, {{apparently}} performing stand-up {{in a small}} comedy club. These performances are fantasy sequences, playing out in the character's mind and portraying his internal creative processes as comedic monologues; these monologues mainly employ material from the character's failing marriage and are intended to show that [...] "he thinks in punchlines, in comedy". Episodes regularly cut back to these fantasy performances, which usually open with the signature line: [...] "My wife left me...". Moffat felt that audiences needed to <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start that the relationship would not survive. However, it was unclear to some viewers that the fantasy sequences were set in the writer's mind; many journalists reported that the character Mark was a stand-up comic, not a sitcom writer.|$|E

500|$|After the reveal of the film's full cast, many {{outlets and}} fans began {{referring}} to the film as [...] "Avengers 2.5", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, {{and the fact that}} the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier. In response to this, Feige said, [...] "What's fun about Civil War though is, as you <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people .... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in a way that I don't think becomes overwhelming." [...] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because [...] "there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice," [...] saying Marvel was [...] "saving" [...] the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see [...] "her dynamic with Scott [...] in a way it could play out".|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph {{stated that}} [...] "Wolverine is an {{artificial}} stimulus package {{of the most}} unsatisfying kind.

[...] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: [...] "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying." [...] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of [...] "D", noting that [...] "Wolverine was the lead character of [...] films, and we've already learned everything we need to <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> films in said franchise," [...] adding that [...] "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting." [...] Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that [...] "how the hero acquired his special powers {{turns out to be}} a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them", while also being [...] "a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing".|$|E

500|$|Besides word {{of mouth}} and {{opinions}} in letters, {{there were only a}} few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described [...] "Strange fits" [...] and [...] "She dwelt" [...] as [...] "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about [...] "I travell'd": [...] "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" [...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to <b>know,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about." ...|$|E
500|$|The stories {{themselves}} were designed as glimpses into the Halo universe, including {{information on the}} inner workings of the alien Covenant, as well as details regarding elements of the back-story that were hitherto undisclosed. Jarrard explained that [...] "The stories that happen off camera, the parallel events to the arcs that our fans <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> existing mediums, are the stories we really wanted to tell." [...] Jarrard further described this as an attempt to move away from the story of the Master Chief, the central character of the franchise, and focus instead on what they believed to be the core themes that lay behind the game universe, such as maintaining hope in the face of overwhelming odds and humanity's struggle for survival; themes that extended beyond [...] "...a genetically enhanced super soldier picking up two guns and kicking some alien butt." [...] The four stories that ended up in the final publication were [...] "the most interesting to , and the writers of [...] ". Although Bungie created the story arcs present in the Halo Graphic Novel, the studio described the importance of providing a framework for each story that the various artists and writers could tell without jeopardizing their own voice. Artist Simon Bisley said that [...] "the stress was to make the characters look very much as they do in the game. Beyond that point I was given free rein to interpret the script and the action" [...] based on what was given to the artists and writers.|$|E
2500|$|Self-experimentation {{has value}} in rapidly obtaining the first results. [...] In some cases, such as with Forssmann's {{experiments}} done {{in defiance of}} official permission, results may be obtained that would never otherwise have come to light. [...] However, self-experiment lacks the statistical validity of a larger experiment. [...] It {{is not possible to}} generalise from an experiment on a single person. [...] For instance, a single successful blood transfusion does not indicate, as we now <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> work of Karl Landsteiner, that all such transfusions between any two random people will also be successful. [...] Likewise, a single failure does not absolutely prove that a procedure is worthless. [...] Psychological issues such as confirmation bias and the placebo effect are unavoidable in a single-person self-experiment where {{it is not possible to}} put scientific controls in place.|$|E

2500|$|Shakespeare’s Christianity is {{in itself}} not universally accepted. William Birch of Oxford University was, in 1848, {{probably}} the first to suggest that Shakespeare could be an atheist, based on his interpretation of sentiments expressed in the works. His theory wasn't accepted by other scholars, however, and his contemporary H. H. Furness dismissed it as a [...] "rare tissue of perverted ingenuity". Some evidence used to support this thesis was suggested by a notorious forger of historical documents, John Payne Collier, who examined the records of St Saviour's, Southwark, and found that Shakespeare, alone among his fellow Globe actors, was not shown as a churchgoer. Joseph Pearce again offers the explanation of recusancy, rather than evidence of atheism. Herbert Thurston, writing in the 1912 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia questioned not only Shakespeare's Catholicism, but pondered [...] "whether Shakespeare was not infected with the atheism, which, as we <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> testimony of writers as opposite in spirit as Thomas Nashe and [...] Persons, was rampant in the more cultured society of the Elizabethan age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hausdorff's {{entry into}} a {{thorough}} study of ordered sets was prompted {{in part by}} Cantor's continuum problem: which place does the cardinal number [...] take in the series [...] In a letter to Hilbert on 29 September 1904, he speaks of this problem, [...] "it has plagued almost like a monomania". He saw in the set [...] a new strategy to attack the problem. Cantor had suspected , but had only shown [...] [...] is the [...] "number" [...] of possible well-orderings of a countable set [...] had now emerged as the [...] "number" [...] of all possible orders of such an amount. It was natural, therefore, to study systems that are more special than general orders, but more general than well-orderings. Hausdorff did just that in his first volume of 1901 {{with the publication of}} theoretical studies of [...] "graded sets". We <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> results of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen, that this strategy to solve the continuum problem is just as ineffectual as Cantor's strategy, which was aimed at generalizing the Cantor-Bendixson principle for closed sets to general uncountable sets.|$|E
