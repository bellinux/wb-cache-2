The German word {{for them is}} , {{literally}} [...] "little sea pig", which has been translated into Polish as świnka morska, into Hungarian as tengerimalac, and into Russian as морская свинка.

40|$|India is {{endemic to}} Japanese {{encephalitis}} virus (JEV) and recurrent outbreaks occur mainly in rice growing areas. Pigs {{are considered to}} be the amplifying host for JEV and infection in gestating pigs results in reproductive failure. Most studies conducted on JEV infection in <b>Indian</b> <b>pigs</b> have been serological surveys and very little is known about JEV genotypes circulating in pigs. So the potential risk posed by pigs in JEV transmission and the genetic relationship between viruses circulating in pigs, mosquitoes and humans is poorly understood. This study was conducted in pigs with a history of reproductive failure characterized by stillborn piglets with neuropathological lesions. Japanese encephalitis (JE) suspected brain specimens inoculated intracerebrally into mice and Vero cells resulted in successful isolation of JEV/SW/IVRI/ 395 A/ 2014. Clinicopathological observations in infected mice, demonstration of JEV antigen in brain, and analysis of the envelope protein identified the swine isolate as being neurovirulent. Phylogenetic analysis based on prM and E gene sequences showed that it belonged to genotype III. This swine isolate was closely related to JEV associated with the 2005 outbreak in India and JaoArS 982 from Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of JEV strains collected between 1956 and 2014 in India categorized the GIII viruses into different clades blurring their spatial distribution, which has been discernible in the previous century. Isolation of JEV from stillborn piglets and its close genetic relationship with viruses detected at least three decades ago in humans and mosquitoes in Japan suggests that the virus may have been circulating among <b>Indian</b> <b>pigs</b> for several decades. The close similarity between the present swine isolate and those detected in humans affected in the 2005 outbreak in Uttar Pradesh, India, suggests the need for more intensive surveillance of pigs and implementation of suitable strategies to control JE in India...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Partial {{fragment}} of D-loop region extending from 35 to 770 {{were compared with}} corresponding sequences of 16 wild pigs and 9 domestic pig breeds {{from different parts of}} the world for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the region. The paper also reappraises SNP markers from two fragments of cytochrome b gene and a fragment 12 S rRNA gene distinguishing the <b>Indian</b> wild <b>pig</b> from other pig species of the world. Materials and Methods: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated from 14 and 12 tissue samples of Indian wild and domestic pigs, respectively, collected from Central India for characterization of the D-loop DNA sequences using universal primers. The sequences obtained were aligned along with the retrieved sequences to analyze species-specific SNP marker. Results: A total of 58 mitochondrial D-loop gene sequences of pig races were aligned to identify 1349 polymorphic sites in the fragment from nucleotide positions 35 - 770 bp and four SNP markers were identified to differentiate <b>Indian</b> wild <b>pig</b> from all the sequences investigated in this study. With the inclusion of cytochrome b gene and 12 S rRNA gene fragments, the present study contributes to the total 15 SNP markers, which have been identified in the mitochondrial {{fragment of}} 1936 bp for identification of <b>Indian</b> wild <b>pig.</b> Conclusion: SNP markers have advantages over other marker types and do not require subsequent standardization to compare data across studies or laboratories...|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} polymorphism of 13 microsatellites in two Indian domesticated pig types (North Indian and Northeast Indian). Heterozygosity, polymorphism information content, and {{probability of}} identity of two random individuals {{were calculated for}} all microsatellites in both types. The number of alleles observed at a locus varied between five and 12. The evaluated microsatellites exhibited a very high heterozygosity and polymorphism information content. The probability of identity of two random individuals from different populations taking into account all the 13 micro-satellites was as low as 3. 51 × 10 – 19. On {{the basis of these}} results, we propose that these microsatellite markers may be used with reliability for studying the genetic diversity and for dentification of individuals in <b>Indian</b> <b>pig</b> types...|$|E
40|$|Environmentally {{conscious}} manufacturing {{has become}} a global attention for the iron and steel manufacturers to prevent global warming and climate change while making money. Iron and steel sector is considered {{as one of the}} most polluting sectors in the world. It is also one of the most energy intensive industries. During pig iron manufacturing, there is a number of steps that affect the environment emitting different pollutants. While some step(s) may be considered critical to damage the environment among all the steps, some pollutant(s) may be considered critical to affect the environment among all the pollutants. This paper proposes environmental bottleneck to consider critical step and critical pollutant simultaneously. Unless environmental bottleneck is improved, environmental performance of the entire manufacturing process may not improve significantly even if other processes (i. e. other than environmental bottleneck) are taken care of. Thus, environmental bottleneck must be taken care of properly by the manufacturing organization to enable environmentally conscious manufacturing. Hence, a method should be developed to identify environmental bottleneck. Current research work uses Bayesian Networks (BN) to identify environmental bottleneck. The contribution of the paper is to identify the environmental bottleneck for an <b>Indian</b> <b>pig</b> iron manufacturing organization. Results suggest that carbon monoxide (CO) emission from the blast furnace is the environmental bottleneck for the current pig iron manufacturing organization. Hence, proper precautions should be considered to control the CO emission from the blast furnace...|$|E

The histopathological character of the resultant acute myocardial infarction is presented. In all, 52 pigs were used. Pretreatment of 9 pigs, with 3 as controls, with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, nialamide, 20 mg/kg daily for 2 to 4 days, suppressed the development of experimental ventricular arrhythmia and favourably influenced the ischaemic myocardium by reducing the oedema {{and the formation of}} microthrombi.

Some wildlife experts are {{of the opinion that}} the largest saltwater crocodile ever was in Bhitarkanika, measuring an estimated 23 feet (7.0 m) which could be traced from the skull preserved by the Kanika Royal Family. The crocodile was shot near Dhamara in 1926, and later its skull was preserved by the then Kanika King. Crocodile experts estimate the animal to have been between 20 feet (6.1 m) and 23 feet (7.0 m) long, as the size of the skull was measured one ninth of the total length of the body. In 2006 the park was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest white crocodile living in captivity also measuring 23 feet.

6000|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the young of wild European and <b>Indian</b> <b>pigs</b> (3/26. D. Johnson 'Sketches of Indian Field Sports' page 272. Mr. Crawfurd informs me that the same fact holds good with the wild pigs of the Malay peninsula.), {{for the first six}} months, are longitudinally banded with light-coloured stripes. This character generally disappears under domestication. The Turkish domestic pigs, however, have striped young, as have those of Westphalia, [...] "whatever may be their hue" [...] (3/27. For Turkish pigs see Desmarest 'Mammalogie' 1820 page 391. For those of Westphalia see Richardson 'Pigs, their Origin, etc.' 1847 page 41.); whether these latter pigs belong to the same curly-haired race as the Turkish swine, I do not know. The pigs which have run wild in Jamaica and the semi-feral pigs of New Granada, both those which are black and those which are black with a white band across the stomach, often extending over the back, have resumed this aboriginal character and produce longitudinally-striped young. This is likewise the case, at least occasionally, with the neglected pigs in the Zambesi settlement on the coast of Africa. (3/28. With respect to the several foregoing and following statements on feral pigs see Roulin in 'Mem. presentes par divers Savans a l'Acad.' etc. Paris tome 6 1835 page 326. It should be observed that his account does not apply to truly feral pigs; but to pigs long introduced into the country and living in a half- wild state. For the truly feral pigs of Jamaica see Gosse 'Sojourn in Jamaica' 1851 page 386; and Col Hamilton Smith in 'Nat. Library' volume 9 page 93. With respect to Africa see Livingstone 'Expedition to the Zambesi' 1865 page 153. The most precise statement with respect to the tusks of the West Indian feral boars is by P. Labat quoted by Roulin; but this author attributes the state of these pigs to descent from a domestic stock which he saw in Spain. Admiral Sulivan, R.N., had ample opportunities of observing the wild pigs on Eagle Islet in the Falklands; and he informs me that they resembled wild boars with bristly ridged backs and large tusks. The pigs which have run wild in the province of Buenos Ayres (Rengger 'Saugethiere' s. 331) have not reverted to the wild type. De Blainville 'Osteographie' page 132 refers to two skulls of domestic pigs sent from Patagonia by Al. d'Orbigny, and he states that they have the occipital elevation of the wild European boar, but that the head altogether is [...] "plus courte et plus ramassee." [...] He refers also to the skin of a feral pig from North America, and says [...] "il ressemble tout a fait a un petit sanglier, mais il est presque tout noir, et peut-etre un peu plus ramasse dans ses formes." ...|$|R
6000|$|The strange {{babirusa}} of Celebes is {{also found}} in Bouru; but in no other Moluccan island, and it is somewhat difficult to imagine how it got there. It is true that there is some approximation between the birds of the Sula Islands (where the babirusa {{is also found}}) and those of Bouru, which seems to indicate that these islands have recently been closer together, or that some intervening land has disappeared. At this time the babirusa may have entered Bouru, since it probably swims as well as its allies the pigs. These are spread all over the Archipelago, even to several of the smaller islands, and in many cases the species are peculiar. It is evident, therefore, that they have some natural means of dispersal. There is a popular idea that pigs cannot swim, but Sir Charles Lyell has shown that this is a mistake. In his [...] "Principles of Geology" [...] (10th Edit. vol. ii p. 355) he adduces evidence to show that pigs have swum many miles at sea, and are able to swim with great ease and swiftness. I have myself seen a wild pig swimming across the arm of the sea that separates Singapore from the Peninsula of Malacca, and we thus have explained the curious fact, that of all the large mammals of the <b>Indian</b> region, <b>pigs</b> alone extend beyond the Moluccas and as far as New Guinea, although it is somewhat curious that they have not found their way to Australia.|$|R

For the present study, the ovaries were collected from apparently healthy, non pregnant, cyclic and middle aged (2 to 5 years) Ankamali pigs slaughtered at civil meat processing and production centre, Frazer town, Bangalore during the month of February to May 2010. The February month was transition month from winter to summer and the month of March, April and May were considered as summer months. A total of 640 ovaries were collected and the surface antral follicles on the ovaries were classified into Group I (small, < 3 mm), Group II (medium, 3 - 6. 9 mm) and Group III follicles (large, 7 - 12 mm) {{on the basis of their}} diameter. The results of the present study revealed that the number of Group I follicles were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher compared to Group II and Group III follicles. Similarly, Group II follicles were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher compared to Group III follicles during different months of observation. An attempt was also made in the present study to find out the approximate ratio between the small, medium and large follicles wherein it was 7 : 4 : 1 during the month of February and March and it was 6 : 5 : 1 during the month of April and May.

5000|$|Lexington {{was first}} {{inhabited}} by the Delaware, Wyandot and Mohawk Indians. They used {{the hills of}} Lexington as hunting grounds and they picked berries {{on their way back}} from the hunt. The Indians were friendly with Watson when he and his family moved into the area until Watson's pig ate their baby. The Indians demanded Watson's newborn daughter, who was the first white child born in Lexington, as replacement to their own. Watson settled the argument by agreeing to give the <b>Indians</b> the <b>pig</b> instead. Watson chose to name his new home Lexington. He chose this out of respect for his father who fought in the Revolutionary War of which the first battle was fought in Lexington, Massachusetts. In 1813, Watson built a water-powered sawmill along the Clear Fork River. The mill made work easier and attracted more and more settlers. Business owners used the gristmills for their woolen and saw mills and also distilleries. The first tavern was built in 1815 by Jacob Cook. It was called [...] "Cook's Tavern" [...] and the first grocery store was built in 1825 by William Damsell. It was in 1839 that Lexington was recognized as a village by the federal government. In 1850 the railroad made its path through Lexington and this contributed to much of the business activity and travel for the settlers. Also by 1850 Lexington was booming and anyone could get anything they needed from Lexington and its resources. By 1853 there were over 50 established businesses in Lexington, many of which competed with each other. The cemetery is on land originally owned by Amariah Watson himself. It wasn't until 1857 that the village fenced it in to allow a more safe resting place. The sexton house was built in 1863 and the row of maple tress was later planted in 1889. The Lexington Square was once decorated with a Civil War Gatling gun. In 1958 the village of Lexington donated the gun to the Smithsonian Institution and it can still be found there today in Washington, D.C. A structure still standing in Lexington, Ohio from 1843 is known as the [...] "Old Stone House". It was built by James Gass and was host to many runaway slaves traveling along the Underground Railroad. The owners today believe that slaves were hidden in a secret closet. Benjamin Gass took 11-12 slaves in a wagon to Springfield Township and those slaves eventually made their way to Canada. A farm on Texter Road owned by Samuel McClure was also part of the underground railroad and George Mitchell hid slaves in his home and water-powered mill, located near the intersection of today's routes 97 and 314. Many more families in Lexington helped and hid slaves making their way to freedom. While there is no list of names there was a protracted court case against certain citizens who were charged with helping slaves.|$|R
