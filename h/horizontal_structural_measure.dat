40|$|AbstractThe Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is an {{extensive}} reference terminology with an attendant amount of complexity. It has been updated continuously and revisions {{have been released}} semi-annually to meet users’ needs and to reflect the results of quality assurance (QA) activities. Two <b>measures</b> based on <b>structural</b> features are proposed to track the effects of both natural terminology growth and QA activities based on aspects {{of the complexity of}} SNOMED CT. These two <b>measures,</b> called the <b>structural</b> density <b>measure</b> and accumulated <b>structural</b> <b>measure,</b> are derived based on two abstraction networks, the area taxonomy and the partial-area taxonomy. The measures derive from attribute relationship distributions and various concept groupings that are associated with the abstraction networks. They are used to track the trends in the complexity of structures as SNOMED CT changes over time. The measures were calculated for consecutive releases of five SNOMED CT hierarchies, including the Specimen hierarchy. The <b>structural</b> density <b>measure</b> shows that natural growth tends to move a hierarchy’s structure toward a more complex state, whereas the accumulated <b>structural</b> <b>measure</b> shows that QA processes tend to move a hierarchy’s structure toward a less complex state. It is also observed that both the structural density and accumulated <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> are useful tools to track the evolution of an entire SNOMED CT hierarchy and reveal internal concept migration within it...|$|R

50|$|Beams and joist are <b>horizontal</b> <b>structural</b> {{members that}} {{distribute}} {{the dead and}} live load from the upper floors to the load-bearing walls. The beams and joist in Gedung Kuning are made out of timber {{because it was a}} readily available material back then. It is often made of Chengal, a hardwood that is resistant to the dead load transferred from the upper floors. It is an economical material as it could be sourced locally and has enough tensile strength to carry lateral loads. Main timber beams, which are key <b>horizontal</b> <b>structural</b> members, are parallel to Kandahar Street & Sultan Gate road and span between the walls. However, there are beams and joist that run in the perpendicular direction. Those beams are usually located in the outdoor spaces such as the fiveIfootway. This suggests that the direction of beams might indicate spaces that are outdoors and public, and spaces that are more private. The beams and joist rest on ledges where the wall diminish in thickness and act as a load-bearing surface. I-beams have been introduced into structures to replace rotten timber beams but in Gedung Kuning, it is used to support the current beams. Exposed IIbeams have to be encased in concrete for fire safety as well as aesthetics reasons (Fig. 3c). Reinforced concrete beams are used to support the upper storey of the five-footway.|$|R

The deltaic region is affected by flood, drainage and salinity problems almost every year due to presence of low level escapes [...] These escapes start functioning with a flood of 17000 cumecs of undivided flood in Mahanadi at Naraj. Some part of the deltaic region is safe up to a flood of 28300 cumecs due to presence of double continuos embankments.

40|$|Different {{ethnic groups}} have evolved {{distinctive}} cultural models which guide {{their interactions with}} the environment, including their agroecosystems. Although {{it is probable that}} variations in the structures of homegardens among separate ethnic groups reflect differences in the cultural models of the farmers, empirical support for this assumption is limited. In this paper the modal <b>horizontal</b> <b>structural</b> patterns of the homegardens of 8 ethnic groups in Northeast Thailand and Vietnam are described. Six of these groups (5 speaking Tai languages and 1 speaking Vietnamese) live in close proximity to each other in separate villages in Northeast Thailand, and 2 of the groups (one Tai-speaking and one Vietnamese-speaking) live in different parts of Vietnam. Detailed information on the horizontal structure of homegardens was collected from samples of households belonging to each group. Although each ethnic group has a somewhat distinctive modal structure, the groups cluster into 2 different types. The Tai speaking Cao Lan, Kalaeng, Lao, Nyaw, and Yoy make up Type I while both of the Vietnamese groups, along with the Tai speaking Phu Thai, belong to Type II. Type I gardens have predominantly organic shapes, indeterminate boundaries, polycentric planting patterns, and multi-species composition within planting areas. Type II homegardens have geometric shapes, sharp boundaries, lineal planting patterns, and mono-species composition of planting areas. That the homegardens of most of the Tai ethnic groups share a relatively similar <b>horizontal</b> <b>structural</b> pattern that {{is quite different from the}} pattern shared by both of the Vietnamese groups suggests that the spatial layout of homegardens is strongly influenced by their different cultural models...|$|R

That means, it remains often unclear whether a particular measure is useful and feasible to solve a particular problem in network biology. Exemplarily, the classification of complex biological networks can be named, for which <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> are used leading to a minimal classification error. Hence, there is a strong need to provide freely available software packages to calculate and demonstrate the appropriate usage of <b>structural</b> graph <b>measures</b> in network biology. Results Here, we discuss topological network descriptors that are implemented in the R-package QuACN and demonstrate their behavior and characteristics by applying them to a set of example graphs. Moreover, we show a representative application to illustrate their capabilities for classifying biological networks. In particular, we infer gene regulatory networks from microarray data and classify them by methods provided by QuACN. Note that QuACN is the first freely available software written in R containing a large number of <b>structural</b> graph <b>measures.</b> Conclusion The R package QuACN is under ongoing development and we add promising groups of topological network descriptors continuously.

The {{aim is to}} extrapolate and predict the bone loss, to provide test objects for newly developed <b>structural</b> <b>measures,</b> and to understand the physical mechanisms behind the bone alteration. Our bone model approach differs from those already {{reported in the literature}} by two features. First, we work with original bone images, obtained by computed tomography (CT); second, we use <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> of complexity to evaluate bone resorption and to compare it with the data provided by CT. This gives us the possibility to test algorithms of bone resorption by comparing their results with experimentally found dependencies of <b>structural</b> <b>measures</b> of complexity, as well as to show efficiency of the complexity measures in the analysis of bone models. For 2 -dimensional images we suggest two algorithms, a threshold algorithm and a virtual slicing algorithm. The threshold algorithm simulates bone resorption on a boundary between bone and marrow, representing an activity of osteoclasts. The virtual slicing algorithm uses a distribution of the bone material between several virtually created slices to achieve statistically correct results, when the bone-marrow transition is not clearly defined.
