40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} need for new non-destructive assay instruments capable of quantifying the fissile isotopic composition of spent nuclear fuel and of independently verifying the declared amounts of special nuclear materials at various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. High-energy delayed gamma-ray spectroscopy can provide the ability to directly assay fissile and <b>fertile</b> <b>isotopes</b> in the highly radioactive environment of the spent fuel assemblies and to achieve the safeguards goal of measuring nuclear material inventories for spent fuel handling, interim storage, reprocessing facilities, and final disposal and repository sites. The delayed gamma-ray assay concept is investigated within this context with the objective of assessing whether the delayed gamma-ray assay instrument can provide sufficient sensitivity, isotope specificity and accuracy as required in nuclear material safeguards applications. Preliminary system design analysis indicates that the delayed gamma-ray response is affected by multiple parameters: type and intensity of the interrogating source, the configuration of the interrogation setup, the time pattern of the interrogation, and the resolution and count rate limit of the gamma-ray detection system. In order to handle the variety of factors associated with the delayed gamma-ray assay of spent nuclear fuel, a high-fidelity response modeling technique is introduced. The new algorithm seamlessly combines transport calculations with analytical decay/depletion, and discrete gamma-ray source reconstruction codes. Its performance was benchmarked in the dedicated experimental campaign involving accelerator-driven photo-neutron sources and samples containing fissile and <b>fertile</b> <b>isotopes.</b> Analytical estimations of the intensity of the delayed gamma-ray response and the passive background rate are utilized to develop a concept of the non-destructive instrument for the assay of spent nuclear fuel. The modeling technique is then applied to more detailed parametric study. These simulations included extensive spent fuel inventories, and accounted for realistic assay configurations and instrumentation. The results of this preliminary analysis indicate that the delayed gamma-ray assay of spent nuclear fuel assemblies can be performed with available neutron generator and detection technology. The sensitivity of the delayed gamma-ray spectra to the actinide content of the spent nuclear fuel is investigated. The simplest analysis of the delayed gamma-ray response is based on the analysis of integrated count rates and peak ratios. More powerful analytical and numerical methods are likely needed for determining the relative concentrations of fissile and <b>fertile</b> <b>isotopes</b> in samples with complex compositions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} willing to {{illustrate}} and quantify {{the impact of a}} double fission barrier in terms of average fission cross section and in particular, to status on both the additional class-II width correction factor and the degree of freedom of the overall double fission barrier which is a key parameter in the calculation of the standard Wn, f factor of Hauser-Feshbach theory. 1 Problematic related to average fission cross section simulation The purpose of this communication is to both recall and emphasize the existence of the class-II state width fluctuation factor, WII, whose treatment is usually disregarded in standard average cross section evaluation codes. The impact of fission channel Intermediate Structures (IS) is well pictured by Fig. 1 which displayed the observed and current evaluated fission cross sections within the neutron-incident Unresolved Resonance energy Range (URR) for a fissile and a <b>fertile</b> <b>isotope</b> borrowed from the plutonium family. Below the fission threshold energy (En < 500 keV), we observe large manifestations of the IS (Fig. 1 - right side), relatively to the fission cross section magnitude, although IS effects show up as well for fissile isotopes (Fig. 1 - left side). We guess that more complexity in the classically [1] used URR fission cross section model will be required for a <b>fertile</b> <b>isotope</b> but are we allowed to make some approximations for a fissile isotope without collateral damage? This is the question raised by this paper. In the next sections, the impact of both the barrier tunneling and WII factor for fissile and fertile isotopes is clarified using a new way of calculating the inextricably admixed IS and WII effects based on accurate formal R-matrix Monte-Carlo-fashion calculations which have been recently applied to the whole plutonium family in a consistent and macro-microscopic approach [2]. 2 Standard Hauser-Feshbach formalism Reaction cross-sections in the URR are commonly calculated using standard Hauser-Feshbach the-ory [7].

40|$|Poster {{presented}} at Idaho National Laboratory for the 2014 Fuel Cycle Technologies Annual Review Meeting. Plutonium is currently used for nuclear energy {{production in the}} form of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel in a once-through cycle. The spent fuel from these burnup cycles is then discarded as nuclear waste. MOX fuel burnup, however, transmutes some uranium into additional fissile plutonium, which can be extracted and remixed into new burnable MOX fuel. One can, in principle, repeat this process throughout multiple iterations, extracting more energy from nuclear fuel and diminishing the accumulation of plutonium in nuclear waste stockpiles. While the cost of reprocessing MOX fuel remains constant throughout recycling iterations, the isotopic composition of plutonium will change as fissile isotopes of plutonium are used up during MOX fuel burnup, while <b>fertile</b> <b>isotopes</b> accumulate. This isotopic drift will also change the neutronics properties of the MOX fuel made out of the recycled plutonium, which may limit the number of times one may recycle plutonium in such a fuel cycle.

40|$|Currently, {{commercial}} power reactors in the United States {{operate on}} a once-through or open cycle, with the spent nuclear fuel eventually destined for long-term storage in a geologic repository. Since the fissile and transuranic (TRU) elements in the spent nuclear fuel present a proliferation risk, limit the repository capacity, and are the major contributors to the long-term toxicity and dose from the repository, methods and systems are needed {{to reduce the amount}} of TRU that will eventually require long-term storage. An option to achieve a reduction in the amount, and modify the isotopic composition of TRU requiring geological disposal is ‘burning’ the TRU in commercial light water reactors (LWRs) and/or fast reactors. Fuel forms under consideration for TRU destruction in light water reactors (LWRs) include mixed-oxide (MOX), advanced mixed-oxide, and inert matrix fuels. Fertile-free inert matrix fuel (IMF) has been proposed for use in many forms and studied by several researchers.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the Task 3, defined in working program as: evaluation of burnable poison designs. Adopting the basic design of a standard PWR and Pu loadings required for 18 -month cycle (results of Task 2), this part of the program is aimed to estimate performance of each BP design and BP material to address challenges of Fertile-Free Fuel (FFF) Concept. Finally, an optimal BP design will be developed and an overall feasibility of FFF concept will be determined. Basically, the main challenge encountered in neutronic design for a FFF core is to develop reactivity control system which is capable to satisfy performance and safety criteria of existing PWR plants. Heavy Pu loadings combined with absence of <b>fertile</b> <b>isotopes</b> with capture resonances result in low reactivity worth of existing control mechanisms and inadequate temperature coefficients. The main solution adopted by several previous design efforts is based on increased content of BP materials with capture resonances. The BP designs proposed and analyzed in previous designs are based on such elements as: Gd, Hf, and Er, located in fuel cell, either as a homogeneous mixture or as a thin ring (IFBA-type geometry). This approach results in a large residual reactivity penalty due to an incomplete burnup of the BP material (especially Hf and Er). Description and parameters of the BP designs considered in this work are presented in section II. In this report, an extensive set of calculations was carried out to assess the potential of the main BP materials - B, Gd, Hf, and Er, utilized in three main geometrical arrangements: Wet Annular Burnable Absorber (WABA) type, Integral Fuel Burnable Absorber (IFBA) type, and Homogeneous fuel-BP mixture. Heavy loadings of BP materials in non-standard geometries combined with high Pu content in a fertile-free matrix necessitated additional verification of the calculational tools. Verification of the calculational modeling and parameters are presented in section III. A full scope of calculations is presented in section IV of this report. All cases are arranged according to geometry-type and BP material. The results and analysis of these calculations, presented and summarized in Section V, serve as a basis for a comprehensive assessment of BP potential to address challenges of the FFF concepts. Three main performance parameters of the BP designs will be evaluated: 1. Maximum critical soluble boron concentration (CBC) required during the cycle, 2. Acceptable fuel and moderator temperature coefficients (will be evaluated in Task 4), 3. Residual reactivity penalty associated with incomplete depletion of the BP materia...|$|R

A number of these advantages stem from its unique fuel design, consisting of a stochastic mixture of tiny (0. 78 mm diameter) microspheres with multiple coatings. However, the microsphere fuel regions represent point absorbers for resonance energy neutrons, resulting in the "double heterogeneity" for particle fuel. Special {{care must be taken}} to analyze this fuel in order to predict the spatial and spectral dependence of the neutron population in a steady-state reactor configuration. The challenges are considerable and resist brute force computation: there are over 1010 microspheres in a typical reactor configuration, with no hope of identifying individual microspheres in this stochastic mixture. Moreover, when individual microspheres "deplete" (e. g., burn the fissile isotope U- 235 or transmute the <b>fertile</b> <b>isotope</b> U- 238 (eventually) to Pu- 239), the stochastic time-dependent nature of the depletion compounds the difficulty posed by the stochastic spatial mixture of the fuel, resulting in a prohibitive computational challenge.

40|$|Transmutation of {{the legacy}} TRansUranics (TRU) from Light Water Reactor {{operation}} has become in recent years a main objective {{for the development of}} Fast Reactors (FR). In fact, an effective TRU-burning requires fuel multi-recycling and a fast-neutron-spectrum reduces the endogenous generation of Cm and Cf isotopes, thus benefitting fuel handling and in-core radiotoxicity generation. However, achievement of high TRU-burning rates requires low-Conversion-Ratio (CR) reactors with a high fraction of Minor Actinides (MA) in the core, requiring remote fuel fabrication behind thick shielding. Problems of fuel handling are exacerbated if Th is used as <b>fertile</b> <b>isotope</b> (e. g. to enhance safety or TRU-burning rate), since Th- 232 irradiation causes the build-up of U- 232, whose progeny emits high energy gamma rays. Use of a liquid fuel with online reprocessing would avoid most of the issues related to reprocessing, manufacturing and transporting highly radioactive recycled fuel. The logical technology for the adoption of liquid fuel is the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR). Among MSRs, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is in principle better suited for TRU burning as it combines the advantages of a liquid fuel with those of a fast-spectrum and of Th use. Objective of this work is to evaluate the MSFR potential benefits in terms of TRU burning through a comparative analysis with a sodium-cooled FR. The comparison is based on TRU- and MA-burning rates, {{as well as on the}} in-core evolution of radiotoxicity and decay heat. Solubility issues limit the TRU-burning rate to 1 / 3 that achievable in traditional low-CR FRs. The softer spectrum also determines notable radiotoxicity and decay heat of the equilibrium actinide inventory. On the other hand, the liquid fuel suggests the possibility of using a Pu- free feed composed only of Th and MA, thus maximizing the MA burning rate. This is generally not possible in traditional low-CR FRs due to safety deterioration and decay heat of reprocessed fuel. In addition, the high specific power and the lack of out-of-core cooling times foster a quick transition toward equilibrium, which improves the MSFR capability to burn an initial fissile loading, and makes the MSFR a promising system for a quick (i. e., in a reactor lifetime) transition from the current U-based fuel cycle to a novel closed Th cycle...|$|E

The primary <b>fertile</b> and fissile <b>isotopes</b> $sup 232 $Th, $sup 233 $U, $sup 235 $U, $sup 238 $U, and $sup 239 $Pu are excluded from this survey. Integral data, i. e., spectrum-averaged thermal cross sections and resonance integrals, are included, but the emphasis is placed on energy-dependent differential cross sections because of their general utility with any specified neutron energy spectrum. Included with the data summaries are an extensive survey of the literature through August 1975, brief descriptions of measurements known to be in progress or firmly planned for the immediate future, and recommendations for needed measurements.
