25|$|The two {{competing}} theories concerning {{the origins of}} reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, {{as opposed to being}} simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by Karl Marx, a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.|$|E

25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{the wide}} {{understanding}} of culture brought about by cultural anthropology, archeology and biology, Mosterín has developed a new philosophical understanding of what culture is, where it is localized and how it evolves in time. <b>Human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> information, and so is human culture, but both are distinguished by their different means of transmission: whereas nature is transmitted genetically and is encoded in the genome, culture is transmitted through social learning and is encoded in the brain. Only individuals have a brain, and only they have a culture. Talk of collective cultures has {{to be understood as}} a statistical artifact for talking about a plurality of individual cultures. The set of elementary chunks of culture (variously known as memes, cultural variants or cultural traits) codified as neuronal circuits in the long term memory of the individual make up that individual’s culture. Corresponding to the different uses of ‘culture’ in ordinary and scientific language, Mosterín defines several notions of collective culture, going from the cultural pool (the union of the cultures of all individuals of the group) to the unanimous culture (the intersection of all those cultures). In 2009 he has completed a thoroughgoing analysis of the forces driving cultural change, paying special attention to the role of Internet and other factors of information technology. He considers that preserving the freedom and efficiency of Internet is crucial for the future thriving of human culture.|$|E

500|$|The {{setting of}} the book has been {{described}} as dystopian. However, it is presented by Heinlein as utopian; its leaders are shown as good and wise, and the population as free and prosperous. Slusser wrote in 1987 that Starship Troopers depicts a world that is [...] "hell for human beings", but nonetheless celebrates the ideology of its fictional society. The rulers are claimed to be the best in history, because they understand that <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> to fight for power through the use of force. The suggestion of utopia is not explored in depth, as the lives of those outside the military are not shown in any detail. The novel suggests that the militarist philosophy espoused by many of the characters has a mathematical backing, though reviewers have commented that Heinlein does not present any basis for this.|$|E
500|$|As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is {{a metaphor}} for the evil that is so hard to undo in history."

As Michael Dirda explains in The Washington Post, the novel conveys the idea that [...] "Most of history's worst nightmares result from an unthinking obedience to authority, high-minded zealotry seductively overriding our mere humanity." [...] It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this, since [...] "our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing ourselves, of relinquishing our very identities as human beings". In fact, the narrator is never named in the novel, suggesting, as one critic explains, [...] "that the quest for the dark side of <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> more universal than specific to a concrete character".|$|E

A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I was disappointed. <b>Human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> that you'd rather win than lose, but Jethro Tull walking away with it makes a huge mockery of {{the intentions of the}} event."

"Last Gasp" [...] was {{inspired}} by someone Pemberton had seen on children's programme Multi-Coloured Swap Shop who collected apparently empty jars which actually contained air taken from different places.

The death of Michael Jackson {{and the death of}} Amy Winehouse, along with the associated collecting of memorabilia, also served as inspiration. For Pemberton, the family and house in [...] "Last Gasp" [...] were very [...] "normal". The episode was filmed on location in what director David Kerr called an [...] "utterly freezing" [...] house. The finished episode, for Kerr, had a degree of [...] "suburban darkness" [...] in that, though the events unfold in a relatively unremarkable setting, the darker side of <b>human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> revealed.

500|$|Chrysippus {{taught that}} ethics {{depended}} on physics. In his Physical Theses, he stated: [...] "for {{there is no}} other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe." [...] The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature. A person's individual nature is part {{of the nature of the}} whole universe, and thus life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature as well as that of the universe. <b>Human</b> <b>nature</b> <b>is</b> ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly. People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason. Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.|$|E
