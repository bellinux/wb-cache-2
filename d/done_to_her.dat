She explains that she files all the unsolved cases under X because there is more room under X than U. Gissing's body is still in the morgue and Dales convinces the technician to cut open the body where they find a strange creature has been sewn into Gissing's chest. Dales goes to Skur's wife and tells her what was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband and that he wants to expose the experiments.

The next major refit ran from April 1975 to June 1976, and was intended to increase the operational lifespan of the carrier to at least 1985. The refit was lengthened by industrial action at the dockyard. Melbourne underwent another refit from late 1978 until August 1979. A refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed in September until a decision regarding the new carrier was made, then cancelled in January 1982, after the announcement that the RAN would be acquiring HMS Invincible.|$|E

5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E

Otherwise, the scripting process was [...] "smooth". The read-through for [...] "Hide" [...] took place on 21 May 2012; filming began three days later, on the 24th. Scenes for the mansion were filmed at Margam Country Park in June. Tyntesfield, a National Trust property near Bristol {{was used as the}} mansion. The scenes in the forest were filmed in the Gethin Forest in Wales, with artificial mist. The Crooked Man's movements were done in reverse and then played forward, to give it an unnatural movement. Director Jamie Payne had Cross's children be [...] "monster consultants" [...] during filming and evaluate if it was scary enough.|$|E
500|$|James and Mona Rocha {{argued that}} while [...] "Veronica showed poor {{judgment}} in the episode, {{the blame for}} her rape should not be put on her—instead, Dick, Logan, Sean, Dick, and Cassidy (Beaver) should take the blame. Responsibility and blame aren't zero-sum reckonings, such that adding to one person's blame automatically subtracts it from someone else's." [...] Regarding Logan, they stated that [...] "she wouldn't have been raped, if not for Logan's buying the GHB." [...] On Dick, they wrote that [...] "Dick didn't intend to drug Veronica, but he did intend to drug someone." [...] The pair argued that Veronica made some choices that were causally related to her rape, but they concluded {{that she did not}} deserve blame. [...] "If someone like Veronica makes a bad prudential choice that causes her harm, then maybe she should blame herself, but we can't blame her for any moral wrong <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as a result. She may have acted foolishly, but that was within her rights." ...|$|E
500|$|Memer in turn {{has a deep}} {{hatred of}} the Alds, vowing [...] "I will always hate the Alds, and I will drive them out of Ansul, and kill them all if I can". Her anger arises from the {{enslavement}} of her city and the hurt <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> loved ones, but also from her mixed heritage: in anger she often refers to herself in derogatory terms such as [...] "half-breed". Her hatred prevents her from engaging with the Alds in any way: she continually refers {{to them in a}} negative manner, and when it is suggested that she attend Orrec's performance for the Gand, is initially reluctant because she wants nothing to do with them. Thus she rejects the Alds in a manner ultimately similar to their rejection of the culture and belief of Ansul. Yet {{by the end of the}} story Memer grows into an acceptance of the Alds and the notion of coexistence with them, even as she grows into her own identity as the reader of the Oracle.|$|E
