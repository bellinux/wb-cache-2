40|$|Many {{vibration}} problems {{involve a}} <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> excitation {{such as those}} of a triangular or rectangular waveform. In practice, the periodic excitation may become disordered due to uncertainties. This paper presents a stochastic model for <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> excitations with random disturbance, which is constructed by introducing random amplitude and phase disturbances to individual terms in the Fourier series of the corresponding deterministic periodic function. Mean square convergence of the random Fourier series are discussed. Monte Carlo simulation of disordered sawtooth, triangular, and quadratic wave forms are illustrated. An application of the excitation is demonstrated by vibration analysis of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) hydraulic valve system subjected to a disordered periodic fluid pressure. In the present study only the phase disturbance is considered. Effects of the intensity of phase modulation on up to fourth order moment response and the convergence rate of the random Fourier series are studied by numerical results. It is found that a small random disturbance in a <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> excitation may significantly change the response moment. 1...|$|R

The periodic source model in this paper is thus rather general. Taking initial state conditions of the periodic sources into account, we construct a superposed arn’val process. Contrary to the previous works, this implies that the periodic sources are not independent. We also provide examples to investigate the eficiency and the accuracy of our bound formulas. ...|$|R

40|$|Periodic unit-cells are the {{premises}} for applying the periodic boundary {{conditions in the}} meso-scale finite element analysis of textile composites. However, due to the extremely complicated microstructure, there is a conflict between high-quality quick mesh generation and efficient application of periodic boundary conditions. A freely generated mesh of the unit-cell combined with more <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> boundary conditions {{is assumed to be}} a more practical approach. In this paper, the <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> boundary conditions are imposed by establishing linear constraint equations between master surface nodes and slave surface nodes of the unit-cell on ABAQUS software platform. For the same unit-cell model of 3 D braided composites with periodic mesh and free mesh, the deformation, stress distribution and the predicted stiffness and strength properties under typical loadings are compared. The numerical results obtained by means of free mesh unit-cell agree well with those using periodic mesh proving the effectiveness and practicability of the new approach. It can be remarked that the <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> boundary conditions are suitable for the free mesh generation of unit-cells for a complicated microstructure reducing the difficulty of meshing and improving the quality of mesh generation...|$|R

An SEIRS epidemic model with <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> vaccination strategy is analysed.

The primary goal of this thesis is to give a comprehensive review of existing analytical expressions for the system fill rate, and provide numerical comparison for all relevant expressions in terms of their accuracy against (simulated) fill rate from the Monte Carlo simulation. We prove relationships between several expressions. Although majority of the expressions discussed herein are designed for standard periodic review system, we conduct numerical simulations for the <b>general</b> <b>periodic</b> review system.
