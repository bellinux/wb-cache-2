The following results are reported: (1) With only a single small entrance, the fanning is controlled so as to induce tidal ventilation of the nest as in a typical breathing pattern. (2) Periodic active fanning moves an air current out followed by a passive influx of air. (3) <b>Fanning</b> <b>bees</b> how negative phototaxis. (4) The colonial respiratory activity decreases atnight following a pronounced ay-night cycle. Key Word Index: Apis mellifera, social hehaviour, ventilation, respiration, circadian rhythm tNTRODUCT’ION Honey bees (A @ melrifera L.) exist in perennial social colonies in which the tasks of survival are carried out by groups of individuals. As in other eusocial insects, the workers regulate their nest envi-ronment through cooperative social activities. In nests of social termites, the internal environment is controlled by an elaborate ventilation system con-structed by the workers that allows for cooling air currents to protect the colony from overheating (Jackson, 1957; Loos, 1964; Luescher, 1955, 1961; Ruelle, 1964). Honey bee colonies maintain viable atmospheres within their nests by fanning behaviour of individual bees for ventilation. This fanning be-haviour aids the control of temperature and humidity as well as concentration of respiratory gases withi...|$|R
40|$|Interindividual {{variability}} {{in response to}} environmental stimuli {{is believed to have}} a major impact on collective behaviors in social insects. The present study presents a detailed investigation of the {{variability in}} individual fanning behavior underlying the collective control of nest climate in bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies. Four colonies were repeatedly exposed to increasing temperature and CO-sub- 2 levels. The response threshold of each worker (defined as the mean stimulus intensity at which a worker responded by fanning) was determined. Temperature response thresholds of 118 workers and CO-sub- 2 response thresholds of 88 workers were analyzed. Workers differed in their response thresholds. Some consistently responded to low stimulus intensities, others consistently responded to high stimulus intensities. No consistent correlation between temperature and CO-sub- 2 thresholds was found within individuals. Response thresholds of <b>fanning</b> <b>bees</b> decreased over successive trials, providing empirical support for the idea of specialization through individual threshold reinforcement. In addition to variability in individual response thresholds, workers of a colony differed in two other parameters of responsiveness: response probability (the probability of responding to a stimulus once it exceeded an individual's response threshold) and response duration (the persistency with which fanning was performed once an individual responded). The results of the present study suggest that response threshold, response probability and response duration are important independent parameters of individual responsiveness in the collective control of nest climate in bumblebee colonies.

40|$|Sodium channels, found ubiquitously {{in animal}} muscle cells and neurons, {{are one of}} the main target sites of many naturally-occurring, insecticidal plant {{compounds}} and agricultural pesticides. Pyrethroids, derived from compounds found only in the Asteraceae, are particularly toxic to insects and have been successfully used as pesticides including on flowering crops that are visited by pollinators. Pyrethrins, from which they were derived, occur naturally in the nectar of some flowering plant species. We know relatively little about how such compounds [...] i. e., compounds that target sodium channels [...] influence pollinators at low or sub-lethal doses. Here, we exposed individual adult forager honeybees to several compounds that bind to sodium channels to identify whether these compounds affect motor function. Using an assay previously developed to identify the effect of drugs and toxins on individual bees, we investigated how acute exposure to 10 ng doses (1 ppm) of the pyrethroid insecticides (cyfluthrin, tau-fluvalinate, allethrin and permethrin) and the nectar toxins (aconitine and grayanotoxin I) affected honeybee locomotion, grooming and wing <b>fanning</b> behaviour. <b>Bees</b> exposed to these compounds spent more time upside down and fanning their wings. They also had longer bouts of standing still. Bees exposed to the nectar toxin, aconitine, and the pyrethroid, allethrin, also spent less time grooming their antennae. We also found that the concentration of the nectar toxin, grayanotoxin I (GTX), fed to bees affected the time spent upside down (i. e., failure to perform the righting reflex). Our data show that low doses of pyrethroids and other nectar toxins that target sodium channels mainly influence motor function through their effect on the righting reflex of adult worker honeybees...|$|R
40|$|A colmeia Langstroth traz em seu modelo {{original}} uma tampa interna, localizada imediatamente abaixo da tampa que serviria para auxiliar as abelhas na termoregulaÃÃo do ninho. No Brasil, essa tampa interna foi retirada dos componentes da colmeia sob a alegaÃÃo de que o paÃs Ã tropical e a tampa interna se tornaria desnecessÃria, sem que estudos tenham sido conduzidos a esse respeito. O presente estudo se propÃs a investigar o papel da tampa interna da colmeia Langstroth na homeostase de colÃnias de abelhas africanizadas Apis mellifera no perÃodo de estiagem no SemiÃrido nordestino. O estudo foi realizado nos meses de outubro e novembro de 2012, no SÃtio CanafÃstula do BixopÃ, Distrito de BixopÃ, municÃpio de Limoeiro do Norte-CE. O experimento constou de 10 colmeias sem tampa interna (T 1) e 10 colmeias com tampa interna (T 2), nas quais se registraram temperatura e umidade relativa no interior das colmeias, a ventilaÃÃo (intensidade e nÃmero de operÃrias ventilando), coleta de Ãgua (nÃmero de abelhas coletoras por horÃrio, nÃmero de viagens por abelha, intervalo entre as viagens e tempo gasto para coleta), bem como o consumo das reservas de alimento entre as colmeias dos dois tratamentos. Os resultados mostraram que houve diferenÃa significativa (p< 0, 05) para a temperatura e umidade relativa no interior das colmeias, com as mÃdias diferindo estatisticamente entre T 1 (32, 08 Â 0, 27 ÂC e 53, 23 Â 0, 62 %) e T 2 (31, 60 Â 0, 33 ÂC e 54, 96 Â 0, 75 %). Os dados de intensidade de ventilaÃÃo, e o nÃmero de abelhas ventilando nÃo diferiram entre os tratamentos T 1 (20, 65 Â 0, 77 mm e 0, 62 Â 0, 14 abelhas) e T 2 (20, 27 Â 0, 86 mm e 0, 3 Â 0, 06 abelhas). Na coleta de Ãgua, houve diferenÃa estatÃstica nos horÃrios de 11 : 00, 15 : 00 e 16 : 00, nos tratamentos T 1 (16, 25 Â 2, 05, 18, 25 Â 2, 28 e 14, 00 Â 1, 35) e T 2 (8, 25 Â 1, 88, 12, 25 Â 0, 62 e 9, 75 Â 0, 75), como tambÃm no tempo gasto para a coleta de Ãgua (T 1 = 34, 86 Â 0, 56 s e T 2 = 37, 64 Â 0, 63 s). O nÃmero de viagens/abelha/dia diferiu nos tratamentos T 1 e T 2 somente entre os quartis I e II (Q 1 T 1 : 11, 25 Â 4, 52; Q 2 T 1 : 35, 5 Â 22, 22; Q 1 T 2 : 4 Â 1, 71; Q 2 T 2 : 25, 5 Â 15, 28), para o teste de Man-Whitney. No intervalo entre viagens houve diferenÃa estatÃstica somente nos quartis I, II e IV dos tratamentos T 1 (Q 1 T 1 : 6 Â 5, 13; Q 2 T 1 : 8 Â 7, 41 e Q 4 T 1 : 97 Â 23, 50 min) e T 2 (Q 1 T 2 : 5, 25 Â 3, 94; Q 2 T 2 : 8 Â 6, 94 e Q 4 T 2 : 272 Â 82, 29 min) para o teste de Man-Whitney. A mÃdia de consumo da reserva de alimento nÃo diferiu entre tratamentos, sendo 177, 7 Â 29, 9 g em T 1 e 141, 8 Â 13, 8 g em T 2. Conclui-se que a tampa interna da colmeia Langstroth propicia que as abelhas dessas colmeias consigam melhores condiÃÃes de homeostase interna do ninho desprendendo menor esforÃo que aquelas de colmeias sem tampa interna. The Langstroth hive has {{its original}} model in an inner lid, {{just below the}} lid which would serve to assist the bees in the nest thermoregulation. In Brazil, the inner cover {{was removed from the}} hive components {{on the grounds that the}} country is tropical and the inner cover would become unnecessary, but no study has been done in this direction. The present study aims to investigate the role of the inner cover of the hive Langstroth homeostasis of Africanized bee colonies Apis mellifera in the dry season in the Caatinga in Limoeiro Norte-CearÃ. The survey was conducted in October and November 2012 at the site of CanafÃstula BixopÃ, District BixopÃ, in the city of Limoeiro do Norte, state of CearÃ. The experiment consisted of 10 hives without inner cover (T 1) and 10 hives with inner cover (T 2), in which he recorded temperature and relative humidity in the hives, ventilation (intensity and number of workers fanning), water harvesting (number of collecting bees by time, number of trips per bee, interval between the journeys and time spent for collection), and the consumption of food reserves from the hives of the two treatments. The results showed a significant difference (p < 0. 05) for temperature and relative humidity in the hives, with averages differing significantly between T 1 (32. 08 Â 0, 27 ÂC and 53. 23 Â 0. 62 %) and T 2 (31. 60 Â 0, 33 ÂC and 54. 96 Â 0. 75 %). The intensity data of ventilation, and the number of <b>fanning</b> <b>bees</b> did not differ between T 1 (20. 65 Â 0. 77 mm and 0. 62 Â 0. 14 bees) and T 2 (20. 27 Â 0. 86 mm and treatments 0. 3 Â 0. 06 bees). In collecting water, there was no statistical difference in the times of 11 : 00, 15 : 00 and 16 : 00 in T 1 (16. 25 Â 2. 05, 18. 25 Â 2. 28 and 14. 00 Â 1. 35 treatments) and T 2 (8. 25 Â 1. 88, 12. 25 Â 0. 62 and 9. 75 Â 0. 75), as well as the time spent collecting water (T 1 = 34. 86 Â 0. 56 s and T 2 = 37. 64 Â 0. 63 s). The number of trips / bee / day differed between the T 1 and T 2 only between quartiles I and II (Q 1 T 1 : 11. 25 Â 4. 52; Q 2 T 1 : 35. 5 Â 22. 22; Q 1 T 2 : 4 Â 1. 71, Q 2 T 2 : 25. 5 Â 15. 28), for the Man-Whitney test. In between trips was no statistical difference only in quartiles I, II and IV of T 1 treatments (Q 1 T 1 : 6 Â 5. 13; Q 2 T 1 : 8 Â 7. 41 and Q 4 T 1 : 97 Â 23. 50 min) and T 2 (Q 1 T 2 : 5. 25 Â 3. 94; Q 2 T 2 : 8 Â 6. 94 and Q 4 T 2 : 272 Â 82. 29 min) for the Man-Whitney test. The average consumption of food supply did not differ between treatments, being in T 1 177. 7 Â 29. 9 g and 141. 8 Â 3. 8 g in T 2. We conclude that the inner cover of the hive Langstroth provides that these bees hives achieve better conditions of internal homeostasis of the nest giving off less effort than those of hives without inner cover in conditions of the Limoeiro do Norte, CearÃ...|$|R
