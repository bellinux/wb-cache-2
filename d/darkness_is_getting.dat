60|$|Margery could {{distinctly}} see the Chippewa, erect {{and bound}} to his tree. On him she principally kept her looks riveted, for near his person did she expect first again {{to find the}} bee-hunter. Indeed, {{there was no chance}} of seeing one who was placed beneath the light of the fire, since the brow of the acclivity formed a complete cover, throwing all below it into deep shade. This circumstance was of the greatest importance to the adventurer, however, enabling him to steal quite near to his friend, favored by a <b>darkness</b> that <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> to <b>be</b> intense. Quitting Margery, we will now rejoin le Bourdon, who by this time was approaching his goal.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{decision}} of Captain Crutchely was made, the helm was put up, and the ship kept off to her course. It was true, that under double-reefed topsails, and jib, which was all the canvas set, there was not half the danger {{there would have been}} under their former sail; and, when Mark took charge of the watch, as he did soon after, or eight o'clock, he was in hopes, by means of vigilance, still to escape the danger. The <b>darkness,</b> which <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> to <b>be</b> very intense, was now the greatest and most immediate source of his apprehensions. Could he only get a glimpse of the sea a cable's-length ahead, he would have felt vast relief; but even that small favour was denied him. By the time the captain and second-mate had turned in, which each did after going below and taking a stiff glass of rum and water in his turn, it was so dark our young mate could not discern the combing of the waves a hundred yards from the ship, in any direction. This obscurity was owing to the drizzle that filled the atmosphere, {{as well as to the}} clouds that covered the canopy above that lone and wandering ship.|$|R

5000|$|In 2004, Jim Emerson {{wrote that}} Prince of <b>Darkness</b> <b>was</b> an undervalued horror film: [...] "What makes me goose-pimply about Prince of <b>Darkness</b> <b>is</b> its goofy-but-ingenious central conceit and its truly Surrealistic imagery, {{some of which}} could have sprouted out of Buñuel and Dali's Un Chien Andalou." ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: At first glance, <b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> {{merely the}} absence of light, and is {{therefore}} negative; hence the traditional equation of night with death, evil and the creatures of the underworld. But a closer study will reveal that <b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> also a positive force; examples can be cited from various cultures where <b>darkness</b> <b>was</b> thought to have given birth to light. The subterranean is the realm of fertility; the worshippers of Dionysius realised this, as did the followers of the world-wide cult of the Great Earth Mother. The realm of <b>darkness</b> <b>is</b> also the habitat of the mystic. In this essay, we will attempt to define the nature of nocturnal imagery, and to trace the various ways in which mankind has sought to reconcile himself with the powers of darkness...|$|R
60|$|That afternoon, as Mrs. Cliff {{happened}} to be in her dining-room, she remarked to Willy that it <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> dark very early, but she would not pull up the blind of the side window, because she would then look out on the new cellar, and she had promised Mr. Burke not to look at anything until he had told her to do so. Willy, who had looked out of the side door at least fifty times that day, knew that the early <b>darkness</b> <b>was</b> caused by the shadows thrown by a large building slowly approaching from the west.|$|R
