50|$|The {{compound}} is {{the lowest}} mass member of the <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (HFC) family, compounds which contain only hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. These {{are related to the}} Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)s, but since they do not contain chlorine, are not destructive to the ozone layer.|$|E
2500|$|The interim {{replacements}} for CFCs are hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which deplete stratospheric ozone, {{but to a}} much lesser extent than CFCs.

[...] DuPont began producing <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> as alternatives to Freon in the 1980s. These included Suva refrigerants and Dymel propellants. Natural refrigerants are climate friendly solutions that are enjoying increasing support from large companies and governments interested in reducing global warming emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning. <b>Hydrofluorocarbons</b> {{are included in the}} Kyoto Protocol because of their very high Global Warming Potential and are facing calls to be regulated under the Montreal Protocol due to the recognition of halocarbon contributions to climate change.|$|R

50|$|Several inhaled general {{anesthetic}} agents, {{including the}} most commonly used inhaled agents, also contain fluorine. The first fluorinated anesthetic agent, halothane, proved to be much safer (neither explosive nor flammable) and longer-lasting than those previously used. Modern fluorinated anesthetics are longer-lasting still and almost insoluble in blood, which accelerates the awakening. Examples include sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane, and isoflurane, all <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> derivatives.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydrofluorocarbons</b> are {{powerful}} greenhouse gases developed by industry after the phase-out {{of the ozone}} depleting chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons required by the Montreal Protocol. The climate benefit of reducing the emissions of <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> has been widely recognised, leading to an amendment of the Montreal Protocol (Kigali Amendment) calling for developed countries to start to phase-down <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> by 2019 and in developing countries to follow with a freeze between 2024 and 2028. In this way, nearly half a degree Celsius of warming would be avoided {{by the end of}} the century. <b>Hydrofluorocarbons</b> are also included in the basket of gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Annex I parties to the Convention submit annual national greenhouse gas inventories based on a bottom-up approach, which relies on declared anthropogenic activities. Top-down methodologies, based on atmospheric measurements and modelling, can be used in support to the inventory compilation. In this study we used atmospheric data from four European sites combined with the FLEXPART dispersion model and a Bayesian inversion method, in order to derive emissions of nine individual <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> from the whole European Geographic Domain and from twelve regions within it, then comparing our results with the annual emissions that the European countries submit every year to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as with the bottom-up Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. We found several discrepancies when considering the specific compounds and on the country level. However, an overall agreement is found when comparing European aggregated data, which between 2008 and 2014 are on average 84. 2 ﾂｱ 28. 0 Tg-CO 2 -eqyr 1 against the 95. 1 Tg-CO 2 -eqyr 1 reported by UNFCCC in the same period. Therefore, in agreement with other studies, the gap on the global level between bottom-up estimates of Annex I countries and total global top-down emissions should be essentially due to emissions from non-reporting countries (non-Annex I) ...|$|R
