5|$|In {{a modern}} note {{written on a}} <b>fly-leaf</b> {{at the end of}} the book it is said that the author of the Chronicle was one Gregory Skinner (meaning William Gregory of the Skinners' Company) who was Mayor of London in 1451, the thirtieth year of Henry VI. And when we turn to the Chronicle itself the fact seems to be pretty well borne out by what the author himself says in the record of that year.|$|E

2500|$|Sir John Jerningham (d.1559?) of Somerleyton, {{who married}} Bridget Drury (d. 19 January 1518), the {{daughter}} of Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk, by whom he had three sons, George (d.1559), Robert and John, and two daughters, Anne Jerningham, who married Sir Thomas Cornwallis, and Elizabeth Jerningham, who married John Sulyard of Wetherden, Suffolk. Bridget Drury's name appears on the <b>fly-leaf</b> of the Ellesmere manuscript of The Canterbury Tales now in the Huntington Library, together {{with the names of}} four of her brothers and sisters: [...] "William Drury, miles, Robertus Drury, miles, Domina [...] Jarmin, Domina [...] Jarningham, and Domina [...] Allington." ...|$|E
2500|$|The three {{signatures}} on {{the will}} were first reproduced by the 18th-century scholar George Steevens, {{in the form}} of facsimile engravings. The two relating to the house sale were identified in 1768, and the document itself was acquired by Edmond Malone. Photographs of these five signatures were published by Sidney Lee. The final signature was discovered by 1909 by Charles William Wallace. There is also a signature on the <b>fly-leaf</b> of a copy of John Florio's translation of the works of Montaigne, which reads [...] "Willm. Shakspere". This is no longer considered genuine, but was accepted by some scholars until the late 20th century. Another possibly authentic signature appears on a copy of William Lambarde's Archaionomia (1568). Though smudged, the spelling appears to be [...] "Shakspere".|$|E
2500|$|No other {{volume of}} Basse's poems was printed in his lifetime, but two {{manuscript}} collections, {{prepared for the}} press, are still extant. Of these one bears the title of Polyhymnia, {{and has never been}} printed. The only copy of it now known belonged to Richard Heber, and afterwards to Thomas Corser; on the <b>fly-leaf</b> is the autograph of Francis, Lord Norreys, to whom the opening verses are addressed, and to whose sister, Bridget, countess of Lindsey, the collection is dedicated. Another manuscript of Polyhymnia, described by Cole in his manuscript 'Athen√¶ Cantab.' and now lost, differed materially from the Corser manuscript. The second collection left by Basse in manuscript consists of three long pastoral poems, of which the first is dedicated to Sir Richard Wenman; bears the date 1653, and was printed {{for the first time in}} J. P. Collier's Miscellaneous Tracts, in 1872. To it is prefixed a poem addressed to Basse, by Ralph (afterwards dean) Bathurst, who compares the author to an [...] "aged oak", and says: ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1580s {{were also}} a {{productive}} decade for Byrd as a composer of instrumental music. On 11 September 1591 John Baldwin, a tenor lay-clerk at St George's Chapel, Windsor and later a colleague of Byrd in the Chapel Royal, completed the copying of My Ladye Nevells Booke, a collection of 42 of Byrd's keyboard pieces, which was probably produced under Byrd's supervision and includes corrections which {{are thought to be}} in the composer's hand. Byrd would almost certainly have published it if the technical means had been available to do so. The dedicatee long remained unidentified, but John Harley's researches into the heraldic design on the <b>fly-leaf</b> have shown that she was Lady Elizabeth Neville, the third wife of Sir Henry Neville of Billingbear House, Berkshire, who was a Justice of the Peace and a warden of Windsor Great Park. Under her third married name, Lady Periam, she also received the dedication of Thomas Morley's two-part canzonets of 1595. The contents show Byrd's mastery {{of a wide variety of}} keyboard forms, though liturgical compositions based on plainsong are not represented. The collection includes a series of ten pavans and galliards in the usual three-strain form with embellished repeats of each strain. (The only exception is the Ninth Pavan, which is a set of variations on the passamezzo antico bass.) ...|$|E
60|$|My {{intention}} was, to interpose, as it were, a <b>fly-leaf</b> in {{the book}} of my life, in which nothing should be written from without for a brief season of a few weeks. But some very singular experiences recorded themselves on this same <b>fly-leaf,</b> and I am going to relate them literally. I repeat the word: literally.|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas More.--You {{would have}} its history {{recorded}} in the <b>fly-leaf</b> as carefully as the pedigree of a racehorse is preserved.|$|E

60|$|Will it seem exaggerative {{to state}} {{my belief that}} the most honest, the most modest, and the least vain-glorious of all the records upon this strange <b>fly-leaf,</b> was {{a letter from the}} self-deceived {{discoverer}} of the recondite secret 'how to live four or five hundred years'? Doubtless it will seem so, yet the statement is not exaggerative by any means, but is made in my serious and sincere conviction. With this, and with a laugh at the rest that shall not be cynical, I turn the <b>Fly-leaf,</b> and go on again.|$|E
6000|$|Note (2).--An {{autograph}} note, dated May 20th, 1812, signed [...] "Byron," [...] {{is inserted}} on the <b>fly-leaf</b> of a large-paper copy in the Rowfant Library (Catalogue, 1886, p. 144).|$|E

60|$|At {{the same}} time, Jane {{discovered}} {{the books in}} the cupboard, and on opening the <b>fly-leaf</b> {{of one of them}} saw the name, JOHN CLAYTON, LONDON. In a second book which she hurriedly examined was the single name, GREYSTOKE.|$|E
6000|$|On the <b>fly-leaf</b> of {{the same}} volume (Poetry of Robert Burns, vol. iv. Third Edition, 1802), {{containing}} the Farewell to Ayrshire, Byron wrote in pencil the two stanzas [...] "Oh! little lock of golden hue," [...] in 1806 (vide post, p. 233).|$|E
60|$|The quarto Bible {{was laid}} open before {{him at the}} <b>fly-leaf,</b> {{and while he was}} reading with slowly {{travelling}} eyes Mrs. Tulliver entered the room, but stood in mute surprise to find her husband down already, and with the great Bible before him.|$|E
6000|$|When the Old Lady {{got home}} she took from her top bureau drawer an inlaid box of sandalwood. It held a little, slim, limp volume, wrapped in tissue paper--the Old Lady's most treasured possession. On the <b>fly-leaf</b> was written, [...] "To Margaret, with the author's love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Philippe de Croy, {{whoever he}} may have been. On the <b>fly-leaf,</b> in very faded ink, is written 'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.' I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|Juanna {{placed the}} lantern {{beside her and}} opened the book. The first thing that she saw was a name on the <b>fly-leaf,</b> [...] "Jane Beach," [...] and beneath it this inscription, which evidently had been written by some one in a great hurry: [...] "To dearest Leonard from Jane. 23 Jan." ...|$|E
6000|$|He took it {{carefully}} {{and read the}} title on the back, then turned {{a few of the}} leaves. [...] "I'm not much on reading," [...] he said, [...] "but I've got a sister that sends me tracts, and the like." [...] He returned to the <b>fly-leaf.</b> [...] "Is this your name?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... [981:1] These {{lines are}} {{written on a}} <b>fly-leaf</b> of a copy of Five Bookes of the Church by Richard Field (folio 1635), under the inscription: 'Hannah Scollock, her book, February 10, 1787.' The volume was bequeathed to the poet's younger son, Derwent Coleridge, {{and is now in}} the {{possession}} of the Editor.|$|E
60|$|I {{had picked}} up the book I know not where. Very old it {{apparently}} was and made in England. For there was pasted across the <b>fly-leaf</b> of it an extract from some ancient magazine or journal of a century ago, giving what was evidently a description of the New York of that day.|$|E
60|$|I {{will send}} you with this {{a copy of the}} English edition of the Child's Garden. I have heard there is some vile rule of the post-office in the States against inscriptions; so I send {{herewith}} a piece of doggerel which Mr. Bunner may, if he thinks fit, copy off the <b>fly-leaf.</b>|$|E
60|$|Another odd {{entry on}} the <b>fly-leaf,</b> {{of a more}} {{entertaining}} character, was the wonderful persistency with which kind sympathisers assumed that I had injuriously coupled with the so suddenly relinquished pursuit, those personal habits of mine most obviously incompatible with it, and most plainly impossible of being maintained, along with it. As, all that exercise, all that cold bathing, all that wind and weather, all that uphill training-- all that everything else, say, which is usually carried about by express trains in a portmanteau and hat-box, and partaken of under a flaming row of gas-lights {{in the company of}} two thousand people. This assuming of a whole case against all fact and likelihood, struck me as particularly droll, and was an oddity of which I certainly had had no adequate experience in life until I turned that curious <b>fly-leaf.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The carpet-bag {{contained}} {{nothing but}} a change of clothing, and two books--the Plays of Sophocles, in the original Greek, and the [...] "Faust" [...] of Goethe, in the original German. Both volumes were much worn by reading, and on the <b>fly-leaf</b> of each were inscribed the initials O. M. So much the bag revealed, and no more.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: These {{lines are}} {{preserved}} in MS. at Newstead, {{with the following}} memorandum in Miss Pigot's handwriting: [...] "Copied from the <b>fly-leaf</b> in a vol. of my Burns' books, which is written in pencil by himself."

6000|$|... "I {{have the}} date," [...] {{answered}} our host, [...] "for {{he left me}} an autograph copy of The Sybarites when he went away." [...] And after dinner he showed us the book, with evident pride. Inscribed on the <b>fly-leaf</b> {{was the name of}} the author, October 10th. But a glance sufficed to convince both of us that the Celebrity had never written it.|$|E
6000|$|But we {{were going}} to speak of some further reward that her amiable behavior, in this instance, {{procured}} her. As her father opened a package which he had brought on his return, he silently placed in her hands a beautiful copy of a newly-published work, upon the <b>fly-leaf</b> of which she found written--"Maria Wilton--a reward for her kind and obliging manners towards her brothers and sisters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I open this, Mr. Turner," [...] he said, [...] "for my own {{satisfaction}} I {{may as well}} ask you {{to compare}} the handwriting of the address with another specimen of it that chances {{to be in my}} possession"; and producing the worn prayer-book from his pocket--Jane's parting gift--he opened it at the <b>fly-leaf,</b> and pointed out the inscription to the lawyer, placing the envelope beside it.|$|E
6000|$|... [131] [The MS. of stanza xxvii. {{is on the}} <b>fly-leaf</b> of a bound {{volume of}} proof-sheets {{entitled}} [...] "Additions to Childe Harold," [...] It {{was first published in}} the seventh edition, 1814. It may be taken for granted that Byron had seen what he describes. There is, however, no record of any visit to Mount Athos, either in his letters from the East or in Hobhouse's journals.|$|E
