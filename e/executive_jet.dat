25|$|Shortly thereafter, Aero Commander was {{acquired}} by North American Rockwell. The Jet Commander created a problem, since Rockwell already had an <b>executive</b> <b>jet</b> of its own design, the Sabreliner, and could not keep both in production because of anti-trust laws.

25|$|U.S. Major General Stiner, {{in command}} of the American Special Forces at Sigonella, upon {{learning}} that the 737 had been cleared by the Italians to proceed to Rome with members of the PLF still onboard became concerned that there was no guaranteed that once airborne it would travel to Rome rather than back to Cairo. He choose his best men to board a T-39 Navy <b>executive</b> <b>jet</b> (the North American Sabreliner) to shadow the 737. When the Egyptian airliner took off from Sigonella at 10:00p.m. the T-39 was not granted clearance from that runway. In response the Americans used a runway alongside without receiving Italian permission to do so.|$|E
25|$|At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer {{launched}} the Legacy 600, a business jet {{variant of the}} ERJ.

In 2005, the Phenom 100 was then conceptualised as an air taxi like the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and {{is the basis of}} the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, where the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190.

It was of all-composite construction, and its wing was forward swept to reduce drag and to allow an unobstructed cabin by mounting the wing spar behind the cabin.

25|$|After {{planning}} permission {{for a permanent}} passenger terminal was initially denied by Warwick District Council in 2004, two public inquiries took place, followed by an unsuccessful appeal by the airport owners to the UK government planning inspectorate, and finally to the High Court in 2008. The planning battle affected the confidence of flight operators. On 1 September 2008, Wizz Air confirmed it would not continue its seasonal service from Coventry to Gdańsk and Katowice. On 15 October 2008, Thomsonfly confirmed that it would cease operations at Coventry Airport, citing its increased focus on charter services after its merger with First Choice Airways.

25|$|Mulroney {{took the}} job of {{executive}} vice president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, a joint subsidiary of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983 Mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the Schefferville mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers. Under his leadership, the company was sold off to foreign interests. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a teetotaler. During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company's <b>executive</b> <b>jet,</b> frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips. Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards. He declined an offer to run in a Quebec by-election as a federal Liberal.|$|E
