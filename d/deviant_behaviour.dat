The aim of {{this study}} was to establish, within the South African context, the extent to which character-strengths {{specifically}} self-control and integrity are related to the propensity to engage in <b>deviant</b> workplace <b>behaviour.</b> Due to the inherent difficulty of obtaining unbiased responses on sensitive issues, both self-report and non-self-report measures of each of the Character Strengths and <b>Deviant</b> Workplace <b>Behaviour</b> Scales were administered to a convenience sample of 292 South African employees working in different industries. Using principal axis factoring, one reliable factor was extracted from both the Self-control Scale and the Integrity Scale. With regards to the <b>Deviant</b> Workplace <b>Behaviour</b> Scale, three reliable factors were extracted. The character strength factors were found to be positively intercorrelated, as was the case with the <b>deviant</b> workplace <b>behaviour</b> factors. The results confirmed that a negative correlation exists between character strengths, in particular selfcontrol and integrity, and the propensity to engage in <b>deviant</b> workplace <b>behaviour,</b> implying that the employees with stronger self-control and integrity are less likely to engage in <b>deviant</b> workplace <b>behaviour.</b> In addition, the findings of the study showed that employees in general consider themselves to have stronger character strengths and a lower propensity to engage in <b>deviant</b> workplace <b>behaviour</b> than that which they perceive their colleagues to have. Significant differences between the self-report and non-self-report measures were evidenced.

40|$|Bartending is an {{important}} aspect of the service industry. As with any occupation, bartending is a job that must be learned. The purpose of this thesis was to explore how ten males were socialized into the role of nightshift bartender. In line with Akers 2 ̆ 7 social learning theory, the bartenders in this study learned the various aspects of their job through differential association, differential reinforcement, imitation, and definition formation. They were exposed to and learned a number of work-related behaviours that could be defined as deviant, including: excessive alcohol consumption, sexual activity, and cash scams and hustles. Interestingly, {{the findings of this study}} indicate that non-deviant and <b>deviant</b> <b>behaviours</b> were learned through the same processes and involved interaction with other members of the bar subculture. For many of the bartenders in this study, <b>deviant</b> <b>behaviours</b> became normal aspects of their occupation.

40|$|Purpose: Detecting <b>deviant</b> <b>behaviours</b> that precede and {{are related}} to crimes can help prevent these crimes. Research {{suggests}} that the psychological mindset of wrongdoers may differ from others, such {{that they are more}} anxious, self-focussed, and vigilant. As a result, their responses to environmental cues, specifically those that signal risk of exposure, may differ. Method: In two randomized controlled trials, participants with high (vs. low) cognitive load walked a pre-defined route to carry out a hostile or non-hostile task. En route, participants were exposed to a strong (vs. mild) cue from a security officer (Study 1), or a cue (vs. no cue) resembling police walkie-talkie static noise (Study 2). Participants filled out a questionnaire measuring psychological constructs. Reactions during the task were recorded and presented to independent observers to determine the participants' intent. Results: Participants with high (vs. low) cognitive load who were exposed to a strong (vs. mild or no) cue while carrying out their task were more often correctly identified by observers as either innocent or hostile based on their behaviour. Analysis of the questionnaire revealed that the experience of hostile intentions is related to anxiety, inhibitory control of anxiety, activation control of normal behaviour, and to other relevant constructs which may explain why cues that signal risk of exposure can improve the detection accuracy of individuals with hostile intentions. Conclusion: These studies show that cues that signal risk of exposure can improve the detection of wrongdoers and the role of self-regulation in the suppression of anxiety and <b>deviant</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Within healthcare, {{the limited}} success of deficit based {{approaches}} in improving patient safety {{has led to}} an increasing focus on ‘how things go right most of the time’. Positive deviance, an asset based approach, learns from those who demonstrate exceptional performance despite facing similar constraints as others. This study applies the positive deviance approach to generate hypotheses about the abstract behaviours and concrete strategies that staff on positively deviant elderly medical wards use to deliver exceptionally safe patient care. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted on eight elderly medical wards within five NHS Trusts in the North of England. Wards were selected using a routinely collected outcome measure of overall safety; four wards were positively deviant (exceptional safety performances), and four wards were matched comparators (slightly above average safety performances). Semi structured, multi-disciplinary staff focus groups explored how safe patient care is delivered at ward level. The researcher made field notes following each focus group. Data from all wards were analysed thematically to create a framework of abstract behaviours and concrete strategies that facilitate high performance in general. This was then analysed to identify differences between positively deviant and comparison wards which enabled hypotheses to be generated about which behaviours and strategies were specifically related to positive deviance. Results: The thematic framework of factors influencing general high performance included five high-order observations, 12 themes, and 65 subthemes (all of which pertained to abstract behaviours), and 14 concrete strategies. This presentation will focus on the behavioural sub-themes that were specifically hypothesised to facilitate ward level positive deviance. Positively <b>deviant</b> <b>behaviours</b> related to staff relationships, integrated multidisciplinary ward teams, performance improvement efforts, and communication among team members. The concrete strategies that staff use to achieve these abstract behaviours will be highlighted. For example, holding daily ‘safety briefings’ or ‘board rounds’ that are timely and involve all staff regardless of their grade, emphasises the important role everyone plays in maintain safety, engenders a multidisciplinary approach, and facilitates relationships by enabling staff to get to know one another and by reducing work related frustrations. Conclusion: This research reports the first known application of the positive deviance approach within the UK’s National Health Service. Findings highlight the positively <b>deviant</b> <b>behaviours</b> that are hypothesised to facilitate not only good but exceptionally safe patient care at ward level. Furthermore, the specific, concrete and practical strategies that staff use to achieve these more abstract positively <b>deviant</b> <b>behaviours</b> are identified.
