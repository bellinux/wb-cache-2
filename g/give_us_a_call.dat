40|$|AbstractWe {{will show}} that the book Dislocations by Jacques Friedel, {{published}} half a century ago, can still be recommended, {{in agreement with the}} author's intention, as a textbook “for research students at University and for students at engineering schools as well as for research engineers”. Indeed, today dislocations are known to occur not only in solid crystals but also in many other systems discovered more recently such as colloidal crystals or liquid crystals having periodic structures. Moreover, the concept of dislocations is an excellent starting point for lectures on topological defects occurring in systems equipped with order parameters resulting from broken symmetries: disclinations in nematic or hexatic liquid crystals, dispirations in chiral smectics or disorientations in lyotropic liquid crystals. The discussion of dislocations in Blue Phases will <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to <b>call</b> on mind Sir Charles Frank, friend of Jacques Friedel since his Bristol years, who called these ephemeral mesophases “topological oddities”. Being made of networks of disclinations, Blue Phases are similar to Twist Grain Boundary (TGB) smectic phases, which are made of networks of screw dislocations and whose existence was predicted by de Gennes in 1972 {{on the basis of the}} analogy between smectics and superconductors.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, many power {{utilities}} world-wide {{have been forced}} to change their ways of doing business, from vertically integrated functioning to open-market systems. The reasons have been many, and differed, across regions and countries. Reforms were undertaken by introducing commercial incentives in generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, with in many cases, large efficiency gains. Though this may seem fairly straightforward at first glance, there are several complexities involved in restructuring and several new issues have surfaced. Recent large-scale power system blackouts in the USA and Europe have <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> “wake-up” <b>call</b> on the vulnerability of our power systems that they are being operated much closer to the limits than ever before. This study aims at investigating the changes in power market transaction levels when taking into account the voltage stability consideration and FACTS devices in the market settlement scheme. The study is based on a security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) framework for a combined bilateral-and-pool electricity market. An IEEE 30 -bus test system is used in the study in which four separate cases are analyzed, i. e., a base case, a base case with security margin and these two cases with FACTS devices included. It is found that the voltage security constraints could help independent market operators (IMO) to include a sufficient margin for allowable power transactions to ensure the system security while maximizing the social welfare. It is also shown in the study that the use of FACTS devices (e. g., TCSC) can lead to an increase of up to 107 % in available load capacity (ALC) for the same total transaction level (TTL) and an increase in TTL by up to about 3. 5 % when keeping the security loading factor of the system constant. Furthermore, the payment to the IMO is decreased by 4 % due to congestion relief effects of FACTS. It can be concluded that power systems will be operating with a larger security margin with the proposed market settlement. It is, however, {{important to note that the}} social welfare is compromised with the increased security margin...|$|R

The cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces, while the octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges and 8 faces. Is this reversal in the number of faces in each dimension common? In the problem session you saw that v-e+f= 2 for 3 -polytopes. Is something similar true in higher dimensions? Are there other restrictions on the number of faces of each dimension? What is the most number of faces in each dimension if we fix the number of vertices and dimension? The least? What if we fix other numbers of faces in random dimensions?

Out of New England, {{it would be impossible}} to meet with a person combining so many ladylike attributes with so many others that form no necessary (if compatible) part of the character. She shocked no canon of taste; she was admirably in keeping with herself, and never jarred against surrounding circumstances. Her figure, to be sure,--so small as to be almost childlike, and so elastic that motion seemed as easy or easier to it than rest, would hardly have suited one's idea of a countess. Neither did her face--with the brown ringlets on either side, and the slightly piquant nose, and the wholesome bloom, and the clear shade of tan, and the half dozen freckles, friendly remembrances of the April sun and breeze--precisely <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> right to <b>call</b> her beautiful.

[...] Instead of discussing her claim to rank among ladies, it would be preferable to regard Phoebe as the example of feminine grace and availability combined, in a state of society, if there were any such, where ladies did not exist. There it should be woman's office to move in the midst of practical affairs, and to gild them all, the very homeliest,--were it even the scouring of pots and kettles,--with an atmosphere of loveliness and joy.|$|R
