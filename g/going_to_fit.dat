500|$|Parker {{said he and}} Stone did {{not intend}} for [...] "Damien" [...] to be {{offensive}} to Christians or any other religion: [...] "In South Park, Jesus is a great guy, he's on our show, and in this episode he's the hero. We're {{not in the business}} of offending people. We're in the business of making people laugh." [...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year. Parker said, [...] "It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over, so I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into any of them, and I just wanted to destroy and kill, which was the inspiration for this show." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, Broadwater Development LLC – {{a casino}} holding company owned by two local {{construction}} figures, Roy Anderson III and Cotton Fore – won a [...] bankruptcy auction {{bid for the}} casino and resort for $82 million, amid speculation that they had overpaid. Anderson said of the barge, [...] "It's a nice structure. But overall aesthetically, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into our master plan." [...] On April 15, 2005, the deal closed; as part of it, the President Casino barge was purchased for $6.8 million by Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC {{with the intention of}} operating it under the name of President Casino until it could be moved to their site in Hancock County, Mississippi, where the Silver Slipper operators thought it would fit in. [...] On July 31, 2005, the Broadwater Beach Resort closed its doors, with Broadwater Development announcing plans to tear it down and build a new resort and casino.|$|E
2500|$|In the Observer interview, Hewlett {{said that}} there is [...] "a new project which Damon and I are working on now, called Carousel, which is even bigger and more {{difficult}} than , and it isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> anywhere and no one's going to like it, ha ha ha! We've started work— I've {{done a lot of}} visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't figured out how they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> together. I can't say much about it yet but it's sort of like a film, but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or even if it will happen. But Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals, but right now, at this moment, it's still just a really good idea." [...] Carousel was to be about the mystical aspects of Britain.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Caddy" [...] — Jackie sues Oh Henry! {{candy bar}} heiress Sue Ellen Mischke for {{allegedly}} causing Kramer personal injury {{due to an}} automobile accident. Kramer distracts Jerry while driving when he sees Mischke walking the streets of New York City wearing only a bra. Chiles describes her actions as [...] "lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!" [...] The lawsuit fails when Kramer, taking the ill advice of his golf caddy, demands she try on the bra to prove it is hers. It fails to fit because she tries donning it over a leotard. Jackie yells at Kramer, [...] "Of course a bra's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> on over a leotard. A bra's got to fit right up against a person's skin... like a glove!" [...] — an obvious parody of the O. J. Simpson murder case.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kitana's origins were {{revealed}} by her creator, John Tobias, who disclosed that she {{started out as}} an unplayable herald-type character called [...] "Kitsune" [...] during the early development of the original Mortal Kombat game in 1991; his inspiration {{at the time was}} the character of Princess Mariko from Jordan Mechner's 1984 video game Karateka. In Tobias' design sketch, Kitsune wielded a single ornamental fan and [...] "was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into the story as Shang Lao's [...] princess daughter—the spoil of victory for winning the tournament" [...] who would betray her father after she fell for Liu Kang. Shang instead became a minion of Shao Kahn when the story was expanded for Mortal Kombat II, for which Kitsune was renamed [...] "Kitana" [...] and made Kahn's stepdaughter. According to Tobias, her original name was rejected for being Japanese and thus not compatible with [...] "Shang and Shao who were both Chinese in origin" [...] (before the games [...] "ultimately became a hodgepodge of nonsensical Asian mythological hooha anyway"), and the name Kitana was created as [...] "a combo of Kitsune & Katana" [...] that would sound [...] "generically Asian enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{signify the}} character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was {{required}} to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, [...] "It is hard work, but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it." [...] After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained {{the reason for the}} change in 2004: [...] "The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like EastEnders. It's not something that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in {{for a long period of}} time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{rangefinders}} {{were originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> in the conning tower, {{but this was}} changed during construction to mounting them in the forward and aft main gun turrets using periscopes in armored hoods on the turret roofs. These would provide data for the central artillery post to calculate and then transmit to the guns for the gun crew to follow. A new, domestically designed, Erikson mechanical computer {{was intended to be}} used.|$|R
50|$|Lola had {{originally}} intended to enter Formula One {{in their own right}} in 1998, but pressure from main sponsor MasterCard caused Lola to debut its new car one year early, in 1997. The sponsorship model was curious, linked both to MasterCard membership of a 'club', and to results - something a first-year F1 team often finds hard to achieve. A custom-built V10 engine from Al Melling was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> the cars, which initially started racing fitted with underpowered Ford Cosworth ED V8s.|$|R

2500|$|Murray {{never played}} much {{basketball}} before the show, and was more into football while in high school. Because of this, a basketball coach was hired for Murray {{in order to}} improve his basketball skills. To go along with the character's personality, a [...] "sedate" [...] wardrobe was designed. Schwahn said of Lucas's wardrobe, [...] "...He was a Levi's guy. He was, you know, he wore a lot of, like, plain T-shirts and things because we just wanted him to represent the everyman." [...] Despite having the character start out this way, the series eventually let his wardrobe evolve. Starting from the fourth season on, he was given some [...] "wilder stuff". Schwahn clarified, [...] "You know, he can [...] rock something from Sean John, which normally would have been Nathan's department." [...] He said the style of the characters really does evolve on the show, especially with the four-year timeline jump. [...] "Diesel is so wonderful on [...] Diesel jeans. It's an Italian company. A lot of times, Italian designers cut much more slimly...for a really lean physique," [...] stated One Tree Hill's costume designer, Carol Cutshall. [...] "Also, this year, they’ve had nice long sleeves and nice long shirts and really slim clothing and that looks best on [...] He doesn’t need to be swallowed up. He's got his own style as a person. It's not just up to me. I try to bring in what I think is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> him best." [...] With the timeline jump, Lucas’s main brands become Diesel, Guess menswear, and Juicy Couture for men.|$|E
2500|$|Friedgen {{was born}} on April 4, 1947 in Harrison, New York. His father, [...] "Big Ralph" [...] Friedgen, {{attended}} Fordham University, where he played from 1938 to 1939, and coached high school football for 30years. The younger Friedgen worked under his father as a water boy and manager, and the two often attended New York Giants and Jets games together. He attended Harrison High School where he played quarterback on his father's team. John Nugent, the head coach of Harrison's rival Rye High School, recommended that his brother, Maryland head coach Tom Nugent, recruit Friedgen. His recruitment was handled by Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at the school. After his first season at Maryland, Nugent was fired as head coach, and his successor Lou Saban moved Friedgen to fullback to fill in for an injured teammate. The following year, Maryland had a new coach, and Bob Ward again changed Friedgen's position, this time to offensive guard, although he had never blocked before. Upset about the constant turnover at head coach and position changes, Friedgen received a favorable recommendation to transfer from coach Ward, but his father said, [...] "You can transfer, {{but when you get}} home, the key you have is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the door because we're changing the lock. Quitters don't live here." [...] He remained at Maryland as a guard and later said the experience taught him a lesson in perseverance. As an undergraduate, {{he was a member of}} Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. After completion of his bachelor's degree in physical education in 1970, Friedgen served as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, before later accepting positions on the staffs of The Citadel, William and Mary, and Murray State. Joining him on many of these coaching stops was Frank Beamer, who later served as head coach at Virginia Tech.|$|E

I 'm not a 'rampant woman's rights reformer,'" [...] added Miss Mills, with a smile at Polly's sober face; [...] "but I think that women can do {{a great deal for}} each other, if they will only stop fearing what 'people will think,' and take a hearty interest in whatever is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> their sisters and themselves to deserve and enjoy the rights God gave them. There are so many ways in which this can be done, that I wonder they don't see and improve them. I don't ask you to go and make speeches, only a few have the gift for that, but I do want every girl and woman to feel this duty, and make any little sacrifice of time or feeling that may be asked of them, {{because there is so much}} to do, and no one can do it as well as ourselves, if we only think so." ...|$|E
