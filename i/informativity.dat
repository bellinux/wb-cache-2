No matter how expected or predictable content may be, a text will always be informative at least to a certain degree due to unforeseen variability. The processing of highly informative text demands greater cognitive ability but at the same time is more interesting. The level of <b>informativity</b> should not exceed a point such that the text becomes too complicated and communication is endangered. Conversely, the level of <b>informativity</b> should also not be so low that it results in boredom and the rejection of the text.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare quantitatively the discriminatory {{power of}} the EQ- 5 D, HUI 2 and HUI 3 in terms of {{absolute}} and relative <b>informativity,</b> using Shannon's indices. METHODS: EQ- 5 D and HUI 2 / 3 data completed by {{a sample of the}} general adult US population (N = 3, 691) were used. Five dimensions allowed head-to-head comparison of informativity: Mobility/Ambulation; Anxiety/Depression/Emotion; Pain/Discomfort (EQ- 5 D; HUI 2; HUI 3); Self-Care (EQ- 5 D; HUI 2); and Cognition (HUI 2; HUI 3). Shannon's index and Shannon's Evenness index were used to assess absolute and relative <b>informativity,</b> both by dimension and by instrument as a whole. RESULTS: Absolute <b>informativity</b> was highest for HUI 3, with the largest differences in Pain/Discomfort and Cognition. Relative <b>informativity</b> was highest for EQ- 5 D, with the largest differences in Mobility/Ambulation and Anxiety/Depression/Emotion. Absolute <b>informativity</b> by instrument was consistently highest for HUI 3 and lowest for EQ- 5 D, and relative <b>informativity</b> was highest for EQ- 5 D and lowest for HUI 3. DISCUSSION: Performance in terms of absolute and relative <b>informativity</b> of the common dimensions of the three instruments varies over dimensions. Several dimensions are suboptimal: Pain/Discomfort (EQ- 5 D) seems too crude with only 3 levels, and the level descriptions of Ambulation (HUI 3) and Self-Care (HUI 2) could be improved. In absence of a formal measure, Shannon's indices provide useful measures for assessing discriminatory power of utility instrument...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been claimed (e. g. Sweet 1892, Bolinger 1972, Ladd 1984) that <b>informativity</b> has an {{influence}} on the leftward or rightward stress assigned to noun-noun combinations in English. However, the few available empirical studies of this hypothesis have provided contradictory findings (Plag & Kunter 2010, Bell 2012, Bell & Plag 2012). The present paper replicates the effect of <b>informativity</b> using the same measures as Bell & Plag (2012) but with a different set of data. More informative constituents in N 2 position tend to be stressed. This result fits with the general propensity of speakers to accentuate important information and our results can therefore be interpreted as further evidence for an accentual theory of compound stress (e. g. Gussenhoven 2004, Kunter 2011). The results also raise the question of the relationship between <b>informativity</b> and constituent identity, which is the strongest known predictor of compound stress pattern (e. g. Plag 2010, Arndt-Lappe 2011). An exploration of this problem shows that the two factors are interrelated. We argue that <b>informativity</b> is best conceptualized as underlying other predictors of prominence, including constituent identity...|$|E
40|$|For the {{analysis}} of affected sib pairs (ASPs), a variety of test statistics is applied in genomewide scans with microsatellite markers. Even in multipoint analyses, these statistics might not fully exploit {{the power of a}} given sample, because they do not account for incomplete <b>informativity</b> of an ASP. For meta-analyses of linkage and association studies, it has been shown recently that weighting by <b>informativity</b> increases statistical power. With this idea in mind, the first aim of this article was to introduce a new class of tests for ASPs that are based on the mean test. To take into account how much <b>informativity</b> an ASP contributes, we weighted families inversely proportional to their marker <b>informativity.</b> The weighting scheme is obtained by use of the de Finetti representation of the distribution of identity-by-descent values. We derive the limiting distribution of the weighted mean test and demonstrate the validity of the proposed test. We show that it can be much more powerful than the classical mean test in the case of low marker <b>informativity.</b> In {{the second part of the}} article, we propose a Monte Carlo simulation approach for evaluating significance among ASPs. We demonstrate the validity of the simulation approach for both the classical and the weighted mean test. Finally, we illustrate the use of the weighted mean test by reanalyzing two published data sets. In both applications, the maximum LOD score of the weighted mean test is 0. 6 higher than that of the classical mean test...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa, que tem como tema a informatividade como fator de textualidade no texto opinativo realizado como exercício redacional nas escolas, partindo da inquietação provocada pela reiteração das mesmas ideias na expressão opinativa dos alunos, aquilo que nomeamos aqui de senso comum. Também motivados pela evidente importância dada às produções escritas dos alunos, sejam como prática em sala de aula, sejam em exames externos que avaliam a qualidade do ensino básico. O desafio de encontrar caminhos de aprimoramento para a produção escrita de opiniões motivou a revisão da informatividade entre os fatores de textualidade postulados por Beaugrande & Dressler (1981). Isso possibilitou entender como o {{material}} novo exerce controle na seleção do conteúdo significativo dos textos e como, assim, a informatividade limita ou motiva a comunicabilidade, na medida em que há ocorrências que indiquem baixa, média ou alta informatividade. Para mensurar essas ordens de informatividade, as fontes de expectativas de informação foram organizadas em conhecimento linguístico e concepção de realidade, constituindo-se critérios para a análise no corpus de pesquisa. Em quatro textos opinativos produzidos em situação escolar, desconstruídos da microestrutura para macroestrutura, observou-se os graus de ocorrências de informatividade. Os resultados indicam que os textos em que costumeiramente encontramos ideias do senso comum são característicos de baixa informatividade; os textos de média informatividade são modelos que norteiam o texto adequado; e as produções de alta informatividade são de difícil interpretação, precisando de simplificação para serem compreendidas. São constatações que abrem caminho para o aprimoramento da produção textual na escola, uma vez que permitem uma visão mais precisa para avaliar a qualidade da abordagem temática dos textos opinativosThis research, {{which is}} about the <b>informativity</b> of textuality as a factor in the opinionated text redaction performed as an exercise in schools, from the restlessness caused by repetition of the same ideas in the expression of opinionated students, what we name here common sense. Also motivated by the evident importance given to the students' written production, whether as a practice in the classroom, whether in external examinations that assess the quality of basic education. The challenge of finding ways to improve the production of written opinions led to a revision of <b>informativity</b> among the textuality factors postulated by Beaugrande & Dressler (1981). This made it possible to understand how the new material exerts control in the selection of meaningful content of the texts and how, thus limiting the <b>informativity</b> or motivates communicability, to the extent that there are instances that indicate low, medium or high <b>informativity.</b> To measure the <b>informativity</b> of these orders, the sources of information expectations were organized in linguistic knowledge and conception of reality, constituting criteria for analysis in the research corpus. In four opinion writings texts produced in the school situation, deconstructed the microstructure to macrostructure, it was observed occurrences of the degrees of <b>informativity.</b> The results indicate that the texts that usually find common sense ideas are characteristic of low <b>informativity,</b> the texts of average <b>informativity</b> are models that guide the appropriate text, and the production of high <b>informativity</b> are difficult to interpret, in need of simplification to be understood.

In livestock production, there are still no commercial arrays and many studies use home-made sets of SNPs. Thus, the current methodologies for SNP genotyping are still expensive and it is a crucial step to select the SNPs to use. Indeed, the main factors affecting the power of the linkage analyses are the density of the genetic map and the heterozygosity of markers in tested animal parents. Findings This is why we have developed a PERL program selecting a defined number of markers based on their locations on the genome and their <b>informativity</b> in specific experimental designs. As an option, different experimental designs can be combined in order to select the best possible common marker set.
