50|$|When the coke is very hot, solid {{pieces of}} metal are charged into the furnace through {{an opening in the}} top. The metal is alternated with {{additional}} layers of fresh coke. Limestone is added to act as a flux. As the heat rises within the stack the metal is melted. It drips down through the coke bed to collect in a pool at the bottom, just above the bottom doors. During the melting process a thermodynamic reaction takes place between the fuel and the blast air. The carbon in the coke combines with the oxygen in the air to form carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide further burns to form carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon is picked up by the falling droplets of molten metal which raises the carbon content of the iron. Silicon carbide and <b>ferromanganese</b> briquettes may also be added to the charge materials. The silicon carbide dissociates and carbon and silicon enters into the molten metal. Likewise, the <b>ferromanganese</b> melts and is combined into the pool of liquid iron in the 'well' {{at the bottom of the}} cupola. Additions to the molten iron such as <b>ferromanganese,</b> ferrosilicon, Silicon carbide and other alloying agents are used to alter the molten iron to conform to the needs of the castings at hand.|$|E
50|$|Henry Bessemer {{invented the}} use of <b>ferromanganese</b> {{as a method of}} {{introducing}} manganese in controlled proportions during the production of steel.

50|$|The Council of the Authority began work, in August 2002, {{on another}} set of regulations, {{covering}} polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-rich <b>ferromanganese</b> crusts, which are rich sources of such minerals as copper, iron, zinc, silver and gold, as well as cobalt. The sulphides are found around volcanic hot springs, especially in the western Pacific Ocean, while the crusts occur on oceanic ridges and elsewhere at several locations around the world. The Council decided in 2006 to prepare separate sets of regulations for sulphides and for crusts, with priority given to sulphides. It devoted most of its sessions in 2007 and 2008 to this task, but several issues remained unresolved. Chief among these were the definition and configuration of the area to be allocated to contractors for exploration, the fees {{to be paid to}} the Authority and {{the question of how to}} deal with any overlapping claims that might arise. Meanwhile, the Legal and Technical Commission reported progress on <b>ferromanganese</b> crusts.|$|E
50|$|The Authority {{also holds}} four {{contracts}} for {{the exploration of}} cobalt-rich <b>ferromanganese</b> crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (29 April 2014); Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC, 27 January 2014); Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (10 March 2015) and Companhia De Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais (9 November 2015).|$|E
