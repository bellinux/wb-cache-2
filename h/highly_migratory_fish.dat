500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} bignose shark as Data Deficient overall, due to {{inadequate}} population and fishery monitoring. The species {{is considered to}} be of concern, however, given it is slow-reproducing and faces widespread heavy fishing pressure. There is evidence that its numbers have recently declined in the Maldives. Furthermore, most bignose shark bycatch occurs in international waters, where a single stock may be affected by multiple fisheries. It is listed as a [...] "highly migratory species" [...] under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and <b>Highly</b> <b>Migratory</b> <b>Fish</b> Stocks, but thus far this has not led to significant conservation measures. Regionally, the IUCN has assessed the bignose shark as Near Threatened in the northwestern Atlantic. Though specific data are lacking, it is suspected to have declined there because it is commonly misidentified as the sandbar shark, thus the known decline in sandbar shark numbers resulting from US longline fishing may represent a decline in bignose shark numbers, as well. This species has been assessed as Least Concern in Australian waters, where it faces no significant threats.|$|E

40|$|For centuries, the {{mechanisms}} surrounding spatially complex animal migrations have intrigued {{scientists and the}} public. We present a new methodology using ocean heat content (OHC), a habitat metric that is normally a fundamental part of hurricane intensity forecasting, to estimate movements and migration of satellite-tagged marine fishes. Previous satellite-tagging research of fishes using archival depth, temperature and light data for geolocations have been too coarse to resolve detailed ocean habitat utilization. We combined tag data with OHC estimated from ocean circulation and transport models in an optimization framework that substantially improved geolocation accuracy over SST-based tracks. The OHC-based movement track provided the first quantitative evidence {{that many of the}} tagged <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>fishes</b> displayed affinities for ocean fronts and eddies. The OHC method provides a new quantitative tool for studying dynamic use of ocean habitats, migration processes and responses to environmental changes by fishes, and further, improves ocean animal tracking and extends satellite-based animal tracking data for other potential physical, ecological, and fisheries applications...|$|R
5000|$|Billfish occur {{worldwide}} in temperate and tropical waters.

Little is known about their movements and life histories, so assessing how they can be sustainably managed is not easy.|$|R

50|$|Swordfish (Xiphias gladius), {{also known}} as broadbills in some countries, are large, <b>highly</b> <b>migratory,</b> predatory <b>fish</b> {{characterized}} by a long, flat bill. They are a popular sport fish of the billfish category, though elusive. Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. These fish are found widely in tropical and temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and can typically be found from near the surface {{to a depth of}} 550 m. They commonly reach 3 m in length, and the maximum reported is 4.55 m in length and 650 kg in weight.|$|R
40|$|Overfishing {{is arguably}} the {{greatest}} ecological threat facing the oceans, yet catches of many <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>fishes</b> including oceanic sharks remain largely unregulated with poor monitoring and data reporting. Oceanic shark conservation is hampered by basic knowledge gaps about where sharks aggregate across population ranges and precisely where they overlap with fishers. Using satellite tracking data from six shark species across the North Atlantic, we show that pelagic sharks occupy predictable habitat ‘hotspots’ of high space use. Movement modelling showed sharks preferred habitats characterised by strong sea-surface-temperature gradients (fronts) over other available habitats. However, simultaneous Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of the entire Spanish and Portuguese longline-vessel fishing fleets show an 80 % overlap of fished areas with hotspots, potentially increasing shark susceptibility to fishing exploitation. Regions of high overlap between oceanic tagged sharks and longliners included the North Atlantic Current/Labrador Current convergence zone and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge south-west of the Azores. In these main regions, and sub-areas within them, shark/vessel co-occurrence was spatially and temporally persistent between years, highlighting how broadly the fishing exploitation efficiently ‘tracks’ oceanic sharks within their space-use hotspots year-round. Given this intense focus of longliners on shark hotspots our study argues the need for international catch limits for pelagic sharks and identifies a future role of combining fine-scale fish and vessel telemetry to inform the ocean-scale management of fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Swordfish (Xiphias gladius L., 1758) is an apex predator, <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> meso-pelagic <b>fish</b> widely {{distributed}} in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean. As top predators, this fish may be the end reservoir of the bioaccumulation of trace elements in a food chain because they occupy higher trophic levels and are an important food source, causing them to be potentially hazardous to consume. This study aims to investigate the concentration of 18 trace elements of Swordfish, caught in the Mediterranean Sea and to discuss human exposure risks. The mean element levels in the fish muscles were clearly below the maximum allowable concentrations established by International food safety regulations. The data suggested that the risk is minor and acceptable for human health.

40|$|The coded wire tag (CWT) {{database}} contains {{detailed information}} on millions of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. released from hatcheries or smolt traps and recovered in the north Pacific Ocean and its tributaries. I used this data set to examine the spatial and temporal variation in the marine distributions of 77 hatchery and 16 wild populations of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha based on recoveries of an estimated 632, 000 tagged salmon in coastal waters from southern California to the Bering Sea during 1979 – 1994 (and 1995 – 2004 for select hatcheries). Chinook salmon showed 12 distinct region-specific recovery patterns. Chinook salmon originating in a common freshwater region had similar marine distributions, which were distinct from those of adjacent regions. Different run types (e. g., spring, summer, and fall runs) originating in the same region exhibited variation in their marine distributions consistent with recovery {{at different stages of}} their ocean residence period. Recovery patterns were surprisingly stable across years, despite high interannual variation in ocean conditions. By contrast, ocean age influenced recovery patterns, as older fish were recovered further from their natal stream than younger fish. Although most of the CWT data used in the analysis came from hatchery fish, recoveries of tagged wild populations indicate patterns similar to those of fish from nearby hatcheries. The consistency in these findings across broad geographic areas suggests that they apply to Chinook salmon across the entire Pacific Rim. Similar findings for tagged coho salmon O. kisutch indicate that the observed patterns may apply to Pacific salmon as a whole and provide a model for other <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> <b>fishes</b> that have not benefited from such intensive tagging programs. The results also have implications for the genetic control of migration and salmon’s ability to respond to climate change...|$|R

40|$|In {{species with}} high migratory potential, the genetic signal {{revealing}} population differentiation is often obscured by population admixture. To our knowledge, the explicit comparison of genetic samples from known spawning and feeding areas {{has not been}} conducted for any <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> pelagic <b>fish</b> species. This study examines the geographic heterogeneity of swordfish mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages within the Atlantic Ocean using 330 base pairs of sequence of the control region from 480 individuals.

40|$|The {{paddlefish}} (Polyodon spathula) is an evolutionarily ancient, long-lived, <b>highly</b> <b>migratory,</b> cartilaginous <b>fish</b> {{native to}} the Missouri, Mississippi and several Gulf Coast drainages (Gengerke, 1986; Russell, 1986). Paddlefish populations have declined along with a concomitant reduction in their range partly due to impoundments, channel alterations and overharvesting. To {{address some of the}} problems that arise when restoration of a species such as paddlefish is undertaken, genetic analysis becomes necessary. To ensure that stocking programs are maximized, inbred and conversely, genetically unique fish populations must be identified. Previous genetic analysis was either biochemically performed or at the DNA-level. Livers were removed to isolate mitochondrial DNA which meant the sacrifice of the individual(s). With the rapid advances in molecular biological techniques, non-invasive genetic analysis can now be obtained. This study demonstrates a method to analyze at the DNA level without the need to sacrifice the individual. By selectively targeting the genetic site of interest and using a technique known as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), millions of copies of a DNA fragment can be produced and then tested for variations between 2 or more individuals by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of biologically differentiated populations has {{been credited with}} {{a major role in}} conferring sustainability and in buffering overall productivity of anadromous fish population complexes where evidence for spatial structure is uncontroversial. Here, we describe evidence of correlated genetic and life history (spawning season linked to spawning location) differentiation in an abundant and <b>highly</b> <b>migratory</b> pelagic <b>fish,</b> Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, in the North Sea (NS) and adjacent areas. The {{existence of}} genetically and phenotypically diverse stocks in this region despite intense seasonal mixing strongly implicates natal homing in this species. Based on information from genetic markers and otolith morphology, we estimate the proportional contribution by NS, Skagerrak (SKG) and Kattegat and western Baltic (WBS) fish to mixed aggregations targeted by the NS fishery. We use these estimates to identify spatial and temporal differences in life history (migratory behaviour) and habitat use among genetically differentiated migratory populations that mix seasonally. Our study suggests the existence of more complex patterns of intraspecific diversity than was previously recognized. Sustainability may be compromised if such complex patterns are reduced through generalized management (e. g. area closures) that overlooks population differences in spatial use throughout the life cycl...|$|R
