40|$|Abstract: It is {{practical}} in our country’s {{industry and}} global industry that safety accidents occur frequently and major production accidents cause painful price. Reflection on the intelligent monitoring is generated {{based on the}} harsh reality. Generally speaking, the intelligent monitoring refers to supervision and control of plant operation safety through intelligent programming by collecting and integrating wisdom of an engineering designer, a plant operator and an equipment manufacturer. A valve is called the “throat ” in various kinds of pipe network systems of enterprises in petroleum, electricity and chemistry industries. Operational safety of industrial valves causes high attention. According to relevant data statistics, one third of significant production accidents occurring in the world every year are caused by valve accidents. Among the several major and significant petrochemical safety accidents occurring in our country in recent years, operators were neglectful and careless and opened or closed valves in a wrong way to cause explosion; in the electric industry all over the world, significant accidents such as <b>electric</b> <b>leakage</b> and power outage caused by improper valve management brought immeasurable losses, such as the significant Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Station Accident in USA, to normal operation and people’s property safety and so forth in industrial production. Damages and losses of such kind of accidents have brought very serious influences to relevant industries and society.

40|$|In U. S. A. {{more than}} 25 % of major {{operation}} are performed {{by mean of}} laparoscopy. Accidental burns are infrequent but very dangerous complications during laparoscopic surgery. They may lead to cutaneous burns, organs’ damage, bowel perforation far from the main surgical site, peritonitis, which may require subsequent surgery included stomas. The incidence of laparoscopic accidental burns is between 2, 3 and 4 cases every 1000 major operation. Almost 18 % of general surgeons and 33. 33 % of gynecologists have a direct or indirect experience of burn injuries (2). The aim of our work is to investigate the reason of accidental burns occurrence and develop a reliable solution which is cost effective on a large scale. The main mechanism of laparoscopic burns could be epitomized in three phenomenon. Direct contact that occurs when energy is transferred through a physical contact between two conductors. This effect is generally attributed to human errors. Lack of insulation due to a defect of the instrument as <b>electric</b> <b>leakage</b> on sheath’ surface, and capacitive coupling. Capacitance is a stored electrical charge that occurs between two conductors separated by insulation (13). Our hypothesis is {{that the presence of}} biological fluid {{on the surface of the}} laparoscopic instrument into the abdominal cavity works as a conductor for electric conduction on the sheath. We developed a cover which separate the ions present into an electrolyte solution and works as an insulator for electric conduction when applied on the sheath of the instruments...|$|E
40|$|In the {{modeling}} of piezoelectric vibrators, {{one of the}} universally used assumptions is that the exterior electroquasistatic field due to the <b>electric</b> flux <b>leakage</b> through the piezoelectric-air interface can be neglected. This approximation, valid for materials with large dielectric constants, can introduce a significant error in the simulation of piezoelectric crystals whose permittivity is comparable with that of free space. Because models that {{take into account the}} <b>electric</b> flux <b>leakage</b> are virtually non-existent, the objective of this thesis is to develop a solution of the three-dimensional piezoelectric problem which is referred to, by analogy with electromagnetics, as electrically unbounded. To begin with, the general piezoelectric boundary-value problem with open electric boundaries is stated in the form of differential, variational, and projective equations. The latter formulation serves to construct the finite element solution of the system of piezoelectric equations. Tetrahedral elements of high order, assembled by means of universal matrices, are used to approximate the coupled mechanical and electric fields in the interior region. The exterior infinitely extending electric field is modeled by a single 'superelement', obtained by the ballooning method, and automatically compatible with the interior finite element discretization. After imposing electrical, static or homogeneous, boundary conditions on the matrix equations, the associated deterministic problem is solved for the full piezoelectric static capacitance using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, while the eigenvalue problems are solved for the two resonant frequencies by a variant of the Lanczos method. Convergence and computer implementation of both methods, {{as well as of the}} associated data structures are described in detail. The effect of the external electric field on static and motional parameters is studied for various types of rectangular piezoelectric vibrators. Illustrative examples involving different geometries, materials, electrode shapes and modes show that the leakage field increases the static capacitance, reduces the effective piezoelectric coupling and the spacing between the two resonant frequencies, and activates many spurious modes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For hybrid {{electric}} vehicles, {{the batteries}} and the drive dc link {{may be at}} different voltages. The batteries are at low voltage to obtain higher volumetric efficiencies, and the dc link is at higher voltage to have higher efficiency on the motor side. Therefore, a power interface between the batteries and the drive’s dc link is essential. This power interface should handle power flow from battery to motor, motor to battery, external genset to battery, and grid to battery. This paper proposes a multi-power-port topology which is capable of handling multiple power sources and still maintains simplicity and features like obtaining high gain, wide load variations, lower output-current ripple, and capability of parallel-battery energy due to the modular structure. The scheme incorporates a transformer winding technique which drastically reduces the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor. Finally the proposed converter is applied to a induction motor drive.

40|$|Adverse {{environmental}} conditions have a detrimental impact on crop growth and development, and cause protein denaturation or misfolding. The binding protein (BiP) {{plays an important}} protective role by alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by misfolded proteins. In this study, we characterized three BiP genes (CaBiP 1, CaBiP 2, and CaBiP 3) in pepper, an economically important vegetable and spice species. The role of CaBiP 1 in plant tolerance to ER stress and adverse {{environmental conditions}} (including heat, salinity, osmotic and drought stress) were investigated. All the expected functional and signaling domains were detected in three BiP proteins, but the motifs and exon-intron distribution differed slightly in CaBiP 3. CaBiP 1 and CaBiP 2 were constitutively expressed in all the tested tissues under both normal and stressed conditions, whereas CaBiP 3 was mainly expressed following stress. Silencing of CaBiP 1 reduced pepper tolerance to ER stress and various environment stresses, and was accompanied by increased H 2 O 2 accumulation, MDA content, relative <b>electric</b> <b>leakage</b> (REL), water loss rate, {{and a reduction in}} soluble protein content and relative water content (RWC) in the leaves. Conversely, overexpression of CaBiP 1 in Arabidopsis enhanced tolerance to ER stress and multiple environment stresses, as demonstrated by an increase in germination rate, root length, survival rate, RWC, the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, and a decrease in water loss rate. Our results suggest that CaBiP 1 may contribute to plant tolerance to abiotic stresses by reducing ROS accumulation, increasing the water-retention ability, and stimulating UPR pathways and expression of stress-related genes...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the process of}} {{fabricating}} a narrow channel on Si/SiGe heterostructures containing a heavily doped boron layer. We use the photolithography technique for the Hall pattern and the e-beam lithography technique to define the narrow channel. Because the boron d-doping of the sample, we have to use a very strong wet-etching solution to do the mesa etching. The PMMA can not block the etching solution for mesa etching. Therefore, we transferred the narrow channel pattern to a Au/Ti metal layer which serves as both the etching mask and the gate. We successfully made a device with a 2 micro narrow channel. We investigated the electric properties of the device. The I-V characteristics at the room temperature and 11 K are measured, including the effect of the gate bias. From the result of our measurement, we found that: (1) the lowest resistance between ohmic contacts was 5 kohm at room temperature, and 80 kohm at 11 K. (2) the gate on the Si/SiGe heterostructure sample N 492 has a serious <b>electric</b> <b>leakage,</b> probably due to the heavy boron doping. 我們使用黃光微影配合電子束微影製程，在矽鍺異質接面樣品上製作微小通道元件。因為我們使用的樣品中有硼（Boron）的摻雜層，在蝕刻上需要用較強的蝕刻配方，造成無論是濕式蝕刻或者乾式蝕刻，電子束微影的光阻都無法抵擋，於是我們使用金來當作阻擋層，用乾蝕刻與濕蝕刻方式蝕刻出微小通道。以濕式及乾式兩種蝕刻互相配合，我們成功地做出寬度小於 2 micro通道的矽鍺微小結構。 我們也對元件做了一些基本的電性量測包括室溫與低溫（ 11 K）歐姆接點間的I-V關係，以及低溫（ 11 K）下外加偏壓的I-V關係與樣品的漏電流情形。經量測結果可知：(1) 歐姆接點間的電阻，在室溫最低可到 5 k歐姆，在低溫（ 11 K）最低可到 80 k歐姆。(2) 編號N 492 p-type SiGe異質結構樣品因為硼的重摻雜關係，產生了漏電流情形，並使得外加偏壓的效果不夠彰顯。中文摘要………………………………………I 英文摘要………………………………………II 致謝……………………………………………III 目錄……………………………………………IV 圖表索引………………………………………VI 第一章 簡介……………………………… 1 1. 1 矽鍺材料的介紹……………………… 1 1. 2 電子束微影術的介紹………………… 3 第二章 矽鍺(SiGe) 微小結構之製作……… 8 2. 1 樣品介紹……………………………… 8 2. 2 蝕刻技術……………………………… 11 2. 2. 1 濕蝕刻……………………………… 11 2. 2. 2 乾蝕刻……………………………… 16 2. 3 矽鍺(SiGe) 微小結構之製作程序與方法…… 27 2. 3. 1 黃光微影術上的製程……………………… 27 2. 3. 2 電子束微影術上的製程…………………… 31 第三章 矽鍺(SiGe) 微小結構之基本測量……… 41 第四章 結論與未來工作建議…………………… 54 參考資料………………………………………… 5...|$|E

40|$|Earthquake {{zones in}} the upper crust are usually more {{conductive}} than the surrounding rocks, and electrical geophysical measurements {{can be used to}} map these zones. Magnetotelluric (MT) measurements across fault zones that are parallel to the coast and not too far away can also give some important information about the lower crustal zone. This is because the long-period electric currents coming from the ocean gradually leak into the mantle, but the lower crust is usually very resistive and very little leakage takes place. If a lower crustal zone is less resistive it will be a leakage zone, and this can be seen because the MT phase will change as the ocean currents leave the upper crust. The San Andreas Fault is parallel to the ocean boundary and close enough {{to have a lot of}} extra ocean currents crossing the zone. The Loma Prieta zone, after the earthquake, showed a lot of ocean <b>electric</b> current <b>leakage,</b> suggesting that the lower crust under the fault zone was much more conductive than normal. It is hard to believe that water, which is responsible for the conductivity, had time to get into the lower crustal zone, so it was probably always there, but not well connected. If this is true, then the poorly connected water would be at a pressure close to the rock pressure, and it may play a role in modifying the fluid pressure {{in the upper}} crust fault zone. We also have telluric measurements across the San Andreas Fault near Palmdale from 1979 to 1990, and beginning in 1985 we saw changes in the telluric signals on the fault zone and east of the fault zone compared with the signals west of the fault zone. These measurements were probably seeing a better connection of the lower crust fluids taking place, and this may result in a fluid flow from the lower crust to the upper crust.

In order to make the bunch interval of 250 ns or more, the pre-buncher with a variable frequency of 2 - 4 MHz, is considered to be installed upstream of the SCRFQ. It is designed as the pre-buncher has two gaps with non-π mode. In order to make the bunching beam profile like a pseudo sawtooth-wave, the RF voltage synthesized three harmonic frequencies is applied to these gaps. Consequently, the pre-buncher has a compact size and no <b>leakage</b> <b>electric</b> field outside gaps, and can keep the RF voltage low. The beam test of this pre-buncher with a 2 MHz was performed using 16 O 4 + and 12 C 3 + beams. The clear bunch structure with a interval of 500 ns was obtained by the SSD set downstream of the SCRFQ. The results of the beam test are almost consistent with those of the beam simulation code...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} abiotic stresses that limits crop production in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Lentil (Lens culinaris L.), a valuable legume crop, is produced mainly rain-fed in Iran. An experiment was conducted to study the relationships between relative water content (RWC), cell membrane stability (CMS) and duration of growth period with grain yield of 11 advanced genotypes, varieties and a local genotype in the Ardabil Agriculture and Natural Resources research Station. Experimental design was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replication under both rain-fed and irrigated conditions. Combined ANOVA showed significant differences among all the evaluated traits. Significant differences between characters reveals that there are high variation between the traits studied. Means for characters under study showed that grain yield, RWC, CMS and duration of growth period decreased in rain-fed condition but cell membrane <b>leakage</b> (<b>electric</b> conductivity) increased. Correlation coefficients showed strongly positive relation between grain yield with RWC (r 0. 98 **), strongly negative and non significant CMS (r- 0. 32 ns) and strongly negative relation between grain yield and the days to maturity (r- 0. 78 **). The results of the experiment also revealed that there weren’t a strong relation between yield and calculated attributes for drought tolerance except RWC. Therefore, this character could be effective in evaluation of drought tolerance and identification of high yielding genotypes (ILL 6031, ILL 9893 and ILL 8095) ...|$|R
40|$|Ageing {{of outdoor}} {{insulation}} under low leakage currents are concerns {{for safety and}} reliability in transmission line operations. Overhead line elements such as insulators and ADSS (All Dielectric, Self-Supporting) cables are subject to <b>electric</b> fields, resultant <b>leakage</b> currents, and resulting surface discharges such as coronas and dry-band arcs. Under certain conditions, the normally benign long-term low current ageing effect may transform to more severe ageing forms, having a detrimental impact on the insulation materials and creating high rates of unexpected failures. In this thesis, a series of experimental studies are reported which have created low current discharges under variable electrical and environmental conditions. The electrical properties of resulting arcs are investigated {{and their impact on}} the insulation materials is analyzed. Based on the test results, new modelling approaches have been developed for the simulation of dry-band arcing activity. The respective 'Double Sinusoidal Model' and 'PSCAD simulation' are able to simulate the voltage and current traces of low current arcs, while the 'Triple Cylinder Model' is used to analyze the heat flow around the arcing region. Based on both experiment and simulation, the phenomenon of 'dry-band arc compression' is reproduced. Research confirms previous suggestions that such a compression process may lead to more aggressive damage on insulation surfaces, and could possibly accelerate the long-term ageing effect into a short-term hazard. As a result, this thesis supports the argument that processes controlling insulation lifetime may not be continual and gradual, but are determined by extreme events such as the occurrence of dry-band arc compression.

40|$|Silicon {{radiation}} detectors fabricated at the IMB-CNM (CSIC) Clean Room facilities {{using the}} most innovative techniques in detector technology are presented in this thesis. TCAD simulation comprises {{an important part in}} this work as becomes an essential tool to achieve exhaustive performance information of modelled detectors prior their fabrication and subsequent electrical characterization. Radiation tolerance is also investigated in this work using TCAD simulations through the potential and <b>electric</b> field distributions, <b>leakage</b> current and capacitance characteristics and the response of the detectors to the pass of different particles for charge collection efficiencies. Silicon detectors investigated in this thesis were developed for specific projects but also for applications in experiments which can benefit from their improved characteristics, as described in Chapter 1. Double-sided double type columns 3 D (3 D- 31 TC) detectors have been developed under the NEWATLASPIXEL project in the framework of the CERN RD 50 collaboration for the ATLAS Inner Detector upgrades and the introduction of a new pixel layer called Insertable B-Layer. The radiation tolerance of slim-edge ("edgeless") detectors, whose current terminating structure reduces the insensitive area of detectors to 50 μm, for close-to-beam experiments like the TOTEM experiment at HL-LHC, have been simulated under the EU TOSTER project. Ultra-thin 3 D detectors, which combine 3 D detector technology and thin membrane fabrication process, are also studied in this work. They provide an alternative to the present Neutral Particle Analyzers at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in the ions detection for plasma diagnosis, and they are also being used in neutron detection experiments after being covered with any layer containing 10 B whose high capture cross-section of thermal neutrons allows their detection through the emitted alpha. Finally, active-edge detectors have been studied for applications in X-ray beam positioning, X-ray sensors for beamstops and detectors with pad, microstrip and Medipix 2 designs for research purposes...|$|R
40|$|Using CdSe and CdS {{thin films}} {{as an active}} layer {{prepared}} by chemical bath deposition method (CBD), thin film transistors (TFT) have been fabricated and studied. There are two fabrication processes developed in this work for TFTs dependent on the substrates used. A procedure for the fabrication of TFTs on Si substrates and a procedure for devices on glass substrates will be presented. Both procedures are designed for the fabrication of TFTs with an inverted gate-staggered electrode configuration. The chemical bath deposition process developed has yielded CdSe-TFTs and CdS-TFTs on thermally grown oxide/Si substrate with very good performance. Typical values of mobility for those TFTs are about 10 cm 2 /V-s for CdSe-TFTs and 1 Cm 2 /V-s for CdS-TFTs with W = 200 mum and L = 20 mum. The ON-current values of the CdSe-TFTs and CdS-TFTs at a gate bias of 10 V and a source-drain voltage of 10 V are about 100 muA and 5 muA, respectively. The OFF-current values of the CdSe-TFTs and CdS-TFTs at the source-drain voltage of 10 V are less than 10 pA. The incorporation of the thermal oxidation process for the fabrication of TFTs described in the first procedure is useful for studying the properties and deposition of active semiconductor layers. However, {{it may not be}} suitable for large-scale production due to the high temperatures involved and the thermal requirements of the substrate. To reduce the process temperatures and the requirements for substrates, it is necessary to employ methods other than thermal oxidation for gate oxides. In this work, in addition to thermal oxidation, the anodization method will be used to form gate oxides for the second fabrication procedure on glass substrate. In addition, some samples were prepared with thin gate dielectric films by magnetron-sputtering method. The effects of anodization conditions {{on the quality of the}} anodic dielectric were investigated by measuring the breakdown <b>electric</b> field and <b>leakage</b> current density of the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors fabricated. Results of electrical measurements carried out on the CdSe-TFTs with A 12 O 3 and Ta 2 O 5 gate dielectrics showed field effect mobilities of 3. 4 and 0. 67 cm 2 /V-s and threshold voltages of 3. 2 V and 8. 2 V, respectively. Field effect mobilities of 0. 2 and 2 cm 2 /V-s and threshold voltages of 4. 3 and 5. 2 V were observed for CdS-TFTs, again with Al 2 O 3 and Ta 2 O 5 gate dielectrics.
