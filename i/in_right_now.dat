5000|$|In {{his review}} in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert said, [...] "I watched {{it the first time}} and knew it was a great film ... the subject of 'Synecdoche, New York' is nothing less than human life and how it works. Using a {{neurotic}} theater director from upstate New York, it encompasses every life and how it copes and fails. Think about it a little and, my god, it's about you. Whoever you are." [...] In 2009 Ebert wrote that the movie was the best of the decade. Manohla Dargis of the New York Times said, [...] "To say that {{it is one of the}} best films of the year or even one closest to my heart is such a pathetic response to its soaring ambition that I might as well pack it <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> ... Despite its slippery way with time and space and narrative and Mr. Kaufman’s controlled grasp of the medium, Synecdoche, New York is as much a cry from the heart as it is an assertion of creative consciousness. It’s extravagantly conceptual but also tethered to the here and now." [...] In the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano called the film [...] "wildly ambitious ... sprawling, awe-inspiring, heartbreaking, frustrating, hard-to-follow and achingly, achingly sad." ...|$|E

Single-payer advocates supported H.R. 676, proposed by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI). AARP released a statement explaining to its members why the organization was not supporting H.R. 676:Starting over with a new, [...] "single-payer" [...] program will not eliminate the problems Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP currently face, such as the spiraling costs of procedures and prescription medications, as well as technological advances that are often not comprehensively tested to be proven safe or effective before marketing. H.R. 676 {{does not address the}} problem of increasing health-care costs. Rather, it allows costs to continue to grow, which will result in unaffordable coverage.John Rother, AARP's former chief lobbyist, said the single-payer model would [...] "disrupt the system that is currently in place" [...] and [...] "would require a very significant tax increase." [...] But Rother admitted that {{it would be possible to}} design a system that would avoid these problems and function well. AARP's priorities now are to protect the current programs and implement the Affordable Care Act. Rother said that any effort to promote single payer would be undercutting health reform. Rother said.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} by Out magazine, {{talking about the}} lyrics, Lambert said: [...] "This song was an idea that started with Sarah Hudson and Ferras, who are two dear friends of mine. I've known them for years and we've written together a handful of times. This {{is the first time}} something has solidified for us, where I was like, 'This is it. Let's put this out.' It's great because every time we get in the studio, it's all laughter and ridiculousness. We {{have a lot of fun}} together." [...] Lambert said that the song is [...] "basically a mission statement"."That chorus, saying, if you think what I do and how I live is too much, I don't really give two fucks. You know, the world we're living <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is a little scary. There's a lot of hatred out there and a lot of negativity. Our country’s politically and socially divided. And to be able to put out a song that addresses everything, saying, 'Look, you may not like me, but I'm not going to let that take me down. I'm not going to let that ruin my day. I'm going to do me.' I think people want some of those self-strengths. It makes me feel good to listen to it, and hopefully it makes others feel good. It's not taking itself too serious—the lyrics are ridiculous and silly, and I think it'll give people a reason to smile." [...] When asked about how the song speak to where he is at mentally, he said: [...] "'Two Fux,' to me, kind of sums it up. I've been writing a lot in the past about chasing the original high—I was longing for something that was out of reach. And now with this project, I'm at a place in my life where I'm like, 'You know what, no—I'm cool.' I'm just going to do my shit and not really make any apologies for it—not really try to be such a people pleaser. I think everyone has these upswings and downswings in their life where they're trying to figure out where they're at, and right now I'm at a place of feeling a lot more self-assured." ...|$|E
5000|$|On February 24, 2016, West stated on Twitter {{that he was}} {{planning}} to release another album in the summer of 2016, tentatively called Turbo Grafx 16 in reference to the 1990s video game console of the same name. On June 3, 2016, West premiered the first single [...] "Champions" [...] off the GOOD Music album Cruel Winter, which was six minutes and featured Travis Scott, Big Sean, Gucci Mane, Desiigner, Yo Gotti, Quavo, and 2 Chainz. He told the radio host, Big Boy, that the beat had been in works {{for a year and a}} half. In June, West released a controversial video for [...] "Famous," [...] which depicted wax figures of several celebrities (including West, Kardashian, Taylor Swift, president and businessman Donald Trump, comedian Bill Cosby, and former president George W. Bush) sleeping nude in a shared bed. In August 2016, West embarked on the Saint Pablo Tour in support of The Life of Pablo. The performances featured a mobile stage suspended from the ceiling. West postponed several dates in October following the Paris robbery of his wife Kim Kardashian. On November 21, 2016, West cancelled the remaining 21 dates on the Saint Pablo Tour, following a week of no-shows, curtailed concerts and rants about politics. He was later admitted for psychiatric observation at UCLA Medical Center. He stayed hospitalized over the Thanksgiving weekend stemming from a temporary psychosis stemming from sleep deprivation and extreme dehydration. The current West seems to be based on trying to create a world that he wants his daughter, North, to grow up in. In an interview for Paper West states that all that time, all the seemingly sporadic actions and outbursts, he was fighting for his daughter Nori’s future “‘Lets just tap back into the real world for a second we can have children. Let’s be thankful, we can raise our kids, let’s be thankful. But how about we raise our kids in a truthful world, not a world based on brands and concepts of perception? Perception is not reality. When I look in Norths eyes, Im happy about every mistake Ive ever made. Im happy that I fought to bring some type of reality to this world we choose to stay <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> driven by brands and corporations." ...|$|E
5000|$|Miles’ work {{consists}} {{mainly of}} over-sized canvases, often stretching up to twenty-two {{feet in length}} and/or height. In addition to the larger pieces, the artist also finds himself drawn to stylized expressions on various sized canvas, linens, diptychs, triptychs and objects like cell phone cases, clothing and fashion accessories, recycled denim, newspapers, wood assemblage and most recently digital 3D. Miles' work {{has been described as}} [...] "a force of a Caribbean nature, completely unstoppable and his creativity absolutely relentless". And as [...] "a very prolific painter". He is said to be [...] "a hard worker, committed and passionate, excited and sincere, and his work is a reflection of these qualities. Being a father and a husband also informs his work and he strives to create a better place in which to live, no doubt for himself, and absolutely for the children he is raising so beautifully". While serious collectors can find themselves caught in a whirlwind of themes and series he has developed over the years, selections of his work are also available in print through Edition One Hundred.Miles is also that rare breed who is pursued by celebrities {{rather than the other way}} around, and he's a refreshingly down to earth person whose perspective is an inspiration to anyone who aspires to a creative career. His work is evocative and filled with rhythms and movement, life, and color. It's challenging and filled with depth and meaning.Regis is known for his work with drip painting and collage that is different and interesting. He plays with colors and shapes in a way that many other artists have not, creating unique and eye catching pieces with distinct messages for his audience. He creates art in a way that challenges the public, making them think and look a little bit closer.The thread running through this prolific painter’s work is strong, free-form brushstrokes, all manifestations of a confident spirit. Regis studied painting, singing and writing, worked as a singer in Trinidad, then pursued creative writing at USC.All of these influences are apparent in his work. Primitive figurative forms, often leaning toward abstraction, reflect his classic training. Dancing figures are in several pieces, while written statements on paintings draw on his creative writing background.His work has traces of his Trinidadian heritage. In a 2009 interview he spoke of a Trinidadian mythology series he has been working on:In Trinidad, there are Soucouyants, La Diablesses and Duennes. [...] I mean, it's based on Trinidadian folklore. So it's derived from Africa, our African heritage. Really just fascinating characters that we grew up in Trinidad hearing about. They are creatures of the night. He also spoke of his technique in the 2009 interview with The Art of The Interview:I tend to mix a lot of colors. At least, that's the direction I'm going <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> And also mix different textures. Not to give away my secrets or anything, but I mix oil-based paint with water-based paint a lot. So it's who I am, a whole lot of mixture of cultures and experiences and people and variations going on. So all is expressed on that canvas, the best way that I can, you know.|$|E
