50|$|Karol Franciszek Pollak (November 15, 1859 - December 17, 1928) was a Polish <b>electrotechnician,</b> {{inventor}} and businessman.|$|E
50|$|Bolesław Konorski (14 April 1892 - 12 February 1986) was a Polish engineer, <b>electrotechnician,</b> Rector of the Lodz University of Technology in 1952-53.|$|E
50|$|Graetz {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{investigate}} the propagation of electromagnetic energy. The Graetz number (Gz), a dimensionless number describing heat flow, is named after him. Also sometimes known by his name is the diode bridge rectifier circuit invented by Polish <b>electrotechnician</b> Karol Pollak and popularised by Leo Graetz in Elektronische Zeitung in 1897.|$|E
40|$|The first {{reference}} on {{this emerging}} interdisciplinary research {{area at the}} interface between materials science and biomedicine is written by pioneers in the field, who address the requirements, current status and future challenges. Focusing on inherently conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes and graphene, they adopt a systematic approach, covering all relevant aspects and concepts: synthesis and fabrication, properties, introduction of biological function, components of bionic devices and materials requirements. Established bionic devices, such as the bionic ear are examined, as are emerging areas of application, including use of organic bionic materials as conduits for bone re-growth, spinal cord injury repair and muscle regeneration. The whole is rounded off {{with a look at}} future prospects in sustainable energy generation and storage. Invaluable reading for materials scientists, polymer chemists, <b>electrotechnicians,</b> chemists, biologists, and bioengineers...|$|R
50|$|Edison, also {{traveling}} to Europe, sent Wangemann to Berlin, {{where he was}} to show the phonograph to Werner von Siemens. Von Siemens, a friend and business partner of Edison's, provided a special room for Wangemann, {{as well as a}} German mechanic to assist him while he toured Germany and Austria-Hungary. Wangemann made a number of experimental recordings of prominent musicians and individuals. He also demonstrated the phonograph and recordings to different groups. On September 18, he gave a demonstration to scientists and professors in Heidelberg and two days later, to a group of <b>electrotechnicians</b> in Frankfurt. Wangemann's behavior at both of these events provoked some criticism from the audience. In Heidelberg, where Edison was the guest of honor, he took over the address, during which some of his comments were viewed as out of turn. In Frankfurt, where he spoke to a wider audience in a packed hall, he condescendingly made them look unsophisticated and feel unworthy of his time.|$|R
50|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} a diode bridge {{is that the}} polarity of the output is the same regardless of the polarity at the input. The diode bridge circuit was invented by Polish <b>electrotechnician</b> Karol Pollak and patented on 14 Jan, 1896 under the number DRP 96564. It was later published in Elektronische Zeitung, vol. 25 in 1897 with annotation that German physicist Leo Graetz also was researching this matter at that time. Today the circuit is still often referred as Graetz circuit or Graetz bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Sophie {{is a young}} black-haired, pig-tailed {{girl who}} is the {{daughter}} of <b>electrotechnician</b> Mr. Karapolie. She was named after Jidéhem's own daughter. They both live in a villa in a quiet neighborhood outside the city, where they are aided by a butler, Joseph. Sophie has three friends, Starter and Pipette, who work as mechanics and Petit Bernard, a little boy who is two years younger than her and far more cowardly. Pipette furthermore owns a black car, Zoë, with a sentient mind.Many storylines revolve around criminals who want to steal the inventions of Sophie's father.|$|E
