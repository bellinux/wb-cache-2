500|$|Los Angeles had {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington's {{style of play}} complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. [...] "I could feel it tearing <b>inside.</b> <b>I</b> looked down, and my kneecap was hanging {{on the side of}} my leg." [...] Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.|$|E
500|$|The 100m at the DN Galan {{meeting in}} Stockholm saw Gay's first match-up {{of the year}} against Bolt. He {{surprised}} the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory, beating him with 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97seconds. This was {{only the second time}} Bolt had lost a 100m final – the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell (also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium). Gay broke Powell's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat. Gay chose not to overstate the significance of the win, acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness: [...] "It feels great to beat Usain but deep down <b>inside</b> <b>I</b> know he is not 100%. I look forward to beating him when he is". With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries, Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week, running a world leading time of 9.78seconds despite poor weather. A victory at the Memorial van Damme in 9.79seconds earned him the first Diamond Race Trophy for the 100m.|$|E

500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires <b>inside,</b> <b>I</b> can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the leg, {{the band}} members were having trouble {{adjusting}} to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother's Milk approached 500,000 units sold. Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling <b>inside.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't proud of who I was then." [...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea's arrest worsened Kiedis' impending charge in Virginia from the [...] "Positive Mental Octopus" [...] tour, for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.|$|E
2500|$|Then Australian coach Bob Dwyer, in The Winning Way, wrote that, [...] "I had noticed... {{that the}} American cover defence {{was intent on}} getting across to the winger, which meant it left huge holes <b>inside.</b> <b>I</b> told our players to try putting up a centre kick, which they did with resounding success." [...] Campese set up Andrew Slack for Australia's fourth try in this Test by utilising a centre kick as Slack {{streamed}} through the midfield.|$|E

2500|$|The first verse {{begins with}} Lopez singing, [...] "Nobody knows what I'm feeling <b>inside.</b> <b>I</b> find it so stupid {{so why should}} I hide that I love {{to make love to}} you baby." [...] The quick pace electro beat returns, revving up energy before Lopez goes into the chorus, [...] "I wanna dance and love and dance again." [...] Sara Gates of The Huffington Post said that the chorus line [...] "will surely get stuck in your head." [...] It has been {{suggested}} that the chorus was [...] "cheesy" [...] and weak, and ends up being [...] trumped by the pre-chorus, verses, overall production and fist-pumping beat. The song contains sexual innuendos, and Lopez sings the bridge with heartbreaking emotion. The song has been compared to Lopez's song [...] "Waiting For Tonight". Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly noted that Pitbull's lyrics [...] "Can't even show love 'cause they'll sue ya" [...] was a reference to Lindsay Lohan suing him for using a reference to her without her consent in his song [...] "Give Me Everything" [...] (2011).|$|E

2500|$|Nicola Roberts is one {{fifth of}} the band Girls Aloud. During her time with the girl group, she {{struggled}} with loneliness, due to living away from home in London, busy schedule, and media criticism of her image, eventually describing her time in the band as a [...] "blur". She became exhausted and found herself with two personalities, one being a [...] "normal" [...] girl and another {{to deal with the}} celebrity lifestyle, with which she was uncomfortable. Roberts claimed that the hardest aspect of being with the group was the media attention – which would constantly pick out flaws with her image. She said she [...] "just had to harden myself to it, actually, <b>inside,</b> <b>I</b> was dying". The album was inspired by her time performing with Girls Aloud – [...] "It would have been stupid for me to make an album that meant nothing." [...] For Roberts the album was about making a risky record, where there wasn't a guaranteed commercial success, explaining to The Guardian: [...] "It's taken every last bit of confidence just to release this record, or maybe I've just brainwashed myself into feeling more confident. I don't know if it's good, or if I've just told myself it's good." [...] On 6 May 2011 via her official website, Roberts confirmed that she had been developing a studio album ready for release, she said; ...|$|E
2500|$|On lap 146, Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish, Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, {{including}} Kenseth, remained in theirs.

I had a big old run on him and I went to the <b>inside.</b> <b>I</b> didn't try to make no late move and {{make some kind of}} surprise or anything. I just kind of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass and I tried to recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack." [...] When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt, Jr. was unrepentant and said, [...] "Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field." [...] The drivers and fans did not buy Earnhardt Jr.'s excuse and to this day Vickers, the drivers, and fans {{do not believe that the}} crash was accidental. Later that week, Earnhardt Jr. gave a public apology for the incident and decided that he should have thought before he made his move that obviously would have crashed Vickers.|$|E
