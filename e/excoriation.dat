Also known as Welcome Home Elvis, the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed {{in front of an}} audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 fee for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{psychiatric}} conditions {{encountered in}} dermatology include dermatitis artefacta, trichotillomania (TTM) and neurotic <b>excoriations.</b> For these disorders, the primary pathologic condition involves the psyche; therefore, any cutaneous findings are self-induced. Herein, we review common primary psychiatric conditions in dermatology - dermatitis artefacta, neurotic <b>excoriations</b> and TTM - and examine their epidemiology, clinical presentation, differential {{diagnosis and treatment}} strategies. For all primary psychiatric disorders, the most effective underlying strategy is to first establish a strong therapeutic rapport with the patient. Various pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies can then be attempted afterwards to successfully manage these patients...|$|R
40|$|Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa, {{a genetic}} mechanobullous disease, is {{characterized}} by pruritus, lichenified or nodular prurigo-like lesions, occasional trauma-induced blistering, <b>excoriations,</b> milia, nail dystrophy and albopapuloid lesions, appearing at birth or later. Scarring and prurigo are most prominent on the shins. Treatment is unsatisfactory. We report three such cases: two of them first cousins, are described with history of blisters since childhood, followed by intensely pruritic lesions predominantly on the shins, and dystrophy of toenails, but no albopapuloid lesions or milia. Intact blisters were present in one case, and <b>excoriations</b> were seen in the other two. All of them showed encouraging response to cryotherapy...|$|R
25|$|Stage II: Partial {{thickness}} loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer {{with a red}} pink wound bed, without slough. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum-filled blister. Presents as a shiny or dry shallow ulcer without slough or bruising. This stage {{should not be used}} to describe skin tears, tape burns, perineal dermatitis, maceration or <b>excoriation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Caporetto {{has been}} the subject of a number of books. The Swedish author F.J. Nordstedt (pseud. Christian Braw) wrote about the battle in his novel Caporetto. The bloody {{aftermath}} of Caporetto was vividly described by Ernest Hemingway in his novel A Farewell to Arms. Curzio Malaparte wrote an <b>excoriation</b> of the battle in his first book, Viva Caporetto, published in 1921. It was censored by the state and suppressed; it was finally published in 1980.|$|E
500|$|The Monster and Other Stories was {{the last}} {{collection}} of Crane's work to be published during his lifetime. [...] In the mid-20th century, the novella received a resurgence of critical attention, especially in regard to studies of race relations in late 19th-century New York. [...] Critic Chester L. Wolford wrote that the story [...] "reveals truths not socially accepted for almost another hundred years. [...] The story is, indeed, an <b>excoriation</b> of social conditions for the blacks, but more important... it is an <b>excoriation</b> of all communities, all societies, in all places and all times." [...] African-American author Ralph Ellison called The Monster, alongside Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, [...] "one of {{the parents of the}} modern American novel". [...] In a 1999 article, critic James Nagel stated that [...] "no other work of short fiction in the decade was more important thematically, and nothing until William Faulkner's [...] "The Bear" [...] so enriched the genre of the United States. [...] Screenwriter and director Albert Band adapted Crane's novella for the 1959 film Face of Fire, starring Cameron Mitchell as Dr. Trescott and James Whitmore as Johnson. [...] Unlike in the original story, Johnson was depicted as white, and his first name was changed from Henry to Monk.|$|E

The Chief of the Materiel Division's Photographic Section, Maj. George W. Goddard, flew co-pilot in aircraft No. 81 to document the mission using a specially-modified Graflex camera. Reporters were also invited to accompany the mission. They included Hanson Baldwin, possibly because of his earlier <b>excoriation</b> of the [...] "Shasta Disaster," [...] and a radio crew from the National Broadcasting Company (which on 4 April 1937, had made a live six-minute broadcast from a B-17 at Langley Field) to broadcast from aboard the lead aircraft while it made the interception.|$|E

2500|$|Periwound {{skin damage}} caused by {{excessive}} amounts of exudate and other bodily fluids can perpetuate the non-healing status of chronic wounds. Maceration, <b>excoriation,</b> dry (fragile) skin, hyperkeratosis, callus and eczema are frequent problems [...] that interfere with the integrity of periwound skin. They can create a gateway for infection as well as cause wound edge deterioration preventing wound closure.|$|E
2500|$|An ulcer ( [...] ; from Latin ulcus, [...] "ulcer, sore") is a {{break in}} the skin or mucous {{membrane}} with loss of surface tissue and the disintegration and necrosis of epithelial tissue. A mucosal ulcer is an ulcer which specifically occurs on a mucous membrane. An ulcer is a tissue defect which has penetrated the epithelial-connective tissue border, with its base at a deep level in the submucosa, or even within muscle or periosteum. An ulcer is a deeper breach of the epithelium than an erosion or an <b>excoriation,</b> and involves damage to both epithelium and lamina propria.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 September 1945, he {{delivered}} an address billed as [...] "from work {{to home and}} from home to work". The speech, prefaced by an <b>excoriation</b> of the conservative opposition, provoked an ovation by declaring that [...] "we've passed social reforms to make the Argentine people proud to live where they live, once again." [...] This move fed growing rivalries against Perón and on 9 October 1945, {{he was forced to}} resign by opponents within the armed forces. Arrested four days later, he was released due to mass demonstrations organised by the CGT and other supporters; 17 October was later commemorated as Loyalty Day. His paramour, Eva Duarte, became hugely popular after helping organize the demonstration; known as [...] "Evita", she helped Perón gain support with labour and women's groups. She and Perón were married on 22 October.|$|E
40|$|A 63 -year-old Caucasian man {{presented}} with a two-month history of an intensely pruritic, symmetric and polymorphous skin eruption. His past medical history was unremarkable. On examination, we observed multiple papu-les, vesicles, pustules and crusted <b>excoriations</b> on an erythematous base, especially over the buttocks, legs and arms (Figure 1). The oral and genital mucosas were spared. Nikolsky’s sign was negative. Tzanck smear showed abundant eosinophils with absence of acantholytic cells. Histopathological exami-nation revealed eosinophilic spongiosis and intraepider-mal vesicles filled with eosinophils and neutrophils (Figure 2). Direct immunofluorescence microscopy sho-wed intercellular deposits of IgG (Figure 3). High titers of circulating anti-desmoglein 1 autoantibodies were demonstrated by immunoblot study. The remaining workup, which included blood tests, imagiologic stu-dies and gastrointestinal endoscopy, was normal. The patient was treated with 100 mg/day dapso-ne and showed an excellent response. After a year, he was free of the disease on a maintenance dose of 50 mg dapsone daily.

40|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} {{and environmental}} factors, including the gut microbiota, {{have been suggested}} as major factors {{in the development and}} progression of atopic dermatitis. Hyperlipidemic human APOC 1 +/+ transgenic mice display many features of human atopic dermatitis, such as scaling, lichenification, <b>excoriations,</b> and pruritus, along with a disturbed skin barrier function. Cytokine analysis of serum shows an increase of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL) - 12 p 40, IL- 6, and IL- 1 α, but lower levels of interferon-γ. These mice also display aspects of colitis evident from macroscopic and histological abnormalities. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the intestine shows up-regulation of several genes associated with mast cells and eosinophils and this observation was confirmed by demonstrating increased numbers of IgE+ and FcRε+ mast cells in the colon and in the skin. Oral treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826 resulted in decreased numbers of mast cells in the colon. Moreover, this L. plantarum strain ameliorated skin pathology, evident from improved skin barrier integrity, absence of skin thickening, and less <b>excoriations.</b> These results suggest that modulation of intestinal immune homeostasis contributes to the suppression of atopic dermatitis. © 2015 Wageningen Academic Publishers...|$|R

The medical testimony, though given by the most distinguished consulting expert of the city, was entirely inconclusive. The body, the expert testified, showed evident marks of violence. There was a distinct lesion of the oesophagus and a decided <b>excoriation</b> of the fibula. The mesodenum was gibbous. There was a certain quantity of flab in the binomium and the proscenium was wide open.|$|E

The women (their noses in a chronic state of <b>excoriation</b> from smelling-salts) were always primed and loaded for a swoon, and ready to go off with hair- triggers. The two elder detached the Odd Girl on all expeditions that were considered doubly hazardous, and she always established the reputation of such adventures by coming back cataleptic. If Cook or Streaker went overhead after dark, we knew we should presently hear a bump on the ceiling; and this took place so constantly, that {{it was as if a}} fighting man were engaged to go about the house, administering a touch of his art which I believe is called The Auctioneer, to every domestic he met with.|$|E

50|$|Because athlete's foot may itch, it {{may also}} elicit the scratch reflex, causing the host to scratch the {{infected}} area before he or she realizes it. Scratching can further damage the skin and worsen the condition by allowing the fungus to more easily spread and thrive. The itching sensation associated with athlete's foot can be so severe that it may cause hosts to scratch vigorously enough to inflict <b>excoriations</b> (open wounds), which are susceptible to bacterial infection. Further scratching may remove scabs, inhibiting the healing process.|$|R

A sedative antihistamine may be a useful adjunct for pruritic patients, since it helps patients to sleep at night, thus limiting nocturnal scratching and <b>excoriations.</b> Antimicrobial agents often are used if an infection is suspected to be precipitating or complicating exfoliative dermatitis. Other drugs specifically indicated for management of underlying cause of exfoliative dermatitis may be necessary.|$|R
60|$|The trees grew wild, {{sometimes}} sturdily {{like our}} oaks, and sometimes gnarled and twisted like our seaside cedars, {{and in every}} state of <b>excoriation.</b> The bark is taken from them each seventh year, and it begins to be taken long before the first seventh.
