The Catholic University of Portugal, the oldest non-state-run university (concordat status), was instituted by decree of the Holy See and is recognized by the Portuguese State since 1971.

[...] <b>Higher</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> was also restructured, {{and there was a}} general tendency there to emphasize [...] elite institutions. This rapid expansion of mass higher education has resulted in not only a strain in teaching resources but also in higher unemployment rates among graduates. The creation of private universities, not under governmental control, remains slow and its future uncertain. The restructuring of higher education, {{in the words of one}} academic [...] "has created a clearly escalating social stratification pattern among institutions, stratified by geography, source of funding, administrative unit, as well as by functional category (e.g., comprehensive, law, medical, etc.)." [...] Thus, although recent reform has arguably improved over-all educational quality, they have created new, different issues of equity and efficiency that will need to be addressed as the century proceeds.|$|E
