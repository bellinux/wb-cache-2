40|$|Horizontal {{acoustic}} Doppler current profilers (H-ADCPs) can {{be employed}} to estimate river discharge based on water level measurements and flow velocity array data across a river transect. A new method is presented that accounts for the dip in velocity near the water surface, which is caused by sidewall effects that decrease with the width to depth ratio of a channel. A boundary layer model is introduced to convert single-depth velocity data from the H-ADCP to specific discharge. The parameters of the model include the local roughness length and a <b>dip</b> <b>correction</b> factor, which accounts for the sidewall effects. A regression model is employed to translate specific discharge to total discharge. The method was tested in the River Mahakam, representing a large river of complex bathymetry, where part of the flow is intrinsically three-dimensional and discharge rates exceed 8000 m 3 s- 1. Results from five moving boat ADCP campaigns covering separate semidiurnal tidal cycles are presented, three of which are used for calibration purposes, whereas the remaining two served for validation of the method. The <b>dip</b> <b>correction</b> factor showed a significant correlation with distance {{to the wall and}} bears a strong relation to secondary currents. The sidewall effects appeared to remain relatively constant throughout the tidal cycles under study. Bed roughness length is estimated at periods of maximum velocity, showing more variation at subtidal than at intratidal time scales. Intratidal variations were particularly obvious during bidirectional flow conditions, which occurred only during conditions of low river discharge. The new method was shown to outperform the widely used index velocity method by systematically reducing the relative error in the discharge estimate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{ordinary}} {{differential equation}} for velocity distribution in open channel flows is presented {{based on an}} analysis of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and a log-wake modified eddy viscosity distribution. This proposed equation allows to predict the velocity-dip-phenomenon, i. e. the maximum velocity below the free surface. Two different degrees of approximations are presented, a semi-analytical solution of the proposed ordinary differential equation, i. e. the full dip-modified-log-wake law and a simple dip-modified-log-wake law. Velocity profiles of the two laws and the numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation are compared with experimental data. This study shows that the <b>dip</b> <b>correction</b> is not efficient for a small Coles' parameter, accurate predictions require larger values. The simple dip-modified-log-wake law shows reasonable agreement and seems to be an interesting tool of intermediate accuracy. The full dip-modified-log-wake law, with a parameter for dip-correction obtained from an estimation of dip positions, provides accurate velocity profiles...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a residual shot profile migration technique, which consists of dip-corrected residual normal moveout (NMO) and depth restretching. The dip-corrected residual NM 0 equation and the depth restretching equation were derived by generalizing Al-Yahya’s residual NM 0 equation. Using the dip-correction residual NM 0 equation, velocity errors can be estimated more accurately than without the <b>dip</b> <b>correction</b> term in the residual NM 0 equation. Resid-ual shot profile migration was applied to migrated prestack data {{in a manner similar}} to conventional processing by cascading residual velocity analysis, residual NMO, and stack and depth stretching. With residual migration, we can either avoid remigration of the original prestack data or reduce the number of iterations required to produce a satisfactory image. Re-sidual migration is efficient enough to be implemented on a workstation. Significant improvement in imaging to cases (a pinchout and salt top and bottom) is demonstrated using synthetic and field data examples...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of bed shear stress in large river systems {{may serve to}} better estimate alluvial sediment transport to the coastal ocean. Here we explore {{the possibility of using}} a horizontally deployed acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) to monitor bed shear stress, applying a prescribed boundary layer model, previously used for discharge estimation. The model parameters include the local roughness length and a <b>dip</b> <b>correction</b> factor to account for sidewall effects. Both these parameters depend on river stage and on the position in the cross-section, and were estimated from shipborne ADCP data. We applied the calibrated boundary layer model to obtain bed shear stress estimates over the measuring range of the HADCP. To validate the results, co-located coupled ADCPs were used to infer bed shear stress, both from Reynolds stress profiles and from mean velocity profiles. From HADCP data collected over a period of 1. 5 years, a time series of width profiles of bed shear stress was obtained for a tidal reach of the Mahakam River, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. A smaller dataset covering 25 hours was used for comparison with results from the coupled ADCPs. The bed shear stress estimates derived from Reynolds stress profiles appeared to be strongly affected by local effects causing upflow and downflow, which are not included in the boundary layer model used to derive bed shear stress with the horizontal ADCP. Bed shear stresses from the coupled ADCP are representative of a much more localized flow, while those derived with the horizontal ADCP resemble the net effect of the flow over larger scales. Bed shear stresses obtained from mean velocity profiles from the coupled ADCPs show a good agreement between the two methods, and highlight the robustness of the method to uncertainty in the estimates of the roughness length...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Computer scienceExploring the {{subsurface}} {{is today}} mostly done by researching seismic imaging thoroughly before attempting to bore exploration wells. By applying seismic attributes (imaging filters), we can highlight {{certain aspects of}} the seismic, which will help geoscientists to determine with better certainty potential reservoirs. Faults are an important feature in reservoir identification as oil is likely to emigrate via them. By highlighting faults with seismic attribute, it is possible to create three-dimensional models and through advance simulations a better understanding is achieved. However, achieving a detailed image of a faulted area can be difficult as larger faults can overshadow minor faults, parallel or perpendicular. This is especially hard considering a static filter operator size that can be too large to pick up the smaller faults. In this work, we propose to adjust the filter operator size according to the frequency content of the seismic, by adapting the operator size according to the current filter position. We aim to achieve higher amounts of detail in fault detection using a method based on the Sobel method. We will also investigate the chaotic nature of the seismic to determine if the use of <b>dip</b> <b>correction</b> is needed. These are all novel methods in the approach to fault estimation in seismic. Our implementation is done in MATLAB and tested on a dataset in the North Sea offshore Netherlands, F 3, which has a heavily faulted area due to salt tectonics. We perform a vertical frequency analysis using the discrete Fourier transform to determine an operator size that is used in a horizontal frequency analysis using variance. To avoid picking up stratigraphy, we use dip guiding that let us filter along the different layers of the earth. This helps avoid geological noise detection. However, in chaotic areas, such as salt domes, we avoid using dip guided filtering, as there are no layers to follow, leading to a possible false representation. With the use of linear interpolation, we want to capture small details that otherwise would be absent. To better represent the faults in our image, we apply a vertical mean smoothing filter with neighboring values. This works due to the vertical nature of fault features. Evaluating all the stages in our algorithm, we find that the computational complexity is bounded by O(N 2). The approach of an adaptive operator size for a Sobel based edge detection to achieve a more detailed image proves to be successful as it surpasses the industry standard for fault detection.   Some of the larger faults are weaker in value than in Petrel. However, the noise in between the faults has been reduced substantially and smaller faults parallel and perpendicular have emerged. Ultimately giving a more realistic and complete representation of the fault networks present in the sub-surface...|$|E

40|$|The common {{reflecting}} element (CRE) {{method is}} an interesting alternative to the familiar methods of common midpoint (CMP) stack or migration to zero offset (MZO). Like these two methods, the CRE method aims at constructing a stacked zero-offset section from a set of constant-offset sections. However, it requires no more knowledge about the generally laterally inhomogeneous subsurface model than the near-surface values of the velocity field. In {{addition to being a}} tool to construct a stacked zero-offset section, the CRE method simultaneously obtains information about the laterally inhomogeneous macrovelocity model. An important feature of the CRE method {{is that it does not}} suffer from pulse stretch. Moreover, it gives an alternative solution for conflicting dip problems. In the 1 -D case, CRE is closely related to the optical stack. For the price of having to search for two data-derived parameters instead of one, the CRE method provides important advantages over the conventional CMP stack. Its results are similar to those of the MZO process, which is commonly implemented as an NMO correction followed by a <b>dip</b> moveout (DMO) <b>correction</b> applied to the original constant-offset section. The CRE method is based on 2 -D kinematic considerations only and is not an amplitude-preserving process...|$|R
40|$|Two seismic {{reflection}} profiles {{acquired by}} Xstrata Canada in the Noranda mining camp were reprocessed and interpreted {{with the objective}} of providing key information on the geologic contacts and structures associ-ated with volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits at depth. The Amulet and Ribago seismic profiles run approximately from east to west and cross the volcanic rocks of the Noranda formation, which host most of the ore deposits in this camp. The seismic data interpretation relies strongly on a detailed three-dimensional geologic model built from an extensive number of exploration boreholes available in this area and is further sup-ported by physical rock property measurements from in situ borehole logging data. Some reflections observed on the Amulet and Ribago seismic profiles correlate with rhyolite/andesite or silicified-andesite/andesite con-tacts that host the prospective exhalites of the Noranda formation. In particular, the silicified-andesite/andes-ite contact hosting the C-contact exhalite is imaged clearly down to a vertical depth of 1, 100 m along the Ribago profile. The processing sequence included <b>dip</b> moveout (DMO) <b>corrections</b> and poststack migration. The seismic data reprocessing allowed the identification of two diffractions that correlate with known sulfide bodies intersected in boreholes located close to the Ribago profile.

40|$|SUMMARY Conscious rats with two-kidney one dip Goldblatt {{hypertension}} had the constricting dip removed during continuous {{infusion of}} either dextrose, saralasin, or captopril. Other dextrose-infused animals underwent {{removal of the}} ischemic kidney or a sham procedure. Direct arterial blood pressure (BP) was recorded throughout the 15 -hour preoperative and subsequent 24 -hour postoperative period. Rats were studied in the "early " phase (1 - 3 weeks duration) or "chronic " phase (> 4 months) of hypertension. Animals sub-jected to a sham procedure returned to preoperative BP values. The BP of animals undipped or nephrec-tomlzed {{did not return to}} previous hypertensive levels. Instead, a biphasic response was seen where BP par-tially recovered from an operative fall and then slowly declined to normal at 24 hours; this effect occurred in both stages of hypertension. At 24 hours, removal of the ischeraic kidney was as effective as removal of the con-stricting <b>dip</b> in the <b>correction</b> of both eariy and chronic phase hypertension. Rats infused with saralasin or cap-topril demonstrated an acute (within 2 hours) and sustained fall in BP, but not to nonnotensive levels. This fall was significant In all animals (p < 0. 01) apart from chronic phase rats infused with saralasin where no signifi-cant fall was seen. Although animals infused with saralasin or captopril commenced at a lower preoperative BP, the biphasic pattern of response to undipping was identical to that of dextrose-infused undipped rats. Thus, sustained inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system did not modify the correction of hypertension pro...|$|R
