25|$|WFM members {{walked out}} of the ore {{processing}} mills at Telluride on 1 September 1903, for a reduction in the workday from 12 hours to 8. The mill shutdowns caused a shutdown of most of the mines which <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> send their ore to be processed. The ore mill for the Tom Boy mine tried to reopen with a nonunion workforce, but the WFM struck the Tom Boy mine, and posted picketers armed with pistols and rifles around the Tom Boy, preventing strikebreakers from entering.|$|E
25|$|Olmsted also {{designed}} the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits {{just north of}} the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, the United Nations General Assembly {{passed a}} {{resolution}} condemning the ROC government for its actions and guerrilla warfare inside Burma. Finally, an agreement was reached between Taipei, Yangon and Bangkok for evacuation of all Kuomintang irregular forces under command of General Li Mi to Taiwan. Civil Air Transport transported 5,583 Kuomintang soldiers and 1,040 dependents to Taiwan. The majority of these guerrilla forces were Muslim and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> worship in their new Taiwan home and so they started to construct the Longgang Mosque in Zhongli in 1964 and was completed three years later in 1967. There are around 200 Muslim families living around this area with most of them belongs to Ma family clans. There are numerous Halal Yunnan, Burmese and Thai restaurants around the area as well.|$|E
500|$|On November 21, 1945, the WRA closed Manzanar, {{the sixth}} camp to be closed. Although the incarcerees {{had been brought}} to the Owens Valley by the United States Government, they had to leave the camp and travel to their next {{destinations}} on their own. [...] The WRA gave each person $25 ($ today), one-way train or bus fare, and meals to those who had less than $600 ($ today). [...] While many left the camp voluntarily, a significant number refused to leave because they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go after having lost everything when they were forcibly uprooted and removed from their homes. As such, they had to be forcibly removed once again, this time from Manzanar. Indeed, those who refused to leave were generally removed from their barracks, sometimes by force, even if they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E

Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him. Boyle later said that Ike told him, [...] "'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight'...I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open."

2500|$|The Model 620A began {{production}} in 1940. [...] The main {{difference between the}} 620 and the 620A was how the stock attaches. [...] The 620A used a long draw bolt {{through the end of}} the stock and did away with the receiver and trigger plate tangs used on the 620. [...] Without the trigger tang, a flat main spring <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> attach and the 620A had a shortened trigger housing using a coil main spring. [...] Civilian production of the Model 620A halted during World War II but continued afterwards until 1955.|$|E
2500|$|During {{their time}} together, Bacall learned Douglas had no money, {{and that he}} once {{spent the night in}} jail since he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> sleep.

[...] Sometimes, just to see him, she would drag a friend or her mother to the {{restaurant}} where he worked as a busboy and waiter. He told her his dream was to someday bring his family to New York to see him on stage. During that period she fantasized about someday sharing her personal and stage lives with Douglas, but would later be disappointed: [...] "Kirk did not really pursue me. He was friendly and sweet--enjoyed my company--but I was clearly too young for him", the eight-years-younger Bacall later wrote.|$|E

2500|$|AF Ser. No. 52-2827 – Pima Air & Space Museum, {{adjacent}} to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. This aircraft {{was the final}} B-36 built, named [...] "The City of Fort Worth", and loaned {{to the city of}} Fort Worth, Texas on 12 February 1959. It sat on the field at the Greater Southwest International Airport until that airfield was closed and the property was redeveloped as a business park {{adjacent to}} Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Some attempts were made to begin restoration at that location through the early 1970s. It then moved to the short-lived Southwest Aero Museum, which was located between the former Carswell Air Force Base (now Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth) and the former General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin) assembly plant, where it was originally built; some restoration took place while at the plant. As Lockheed Martin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> display the finished aircraft, and local community efforts in Fort Worth to build a facility to house and maintain the massive aircraft fell short, the NMUSAF retook possession of the aircraft and it was transported to Tucson, Arizona for loan to the Pima Air & Space Museum. It was fully restored and reassembled at that museum, just south of Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, and is displayed at that location.|$|E
