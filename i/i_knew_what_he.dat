25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Flynt won a Supreme Court decision, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, {{after being}} sued by Reverend Jerry Falwell in 1983, over an {{offensive}} ad parody in Hustler {{that suggested that}} Falwell's first sexual encounter was with his mother in an out-house. Falwell sued Flynt, citing emotional distress caused by the ad. The decision clarified that public figures cannot recover damages for [...] "intentional infliction of emotional distress" [...] based on parodies. After Falwell's death, Flynt said despite their differences, he and Falwell had become friends over the years, adding, [...] "I always appreciated his sincerity even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was selling and he knew what I was selling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E

60|$|He had {{gathered}} from my mysterious manner that I was a detective. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was thinking, {{and it made}} me worse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like a bloodhound," [...] {{said the}} {{landlord}} impressively; [...] "just watch him. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was directly I clapped eyes on him." ...|$|E
60|$|My heart leaped with gladness, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had in mind, and I {{gave him}} the bearings—west-north-west, and five hundred miles away.|$|E

60|$|Buck {{reaches in}} his pocket and hands me a key. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant before he spoke. Confounded old buccaneer--I knew what he meant. They don't make them any better than Buck.|$|E
60|$|MISS WILLOUGHBY. A soldier? (Nervously) I wish {{it may not}} be that impertinent {{recruiting}} sergeant. I {{passed him}} in the street to-day. He closed one of his eyes at me and then quickly opened it. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{seem to feel}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks. And <b>I</b> should think, {{with all}} the time you spent with him, you'd know it," [...] she said, [...] "yourself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There you are, then," [...] {{said the}} captain, triumphantly. [...] "What {{is more likely}} than that they should think the same of each other? Besides, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks; <b>I</b> can read him like a book." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{started to}} find that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant. Till that moment, in my Second State, I had learned no French, and didn't know I could speak any. But I {{recognised}} the words quite well {{as soon as he}} uttered them. My lost knowledge reasserted itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's another!" [...] said he, poking {{the fire}} savagely, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant. One cannot put steam-heat in houses where Queen Elizabeth slept. The steady beat of a night-mail, {{whirling}} down the valley, recalled me to business. [...] "What about the Great Buchonian?" [...] I said.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant. The {{old man was}} exhausted. For much of {{the period}} of our flight either Ghak or I had half {{supported}} him on the march.

6000|$|This convulsed {{the bold}} things with laughter. When {{they could get}} their breath, one of them said, [...] "Pshaw! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> up for: preaching on the Common. Say, young feller! don't you want to hold a prayer-meetin' here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was so,' exclaimed Theodora. 'There were {{places where}} I said to myself, [...] "This cannot be his; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would have said," [...] {{and yet it}} was too forcible and {{sensible}} to have been written by any one else.' ...|$|R
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had found. From {{the first}} the blue-grey {{notepaper}} {{had had a}} familiar look. I recognized it now. It was Cynthia's letter, that damning document which I had been mad enough to read to him in London. His prediction that the luck would change had come amazingly true.|$|E
60|$|He disgusted me much {{while with}} him, for when a horrid blowfly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly {{for a few}} moments between his finger and thumb, and before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it.|$|E
60|$|Such {{is nearly}} all of my remembrance of that momentous occasion. I had caught the one glimpse of our first {{lieutenant}} in converse with their captain and another officer, when a naked seaman came charging at me. He had raised a pike above his shoulder ere <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was about, and my senses left me.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But {{what is the}} use of {{his coming}} to me? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has got to say just as if it were said. It's all very well preaching sermons to good people, but nothing ever was got by preaching to people who ain't good.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I had {{not seen}} Baron Pointdexter, {{and did not know}} what course he would take--whether he would think it best to hush the matter up altogether, or to lay a {{complaint}} before the king; and, until <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was going to do, it seemed to me best that I should hold my tongue, altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{begged me}} never {{to look at}} it at all. He said he was trying a low experiment. Of course <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant and I entreated him to let me just for curiosity take a peep. But he was firm, he {{declared}} he couldn't bear the thought that a woman like me should see him in the depths." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Taunton, [...] "I didn't {{intend to}} have any blamed Percy trying to turn my girl's head, until <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant.

6000|$|... "But I do have {{everything}} to do with them," [...] she replied; [...] "that's what being a medium means. However, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> needs better than you do. He wants to prove that the messages are supra-normal. Very well, I am ready for any test." ...|$|R
