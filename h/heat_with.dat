40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} using different sources of heat on the chemical composition and microbial quality of milk was studied. Raw cow, goat and sheep milk were <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> charcoal, gas and solar energy at 99 ºC for 12 min, cooled to 20 ºC and chemical (fat, protein, total solids, ash (titratable acidity), vitamin C) composition {{as well as}} microbiological examination (total viable bacteria count) were carried out. Results showed that fat, total solids and ash contents w ere high in cow milk <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> solar energy, while protein content was high when milk was <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> gas, and the titratable acidity was high in milk <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> charcoal and gas. The fat, total solids and ash contents of goat milk w ere high when milk was <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> gas, while the protein content and titratable acidity were high when milk was <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> solar energy. The fat contents of sheep milk was high when milk was <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> gas, while the protein and total solids content were high in milk <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> solar energy, and ash content and titratable acidity were high in milk <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> charcoal. Vitamin C content was high for all milks when <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> solar energy, while the total viable bacteria count was high in milks of all species when <b>heated</b> <b>with</b> charcoal.

5|$|As the {{campaign}} entered its final week, polls showed Specter and Sestak {{at a dead}} <b>heat,</b> <b>with</b> different surveys reporting contradictory findings over which candidate maintained a slight edge.

In both cases, the lead fell within the survey's margin of error. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall poll, said that Sestak improved because his television commercials were resonating with voters on three fronts: the arguments that Specter switched parties for solely political reasons, that he consistently voted for Republican policies and that he had been in office too long.|$|E
