Usability evaluation allows assessing whether the product under evaluation is efficient enough (Are the users able to carry out their task while expending reasonable resources such as time, cognitive or physical demand), effective enough (Can the user complete the tasks they are supposed to perform with the tool? Is their performance complete and accurate?) and sufficiently satisfactory for the users (What is the users’ attitude towards the system? Do they experience discomfort?). For this assessment to be objective, {{there is a need for}} measurable goals (for instance in terms of <b>easiness</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> or of learning) that the system must achieve.That kind of goal is called a usability goal (or also usability requirement).

The LMS software usually provides the facility to do the eLearning activities, such as giving a quiz to the students, sending the assignments to the lecturer, and grading the assignments.

The study was conducted at the Drug Information Center (DIC) of the College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. One hundred questions were answered using both sources and the results for each question were determined. The mean time required to find the answer was 1. 70 ± 1. 19 and 5. 05 ± 4. 52 min, using DRUGDEX® and "ALTAVISTA" respectively. In terms of <b>easiness</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> DRUGDEX ® easily answered 78 % of questions versus 55 % answered easily by "ALTAVISTA" (p= 0. 002). No statistically significant differences were found in the comprehensiveness (p= 0. 545), and breadth of information (p= 0. 102). Regarding comprehensiveness 77 % versus 73 % of the questions were well covered by DRUGDEX® and "ALTAVISTA" respectively. While breadth of information (availability of answers) was 77 % versus 86 % with DRUGDEX® and "ALTAVISTA” respectively. The study concluded that DRUGDEX® is a faster, more efficient search source than "ALTAVISTA" search engine because it provides the answers more quickly and it is easier than "ALTAVISTA" search engine however, DRUGDEX® cost per year is much higher than "ALTAVISTA" search engine.
