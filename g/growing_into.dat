Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him.|$|E

After he leaves the room, the metal vertebra begins to spin, <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> what looks like the beginnings of a metallic spine. Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
5|$|After quickly <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> a city, Omaha {{failed to}} pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led {{to the construction of}} many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E

5|$|Jorge Remes Lenicov {{resigned}} in April, alongside ministers De Mendiguren and Capitanich. Peronist governors, legislators, and union leaders {{met at the}} Quinta de Olivos, amid rumors that Duhalde would appoint the populist Daniel Carbonetto as minister of economy. They gave their full support {{to the president and}} the economic policies instrumented so far. As a result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis from <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} were held on May 14, 1989. Menem {{won by a}} wide margin, and became the new president. He was scheduled to take office on December 10, but inflation levels took {{a turn for the}} worse, <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> hyperinflation, causing public riots. The outgoing president Alfonsín resigned and transferred power to Menem five months early, on July 8. Menem's accession marked the first time since Hipólito Yrigoyen took office in 1916 that an incumbent government was peacefully succeeded by a president from an opposition party.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{once part of}} the estate linked to Clevedon Court. It is now managed via a Higher Level Stewardship {{agreement}} between the National Trust and Natural England. This has involved removing trees whose roots are <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> the earthen banks of the site. In particular non native Turkey Oaks, which provide a habitat for damaging Gall wasps, are being removed. Cattle are also being used to manage the scrub and encourage the growth of flowers such as orchids.|$|E

5|$|At 1:50p.m. CDT (18:50UTC), the SPC {{issued a}} tornado watch for {{northern}} and central Illinois, far northwestern Indiana, far southern Wisconsin, and portions of Lake Michigan. A 60% chance {{of two or}} more tornadoes was assessed across the watch box, with a 40% chance of at least one strong tornado. Isolated shower activity began forming across the region just prior to the issuance of watch, eventually <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> a line of strong to severe thunderstorms, including supercells. One such high-precipitation supercell was first severe warned at 6:11p.m. CDT (23:11UTC); the National Weather Service office in Chicago, Illinois warned of winds up to 70mph (110km/h) and quarter- to golf ball-sized hail. The weather forecast office upgraded the severe thunderstorm warning to a tornado warning at 6:35p.m. CDT (23:35UTC), and four minutes later, trained storm spotters reported a damaging tornado north of Ashton. This was one of several tornadoes observed across the Central United States on April8 and April9.|$|E
5|$|The Song court {{returned}} to Hangzhou in 1133, {{and the city}} was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Hangzhou later that same year, {{a sign that the}} court had in practice established Hangzhou as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Hangzhou. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Hangzhou won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Hangzhou, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Hangzhou the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Hangzhou would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> a major commercial and cultural center.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is a {{relatively}} new science that became systematic after the development of the microscope in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli's 1729 work Nova plantarum genera. Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that, under the proper conditions, they could be induced into <b>growing</b> <b>into</b> the same species of fungi from which they originated. Extending the use of the binomial system of nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutch Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761–1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill so as to be considered a founder of modern mycology. Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794–1878) further elaborated the classification of fungi, using spore color and various microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th–19th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley, August Carl Joseph Corda, Anton de Bary, the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne, Arthur H. R. Buller, Curtis G. Lloyd, and Pier Andrea Saccardo. The 20th century has seen a modernization of mycology that has come from advances in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. The use of DNA sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and biodiversity, and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal taxonomy.|$|E
