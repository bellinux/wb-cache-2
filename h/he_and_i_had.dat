500|$|During August and September 1987, Echo & the Bunnymen co-headlined {{a tour of}} the United States {{with popular}} {{electronic}} group New Order. Despite the tour passing without incident, the performances were deemed to be of poor quality. Although American audiences were apparently satisfied by the shows, when the group returned to the United Kingdom for an autumn tour the British music press and audiences were not as equally enthusiastic. Shortly thereafter the band announced plans to record a self-produced album of [...] "savage rock" [...] when there was more free time. The group toured the UK and the US again in early 1988. These concerts were more positively received than their tour the previous year, with guitarist Will Sergeant being singled out for praiseâ€“ BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel said, [...] "Will Sergeant was superb, moving in a trice from squalls of angry sound to playing with such care and subtlety that there were whispered asides from his guitar that I would have sworn only <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard." [...] In March 1988, the band released a cover version of The Doors' song [...] "People Are Strange". However, this failed to impress critics; music paper Melody Maker called it a [...] "rancid effort" [...] and Q said the band had [...] "thrown in the towel".|$|E

"It was in {{the charge}} I took the eagle off the enemy; <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a hard contest for it; he made a thrust at my groin I parried it off and cut him down through the head. After this a lancer came at me; I threw the lance off my right side, and cut him through the chin upwards through the teeth. Next, a foot soldier fired at me, then charged me with his bayonet, which I also had the good luck to parry, and I cut him down through the head; thus ended the contest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foot's first {{stint at}} Private Eye lasted until 1972 when, {{according}} to Patrick Marnham, Foot was effectively sacked by Richard Ingrams {{who had come}} to the conclusion that Foot's copy was being unduly influenced by his contacts in the International Socialists. Ingrams has denied this: [...] "It was said at the time that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> fallen out over political issues. In fact, we very seldom disagreed about such things, the only tension arising from Paul's belief that whenever there was a strike he had to support the union regardless of any rights or wrongs." [...] In October 1972 he left to join the Socialist Worker, the weekly newspaper of the IS, [...] "confident that a revolution was coming", as he explained decades later. He became editor in 1974.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>having</b> {{reconciled}} our differences, {{the project}} then proceeded smoothly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Young lady! in what case;--in {{the case}} of my quarrel with old Tappitt;--whether <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had a {{difference}} about a young lady?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... similarly, {{but with}} a {{different}} subject, placed before the participle (the nominative absolute construction): <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>having</b> reconciled our differences, the project then proceeded smoothly.|$|R
60|$|His bridle and saddle {{were hanging}} in the barn (they are still there), silent {{memorials}} of the explorations in which <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> played a resolute part.|$|E
60|$|As Captain Jamie {{testified before}} the Board of Directors, and as Winwood also so testified, {{on the way to}} the hiding-place Winwood said that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> planted the powder together.|$|E
60|$|And suddenly, not {{ten yards}} farther, we beheld them stop. A low cry arose. Silver doubled his pace, digging {{away with the}} foot of his crutch like one possessed; and next moment <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come also to a dead halt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, {{your little}} {{midshipman}} is delighted at going with me. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been chatting the matter over, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{is in the}} highest glee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{we shall}} most {{certainly}} go. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> and--yes, why, Dr. Watson {{is the very}} man. Your correspondent says two friends. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> worked together before." ...|$|R
60|$|COLFORD. You {{may have}} my head {{if he did}} it, Lord St Erth. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in too many holes together. By Gad! My toe itches for that fellow's butt end.|$|R
60|$|As he had {{scarcely}} seen {{my three}} companions until now,--for <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> walked together,--he {{stood on the}} hearth-rug, after ringing the bell, and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Insane!" [...] said Zarah--"Had he {{been less}} than insane whom I addressed, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ere now been far from the toils which you have pitched for us both. I had means {{prepared}} for everything; and ere this, the shores of Britain had been lost to our sight for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly--likewise {{he is my}} friend, too. We served {{together}} for years, and I sometimes looked up to Phil {{as a kind of}} elder brother. Well, after you left us at the navy-yard <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a long talk about you, and he made me promise to keep my eye on you--do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What bloodthirsty fellows!" [...] cried Jack, laughing. [...] "If {{you talk}} so, I fear that Mak <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> {{to cut your}} acquaintance; for, you see, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got a little feeling left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can easily}} tell you, Miss Minna. I am David Glenney, nephew of Mrs. Wagner, of London. Fritz is staying in her house, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> talked about {{you by the}} hour together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No,--I suppose not. But when I {{heard that}} Mr. Peacocke had come back, and all about his marriage, you know, I could not but {{come over to}} see him. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always been such great friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Du Boung, no doubt." [...] He did {{not think}} so, {{but he could not}} bring himself to declare the success of his enemy to her. [...] "The people there know him. Your old friend is as much a {{stranger}} there as I am. By-the-way, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a little row in the place." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{reached this}} wretched little house {{a few minutes}} before the arrival of Walkirk and the wagon-load of mechanics. My under-study had entered heartily into my scheme, and by his {{directions}} the men had brought with them everything needed to carry out my plans, and {{in a very short time}} <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> set every man to work.|$|E
60|$|My husband, as <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> agreed, {{meeting the}} captain of the ship, took the freedom to tell him that he was afraid he must {{disappoint}} him, for that something had fallen out which had obliged him to alter his measures, and that his family could not be ready to go time enough for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know her}} personally," [...] I replied. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no doubt <b>I</b> {{could find out}} all about her, for I believe she is engaged to young Archie Reeves, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of mutual friends." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{those words}} Mr. Dark {{pocketed}} his large snuff-box, gave a last wink with his bright eye, and walked rapidly away, whistling, {{to catch the}} London coach. From that time to this <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never met again.|$|R
6000|$|... "A peach twig will {{do quite}} as well," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> since {{found that he}} was right. Divining-rods of peach will turn and find water quite {{as well as those of}} hazel or any other kind of wood.|$|R
60|$|Not that I loved Theodore, you understand? But <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> shared so many ups {{and downs}} {{together}} of late that I was loath {{to think of him}} as reduced to begging his bread in the streets. Then I kept him by me, for I thought that he might at times be useful to me in my business.|$|E
6000|$|Our conference being now ended, and {{everything}} arranged, I rose to go; remarking to Herbert that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better not go home together, and that I would take half an hour's start of him. [...] "I don't {{like to leave}} you here," [...] I said to Provis, [...] "though I cannot doubt your being safer here than near me. Good by!" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was very}} true. The wheel {{did not seem}} to be injured, but still I could not travel without a tire. This was the most {{satisfactory}} feature of the affair. If <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been alone together I would have handed the man two dollars, and told him to go in peace with his bear and give himself no more trouble.|$|E
6000|$|Again she paused, {{but after}} {{a moment or two}} a thought struck her, and she replied eagerly, [...] "Anton, I will tell you what I will do. I will ask him openly. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always been open to each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he exclaimed, {{suddenly}} {{giving a}} severe slap to his unoffending thigh, [...] "I'll {{have nothing to}} do with him. If he's so touchy--as that comes to, the less that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say to each other the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What then by {{the terms}} of our friendship--just as Mitchy says--can <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a better right to know and to feel with you about? You'll want, Mitchy, won't you?" [...] Mrs. Brook went on, [...] "to hear all about THAT?" ...|$|R
60|$|Nicholas Naranovitsch {{was summoned}} to the {{presence}} of his colonel. Nicholas was very young and inexperienced; nevertheless, during the brief period in which he had served, he had shown himself possessed of so much ability and wisdom that he was already selected to go on a secret mission. What that mission was he never told me. One result of it, however, was, that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a most unexpected meeting on the Danube in very peculiar circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Louis Ehrich, {{one of the}} gentlest men I {{have ever}} known, rejoiced in our presence. He lived but to fill our days with pleasure. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been friends for ten years, and his family now took my wife into favor--I {{was about to say}} into equal favor, but that would not be true. They very {{properly}} put her above me in the scale of their affection, and to this subordination I submitted without complaint, or even question.|$|E
6000|$|My heart bled for him. Some {{minutes passed}} {{that he did}} not speak, making shift to raise his glass now and again, and I knew that he was gripped by a strong emotion. [...] "'Twas so he ever behaved when the stress was greatest. Presently he lays down the glass on the signal-chest, fumbles in his coat, and brings out the little gold brooch I had not set eyes on since Dolly and <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> stood {{together}} on the Betsy's deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Duke! <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen a {{great deal}} of each other since,--since the days when you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to meet. He knows nothing about all this, and the worst of it is, he is not in a {{condition}} to be told." ...|$|R
6000|$|This at {{any rate}} could not but be {{satisfactory}} to him. [...] "I like them both," [...] he said; [...] "but I love Greg dearly. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived together like brothers for years, whereas it is only quite lately that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay! {{but that}} goes without saying, your Royal Highness," [...] responded Sir Percy, with hospitable alacrity and a most {{approved}} bow directed at his arch-enemy. [...] "We shall expect M. Chauvelin. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not met for so long, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> shall be made right welcome at Blakeney Manor." ...|$|R
