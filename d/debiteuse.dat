5000|$|The <b>Debiteuse</b> is the {{starting}} point of the vertical draw, where the glass begins to change from a hot syrupy mass into useful flat glass. We will call the glass from the point of the <b>Debiteuse</b> until it is cut a [...] "ribbon".|$|E

50|$|The Fourcault Process uses {{a ceramic}} die to shape fused (or molten) glass into a ribbon of {{rectangular}} cross section. The die, {{known as a}} <b>Debiteuse,</b> floats in the molten glass inside of the pit to a prescribed depth which slightly pushes {{a part of the}} molten glass slightly above the top surface of the die. A slot is cut {{through the center of the}} <b>Debiteuse,</b> which is shaped to produce the best quality of glass.|$|E
5000|$|The base of {{the ribbon}} is {{shielded}} from heat radiation from the fused glass so that it continues to hold the shape imparted to it by the <b>Debiteuse.</b> This cooling preserves the rectangular {{cross section of the}} drawn glass by cooling the ribbon glass below the temperature where it would collapse into a column or break back into the melted glass. It is especially important to shield the outside edges of the ribbon from heat so that they are firmer and will hold the rest of the ribbon in a proper shape. In some cases manufacturers will allow the edges to form thicker [...] "bulbs", which are removed after final cutting.|$|E
