Starch grains were also observed in S.  pinnata and S.  cytherea. The wood specific gravity of S.  pinnata, S. lakonensis and S. cytherea was 0. 45, 0. 33 and 0. 30; the wood density was 0. 44, 0. 33 and 0. 27  g/cm 3 and the wood hardness was 2795. 85, 1329. 26 and 1059  N, respectively.

40|$|International audienceFossil wood {{specimens}} {{from the}} late Early-early Middle Jurassic of Jameson Land, Eastern Greenland, have several unexpected features: tracheids of irregular size and shape, thinly pitted <b>ray</b> cell walls, <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>rays,</b> partially scalariform radial pitting, both areolate and simple pits, and pitted elements associated with rays. These characters diverge markedly from those typical of Jurassic wood, which usually conform to those of modern conifers. Although this combination of features is not encountered in any extant angiosperm, each has been documented in one or several extant homoxylous angiosperms, particularly Amborella, Trochodendron, and Tetracentron. As these wood specimens are not found in connection with any reproductive part, {{it is impossible to}} confidently assign them to the angiosperms. If a Jurassic angiosperm did exist, however, it might well have had a similar wood. This material is an early bench-mark in the evolution that led from homoxylous conifer-like wood to that of the angiosperms. Its particular biogeography (Arctic) could renew the discussion about the area of origin of the angiosperm...|$|R

60|$|Exper. 8. I found moreover, {{that when}} Light {{goes out of}} Air through several {{contiguous}} refracting Mediums as through Water and Glass, and thence goes out again into Air, whether the refracting Superficies be parallel or inclin'd to one another, that Light as often as by contrary Refractions 'tis so corrected, that it emergeth in Lines parallel to those {{in which it was}} incident, continues ever after to be white. But if the emergent Rays be inclined to the incident, the Whiteness of the emerging Light will by degrees in passing on from the Place of Emergence, become tinged in its Edges with Colours. This I try'd by refracting Light with Prisms of Glass placed within a Prismatick Vessel of Water. Now those Colours argue a diverging and separation of the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>Rays</b> from one another by means of their unequal Refractions, as in what follows will more fully appear. And, on the contrary, the permanent whiteness argues, that in like Incidences of the Rays there is no such separation of the emerging Rays, and by consequence no inequality of their whole Refractions. Whence I seem to gather the two following Theorems.|$|R
60|$|The <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>Rays</b> are in {{some measure}} {{separated}} from one another by the Refraction of the Prism in the third Experiment, and in the fifth Experiment, by taking away the Penumbra from the rectilinear sides of the coloured Image, that Separation in those very rectilinear sides or straight edges of the Image becomes perfect. But in all places between those rectilinear edges, those innumerable Circles there described, which are severally illuminated by homogeneal Rays, by interfering with one another, and being every where commix'd, do render the Light sufficiently compound. But if these Circles, whilst their Centers keep their Distances and Positions, could be made less in Diameter, their interfering one with another, and by Consequence the Mixture of the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>Rays</b> would be proportionally diminish'd. In the twenty third Figure let AG, BH, CJ, DK, EL, FM be the Circles which so many sorts of Rays flowing from the same disque of the Sun, do in the third Experiment illuminate; of all which and innumerable other intermediate ones lying in a continual Series between the two rectilinear and parallel edges of the Sun's oblong Image PT, that Image is compos'd, as was explained in the fifth Experiment. And let ag, bh, ci, dk, el, fm be so many less Circles lying in a like continual Series between two parallel right Lines af and gm with the same distances between their Centers, and illuminated by the same sorts of Rays, that is the Circle ag with the same sort by which the corresponding Circle AG was illuminated, and the Circle bh with the same sort by which the corresponding Circle BH was illuminated, {{and the rest of}} the Circles ci, dk, el, fm respectively, with the same sorts of Rays by which the several corresponding Circles CJ, DK, EL, FM were illuminated. In the Figure PT composed of the greater Circles, three of those Circles AG, BH, CJ, are so expanded into one another, that the three sorts of Rays by which those Circles are illuminated, together with other innumerable sorts of intermediate Rays, are mixed at QR in the middle of the Circle BH. And the like Mixture happens throughout almost the whole length of the Figure PT. But in the Figure pt composed of the less Circles, the three less Circles ag, bh, ci, which answer to those three greater, do not extend into one another; nor are there any where mingled so much as any two of the three sorts of Rays by which those Circles are illuminated, and which in the Figure PT are all of them intermingled at BH.|$|R

40|$|The seven {{families}} hypothesized by Sosa and Chase {{to comprise}} Crossosomatales possess relatively long vessel elements with scalariform perforation plates and scalariform to opposite vessel-ray pitting; tracheids; diffuse axial parenchyma; and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>rays.</b> These and other primitive character {{states do not}} indicate relationships, {{but they do not}} offer any evidence against the idea that Crossosomatales are a natural order. Departures from the primitive character states are related to ecological adaptations. Crossosomataceae have simple perforation plates (scalariform brieﬂy {{at the beginning of the}} secondary xylem), a feature correlated with the seasonal aridity of habitats occupied by the family, the sole family of the order to exhibit such an ecological shift. Presence of tracheids (which confer embolism resistance to a wood) in ancestors of Crossosomataceae probably pre-adapted the family for entry into highly seasonal habitats. Minimal vessel grouping in all other genera shows that tracheid presence deters vessel grouping; tracheid presence also deters shortening of vessel elements. Autapomorphies are shown by Aphloiaceae (tracheid dimorphism, rays of two distinct widths); Crossosomataceae (perforation plates predominantly simple, lateral wall pitting of vessels alternate); Geissolomataceae (wide rays); Ixerbaceae (ﬁber-tracheid tendency); Staphyleaceae (adjacence of axial parenchyma to vessels); Stachyuraceae (simpliﬁcation of perforation plates); and Strasburgeriaceae (large cell size). Although tracheid presence seems plesiomorphic in Crossosomatales, a degree of lability in density and size of bordered pits on imperforate tracheary elements probably occurs within this order and in other dicotyledon groups...|$|R

In the Sun's Light let into my darken'd Chamber {{through a}} small round Hole in my Window-shut, at about ten or twelve Feet from the Window, I placed a Lens, by which the Image of the Hole might be {{distinctly}} cast upon a Sheet of white Paper, placed at the distance of six, eight, ten, or twelve Feet from the Lens. For, according to the difference of the Lenses I used various distances, which I think not worth the while to describe. Then immediately after the Lens I placed a Prism, by which the trajected Light might be refracted either upwards or sideways, and thereby the round Image, which the Lens alone did cast upon the Paper might be drawn out into a long one with Parallel Sides, as in the third Experiment. This oblong Image I let fall upon another Paper {{at about the same}} distance from the Prism as before, moving the Paper either towards the Prism or from it, until I found the just distance where the Rectilinear Sides of the Image became most distinct. For in this Case, the Circular Images of the Hole, which compose that Image after the same manner that the Circles ag, bh, ci, &c. do the Figure pt [in Fig. 23.] were terminated most distinctly without any Penumbra, and therefore extended into one another the least that they could, and by consequence the Mixture of the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>Rays</b> was now the least of all. By this means I used to form an oblong Image (such as is pt) [in Fig. 23, and 24.] of Circular Images of the Hole, (such as are ag, bh, ci, &c.) and by using a greater or less Hole in the Window-shut, I made the Circular Images ag, bh, ci, &c. of which it was formed, to become greater or less at pleasure, and thereby the Mixture of the Rays in the Image pt to be as much, or as little as I desired.|$|R
40|$|An {{anatomical}} {{study of}} secondary phloem {{of the different}} species of Gymnosperms showed that three categories could be distinguished, which may represent three evolutionary stages.

The phylogenetic sequence of the axial system and the reduction of the phloem rays starts in the Ps. taxifolia type with an almost uniform axial system and ray- albuminous cells, and a complex <b>heterogeneous</b> phloem <b>ray,</b> differentiating through the G. biloba type to the C. pisifera type, which has a highly specialized axial system with phloem-albuminous cells and a simpler, reduced homogeneous phloem ray.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Many {{species of}} the Fagaceae have been {{variously}} interpreted on the basis, primarily of external morphological characteristics. The objectives {{of this study are}} to elucidate generic and specific characteristics of the wood of Fagaceae and to attempt to obtain evidence regarding taxonomic relationships among some of the species occurring in Taiwan that have been variously interpreted. There are 45 species (Lin and Liu, 1965) of Fagaceae, subdivided to seven genera, in Taiwan and 35 of these were obtained for study. Detailed descriptions are provided for all species and differences among species and genera are emphasized. On the basis of comparative wood anatomy of the species studied, several suggestions are made regarding relationships of certain species. The wood anatomy of Pasania uraiana (Hay.) Schottky is very similar to that of Castanopsis and quite different from the anatomy of other species of Pasania or of Lithocarpus. The cupula is cuplike, however, so that it differs in this important generic character from Castanopsis. It probably should be treated under a distinct genus, Limlia, as Masamune and Tomiya (1947) suggested. The comparison of wood anatomy between Pasania dodoniaefolia and Pasania formosana shows consistent differences. Pasania dodoniaefolia shows distinct growth rings, homogeneous rays and absence of crystals in the parenchyma cells. Pasania formosana shows indistinct growth rings, <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>rays</b> and presence of crystals in parenchyma cells. Since the morphological characters are also somewhat different (Lin and Liu, 1965), they probably should be treated as two distinct species. Morphologically, Castanopsis carlesii var. sessilis is very similar to Castanopsis carlesii, but is quite different with regard to wood anatomy. Since Castanopsis carlesii var. sessilis has ring porous wood, conspicuous growth rings and pore size transition abrupt, while Castanopsis carlesii has diffuse porous wood, inconspicuous growth rings, pore size transition gradual, these should be considered as separate species and the original name, Castanopsis stipitata should be recognized as the valid name. The genera Lithocarpus and Pasania could not be separated anatomically. These genera have been separated primarily {{on the basis of the}} cupula but they are very similar with regard to other morphological characteristics. If both anatomy and external morphology are considered, these should be treated as one genus, Lithocarpus...|$|R
60|$|Exper. 16. The Lens which I used in {{the second}} and eighth Experiments, being placed six Feet and an Inch distant from any Object, {{collected}} the Species of that Object by the mean refrangible Rays at the distance of six Feet and an Inch from the Lens on the other side. And therefore by the foregoing Rule, it ought to collect the Species of that Object by the least refrangible Rays at the distance of six Feet and 3-2/3 Inches from the Lens, and by the most refrangible ones at the distance of five Feet and 10-1/3 Inches from it: So that between the two Places, where these least and most refrangible Rays collect the Species, there may be the distance of about 5-1/3 Inches. For by that Rule, as six Feet and an Inch (the distance of the Lens from the lucid Object) is to twelve Feet and two Inches (the distance of the lucid Object from the Focus of the mean refrangible Rays) that is, as One is to Two; so is the 27-1/2th Part of six Feet and an Inch (the distance between the Lens and the same Focus) to the distance between the Focus of the most refrangible Rays and the Focus of the least refrangible ones, which is therefore 5-17/55 Inches, that is very nearly 5-1/3 Inches. Now to know whether this Measure was true, I repeated the second and eighth Experiment with coloured Light, which was less compounded than that I there made use of: For I now separated the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>Rays</b> from one another by the Method I described in the eleventh Experiment, so as to make a coloured Spectrum about twelve or fifteen Times longer than broad. This Spectrum I cast on a printed Book, and placing the above-mentioned Lens at the distance of six Feet and an Inch from this Spectrum to collect the Species of the illuminated Letters at the same distance on the other side, I found that the Species of the Letters illuminated with blue were nearer to the Lens than those illuminated with deep red by about three Inches, or three and a quarter; but the Species of the Letters illuminated with indigo and violet appeared so confused and indistinct, that I could not read them: Whereupon viewing the Prism, I found it was full of Veins running {{from one end of the}} Glass to the other; so that the Refraction could not be regular. I took another Prism therefore which was free from Veins, and instead of the Letters I used two or three Parallel black Lines a little broader than the Strokes of the Letters, and casting the Colours upon these Lines in such manner, that the Lines ran along the Colours from one end of the Spectrum to the other, I found that the Focus where the indigo, or confine of this Colour and violet cast the Species of the black Lines most distinctly, to be about four Inches, or 4-1/4 nearer to the Lens than the Focus, where the deepest red cast the Species of the same black Lines most distinctly. The violet was so faint and dark, that I could not discern the Species of the Lines distinctly by that Colour; and therefore considering that the Prism was made of a dark coloured Glass inclining to green, I took another Prism of clear white Glass; but the Spectrum of Colours which this Prism made had long white Streams of faint Light shooting out from both ends of the Colours, which made me conclude that something was amiss; and viewing the Prism, I found two or three little Bubbles in the Glass, which refracted the Light irregularly. Wherefore I covered that Part of the Glass with black Paper, and letting the Light pass through another Part of it which was free from such Bubbles, the Spectrum of Colours became free from those irregular Streams of Light, and was now such as I desired. But still I found the violet so dark and faint, that I could scarce see the Species of the Lines by the violet, and not at all by the deepest Part of it, which was next the end of the Spectrum. I suspected therefore, that this faint and dark Colour might be allayed by that scattering Light which was refracted, and reflected irregularly, partly by some very small Bubbles in the Glasses, and partly by the Inequalities of their Polish; which Light, tho' it was but little, yet it being of a white Colour, might suffice to affect the Sense so strongly as to disturb the Phænomena of that weak and dark Colour the violet, and therefore I tried, as in the 12th, 13th, and 14th Experiments, whether the Light of this Colour did not consist of a sensible Mixture of <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>Rays,</b> but found it did not. Nor did the Refractions cause any other sensible Colour than violet to emerge out of this Light, as they would have done out of white Light, and by consequence out of this violet Light had it been sensibly compounded with white Light. And therefore I concluded, that the reason why I could not see the Species of the Lines distinctly by this Colour, was only the Darkness of this Colour, and Thinness of its Light, and its distance from the Axis of the Lens; I divided therefore those Parallel black Lines into equal Parts, by which I might readily know the distances of the Colours in the Spectrum from one another, and noted the distances of the Lens from the Foci of such Colours, as cast the Species of the Lines distinctly, and then considered whether the difference of those distances bear such proportion to 5-1/3 Inches, the greatest Difference of the distances, which the Foci of the deepest red and violet ought to have from the Lens, as the distance of the observed Colours from one another in the Spectrum bear to the greatest distance of the deepest red and violet measured in the Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, that is, to the Length of those Sides, or Excess of the Length of the Spectrum above its Breadth. And my Observations were as follows.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{robustness}} {{may have}} {{a crucial role in}} speciation. Nevertheless, its mechanism is still under debate. We analyze by means of principal component analysis the genomic correlation of several mouse subspecies and discriminate between two distinct and mutually orthogonal processes of genetic differentiation which can be equated to interspecific and intersubspecific divergence. While the first principal component is responsible for the separation of different species, the second and third principal component discriminates between different strains within the same species. We find that the across genome correlation distance is both robust and highly different between the two components, and displays a scale invariant distribution. We also report a scale invariant, <b>heterogeneous</b> (non-stochastic) 7 <b>ray</b> clusters of the system variation that may be equated to the biological process. These findings suggest that the correlation structure of millions of genetic elements along the genome is highly important during the process of evolution and may indicate of strong constraints.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are reported for seven specimens representing six varieties {{of the four}} species of Drimys generally recognized. Tracheid length and diameter are correlated both with plant size and with severity of climate: wide, long tracheids, not fluctuating in diameter seasonally, occur in Drimys of moderate elevations in subtropical latitude; narrower, shorter tracheids, becoming radially narrower briefly in latewood, occur in Drimys from higher altitudes and latitudes. Vesturing (warty layer) on the inside surface of tracheids occurs in Drimys from latitudes and altitudes where appreciable freezing is to be expected, but vesturing is absent at lower elevations and latitudes. Vesturing may bond water to tracheid walls better so that water columns do not break under high tensions produced by such conditions as transpiration when soil remains frozen. Scalariform pitting on end walls of Drimys tracheids occurs {{during the first year}} (metaxylem), but is replaced by alternate circular pits later; injury to the cambium, even of a mild kind, results in reversion to sca 1 ariform end wall pitting. Tracheid wall thickness is not correlated with tracheid diameter. Tracheid-ray pits are 75 % the diameter of tracheid-tracheid pits.

Lamiaceae basically have: vessels with simple perforation plates; vessel-to-vessel pitting alternate; imperforate tracheary elements all libriform fibers, fibers commonly septate; axial parenchyma scanty vasicentric; <b>rays</b> <b>Heterogeneous</b> Type IIB. These features ally Lamiaceae closely with Verbenaceae. In {{addition to the}} Mesomorphy ratio (based on vessel element dimensions), features that indicate wood xeromorphy in Lamiaceae, in probable increasing order of importance are: presence of indistinct to marked growth rings; presence of helical thickenings in vessels; presence of vasicentric or vascular tracheids; presence of vessel groups averaging three or more vessels per group. More mesomorphic woods in Lamiaceae occur in species that are arborescent to shrubby, and that occur in areas that have no prolonged drought. Helical sculpture in vessels is expressed not only as thickenings, but also as grooves interconnecting pit apertures (coalesced pit apertures), and inconspicuous thickenings in pairs along the grooves. Vascular tracheids (at ends of growth rings) occur in several genera. Where growth rings are very narrow (Salvia, Trichostema), vessels and tracheids are intermixed, thereby justifying description as vasicentric tracheids of what may have originated phylogenetically as vascular tracheids. This may represent one pathway for origin of vasicentric tracheids. Wide bands of axial parenchyma in Cuminia and Leptosceptrum have originated {{as a result of}} fiber dimorphism. Abundance of upright cells in numerous Lamiaceae is indicative ofpaedomorphosis, and may point to secondary woodiness in some instances; the family as a whole appears ancestrally moderately woody. The ratio between libriform fiber length and vessel element length marks Lamiaceae as specialized. Crystal presence and cambial variants are newly reported for the family...|$|R

And seeing the Rays which differ in Refrangibility may be parted and sorted from one another, and that either by Refraction as in the third Experiment, or by Reflexion as in the tenth, and then the several sorts apart at equal Incidences suffer unequal Refractions, and those sorts are more refracted than others after Separation, which were more refracted before it, as in the sixth and following Experiments, and if the Sun's Light be trajected through three or more cross Prisms successively, those Rays which in the first Prism are refracted more than others, are in all the following Prisms refracted more than others in the same Rate and Proportion, as appears by the fifth Experiment; it's manifest that the Sun's Light is an <b>heterogeneous</b> Mixture of <b>Rays,</b> some of which are constantly more refrangible than others, as was proposed.|$|R
40|$|Maytenus guyanensis, conhecida popularmente por chichuá, possui ações analgésicas, antiinflamatórias, afrodisíacas e antireumáticas. Sendo assim foram estudados seus aspectos anatômicos e etnofarmacológicos a fim de se localizar sítios ou locais de produção da droga através dos testes microquímicos e traçar o perfil dos usuários e feirantes de produtos naturais nas feiras e mercados de Manaus-AM. Para análise anatômica do {{material}} coletado na Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, foram selecionados 3 indivíduos e de cada um deles foram retirados fragmentos do caule e raiz de 1 cm 3. Fragmentos do caule foram incluídos em resina metacrilato para obtenção de cortes em micrótomo rotativo, os quais foram corados com azul de toluidina e montados em resina sintética. Seções do caule em crescimento secundário e da raiz foram obtidas com o auxílio de micrótomo de deslize e coradas com azul de astra e safranina. Os cortes histológicos do caule e raiz foram submetidos a testes microquímicos visando identificar a natureza química das substâncias secretadas. A investigação etnobotânica nas feiras e mercados foi realizada através de entrevistas, usando questionários com perguntas abertas e semi-estruturadas. A análise estrutural do caule e da raiz revelou-se de acordo com o registrado pela literatura para o gênero Maytenus. A periderme do caule origina-se na subepiderme, lenticelas estão presentes. A casca do caule secundário apresenta periderme desenvolvida constituída por felema espesso, seqüencialmente são observados o felogênio e feloderme. Córtex internamente rodeado por dois anéis esclerenquimáticos, sempre contínuo e composto por fibras e inúmeras células pétreas. Cilindro vascular com floema externo ao xilema, tecido floemático e xilemático entremeado com inúmeras fibras. O xilema secundário da raiz e do caule apresenta parênquima axial apotraqueal, raios multisseriados, heterogêneos, vasos solitários, de distribuição difusa, uniforme, seção circular, com parede delgada, pontoações intervasculares alternas e areoladas. O sistema floemático percorrido por grupos de células pétreas, células em processo de esclerificação, fibras e raios parenquimáticos. Medula homogênea formada de células parenquimáticas isodiamétricas e células pétreas. As estruturas do caule e da raiz apresentaram inúmeras células-pétreas e células em processo de esclerificação as quais possuem um lúmen denso que reagiu ao teste de alcalóides. Os testes microquímicos também revelaram a presença de amido, pectina e proteínas (somente no caule). Monocristais prismáticos estão presentes no parênquima radial da raiz e do caule. A pesquisa permitiu avaliar o perfil dos feirantes e usuários de plantas medicinais de Manaus-AM demonstrando que o comércio de fitoterápicos tem crescido nos últimos 10 anos através do aumento da procura de plantas medicinais. A abordagem etnofarmacológica realizada revelou que a espécie M. guyanensis não é comercializada e utilizada pelos feirantes, e sim uma outra espécie com o mesmo nome vulgar de chichuá, Salacia impressifolia. Contudo os informantes que conhecem as duas espécies afirmam que elas apresentam o mesmo uso terapêutico (relaxante muscular, reumatismo, impotência sexual e frigidez). O presente estudo vem enfatizar a importância da anatomia e da etnofarmacologia para o conhecimento das plantas medicinais. Maytenus guyanensis, known popularly for chichuá, possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory, aphrodisiac and anti-rheumatic actions. Here, its anatomical and ethnopharmacological aspects {{had been}} studied through the microchemical tests {{in order to}} locate the small farms where the drug is produced, and to trace {{the profile of the}} users and traders of natural products in the fairs and markets in Manaus-AM. Anatomical analysis of the material collected in the Forest Reserve Adolpho Ducke where conducted for 3 selected individuals, from which fragments of stem and root of 1 cm 3 had been removed. Fragments from stems were embedded in methacrylate resin for sectioning in a rotating microtome, stained with toluidine blue and mounted with synthetic resin. Sections from the stem in secondary growth and root were cut with slide microtome, and stained with astra blue and safranina. The histological cuts of stem and root were submitted to microchemical tests aiming the identification of the chemical properties of the secreted substances. The ethnobotanical aspects were studied through interviews carried in the fairs and markets of Manaus-AM, based on questionnaires with open and semi-structuralized questions. The structural analysis of stems and roots were in accordance with those showed in the literature available for the Maytenus genus. Periderm of stem arising in the sub-epidermis, lenticels is gifts. The bark of stem presented periderm developed constituted by a thick phellem, and subsequently to which the phellogen and phelloderm were observed. Vascular cylinder with phloem external to xylem, weaved phloematic and xylematic larded with innumerable staple fibres. The secondary xylem of the root and stem presented parenchyma axial apotracheal, multiseriates, <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>rays,</b> solitary vessels, of diffuse distribution, uniform, circular section, with thin wall, bordered and alternate intervascular pits. Cortex internally bounded by two sclerenchymatic rings, almost continuous and composed of fibers and innumerable stone cells. The phloem system has a group of stone cells, cells in process of sclerification, fibers and parenchyma rays. Homogeneous pith formed of isodiametric parenchyma cells and stone cells. Staple fibers and rays of the structures in stems and the root presented innumerable stone cells and cells in sclerification process, possessing a dense lumen reactive to alkaloids test. The microchemical tests also disclosed presence of starch, pectin and proteins (only in stem). Prismatic monocrystals were present in the radial parenchyma of roots and stems. The research on the profile of traders and users of medicinal plants in Manaus-AM revealed that the commerce of phytotherapics has grown in last the 10 years because of increasing search of medicinal plants. M. guyanensis is neither commercialized nor used for the traders, but instead another species bearing the same vulgar name of chichuá, Salacia impressifolia. Nevertheless, informers knowing both species affirmed that they are used in similar therapeutical treatments use (rheumatism, sexual impotence and frigidity). The present research emphasizes the importance of anatomical and ethnopharmacological aspects for the knowledge of medicinal plants...|$|R
