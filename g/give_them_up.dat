5|$|One {{contentious}} {{point in}} Denholm-Young's article was his assertion {{that there was}} no mention of the Provisions of Oxford in the Mise of Lewes. This was an idea that John Maddicott strongly contested in an 1983 article. According to Maddicott, the provisions had been at the centre of Montfort's opposition over the last six years, and it was unlikely that he would <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> so easily. Nevertheless, Montfort showed willingness to negotiate the terms of the provisions. As such, the Mise of Lewes was a moderate document; Montfort wanted to avoid a repetition of the situation after the Mise of Amiens. Rather it was external circumstances outside of Montfort's control that led to the eventual failure of the negotiations between the royalists and the barons.|$|E

Out of the ceded areas, including the Åland islands, Russia formed the Grand Duchy of Finland.

500|$|Sally Hemings {{was born}} about 1773 to Betty Hemings (1735–1807), a biracial {{woman who was}} enslaved. Her father was their master John Wayles (1715–1773). Her mother Betty was the {{daughter}} of Susanna, an enslaved African, and John Hemings, an English sea captain. Susanna and Betty Hemings were first enslaved by Francis Eppes IV, where Susanna was referred to as Susanna Epps. John Hemings tried to buy them from Eppes, but the planter refused to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> [...] The mother and daughter were inherited by Francis's daughter, Martha Eppes, who took them with her as personal slaves upon her marriage to the planter John Wayles. His parents were Edward Wayles and Ellen Ashburner-Wayles, both of Lancaster, England.|$|E

It was therefore unwelcome news to him that Ernest Shackleton had announced his own plans to travel to Discoverys old McMurdo Sound base and launch a bid for the South Pole from there. Scott claimed, {{in the first of}} a series of letters to Shackleton, that the area around McMurdo was his own [...] "field of work" [...] to which he had prior rights until he chose to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up,</b> and that Shackleton should therefore work from an entirely different area. In this, he was strongly supported by Discoverys former zoologist, Edward Wilson, who asserted that Scott's rights extended to the entire Ross Sea sector. This Shackleton refused to concede.|$|E

500|$|Authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen criticised the song's {{instrumental}} music as overly sentimental and melodramatic, {{comparing it to}} the music of the pre-rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated. According to Blaney, Lennon's lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions; lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory, asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to communism. Author Chris Ingham indicated the hypocrisy in Lennon, the millionaire rock star living in a mansion, encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions. Others argue that Lennon intended the song's lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world could live without possessions, not as an explicit call to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> Blaney commented: [...] "Lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer, so instead he offers a dream, a concept to be built upon." ...|$|E
500|$|Eleven {{days after}} Orsini's {{assassination}} attempt in France, Victoria's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855, when Princess Victoria was 14 years old; {{the marriage was}} delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17. The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state. Victoria felt [...] "sick at heart" [...] to see her daughter leave England for Germany; [...] "It really makes me shudder", she wrote to Princess Victoria {{in one of her}} frequent letters, [...] "when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> too – one by one." [...] Almost exactly a year later, Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, Wilhelm, who would become the last German Kaiser.|$|E
500|$|Cornwallis {{believed}} that the terms of union should include Catholic emancipation. [...] While some rights had been restored in the early 1790s, Catholics were still denied elective offices and other rights. [...] Almost everyone in the establishments of Dublin and London, including the king and much of Pitt's cabinet, opposed this, leading Cornwallis to write that [...] "some mode must be adopted to soften the hatred of the Catholics to our government". In {{a letter to the}} Home Secretary he wrote, [...] "I trust that your grace and His Majesty's other ministers will on no account consent to the insertion of any clause which shall unalterably bind the United Parliament to persevere in the exclusion of Catholics." [...] Protestants, including the Lord Chancellor, Lord Clare, who favoured union, opposed Catholic emancipation. [...] "I trust, and I hope I am not deceived, that they are fairly inclined to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up,</b> and to bring [...] forward unencumbered with the doctrine of emancipation." [...] King George, after Cornwallis' appointment, wrote to Pitt that [...] "Cornwallis must clearly understand that no indulgence can be granted to the Catholics farther than has been". Cornwallis' efforts to include support for emancipation clearly had negative repercussions. [...] One Protestant wrote, [...] "his silly conduct, his total incapacity, and self conceit and mulishness have alone lost the question [...] ", while another wrote to Castlereagh that Cornwallis had been rendered [...] "not only an object of disgust, but of abhorrence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chapters 4–14 {{spell out}} the allegory at length. Chapters 1–3 speaks of Hosea's family, and the issues with Gomer. Chapters 4–10 contain a series of oracles, or prophetic sermons, showing exactly why God is rejecting the Northern Kingdom (what the grounds are for the divorce). [...] Chapter 11 is God's lament over the {{necessity}} of giving up the Northern Kingdom, which is {{a large part of}} the people of Israel, whom God loves. [...] God promises not to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> entirely. Then, in Chapter 12, the prophet pleads for Israel's repentance. [...] Chapter 13 foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of Assyria, because there has been no repentance. [...] In Chapter 14, the prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging the utmost fidelity to God.|$|E
2500|$|In his postwar memoirs Harris wrote, [...] "In {{spite of}} all that {{happened}} at Hamburg, bombing proved a relatively humane method", which augmented his wartime views expressed in an internal secret memo to the Air Ministry after the Dresden raid in February 1945: [...] "I ... assume that the view under consideration is something like this: no doubt in the past we were justified in attacking German cities. But to do so was always repugnant {{and now that the}} Germans are beaten anyway we can properly abstain from proceeding with these attacks. This is a doctrine to which I could never subscribe. Attacks on cities like any other act of war are intolerable unless they are strategically justified. But they are strategically justified in so far as they tend to shorten the war and preserve the lives of Allied soldiers. To my mind we have absolutely no right to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> unless it is certain that they will not have this effect. I do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier.|$|E

2500|$|On January 5, 1870, Hardin {{was playing}} cards with Benjamin Bradley in Towash, Hill County, Texas. Hardin was winning almost every hand, which angered Bradley who {{threatened}} to [...] "cut out his liver" [...] if he won again. Bradley drew {{a knife and}} a six-shooter. Hardin said he was unarmed and excused himself but claims that later that night, Bradley came looking for him. Bradley allegedly fired a shot at Hardin and missed; Hardin drew both his pistols and returned fire, one shot striking Bradley {{in the head and}} the other in his chest. Dozens of people saw this fight, and from them there is a good record of how Hardin had used his guns. His holsters were sewn into his vest so that the butts of his pistols pointed inward across his chest. He crossed his arms to draw. Hardin claimed this was the fastest way to draw, and he practiced every day. A man called [...] "Judge Moore", who held Hardin's stakes of money and a pistol, but refused to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> without Bradley's consent, later [...] "vanished". Hardin eventually admitted killing two men in Hill County.|$|E
