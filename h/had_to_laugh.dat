500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play my own age for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>laugh</b> I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E
