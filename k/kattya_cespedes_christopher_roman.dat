40|$|In 2005 a Greek and American {{interdisciplinary}} team investigated two shipwrecks off {{the coast}} of Chios dating to the 4 th-century b. c. and the 2 nd/ 1 st century. The project pioneered archaeological methods of precision acoustic, digital image, and chemical survey using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and in-situ sensors, increasing the speed of data acquisition while decreasing costs. The AUV recorded data revealing the physical dimensions, age, cargo, and preservation of the wrecks. The earlier wreck contained more than 350 amphoras, predominantly of Chian type, while the Hellenistic wreck contained about 40 Dressel 1 C amphoras. Molecular biological analysis of two amphoras from the 4 th-century wreck revealed ancient DNA of olive, oregano, and possibly mastic, part of a cargo outbound from Chios. Author(s) : Brendan P.

40|$|What strange {{transactions}} {{take place}} in the mobile spaces between loci? How does the flow of forces between fixed points enliven texts, suggest new connections, and map out the dizzying motion of myriad interactions? The essays in this volume were first presented at the 2014 New Chaucer Society Congress in Reykjavik, Iceland where a meeting of minds in a shared intermediate space initiated dialogue from diverse perspectives and wended its way through the invisible spaces between concrete categories, objects, and entities. The resulting volume asks a core question: what can we learn by tarrying at the nexus points and hubs through which things move in and out of texts, attempting to trace not the things themselves or their supposedly stable significations, but rather their forms of emergence and retreat, of disorder and disequilibrium? The answer is complex and intermediate, for we ourselves are emerging and retreating within our own systems of transit and experiencing our own disequilibrium. Scholarship, like transit, is never complete and yet never congeals into inertia. TABLE OF CONTENTS // James L.

40|$|The Gaia metaoperating system {{extends the}} reach of {{traditional}} operating systems to manage ubiquitous computing habitats and living spaces as integrated programmable environments. Pervasive computing environments augment human thought and activity with digital information, processing, and analysis, providing an observed world that is enhanced by the behavioral context of its users. A spectrum of heterogeneous computation and communication devices aim to enhance user productivity and facilitate everyday tasks. Despite the prevalence of such devices, however, no suitable software infrastructure with which to develop applications for ubiquitous computing habitats or living spaces exists. To address this deficiency, we developed Gaia, a metaoperating system 1 (detailed in the sidebar “The Gaia Operating System”) built as a distributed middleware infrastructure that coordinates software entities and heterogeneous networked devices contained in a physical space.

40|$|Obtaining {{accurate}} and repeatable navigation for robotic {{vehicles in the}} deep ocean is difficult and consequently a limiting factor when constructing vehicle-based bathymetric maps. This thesis presents a methodology to produce self-consistent maps and simultaneously improve vehicle position estimation by exploiting accurate local navigation and utilizing terrain relative Measurements. It is common for errors in the vehicle position estimate to far exceed the errors associated with the acoustic range sensor. This disparity creates inconsistency when an area is imaged multiple times and causes artifacts that distort map integrity. Our technique utilizes small terrain "sub-maps" that can be pairwise registered and used to additionally constrain the vehicle position estimates in accordance with actual bottom topography. A delayed state Kalman filter is used to incorporate these sub-map registrations as relative position measurements between previously visited vehicle locations. The archiving of previous positions in a filter state vector allows for continual adjustment of the sub-map locations. The terrain registration is accomplished using a two dimensional correlation and a six degree of freedom point cloud alignment method tailored for bathymetric data. (cont.) The complete bathymetric map is then created from the union of all sub-maps that have been aligned in a consistent manner. Experimental results from the fully automated processing of a multibeamn survey over the TAG hydrothermal structure at the Mid-Atlantic ridge are presented to validate the proposed method. by <b>Christopher</b> N. <b>Roman.</b> Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Published: May 6, 2016 Sensing {{platforms}} {{that allow}} rapid and efficient detection of metal ions would have applications in disease diagnosis and study, {{as well as}} environmental sensing. Here, we report the first microstructured optical fiber-based biosensor for the reversible and nanoliter-scale measurement of metal ions. Specifically, a photoswitchable spiropyran Zn(2 +) sensor is incorporated within the microenvironment of a liposome attached to microstructured optical fibers (exposed-core and suspended-core microstructured optical fibers). Both fiber-based platforms retains high selectivity of ion binding associated with a small molecule sensor, while also allowing nanoliter volume sampling and on/off switching. We have demonstrated that multiple measurements can be made on a single sample without the {{need to change the}} sensor. The ability of the new sensing platform to sense Zn(2 +) in pleural lavage and nasopharynx of mice was compared to that of established ion sensing methodologies such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and a commercially available fluorophore (Fluozin- 3), where the optical-fiber-based sensor provides a significant advantage in that it allows the use of nanoliter (nL) sampling when compared to ICP-MS (mL) and FluoZin- 3 (μL). This work paves the way to a generic approach for developing surface-based ion sensors using a range of sensor molecules, which can be attached to a surface without the need for its chemical modification and presents an opportunity for the development of new and highly specific ion sensors for real time sensing applications.

40|$|The {{period of}} the mid- 1960 s through the mid- 1970 s, falling at a crux between the {{influences}} of modernity 1 and postmodernity 2, was an era undergoing vast paradigmatic shifts. Defined by cultural historians as The Final Phase of Modernism, A Rage against Order, The New Sensibility, an era of Getting Loose, or The Culture of Narcissism 3, this decade was increasingly fracturing along conservative- liberal fault lines. Presumably, {{as a result of}} this socio-political dichotomisation, debates were being forwarded about the need for and efficacy of grand narratives including historical imperatives, familial connectivity, and traditional spiritual affiliation elicited across this cultural spectrum: from orthodox institutions, such as the Catholic Church to more left-wing establishments such as the Civil Rights and Counter Culture movements. Given prevalence of these conundrums, this thesis will explore how these concerns were discussed and disseminated within the United States through the popular media and, more specifically, works of horror. Indeed, at least since the Gothic literary period, and its qualified revival in the New Hollywood Alternative Religion Horror cinema this discursive thread has, arguably, articulated concerns surrounding the legacy and effects of modernity, traditionalism, the supernatural and affiliations of faith overall. In focusing upon American and British/American co-productions such as Rosemary’s Baby 4, The Omen 5, and The Wicker Man 6, their shared concern in addressing spiritual questions will be taken seriously not merely as metaphors but instead as viable contemporaneous debates. This reading thus offers up an alternative to those currently presented by academia wherein religion is regarded as a mere metaphor for restrictive socio-political mechanisms, or as symbols of plenitude and power. 1 By modernity is meant a series of socio-political norms and mores coalescing around an increasing rejection of traditional systems of personal and cultural cohesion. These mechanisms relate to historical imperatives and include traditional religion, and familial or generational connectivity. The aforementioned ostensibly were rent asunder as a result of the concomitant legacies of the Enlightenment and the Reformation both of which upheld science and rationality over what was perceived to be the irrational: superstition, the supernatural and any adherence to a faith that supported them. This understanding is based upon the writings of historians and cultural critics including Daniel Bell, Christopher Lasch, Marshall Berman and their contemporaries all of which are herein referenced and problematized. 2 For an understanding of postmodernity, this work relies upon the work of Jean-Francois Lyotard who discusses this ethos as involving a loss of historic grand narratives and a resultant search for meaning in the wake of this cultural forfeiture. 3 This various phraseology representing definitions of the era by, respectively, Marshall Berman in All That Is Solid Melts into Air; Daniel Ball in The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism; Susan Sontag in an essay of the same title from Against Interpretation; Sam Binkley in his book of the same title, and finally <b>Christopher</b> Lasch. 4 <b>Roman</b> Polanski, Rosemary’s Baby, DVD.
