40|$|The European {{industrial}} pelagic traw {{fishery in}} Mauritanian waters targeted at {{small pelagic species}} is geared towards sardine (Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792)), round sardinella (Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847), flat sardinella (Sardinella maderensis (Lowe, 1838)), mackerel (Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789) and <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.).</b> In 2003 the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) through its Centro Oceanográfico de Canarias (COC) began to follow up this activity under the European Project Data Collection (Regulation (EC) 1543 / 2000). In 2008 the COC-IEO began the study of <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.)</b> under commercial codification “JAX”. Discharges were about 1, 500 tonnes in that year (22 fishing trips) and 2, 000 tonnes in 2009 (29 fishing trips). During this period, 5, 180 specimens of these commercial catches were analyzed. Four different species were identified (in order of importance in commercial landings analyzed) : Trachurus trecae Cadenat, 1950, Caranx rhonchus Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817, Trachurus trachurus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich, 1825). The assessments {{of the status of}} these resources carried out by International Working Groups are focused on T. trecae and T. trachurus. Previous studies of the area had not considered this. The present study aims to highlight the need to identify the mixture of these species in the landings, in order to ameliorate the quality of data used in the assessments and in the establishment of the level of exploitation...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of two}} {{research}} projects for analysing bycatch and discards, we quantified catch composition, catch rates, bycatch and discard,, in two important commercial bottom trawl fisheries (crustacean and fish trawls) off the Southern coast of Portugal (Algarve). Stratified sampling by onboard observers took place from February 1999 to March 2001 and {{data were collected from}} 165 tows during 52 fishing trips. Commercial tat-get species included crustaceans: blue and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus), deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), Norway lobster (Nepharops norvegicus); and fishes: scabreams (Diplodus spl). and Pagellus <b>Spp.),</b> <b>horse</b> <b>Mackerels</b> (<b>Trachurus</b> <b>spp.)</b> and European hake (Merluccius merluccius). The trawl fisheries are characterised by considerable amounts of bycatch: 59. 5 % and 80. 4 % of the overall total catch for crustacean and fish trawlers respectively. A total of 255 species were identified, which belonged to 15 classes of organisms (137 vertebrates, 112 invertebrates and algae). Crustacean trawlers had higher bycatch biodiversity. Bony fish (45. 6 % and 37. 8 %) followed by crustaceans (14. 6 % and 11. 5 %) were the dominant bycatch components of both crustacean and fish trawlers respectively. The influence of a number of factors (e. g. depth, fishing gear, tow duration and season) on bycatch and discards is discussed...|$|R

Mercury concentrations in <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> and in Mediterranean <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel</b> were between 0. 16 and 2. 41 microg g(- 1) of weight wet (mean, 0. 68 microg g(- 1)) and between 0. 09 and 1. 62 microg g(- 1) (mean, 0. 51 microg g(- 1)), respectively. The regression curves revealed {{a significant relationship between}} mercury concentration and fish size (length and weight) for both species. Concentrations exceeding the proposed limit for human consumption were observed in 33. 3 % of the samples of both species and were associated with larger specimens. The consumption of the larger specimens could lead to an increase in mercury exposure for consumers. Estimated weekly intakes, calculated on the basis of concentrations relative to each size class, revealed a high exposure associated with the consumption of fish larger than 30 cm (<b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> 11. 63 to 20. 16 microg/kg of body weight; Mediterranean <b>horse</b> <b>mackerel,</b> 5. 86 to 13. 55 microg/kg of body weight).
