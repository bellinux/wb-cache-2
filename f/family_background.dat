40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} overall development of preschool children from disadvantaged <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in South Korea. 1, 469 children aged 3 to 6 were involved (971 children from disadvantaged <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and 498 from ordinary <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds).</b> The result showed that children from disadvantaged <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> scored significantly lower in cognitive, language, social, and motor development {{than those from}} ordinary <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> It also reported potential developmental delay pathways that delayed motor development of children from disadvantaged <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> influenced their language development negatively, mediated by delayed cognitive development, and finally had {{a negative impact on}} social development indirectly...|$|R

40|$|This file {{was last}} viewed in Adobe Reader X. This study {{explored}} associations between individuals' risky <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> from childhood {{and the implications}} for relationship outcomes (satisfaction and positive and negative interaction qualities) in young adult dating relationships. A sample of 100 dating couples completed self-report measures to address risky <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and current relationship satisfaction. Couples also participated in a videotaped discussion about a source of conflict in their relationship that was later coded by trained experimenters. Associations between these variables were analyzed using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM; Cook & Kenny, 2005). The findings suggest that male risky <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were correlated with their own and their partners' positive and negative interaction quality. Female risky <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were not predictive of relationship outcomes for either partner. These findings may potentially be explained by gender differences in childhood friendships, willingness to seek counseling, or diverse coping skills used by males and females. Additional potential explanations for findings along with implications for the counseling field are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, {{in spite of his}} conservative militaristic <b>family</b> <b>background,</b> had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of his}} ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of <b>family</b> <b>background,</b> using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character. The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. The young James Bond spends much of his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments company representative. Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of <b>family</b> <b>background.</b> The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, , gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the story, Takaaki meets {{several other}} heroines {{attending}} his school. The first is Manaka Komaki, a timid, clumsy, but accommodating {{girl who is}} the vice class representative of Takaaki's class. She often spends time in the school library's storage, and helps the library committee with general tasks. Similar to Takaaki, she is inarticulate around the opposite gender. Manaka is also close friends with Yuma Tonami, an aggressive girl who commutes to school by a mountain bike. Yuma sees Takaaki as a rival after she first met him at school, and often challenges him to various duels. She often laments her grandfather's insistence of having her take over the family business, and attempts to hide her <b>family</b> <b>background</b> from Takaaki. Karin Sasamori is a schoolmate of Takaaki's {{and the founder of}} the school's mystery club. Karin has a cheerful and energetic personality, and has an odd affection towards the occult and objects such as egg sandwiches. She first meets Takaaki early in the story, and later deceives him into joining the mystery club.|$|E
5|$|William Thomas Stearn {{was born}} at 37 Springfield Road, Chesterton, Cambridge, England, on 16 April 1911, the eldest of four sons, to Thomas Stearn (1871/2–1922) and Ellen ("Nellie") Kiddy (1886–1986) of West Suffolk. His father worked as a coachman to a Cambridge doctor. Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the River Cam, about two miles north of Cambridge's City Centre, where Springfield Road ran {{parallel}} to Milton Road to the west. William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School (see image). Despite not having any <b>family</b> <b>background</b> in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher) he developed {{a keen interest in}} natural history and books at an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the wild flowers of the hedgerows and fields. Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when William was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties since his widow had no pension.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to further investigate, with a focus on Vietnam, such as demographic factors, <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> and prior exposure to self-employment on entrepreneurial intention of business students. Demographic factors include age, gender and education level; <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> include their parents’ job status and parents’ immigrant background. We also strive to assess whether prior experience in self-employment has any impact on entrepreneurial intention of young business graduates or not. Investigating the motives that drive graduate students for entrepreneurship is highly significant given the importance of entrepreneurship for job creation and economic growth.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} secondary education tracking and <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> on education attainment in urban China. Using the data of 2003 General Social Survey in urban China, our study reveals that having a highly educated father or having a father who is a professional is beneficial for getting into key-point senior high schools, while students are equally likely to gain admission of four-year universities regardless of their origins. The most important determinant of the two track placements is their previous key-point school characteristics. However, students begin to benefit from their <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> especially from parents’ high education level and socioeconomic status for university attainment when the opportunity for tertiary education gradually expands. Our {{findings suggest that the}} merit based tracking system in urban China provided some room for disadvantaged students to realize upward mobility when the admission process was governed by entrance exams. However, recent admission policy reforms render <b>family</b> <b>backgrounds</b> emerge as influential factors deciding tertiary education attainment and the education chances for disadvantaged students are further squeezed...|$|R
