40|$|Abstract. <b>Galloping</b> {{is one of}} the gravely natural {{disasters}} witch put a significant threat to Grid security and stability. In this paper, a comprehensive, systematic research and analysis about transmission line <b>galloping</b> in China in recent years was done. Laws and characteristics of <b>galloping</b> disaster was analyzed in many aspects, including time and place that the <b>galloping</b> occurred, name of transmission line, voltage and structural parameters of line, meteorological data (air temperature, wind speed, ice, etc.),the topography information where the transmission line located, the duration of <b>galloping,</b> and the destruction forms coursed by <b>galloping.</b> This work provides an important research reference not only for anti-galloping methods but enhancing the ability of withstanding {{natural disasters}} in Grid...|$|R

Since ice block along the cable works like wing for lift under the strong wind, self-excited vibration will be caused into <b>galloping</b> of cables. To lower the cost for electric transportation, researching for dumping method for <b>galloping</b> phenomena is important subjects. In this study we propose zaile method, connecting flux of cables with insulator chains, to lower vibration of cables. Models experiments for dumping effect of <b>galloping</b> have been done, with several zaile patterns.

40|$|Unpredictable fatigue {{failures}} of cantilevered traffic signal structures in Texas {{and throughout the}} United States {{in recent years have}} created the need to study their fatigue behavior. Based on recent research, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specification has adopted a design equation for <b>galloping</b> loads that is overly conservative in many cases. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is interested in establishing design criteria for <b>galloping</b> that more accurately represents <b>galloping</b> potential and provides a more efficient design. In this study, three signal structures in Texas were monitored for a total of 9 months to detect the magnitude of <b>galloping</b> forces experienced in the field. Although large-amplitude displacements were measured in the field, sustained <b>galloping</b> did not occur. In addition to the field tests, an analytical model was developed and used to perform a parametric study for predicting the <b>galloping</b> potential of traffic signal structures with various properties.

5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the <b>gallop.</b> Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E
40|$|Power {{lines are}} {{subjected}} to complex aerodynamic forces that may cause <b>galloping.</b> The <b>galloping</b> phenomenon is highly complex because of the nonlinear, geometric-dependent, time-varying aerodynamic loads and the resulting amplitudes of vibration, which may cause interactions between various vibration modes and also between adjacent spans and their support hardware. It is generally agreed that cable <b>galloping</b> {{is the result of}} the aerodynamic instability of ice-coated cables. This instability can be defined in terms of measurable aerodynamic properties of the airfoils and the characteristics of the mechanical system. <b>Galloping</b> oscillations can cause interphase clashing, which may lead to flashovers that result in severe disruptions in the electrical power supply. The <b>galloping</b> motion can cause impact damage to insulator strings, support hardware, and tower components. The purpose of this work is to develop mathematical models that provide guidance in designing an energy absorber that will reduce both the magnitude of <b>galloping</b> and the peak impact loads that act on power line structures...|$|R

Discrete models of one DOF, two DOFs, and three DOFs were derived from the continuum model by using the Garlekin method. And the three models were compared by analyzing the <b>galloping</b> vertical amplitude and torsional angle with different influence factors. The influence factors include wind velocity, flow density, span length, damping ratio, and initial tension. The three-DOF model is more accurate at calculating the <b>galloping</b> characteristics than the other two models, but the one-DOF and two-DOF models can also present the trend of <b>galloping</b> amplitude change from the point view of qualitative analysis.

40|$|Rain–wind–induced <b>galloping</b> {{phenomenon}} often {{occurs on}} overhead transmission tower-lines system, just as icing <b>galloping</b> and vortex-excited vibration; {{this kind of}} instability oscillation can cause power-line breakage or tower failure. However, the existing theoretical models of rain–wind–induced <b>galloping</b> are mainly based on the hypothesis of the overhead power-lines with fixed ends, which is inconsistent with the actual operation situation. Therefore, this article thus presents a preliminary theoretical study and proposes a new theoretical model {{taking into account the}} effect of tower excitations on the in-plane <b>galloping</b> of the overhead power-line and on the motion of the upper rain-line. The theoretical model is solved by Galerkin method and verified by the comparison with the test data obtained in the available literature involved with the overhead power-lines with fixed towers or moving towers.
