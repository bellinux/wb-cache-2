5|$|Since {{there is}} no {{physical}} <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that Rappo killed Callahan's wife and son, the case remains unsolved. Mulder's narration states that Rappo's family tries to have him buried at Arlington National Cemetery; he is instead buried in a civilian cemetery in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake {{in the history of}} Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old faults in the region, but none of them are known still to be active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that they are linked.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey prohibits plea {{bargaining}} in DUI cases unless the prosecutor {{believes there is}} insufficient <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other diversion programs. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but {{may be able to}} sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.|$|E
5|$|The senior project {{consists}} of four main P's project, paper, portfolio and presentation. The {{students are required to}} work on a project outside of class that takes at least 15 hours of their time. This project can be anything. Their paper then has to relate in some way to their project, so if the project is creating a bird house the paper could be able the best type of bird house. The portfolio then brings everything together with <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the project was completed. The presentation is then given at least 3 times and ties all of the items together. All the projects are judged throughout the year, and the top four receive a scholarship to help finance their college education.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} clear <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> king John IV of Portugal {{friendship}} and admiration to Rebelo: {{the dedication of}} his own musical treatise Defensa de la musica moderna (In Defense of modern music), published anonymously in 1650, {{a letter to the}} Portuguese agent in Rome and a paragraph of his last will and testament.|$|R
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have sought to}} link this Maharaja of Zabaj with the Sailendra king of Java. However, there are few <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the Maharaja of Zabaj is the same king of Sailendra. While the Javakan king of Tambralinga had been directly linked to Maharaja of Zabaj. Therefore, the Javaka had occurred in The history since 9th century. In addition, Javakan king also occurred {{in the history of}} Lavo kingdom.|$|R
5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice {{announced}} that it would not file criminal charges of violating one's civil rights against Gelhaus. According to a Justice Department spokesman, the decision to not file charges against Gelhaus was due to insufficient <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that he willfully used excessive force that resulted in Lopez's death. A group of federal prosecutors and FBI agents reviewed the case and determine {{there was a lack of}} <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> Gelhaus violated Andy Lopez's civil rights.|$|E
6000|$|Whatever {{might be}} the natural affection of the colonies for the mother country,--and there are {{abundant}} <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that it was deep-rooted and strong,--it had never been properly reciprocated. They yearned to be considered as children; they were treated by her as changelings. Burke testifies that her policy toward them from the beginning had been purely commercial, and her commercial policy wholly restrictive. [...] "It was the system of a monopoly." ...|$|R

25|$|Although the DG had {{based his}} {{decision}} on evidence, he had misdirected himself {{as to the}} nature and effect of the <b>evidence</b> required <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the export of the goods. While the DG had prima facie <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> show that the goods had not been exported, the applicant had submitted his own <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> rebut this finding. The nature and effect of the <b>evidence</b> was <b>to</b> nullify the factual basis upon which the DG had made his decision. It was sufficient that the applicant's evidence had such an effect, and the DG, in failing to recognize this while placing undue weight on his own evidence, had misdirected himself as to the nature and effect of the <b>evidence</b> required <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the export of the goods.|$|R
25|$|Crow {{concluded}} {{that even though}} there was probable cause, the actions and testimony of Wood had so muddied the facts that there wasn't enough credible <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the case beyond reasonable doubt, and recommended the dismissal of all charges.|$|E
25|$|On July 7, 2014, District Attorney Jill Ravitch {{announced}} {{no charges}} would be filed against Gelhaus.

50|$|Gredelj {{was arrested}} by the Ustashe {{in the summer of}} 1941. He was {{tortured}} in prison, but said nothing. He was set free, since there was not enough <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his guilt. After that, he was appointed to work in illegal press cell of the Communist Party of Croatia in Klaićeva street. Ustasha agents discovered illegal press room on 23 December 1941, and tried to arrest Gredelj. He started shooting and tried to escape, but was mortally wounded. He was transported to Vinogradska street hospital where he soon died of wounds.|$|R

25|$|The oral {{tradition}} in the region indicates Dr. Baker was a well known and well respected physician, {{but there is little}} <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> this. He was however made an honorary member of the North Carolina Medical Society when it was formed in 1849 and two of his sons-in-law and his ward were all physicians, likely his students.|$|E
25|$|However, the Maragha school {{never made}} the {{paradigm}} shift to heliocentrism. The influence of the Maragha school on Copernicus remains speculative, {{since there is no}} documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> it. The possibility that Copernicus independently developed the Tusi couple remains open, since no researcher has yet demonstrated that he knew about Tusi's work or that of the Maragha school.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{cases of}} {{assassination}} attempts involve famous historical figures.

25|$|The Tai {{ethnic groups}} are {{believed}} to have begun migrating south from China to Southeast Asia during the first millennium CE.

In support of the theory, however, it is believed the O1 Y-DNA haplogroup is associated with both the Austronesian people and the Tai.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, {{the lake}} {{is home to a}} mysterious sea creature, known as the Lake Van Monster which is {{believed}} by some to lurk {{below the surface of the}} lake, described as being 30-40 ft long with brown scaly skin and with a elongated reptilian head and flippers, resembling an extinct mosasaurus or basilosaurus.

2500|$|There is [...] a [...] {{perception}} that some Kashmir-linked Vadama settled in Tirunelveli between 750 and 800 AD.

Art Historians such as Vasundhara Filliozat claim that there are inscriptional <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the continuous migration of teachers from Kashmir to South. Such scholars also state that some other South Indian Saivaite and Tantric traditions were also introduced by teachers from Kashmir.|$|R
