40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} {{hierarchical}} resource management models and algorithms that support both link-sharing and guaranteed realtime services with priority (decoupled delay and bandwidth allocation). We extend the service curve based QoS model, which defines both delay and bandwidth {{requirements of a}} class in a hierarchy, to include fairness, which {{is important for the}} integration of real-time and hierarchical link-sharing <b>services.</b> The resulting <b>Fair</b> <b>Service</b> Curve link-sharing model formalizes the goals of link-sharing, real-time and priority services and exposes the fundamental tradeoffs between these goals. In particular, with decoupled delay and bandwidth allocation, it is impossible to simultaneously provide guaranteed real-time service and achieve perfect link-sharing. We propose a novel scheduling algorithm called Hierarchical <b>Fair</b> <b>Service</b> Curve (H-FSC) that approximates the model closely and efficiently. The algorithm always guarantees the service curves of leaf classes, thus ensures real-time and priority services, while minimizing the discrepancy between the actual services provided to and the services defined by the <b>Fair</b> <b>Service</b> Curve link-sharing model for the interior classes. We have implemented the H-FSC scheduler in NetBSD. By performing simulation and measurement experiments, we evaluate the link-sharing and real-time performances of H-FSC, and determine the computation overhead. I...|$|R

40|$|Providing <b>fair</b> <b>service</b> among TCP {{connections}} {{over the}} Internet without hampering resource utilization has recently {{become a major}} performance concern. With {{the rapid expansion of}} the Internet along with its increasingly diversified client base, the demand for a reasonably <b>fair</b> <b>service</b> is getting even stronger. To meet these requirements, congestion sensing is essential. Explicit Congestion Notification, ECN has been proved to provide a fast indication of incipient congestion and thus better the performance of a TCP/IP network. In our previous works we have proposed a strategy for ECN called Fair In-time Marking, FIM, and observed its superiority over other ECN schemes in terms of assuring a <b>fair</b> <b>service.</b> However, all TCP connections are not ECN capable. Therefore, they use packet drops for congestion signaling. In this work, we carry out investigations on gateway or router performance in providing fairness when both FIM ECN capable and non ECN capable connections are employed. We propose a new packet dropping scheme named Fair In-time Dropping, (FID) which drops packets from a connection upon detecting an incipient indication of congestion depending on its share of buffer occupancy. We also show that the combination of FIM and FID offers the best fairness compared with combining FIM with other dropping schemes...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Because of the {{development}} of recent broad-band access technologies, <b>fair</b> <b>service</b> among users is becoming more important goal. The most promising router mechanisms for providing <b>fair</b> <b>service</b> is per–flow traffic management. However, it is difficult to implement in high–speed core routers because per– flow state management is prohibitively expensive; thus, a large number of flows are aggregated into a small number of queues. This is not an acceptable situation because fairness degrades as the number of flows so aggregated increases. In this paper, we propose a new traffic management scheme called Hierarchically Aggregated Fair Queueing (HAFQ) to provide per–flow fair ser-vice. Our scheme can adjust flow aggregation levels according to the queue handling capability of various routers. This means the proposed scheme scales well in high–speed networks. HAFQ improves the fairness among aggregated flows by estimating the number of flows aggregated in a queue and allocating bandwidth to the queue proportionally. In addition, since HAFQ can identify flows having higher arrival rates simultaneously while estimating the number of flows, it enhances the fairness by preferentially dropping their packets. We show that our scheme can provide per–flow <b>fair</b> <b>service</b> through extensive simulation and experi-ments using a network processor. Since the currently available network processors (Intel IXP 1200 in our case) are not high ca-pacity, we also give extensive discussions on the applicability of our scheme to the high–speed core routers...|$|R
