5|$|Gilbert's son, {{also called}} Gilbert de Clare, {{inherited}} the castle, but he died fighting {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn in 1314 while still quite young. The family's lands were initially placed {{under the control of the}} Crown, but before any decision could be taken on the inheritance, a revolt broke out in Glamorgan. Anger over the actions of the royal administrators caused Llywelyn Bren to rise up in January 1316, attacking Caerphilly Castle with a large force of men. The castle withstood the attack, but the town was destroyed and the rebellion spread. A royal army was despatched to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> defeating Bren in a battle at Caerphilly Mountain and breaking the Welsh siege of the castle.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the {{two main}} schools that have {{developed}} in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by Edmund Husserl, focuses on {{the contents of the}} human mind (see noema) and how processes shape our experiences. Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. See Heidegger's Being and Time, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.|$|E
5|$|Mussolini sent a warship {{to shell}} the Greek island of Corfu, and Italian forces {{occupied}} the island on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece {{appealed to the}} League to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute {{because it was the}} conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.|$|E

5|$|The anti-Hindi activists from Madras State {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the 1967 Amendment, as it did not address their concerns about the three language formula. However, with DMK in power, they hesitated to restart the agitation. The Tamil Nadu Students' Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation council split into several factions. The moderate factions favored letting Annadurai and the government to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> The extremist factions restarted the agitations. They demanded scrapping of the three language formula and an end to teaching of Hindi, abolishing the use of Hindi commands in the National Cadet Corps (NCC), banning of Hindi films and songs and closure of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachara Sabha (Institution for Propagation of Hindi in South India).|$|E
5|$|Several {{flights in}} and out of the state were delayed or {{canceled}}, and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry canceled travel across the Delaware Bay during the duration of Isabel. In Atlantic City, casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances. New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses, railways, and light rail equipment. To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane, NJ Transit prepared backup generators, pumps, and chainsaws, with workers inspecting trains and the paths of the lines. FEMA mobilized and dispatched an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force of 28people to the state for possible rescue duty. Days before the storm made landfall, the Salvation Army prepared food and aid for potentially affected citizens. In anticipation for the effects of Isabel, Governor Jim McGreevey declared a state of emergency, which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–78) failed to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> effectively, and rapidly lost {{support among the}} military aristocracy. In late 1077, two of the Empire's leading generals, Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder, the doux of Dyrrhachium in the western Balkans, and Nikephoros Botaneiates, the strategos of the Anatolic Theme in central Asia Minor, were proclaimed emperors by their troops. Bryennios set out from Dyrrhachium towards the imperial capital Constantinople, winning widespread support along the way and the loyalty {{of most of the}} Empire's Balkan field army. He preferred to negotiate at first, but his offers were rebuffed by Michael VII. Bryennios then sent his brother John to lay siege to Constantinople. Unable to overcome its fortifications, the rebel forces soon retired. This failure led the capital's nobility to turn to Botaneiates instead: in March 1078 Michael VII was forced to abdicate and retire as a monk, and Nikephoros Botaneiates was accepted into the city as emperor.|$|E

5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels {{moved from one}} house to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to the}} main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure how to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> the Croatian forces withdrew from {{the southern part of the}} village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fiscal}} {{pressure}} on the kingdom caused by Edward's expensive alliances led to discontent at home. The regency council at home was frustrated by the mounting national debt, while the king and his commanders on the Continent were angered {{by the failure of}} the government in England to provide sufficient funds. To <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> Edward himself returned to England, arriving in London unannounced on 30 November 1340. Finding the affairs of the realm in disorder, he purged the royal administration of a great number of ministers and judges. These measures did not bring domestic stability, and a stand-off ensued between the king and John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, during which Stratford's relatives Robert Stratford Bishop of Chichester and Henry de Stratford were temporarily stripped of title and imprisoned respectively. Stratford claimed that Edward had violated the laws of the land by arresting royal officers. A certain level of conciliation was reached at the parliament of April 1341. Here Edward was forced to accept severe limitations to his financial and administrative freedom, in return for a grant of taxation. Yet in October the same year, the king repudiated this statute and Archbishop Stratford was politically ostracised. The extraordinary circumstances of the April parliament had forced the king into submission, but under normal circumstances the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, a fact that Edward was able to exploit.|$|E
5|$|Mark {{shows an}} {{interest}} in Paige, but discovers she is dating Tyler. He later learns {{that this is a}} ruse to cover up their involvement with Dimato, who has bought the garage. They eventually regain Mark's trust after helping to bring Dimato to justice, and Mark and Paige reunite. Mark and Tyler's brother Aaron (Matt Wilson) comes to stay with them, and they are later joined by their father Russell (Russell Kiefel), who has a strained relationship with his sons. The Brennans consider buying the garage together, but Tyler later reveals that Russell abused him when he was younger. Mark and Aaron support Tyler and force Russell to leave. Mark and Paige discuss their future together when he admits that he is ready to have children, while she is not. Mark asks Tyler to buy Number 24 with him. They brothers fall out when Tyler learns that Mark tried to protect Aaron from arrest during his investigation into the Erinsborough High fire. While discussing their future, Mark and Paige get engaged. Mark is deeply critical of Paige when she befriends Dimato's lover Michelle Kim (Ra Chapman), who claims to be on the run from Dimato. The issue divides Mark, who does not trust Michelle, and Paige, who believes Mark thinks she is naïve. On their wedding day the police find stolen items with Paige's fingerprints on them, and Mark arrests her. She explains that Dimato and Michelle were trying to set her up and that Paul helped her <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> and that she did not tell Mark to protect him. Furious at Paige for further lies after promising there would be no secrets between them, Mark calls off the wedding. He later apologises and tries to convince Paige to take him back, but she refuses, wanting to find direction in her life and believing they are too different.|$|E
