40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to analyze the new public {{management}} reforms practiced by some of the developed countries and determine their applicability to Nepal. New Public Management (NPM) was defined as cost cutting and downsizing, introducing agencies, separation of purchaser and provider, <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> management authority, <b>performance</b> management, introduction <b>of</b> market mechanisms, changes in personnel systems and quality and customer responsiveness. The term 'applicability' was determined by the perceived usefulness of NPM to stakeholders. The main focus of this research was to find an answer to the pertinent question - Is NPM applicable to Nepal? This research explored the political and bureaucratic environment inherent in Nepal, examined the influence of political and bureaucratic factors to the applicability of NPM and suggested recommendations for future reform in Nepal...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the effects <b>of</b> environmental uncertainty, <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> decisions rights, {{and the use}} <b>of</b> subjective <b>performance</b> measures on managers’ perceptions of outcome controllability and performance evaluation fairness. Based on a survey of 339 middle- and upper- level managers, our results suggest that environmental uncertainty adversely affects perceptions of outcome controllability and that this effect is not moderated by the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> decision rights. Our results also show a positive association between perceived controllability and performance evaluation fairness. Although we found no direct effect of the use <b>of</b> subjective <b>performance</b> measures on perceived performance evaluation fairness, it appears to moderate {{the positive effect of}} perceived controllability on fairness. We also show that the positive effect of the use of subjective measures may depend on contextual and job-related factors. The overall results underscore the need to consider the organizational context (environmental uncertainty and <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> decision rights) to investigate how performance measures affect perceived controllability and fairness. Because perceived controllability and fairness affect individual attitudes and behaviors within an organization, our results have important implications for the design and use <b>of</b> <b>performance</b> evaluation systems...|$|R
40|$|The current edition in English {{language}} {{turns into}} account and completes the studies {{published in the}} previous edition. Carrying on the research and publication activities {{on the topic of}} corruption is based on its novelty and on the special interest for the Romanian language edition. At the same time, we hope that the current volume will provide greater opportunities for foreign access and thus the admittance in the European and international flows of information in this field. The core ideas of the book focus on social perception, modelled through statistic analyses, on the specificity of corruption in the public administration or the public health system in close correlation to the processes <b>of</b> <b>decentralization</b> and <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> health services. The analysis of the corruption topic is in interference with the effects of the European integration processes, globalization, being correlated to adjacent developments concerning the public integrity, national or regional economic freedom and development. This book represents the result of the scientific collaboration between teams of teaching staff and students from the National School of Political Studies and Public Administration and Academy of Economic Studies, Bucharest. The book is structured on nine chapters, organised according to a didactic logic, in view to provide the reader a profound overview of the mechanisms and methodology of research as well as the conclusions and the economic and social impact of corruption. Data processing in view to estimate the correlations and parameters of regression has been achieved through SPSS and Eviews statistic programs.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we examine the}} effect which the {{obsolescence}} of central city housing exerts on the decentralization within urban areas of high status residents. In particular, we investigate whether housing obsolescence is a useful addition to a model which explains the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> high status residents {{in terms of the}} intensity of competition for central city land. All of our data are official Census figures for 1970. The subjects of our study are Standard Metropolitan Statistical Are. as (SMSA. 2 ̆ 7 s) whose central city had a population of 100, 000 or more. From this group we delete the New York and Chicago Consolidated Areas because of their great size and the number of municipalities included within their borders. For each SMSA we compute the percentage of its families and unrelated individuals who had an income of greater than 25, 000 and who lived in the central city. We then statistically control for variation across SMSA. 2 ̆ 7 s in the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> population and employment. The <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> population is measured by the percentage of the SMSA population which resided within the central city. The <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> employment is measured by the percentage of SMSA jobs which were located within the central city. Once we have controlled the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> the well-to-do for the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> population and the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> employment, we regress it on population density, housing obsolescence, and city age. Population density is persons per square mile in the central city. Housing obsolescence is the percentage of the central city housing structures which were twenty years old or older. City age is the number of decades since the central city attained a population of 50, 000. In our study we demonstrate that population density exerts a considerably stronger effect on the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> the well-to-do than is exerted by housing obsolescence. We also demonstrate that most of city age 2 ̆ 7 s effect on the <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> the well-to-do can be explained by city age 2 ̆ 7 s effect on population density and housing obsolescence...|$|R

The level <b>of</b> <b>decentralization</b> <b>of</b> public power in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the XIII - the beginning of XVII century was high.
