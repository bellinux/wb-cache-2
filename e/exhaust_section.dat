50|$|Most {{military}} aircraft use afterburners (or reheat) to occasionally travel at supersonic speeds and cannot reach supersonic speeds using the dry engine thrust. In these cases afterburners are highly inefficient compared to conventional jet engine operation {{due to the}} low pressures typically found in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>section,</b> but their engines are more efficient when the afterburners are not operational, although also less powerful.|$|E
50|$|A {{jet engine}} {{afterburner}} is an extended <b>exhaust</b> <b>section</b> containing extra fuel injectors. Since the jet engine upstream (i.e., before the turbine) will use {{little of the}} oxygen it ingests, additional fuel can be burned after the gas flow has left the turbines. When the afterburner is turned on, fuel is injected and igniters are fired. The resulting combustion process increases the afterburner exit (nozzle entry) temperature significantly, resulting in a steep increase in engine net thrust. In addition {{to the increase in}} afterburner exit stagnation temperature, there is also an increase in nozzle mass flow (i.e. afterburner entry mass flow plus the effective afterburner fuel flow), but a decrease in afterburner exit stagnation pressure (owing to a fundamental loss due to heating plus friction and turbulence losses).|$|E

The central casing held the power shaft and was made from magnesium alloy. Around it were the six flame cans. The turbine was made of solid Inconel blades attached to an austenitic steel hub.

5000|$|Motorcycle {{exhausts}} come in {{many varieties}} {{depending on the}} type of engine and its intended use.

Larger engines that come with 4 cylinders, such as Japanese super-sport or super-bikes (such the Kawasaki ZX series, Honda's CBR series, Yamaha's YZF series, also known as R6 and R1, and Suzuki's GSX-R series) often come with a twin exhaust system. A [...] "full system" [...] may be bought as an aftermarket accessory, also called a 4-2-1 or 4-1, depending on its layout. In the past, these bikes would come standard with a single exhaust, as seen on the Kawasaki ZX-6R 2000 and 2001 models. However, EU noise and pollution regulations have generally stopped this practice, forcing companies to use other methods to increase performance of the motorcycle.|$|E

40|$|Firstly it is {{observed}} that in a large number of existing steam power plants the energy potential of the cooling medium is not fully utilized owing to turbine limitation in exhaust volume flow-handling capability. A method is proposed by which a fraction of the low-pressure steam is extracted and fed to an auxiliary organic Rankine cycle (ORC) module of small capacity which, besides being perfectly suited to exploiting even the coldest cooling agent, improves the working conditions of the main turbine by reducing its exhaust volume flow. Through the implementation of an appropriate computer program the performance of a typical power station supplemented with an ORC system is analysed for different cooling situations.

Building on previous work published in this journal by the authors, this study was undertaken to improve the operating range, accuracy and usability of the original model as well as introducing the ability to model twin skin <b>exhaust</b> <b>sections</b> with an air gap. Convective heat transfer relationships for nine stainless steel <b>exhaust</b> bend <b>sections</b> of varying wall thicknesses and radiuses were experimentally characterised over a range of steady state conditions. In each case a correlation between observed Reynolds number (Re) and Nusselt number (Nu) was developed. Based on measured experimental data, a generic model was built using Matlab/Simulink capable of predicting the relationship between Nusselt number and Reynolds number for previously unseen pipe geometries falling within the experimental design range. To further develop the usefulness of the model, fifteen twin skin test sections, intended to represent a range of geometries applicable to production automotive gasoline exhaust systems, were also fabricated and characterised. Within the model, both skins of each pipe section were split into five axial and radial elements with the inner and outer skins linked via the modelling of free convection and radiation between them. The predicted Reynolds-Nusselt relationships for each bend section and twin skin configuration were validated using transient experimental data over a portion of the US 06 drive cycle.

40|$|Deflectors {{have been}} {{employed}} in industrial combustors and boilers with an expectation they reduce both radiation heat losses from the fuel bed and impact particle emissions. Despite much research into lab-scale biomass combustion, {{there have been}} no systematic studies to investigate the effects of deflectors on the axially resolved and flue gas availability in laboratory scale fixed bed biomass combustors. This study includes experiments conducted on a continuous feed pellet combustor, with a freeboard deflector located at different axial locations. The aim is to characterize the relative impact of freeboard deflectors on the mechanical exergy profiles and exhaust gas total exergy, over a range of stoichiometry (primary and secondary air flow rates). Results indicate that deflectors affect the mechanical exergy in the downstream, however their influence depends on their relative (axial) position (H). Furthermore, results reveal that for the tests with and without deflector, both CO chemical exergy and total exergy decrease in a similar manner when the air-fuel equivalence ratio (λ) increases.

When working as a generator, the linear Faraday MHD converter was efficient enough, due to high electrical conductivity (3000 S/m) to create a front shock wave at the intake of the constant cross-section MHD converter. Accelerations up to 5000 m/s were obtained in 10 cm long channels. This suggested the possibility to achieve complete shock wave and turbulent wake cancellation, through MHD bypass concept. Such work gave publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentation in international MHD meetings (French Academy of Sciences 1970, Moscow 1983, Tsukuba 1986, Beijing 1992). The work was conducted both through computational simulations (based on the method of characteristics) and hydraulic simulation experiments. We present the synthesis of such studies through a project of a hypersonic vehicle based on an MHD bypass concept, landing under its own steam, using classical turbojets.

This paper investigates the accuracy of this class of Green's functions for predicting the duct noise levels when measured stator vane unsteady surface pressures are used as input to the theoretical formulation. The accuracy of the method is evaluated by comparing the predicted and measured acoustic power levels for the NASA 48 inch low speed Active Noise Control Fan.

In recent years urea selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has become the principal method of NOx abatement within heavy duty (HD) diesel exhaust systems; however, with upcoming applications demanding NOx reduction efficiencies of above 96 % on engines producing upwards of 10 g·kWh − 1 NOx, future diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) dosing systems will be required to operate stably at significantly increased dosing rates. Developing a dosing system capable of meeting the increased performance requirements demands an improved understanding of how DEF sprays interact with changing exhaust flows. This study has investigated four production systems representing a diverse range of dosing strategies in order to determine how performance is influenced by spray structure and identify promising strategies for further development. The construction of an optically accessible hot-air flow rig has enabled visualisation of DEF injection into flows representative of HD diesel exhaust conditions. High-speed and laser sheet imaging have been applied to capture the injection event and analyse spray development within the flows. Results from ambient shadowgraphy show the extent of variation in spray structure that exists between the systems; further quantified with droplet size distribution data collected using phase Doppler interferometry (PDI). Imaging within the <b>exhaust</b> <b>section</b> indicates that the structure of a spray has a significant impact on droplet entrainment within the flow, in turn affecting the level of spray-wall impingement seen.

The combustion pressure has been chosen based on the values quoted in literature for centimeter sized gas turbine. Exhaust gas temperature and composition have been measured for several mass flow rates. A reduction in chemical efficiency is observed by increasing the input thermal power (i. e. the total mass flow rate) at fixed equivalence ratio due to the shorter gas residence time. The operative condition corresponding to high efficiency and smaller mass flow rate has been numerically investigated adopting the RANS k-ε approach, with finite rate chemistry kinetic mechanism (GRIMech 1. 2, 32 species and 177 reactions) and the EDC turbulence-combustion coupling model. Gas temperature at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>section</b> and chemical efficiency are predicted and compared with the corresponding experiment. Numerical and experimental results show to be in fair agreement, and the predicted chemical efficiency differs from the measured value of about 1 %. Despite {{the small size of}} the meso- combustor, it is possible to achieve a relatively high combustion efficiency, making it suitable for miniaturized power generation devices. The relatively high chemical efficiency is due to the relatively long average gas residence time and to a wide recirculation zone that provide heat and radicals to the flame, coupled with the fairly good mixing due to swirl motion and the impinging air/fuel jets...|$|E

The extreme temperatures and dangerous internal conditions make direct observation of phenomenon and mechanisms impossible. Many specific numerical models have been created to describe the different phenomenon in detail. The discontinuity of the individual numerical models combined with their inherent complexity make it difficult for non-experts to understand. The fourth chapter of this work describes a virtual reality blast furnace that is created using combinations of numeric and geometric modeling data. The virtual reality blast furnace is designed to bring complex research together promoting universal understanding. The virtual reality model is ultimately intended {{to be used as a}} training tool for people involved aspects of the steel making industry, while providing insight for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|For the {{operators}} of small incineration plants for chemotoxic or radioactive hazardous waste, advanced incineration techniques {{are of interest}} {{with a view to}} improving the operating characteristics and reducing gaseous pollutant emissions. The subject {{of this study was to}} investigate oxygen enrichment in the supply air for the incineration of hazardous waste. The aim was to determine the benefits and disadvantages of this technology for industrial application. Pilot-scale experiments were carried out in a swivelling furnace. The waste throughput was increased by a factor of 3 during the experiments while maintaining the exhaust gas quality, which implies a cost-efficient capacity expansion. On the other hand, considerable energy savings and a diminution of the <b>exhaust</b> gas purification <b>section</b> are achieved by reducing the nitrogen content in the supply air. Moreover, short-time oxygen addition can reduce unburned hydrocarbon emissions in the event of larger packages being incinerated. The discharge of heavy metals was significantly reduced to 40 percent by oxygenation. The results of the measurements show that the frequently discussed reduction of pollutants does not occur. This applies to nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated benzenes and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). Due to a three-fold reduction in exhaust gas volume and the same pollutant concentration, a waste-mass-related reduction of the pollutant emission occurs. Therefore, incineration with oxygen enrichment is more environment-friendly than the conventional incineration process. For larger plant dimensions, however, an increase in nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions is to be assumed. A clear reduction of the emission of organic hydrocarbon compounds was achieved by increasing the residence time of the exhaust gas in the combustion chamber. It was even possible to reduce the PCDD/F emissions under the legal limit, which is 0, 1 ng/Nm" 3. (orig.)
