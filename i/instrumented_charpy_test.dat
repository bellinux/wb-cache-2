40|$|Abstract. <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> {{method is}} {{possible}} to obtain various dynamic fracture characteristics from the load-deflection or load-time curve. Recently, <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method is widely used {{for the evaluation of}} toughness of various specimens of different materials with different sizes. It is important to record an accurate impact load in order to improve the reliability of this test method. In some standards of <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method such as ISO and ASTM, they havent clearly standardized striker geometry which seem to directly influence the obtained impact load. There are some differences between standards, although standard procedures are well defined. Therefore, <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method has a problem that measurement value is different depending on each standard. In the present study, the effect of striking edge geometries, which are difference between ISO and ASTM, on load-deflection curve and absorbed energy were investigated. According to ISO and ASTM, two types of striker having different radius were machined. There was no difference between the two different striking edge geometries for values of absorbed energy per unit ligament area less than 0. 75 J/mm 2. However, striking edge geometry according to ASTM is not propriety for <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> method because of four, instead of three, point bending on process of fracture at high level of absorbed energy. The effect of brinelling deformation, which was considered as an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM, is very small on <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test.</b> Consequently, there seem to be not an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM. Therefore, standards should be unified in the striking edge geometry according to ISO...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey is}} made of analytic, {{experimental}} and numerical techniques {{in the field of}} the dynamic initiation, and early propagation, of cracks. As no closed form analytic solutions exist for finite geometries, even in the elastic case, numerical and experimental techniques have to be developed. In instrumented impact tests plasticity often occurs. The specific problem of the <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> <b>Test</b> is discussed in detail by virtue of its technological significance and the extensive literature available for the test. Although a standard for the test has been proposed there are still outstanding questions to be answered, for which the techniques described above can be used. The problem of the dynamic calibration of various notched geometries is addressed in the original work of the thesis. The Charpy, Izod, Slender Cantilever and Double Notched Bar geometries are studied using dynamic photoelasticity and 8000 fps photography. It is shown that the response of the DNB is more straightforward than the Charpy geometry. Further photoelastic study of the latter two geometries, using epoxy model material and 10 6 fps photography, gives a quantitative measure of the growth of stress intensity factor at the notch tips and hence a dynamic calibration is deduced. An explicit finite difference code is used to supplement photoelastic data. Having achieved progress in the derivation of the dynamic calibration of the two selected geometries, corresponding instrumented impact tests are then undertaken. The Hopkinson Pressure Bar method of loading is used. It is concluded that the proposed standard for the <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> <b>Test</b> is valid within limits but that there is a requirement for a dynamic calibration.

40|$|Due to {{the large}} volume {{consumption}} of polyolefins, {{the treatment of the}} resulting solid waste is becoming a major concern. One possible utilization of the polyolefin wastes is to form blends from recycled polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). This study is a preliminary investigation on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends. The impact testing method employed in this study includes the conventional and instrumented Izod impact <b>tests,</b> the <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test,</b> and the instrumented drop weight plate impact test (IDWPIT). In both conventional and instrumented Izod impact testing, PP homopolymer and PP/LDPE blend have similar impact strengths, while PP/HDPE blend exhibits slightly lower impact strength. However, the <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> impact <b>test</b> indicates that both PP/LDPE and PP/HDPE have similar impact strengths, and both are slightly lower than PP homopolymer. This suggests that the type of impact test employed is playing {{an important role in the}} impact fracture behaviour of the PP/PE blends. The effect of temperature on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends was evaluated by means of the Charpy and drop weight plate impact tests. During the tests, impact strengths reduced with decreasing testing temperature.

40|$|Control of ductile {{fracture}} propagation {{is one of}} the major concerns for pipeline industry, particularly with the increasing demand of new control rolled steel grades required to maintain integrity at high operational pressures. The objective of this research is to understand which microstructural features govern crack propagation, and to analyse the effect of two of them (average grain size, and volume fraction of pearlite). The main disadvantage during classical Charpy test was to discriminate the crack initiation and propagation energy during fracture of a notched sample. The initiation appears to be caused by the stress state in the neighbouring of Ti-containing precipitates or pearlite particles (no presence of M/A constituents or MnS inclusions was detected in the evaluated grades), propagation-arrest of the crack is assumed to play the main role concerning the control of fracture. Our approach to characterize the fracture resistance is to measure the energy absorbed during the crack propagation stage by means of load-displacement curves obtained via <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> <b>test.</b> It was observed that the energy absorbed during crack propagation is not influenced by the average grain size but by the fraction and the morphological (banded-not banded) distribution of second pearlitic phase.

40|$|The Heavy-Section Steel Irradiation Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is {{involved}} in two cooperative projects, with international participants, both of which involve Charpy V-notch impact tests with instrumented strikers of 2 mm and 8 mm radii. Two heats of A 533 grade B class I pressure vessel steel and a low upper-shelf (LUS) submerged-arc (SA) weld were tested on the same Charpy machine, while one heat of a Russian Cr-Mo-V forging steel and a high upper-shelf (HUS) SA weld were tested on two different machines. The number of replicate tests at any one temperature ranged from 2 to 46 specimens. Prior to testing with each striker, verification specimens at the low, high, and super high energy levels from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) were tested. In the two series of verification tests, the tests with the 2 mm striker met the requirements at the low and high energy levels {{but not at the}} super high energy. For one plate, the 2 mm striker showed somewhat higher average absorbed energies than those for the 8 -mm striker at all three test temperatures. For the second plate and the LUS weld, however, the 2 mm striker showed somewhat lower energies at both test temperatures. For the Russian forging steel and the HUS weld, tests were conducted over a range of temperatures with tests at one laboratory using the 8 mm striker and tests at a second laboratory using the 2 mm striker. Lateral expansion was measured for all specimens and the results are compared with the absorbed energy results.

40|$|The present thesis aims to {{establish}} a validated thermoelasto-thermoviscoplastic model and a failure criterion for several extruded anisotropic aluminium alloys. The materials investigated are AA 6060, AA 6082, AA 7003 and AA 7108, all in temper T 6, which are relevant for application in automotive crash components, e. g. in crash boxes and bumper beams. AA 6060 -T 6 has recrystallized grain structure, while the other three alloys have fibrous grain structure. The stress-strain behaviour and plastic anisotropy of the materials at {{a wide range of}} strain-rates were obtained through tensile tests. The dynamic fracture behaviour of the investigated alloys was investigated using an <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> <b>test</b> machine and V-notch specimens. The numerical study was carried out with the non-linear finite element code LS-DYNA. Tensile tests at low to medium strain-rates were performed with a standard tensile test machine; while a split-Hopkinson tension bar (SHTB) was used to carry out tests at high rates of strain. Both fibrous and recrystallized extruded aluminium alloys have anisotropic mechanical properties. Tests were therefore done in three directions, i. e. 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, with respect to the extrusion direction in order to characterize the plastic anisotropy of the extruded alloys. Fracture characteristics were obtained from measurements of the original area and fractured area of the gauge section. Based on the test results, an anisotropic thermoelastic-thermoviscoplastic constitutive relation and a simple fracture criterion were calibrated for the alloys and used in explicit finite element analyses of the SHTB tests for all four alloys. Using a combination of implicit and explicit solvers, the numerical predictions were found to represent the observed behaviour, including fracture, in the experimental tests fairly well. To investigate dynamic fracture, instrumented Charpy V-notch impact tests were conducted. For each alloy, the influence of orientation of the specimen with respect to the extrusion direction was investigated with the V-notch either parallel or normal to the thickness direction of the profile. Metallurgical studies were also carried out to investigate the physical mechanisms governing the macroscopic material behaviour. The experiments showed that the dissipated energy is practically invariant to specimen orientation and notch direction for the recrystallized alloy. For the fibrous alloys the dissipated energy decreases with increasing angle between the longitudinal direction of the specimen and the extrusion direction, i. e. the dissipated energy is lower when the notch is parallel to the fibrous grain structure. Finally, 3 D numerical analyses of the Charpy V-notch tests were carried out on AA 6060 -T 6 and AA 7003 -T 6 using LS-DYNA. The work hardening behaviour {{in the first part of}} the test was well predicted in the simulation, while the peak load was underestimated in almost all simulations.

The results show that the fracture toughness of the investigated steel is clearly deteriorated when subjected to welding, and was found to be lowest for the ICCGHAZ microstructure. The deteriorated fracture toughness is linked to the weld microstructures being more heterogeneous and to the MA constituents found in these. Introducing a fatigue pre-crack in the Charpy specimen was seen to have the effect of lowering the fracture resistance in terms of increasing the transition temperature. The difference in fracture toughness between the notched and pre-cracked was found to be largest within the transition region. The upper shelf plateau was found to be lower in the weld-microstructures tested compared to the base material. The scatter was found to be large within the transition region for all combinations of microstructure and notch sharpness, where the CGHAZ microstructure was shown to have the overall largest scatter. The test data was found to be more scattered when testing notched specimens compared to the pre-cracked specimens. Several initiation sites were found close to the notch and fatigue pre-crack in the investigated fracture surfaces. For specimens with a pre-crack, the initiation sites were seen to occur closer to the fatigue crack than in the notched specimens tested at the same temperature for the same microstructure. The notched specimens show a more ductile appearance compared to the pre-cracked specimens at the same test temperature. A ductile region was found in front of the cleavage area in the samples tested at the highest test temperatures. Some of the parameters that can be obtained from the <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> data recorded were discussed. These include the energy measured to maximum load, the energy measured to the onset of brittle fracture initiation and the fractions of the total measured energy these energies make. These were linked to the five different curve classes defined for <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> curves. The increase in maximum load with curve class number was seen to resemble the increase in the measured CTOD values with temperature. The change in energies to maximum load and to the onset of brittle fracture with temperature were seen to have a shape that resembled the Charpy transition curves. The curve classesobtained at the lowest test temperatures show signs of early fracture initiation. It has been challenging to classify some of these curves. The validity of these curves are also uncertain. This was mainly a result of early fracture initiation where un-dissipated inertia effects leads to oscillations in the measured load. The lower bound relation after BS 7910 was shown not shown to provide a good coefficient correlation for the microstructures tested, although conservative results were obtained for the pre-cracked parallels. The Master Curve relation was seen to provide better estimates of the CTOD. The degree of correlation was best for the ICCGHAZ microstructure tested. When using the MC correlation, changing the parameters in the correlation were shown to have a large impact on the degree of correlation. A difference in how the two standards investigated, ASTM E 1921 and BS 7910, define some of these parameters were also found. A suggestion in using data obtained from <b>instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> <b>testing</b> in obtaining new and alternative correlations to estimate parameters obtained from quasi-static fracture mechanical <b>tests</b> from <b>Charpy</b> <b>test</b> data was proposed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{determination}} of load variation against deflection by means of <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Charpy</b> Impact <b>testing</b> for characterizing the dynamic fracture properties of metals, the impact energy distribution of the High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) steel containing Nb, Ni and Ti for pressure vessels at low temperature has been quantitatively studied. The whole fracture behavior relative to the total impact energy Et could be subdivided into two parts, Ei and Ep. Ei {{is related to the}} matrix strength of the material in terms of the grain size and alloy addition, which is also found to be less influenced by the holding time of normalization process at 910. Whereas, Ep of Ni-Nb-Ti HSLA steel is strongly linked to the period of holding time. Thermodynamic kinetic investigation by Transmission Electronic Microscope (TEM) reveals that it maybe the remelting and secondary precipitation of heterogeneous particles with the Face-Center-Cubic (FCC) crystal structure, simultaneously occurring in the austenite-to-ferrite transformation, dispersing onto the active sites like grain boundaries, dislocations etc., which dominates the strengthening mechanism of pinning the grain boundaries and restraining the grain growth. ...|$|R

It was revealed that maximum load point (Fm point) was not exact the dynamic crack initiation, which was detected somewhere prior and very close to Fm point by using Compliance Changing Rate method. This fact was also confirmed by Dynamic CTOD method. That is to say, Impact energy related to the Fm point (i. e. Em) consists not only the crack initiation energy Ei, but a small part of crack extension energy as well. Ratio of EJEm was found to be 0. 90 just applicable to the material used here. Dynamic fracture toughness J Jd was then estimated by modified Rice equation. Crack extension behavior and dynamic crack growth resistance curve (J &mdash; Aa) during stable crack propagation period was carefully analyzed by Key Curve method. Finally, method s for evaluating tearing module Toma, and CTOD curve under the impact test were also briefly introduced in the paper...|$|R
