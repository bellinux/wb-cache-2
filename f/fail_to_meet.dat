5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E

Under the programme, a supermajority of NYGH {{students}} graduate to the College (pre-university) section of HCI for their pre-university education. All students of HCI's high school section also move on automatically to the college section and undertake the GCE Advanced Level examination, unless they <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> requirements (students must have an MSG of 3.00 and below {{at the end of}} Secondary 4) or specifically applied to leave.|$|E
5|$|The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} in Malawi {{has been characterized}} by drastic declines {{in the number of}} health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services: {{more than half of all}} hospital admissions in Malawi are related to HIV/AIDS. However, Malawi currently faces a significant deficit in human resources: only 159 doctors were practicing in Malawi in 2007. The World Health Organization's Essential Health Package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in the country, but the vast majority of Malawi's health facilities <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> this standard.|$|E
25|$|Nepal {{is subject}} to a serious problem with arsenic contamination. The problem is most severe in the Terai region, the worst being near Nawalparasi District, where 26 percent of shallow wells <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> WHO {{standard}} of 10 ppb. A study by Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Environment in the Kathmandu Valley showed that 72% of deep wells <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the WHO standard, and 12% <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the Nepali standard of 50 ppb.|$|R

5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

Cinema NDG was given until December 31, 2013 to find financial backing, but <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the deadline; two extensions were granted in both 2014 and 2015 but Cinema NDG <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> these as well. On November 2, 2015 the city voted to grant a third and final extension, for June 30, 2016, but yet again Cinema NDG <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the deadline, forfeiting the project.|$|R

Contact, the group that handles these issues, and Special Circumstances, its secret service division, can employ only those on whose talents and emotional stability it can rely, and may even reject self-aware drones built for its purposes that <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> its requirements. Hence these divisions are regarded as the Culture's elite and membership {{is widely regarded as}} a prize; yet also, as described in many of the novels, something that can be shameful as it contradicts many of the Culture's moral codes.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} the use of {{different}} graphemes for the same Unihan sememe, Unicode has relied on several mechanisms: especially as it relates to rendering text. One has been to treat it as simply a font issue so that different fonts might be used to render Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Also font formats such as OpenType allow for the mapping of alternate glyphs according to language so that a text rendering system can look to the user's environmental settings to determine which glyph to use. The problem with these approaches is that they <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the goals of Unicode to define a consistent way of encoding multilingual text.|$|E

25|$|The cost of home {{blood glucose}} {{monitoring}} can be substantial {{due to the}} cost of the test strips. In 2006, the consumer cost of each glucose strip ranged from about $0.35 to $1.00. Manufacturers often provide meters at no cost to induce use of the profitable test strips. Type 1 diabetics may test as often as 4 to 10 times a day due to the dynamics of insulin adjustment, whereas type 2 typically test less frequently, especially when insulin is not part of treatment. A recent study on the comparative cost-effectiveness of all options for the self-monitoring of blood glucose funded by the National Health Service in the UK uncovered considerable variation in the price paid, which could not be explained by the availability of advanced meter features. It estimated that a total of £12 m was invested in providing 42 million self-monitoring of blood glucose tests with systems that <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> acceptable accuracy standards, and efficiency savings of £23.2 m per annum are achievable if the National Health Service were to disinvest from technologies providing lesser functionality than available alternatives, but at a much higher price.|$|E

500|$|Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens {{provides}} {{examples of}} what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Steiner's definitions. He gives {{an example of an}} intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and noncompliance are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone who makes the demand [...] "either you accept my offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and noncompliance with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.|$|E
