500|$|Overall, {{the show}} {{received}} {{a positive response}} from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, [...] "The spectacle rivals Celine Dion's 'A New Day' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, I Am ... Sasha Fierce." [...] Melissa Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly wrote in her review of the show, [...] "Once Beyoncé took to the stage, she hardly left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater {{from left to right}} throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the mezzo-soprano <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> on the eyes as she is on the ears." [...] John Griffiths of Us Weekly described the concert as [...] "lavish". Andy Kellman from Allmusic wrote, [...] "The show is certainly a theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyoncé and her large backing band energetically rolling through the singer's back catalog." ...|$|E
2500|$|They have {{sensitive}} skin, and shampoo (canine or human) {{may cause}} allergic reactions; therefore, {{it is best}} to wash them with a gentle dog shampoo, and not a human shampoo (as humans require a different pH than dogs [...] ). Grooming Pharaohs <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> as a quick rub with a hound glove or a damp cloth. They are clean dogs, shed very little, and have no noticeable odour, except when wet or when they've been outside; but their odour quickly returns to normal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} {{has largely been}} seen as an ironic refutation of Parmenides' thesis on Being. Gorgias set out {{to prove that it}} <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> to demonstrate that being is one, unchanging and timeless as it is to prove that being has no existence at all. [...] Regardless of how it [...] "has largely been seen" [...] it seems clear that Gorgias was focused instead on the notion that true objectivity is impossible since the human mind can never be separated from its possessor.|$|E

2500|$|In DIGO, {{improved}} {{oral hygiene}} and plaque control is still important {{to help reduce}} any inflammatory component that may be contributing to the overgrowth. Reversing and preventing gingival enlargement caused by drugs <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> as ceasing drug therapy or substituting to another drug. [...] However, {{this is not always}} an option; in such a situation, alternative drug therapy may be employed, if possible, to avoid this deleterious side effect. [...] In the case of immunosuppression, tacrolimus is an available alternative which results in much less severe gingival overgrowth than cyclosporin, but is similarly as nephrotoxic. [...] The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace nifedipine for some uses of calcium channel blocking and does not induce gingival overgrowth.|$|E
