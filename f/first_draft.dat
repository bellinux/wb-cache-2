5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets poem, The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. The <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it.

After the <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> was written, he set the poem aside, and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E
