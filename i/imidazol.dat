40|$|Background: S 100 B is a dimeric {{protein that}} can form tetramers, hexamers and higher order oligomers. These forms have been {{suggested}} {{to play a role}} in RAGE activation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Oligomerization was found to require a low molecular weight trigger/cofactor and could not be detected for highly pure dimer, irrespective of handling. <b>Imidazol</b> was identified as a substance that can serve this role. Oligomerization is dependent on both the <b>imidazol</b> concentration and pH, with optima around 90 mM <b>imidazol</b> and pH 7, respectively. No oligomerization was observed above pH 8, thus the protonated form of <b>imidazol</b> is the active species in promoting assembly of dimers to higher species. However, disulfide bonds are not involved and the process is independent of redox potential. The process was also found to be independent of whether Ca 2 + is bound to the protein or not. Tetramers that are purified from dimers and <b>imidazol</b> by gel filtration are kinetically stable, but dissociate into dimers upon heating. Dimers do not revert to tetramer and higher oligomer unless <b>imidazol</b> is again added. Both tetramers and hexamers bind the target peptide from p 53 with retained stoichiometry of one peptide per S 100 B monomer, and with high affinity (lgK = 7. 360. 2 and 7. 260. 2, respectively in 10 mM BisTris, 5 mM CaCl 2, pH 7. 0), which is less than one order of magnitude reduced compared to dimer under the same buffer conditions.

40|$|Isoforms (1 - 4) {{of human}} {{tyrosine}} hydroxylase (TH) have been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as apoenzymes (metal-free). Apo-human TH binds 1. 0 atom Fe(II) /enzyme subunit, and iron binding {{is associated with}} an immediate and dramatic (40 -fold) increase in specific activity. For X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements the apoenzyme was reconstituted with 56 Fe and for Mossbauer measurements with 57 Fe. XAFS measurements at the Fe-K edge of human TH were performed on the native form [Fe(II) -human TH], as well as after addition of stoichiometric amounts of the substrate tetrahydropterin, the inhibitor dopamine and of H 2 O 2. The addition of dopamine or H 2 O 2 oxidizes the ferrous iron of the native human TH to the ferric state. In both redox states the iron is octahedrally coordinated by low-Z backscatterers, thus sulfur coordination can be excluded. From the multiple scattering analysis of the EXAFS region is was surmised {{that part of the}} iron coordination is due to (3 ± 1) <b>imidazols.</b> Addition of tetrahydropterin does not significantly change the iron coordination of the Fe(II) enzyme. The Mössbauer results confirm the valence states and the octahedral coordination of iron as well as the exclusion of sulfur ligation.

Crude extracts were prepared with a Basic-Z Cell Disrupter (IUL Constant Systems) and subsequent incubation with MgCl 2 (2.5  mM) and DNaseI (1  µg/ml) for 20  min at room temperature to degrade DNA. The insoluble fraction of the lysate was removed by centrifugation (20, 000  rpm for 40  min at 4  °C). The supernatant was applied to an IMAC affinity column, 5  ml HisTrap™ FF, equilibrated with the resuspension buffer using the ÄKTA Purifier-system. The column was washed with 20  ml of resuspension buffer and the enzyme was eluted with 50  mM KPi buffer pH  8.0 (500  mM <b>imidazol,</b> 500  mM NaCl and 10 % glycerol). Elution was monitored by UV (280 nm) and fractions containing protein were subjected to 12 % SDS-Page described by Laemmli (1970).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the clastogenic action [...] i. e., the ability to induce chromosomal aberrations [...] of the tumor promoter phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) was investigated. PMA at 10 and 100 ng/ml induced {{the formation of a}} low molecular weight (less than 10, 000) clastogenic factor (CF) in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human blood and lymphocyte cultures. Bovine erythrocyte Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase strongly inhibited PMA clastogenicity, both the formation of CF and the action of previously formed CF. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents indomethacin, <b>imidazol,</b> and 5, 8, 11, 14 -icosatetraynoic acid inhibited PMA clastogenicity and the clastogenic activity of previously formed CF.

The results from Phase III trials show that luliconazole 1 % cream applied once daily for 2 weeks successfully resolved the clinical signs and symptoms as well as eradicated the pathologic fungi, which cause tinea pedis. A 1 -week treatment with luliconazole 1 % cream also produced favorable clinical and mycological results in clinical trials for tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Across trials, adverse events consisted mainly of localized reactions following application. The {{development of a new}} antifungal agent is timely due to mounting resistance among existing treatments. Because luliconazole requires a short duration of treatment, it may assist in reducing disease recurrence as a result of patient nonadherence.
