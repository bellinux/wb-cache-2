Actually most systems (such as WiMAX, WiFi, DVBT) are based on OFDM modulations but differ from their <b>intercarrier</b> <b>spacing</b> used in OFDM modulation. Therefore carrying out accurate <b>intercarrier</b> <b>spacing</b> estimator is a crucial step in cognitive radio. In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm to estimate the <b>intercarrier</b> <b>spacing</b> based on maximum-likelihood principle. Its performance is analysed through numerical simulations and compared to standard existing approaches. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing efficient detection techniques for multicarrier transmission systems operating {{in the presence of}} narrowband interference (NBI). In this case, conventional linear receivers, such as the zero-forcing (ZF) or the minimum-mean square error (MMSE) ones, usually perform poorly since they are not capable of suppressing satisfactorily the NBI. To synthesize interference-resistant detection algorithms, we resort to widely linear (WL) filtering, which allows one to exploit the noncircularity property of the desired signal constellation by jointly processing the received signal and its complex-conjugate version. In particular, we synthesize new WL-ZF receivers for multicarrier systems, which mitigate, in the minimum output-energy (MOE) sense, the NBI contribution at the receiver output, without requiring knowledge of the NBI statistics. By exploiting the noncircularity property, we also propose a new subspace-based blind channel identification algorithm and derive the channel identifiability condition. Blind identification can be performed satisfactorily also in the presence of NBI, requiring only an approximate rank determination of the NBI autocorrelation matrix. The performance analysis shows that the proposed MOE WL-ZF receiver, even when implemented blindly, assures a substantial improvement over the conventional linear ZF and MMSE ones, particularly when the NBI bandwidth is very small in comparison with the <b>intercarrier</b> <b>spacing</b> and the NBI is not exactly located on a subcarrier...|$|E
30|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{based on}} MIMO systems has gained popularity {{due to the}} potential capacity increases it can provide [1]. OFDM has been a popular technique for transmission of signals over wireless channels primarily because the receiver design is relatively simple, as {{it does not require}} a complex equalizer. MIMO-OFDM-based transmission systems can thus provide very high data rates with a relatively simple receiver design and are adopted in many recent wireless communication standards. Examples include (a) IEEE- 802.11 -n/ac [2, 3], (b) IEEE 802.16 e/m (WiMAX) [4], and (c) LTE [5]. IEEE- 802.11 -n [2] specifies a maximum of 600 Mb/s using four independent spatial streams transmitted over a 40 -MHz channel. IEEE- 802.11 -ac [3] specifies a data rate of up to 3.5 Gb/s using eight independent spatial streams in an 80 -MHz channel. WiMAX [4] specifies a limit of approximately 100 Mb/s using four spatial streams in a 5 -MHz channel. LTE suggests a peak data rate of 326.4 Mb/s using a 20 -MHz downlink with four transmit antennas [5]. Under static multipath channel conditions, the received signal in the MIMO receiver is corrupted only by coantenna interference (CAI). However, high transceiver mobility at high carrier frequency causes severe time-varying frequency-selective multipath fading at the receiver. This breaks the orthogonality of subcarriers and hence causes intercarrier interference (ICI) in the received signal. As an example, at a transmission frequency of 5 GHz and at vehicular speeds of 240 – 480 km/h, which are common in high-speed trains, the expected maximum receiver Doppler spread in WiMAX and LTE systems is of the order of 12 to 23 % of the <b>intercarrier</b> <b>spacing.</b> Furthermore, it is believed that future wireless communications will adopt higher carrier frequencies and higher mobility requirements, further increasing the maximum relative Doppler frequency and exacerbating the ICI. In such scenarios, as discussed in this article, the efficient detector design for MIMO-OFDM systems is a challenging practical problem.|$|E
