25|$|Corruption {{has been}} a {{pervasive}} problem in India.

A follow-up study in 2008 found this rate to be 40 percent. In 2011, TI ranked India at 95th place amongst 183 countries in perceived levels of public sector corruption. In 2014, India saw a reduction in corruption and improved the ranking to 85th place.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{characters}} are killed in action {{during the course of}} the movie. Nevertheless, the general atmosphere of the machine gun company is relaxed and business-like throughout the story. The soldiers' continued disrespect for formalities and discipline is a source of frustration for some of the officers. After all, they are all there just to get the <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> Official propaganda, both their own and that of the enemy, is a source of amusement or an outright offense to them.

By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery, a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army, and of sheer incompetence. Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the <b>job</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Wildcats cruised {{to their}} 11th Grand Final {{appearance}} with a 2–0 Semi Final series {{win over the}} Wollongong Hawks. After knocking out the Hawks in straight sets, the Wildcats faced historical rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the 2014 Grand Final. After winning Game 1 in Perth {{on the back of}} a 30-point effort from James Ennis, the team headed to Adelaide looking to get the <b>job</b> <b>done</b> in two. But it wasn't to be, as the 36ers forced a deciding third game with an 89–84 win in Game 2. Returning to Perth Arena less than 48 hours later for Game 3, the Wildcats crushed the 36ers with a 93–59 win in front of 13,498 fans, as their 2–1 series victory saw them claim their sixth NBL Championship. Jermaine Beal was subsequently named the series MVP after Ennis struggled to make an impact in Games 2 and 3. Beal averaged 17.6 points per game during the Grand Final series, hitting 11 three-pointers at an efficient 48%.|$|E
25|$|Belgium {{was short}} {{of people with}} {{tropical}} experience but Leopold was adept at recruiting other European nationalities for his schemes. Central Africa was a wild frontier attracting mercenaries for hire. At the recommendation of British-American explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who had already acted for Leopold in the Congo, the 27 years old Swahili speaking Captain William Stairs was appointed to lead the expedition, {{on the basis of}} his experience on the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition on which he had become Stanley's second in command. He had a reputation of someone who would obey orders and get the <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> That previous expedition had been marked by violence and brutality against any Africans who stood in its way as well as against its own African members. Canadian born at a time when it was part of the British Empire, Stairs had been educated partly in Britain and had joined a British regiment. He was considered to be and considered himself English or British.|$|E

25|$|Troy Percival was {{activated}} {{from the}} disabled list on September 2. In Toronto for his second outing since his return, he allowed a walk-off grand slam with two outs when the Rays were ahead by a single run and in position {{to win the game}} in extra innings. Against Boston during another extra inning game, Percival came in to close with a three-run lead and allowed the first three batters to reach base. He was removed from the game in favor of Jason Hammel, who had never recorded a save at the MLB level, and was the only remaining reliever available for the Rays in the game due to its length. Hammel converted the save opportunity, but many questioned if Percival should remain as the team's closer. The reason for Percival's removal from the game against Boston was a stiff back, and not for the game's situation, or for any sort of leg injury that had plagued him throughout the year. Percival stated that because of warming up multiple times throughout the game, only to not come in until the Rays took a lead, was what pained his back. Percival acknowledged that he knew he didn't feel well, and that he should have called for his own removal, but decided that with the lead the Rays had, {{he would be able to}} get the <b>job</b> <b>done.</b> As a result of the game, the Rays decided to not use Percival too often on consecutive nights, and using him in a tie game if the situation of the game changes while he is warming up. He would still be listed as the team's closer.|$|E

[...] However, in the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan thought a lot of Tomorrow Never Dies had a [...] "stodgy, been-there feeling", with little change from previous films, and Charles Taylor wrote for Salon.com that the film was [...] "a flat, impersonal affair".|$|E

A 2005 study by Transparency International (TI) India {{found that more}} than half of those {{surveyed}} had firsthand experience of paying a bribe or peddling influence to get a <b>job</b> <b>done</b> in a public office. The chief economic consequences of corruption are the loss to the exchequer, an unhealthy climate for investment and an increase in the cost of government-subsidised services. The TI India study estimates the monetary value of petty corruption in 11 basic services provided by the government, like education, healthcare, judiciary, police, etc., to be around [...] India still ranks in the bottom quartile of developing nations in terms of the ease of doing business, and compared with China, the average time taken to secure the clearances for a startup or to invoke bankruptcy is much greater.|$|E
