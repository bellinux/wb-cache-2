5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|Alice (Milla Jovovich) {{wakes up}} disoriented in a mansion {{laying in the}} showers floor. She wanders through the halls, where she defeats several obstacles, {{including}} a deadly laser beam obstacle and a giant blade that falls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be a clone. The camera zooms out to show a shack camouflaging the facility's above-ground entrance - {{with the rest of}} the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E

5|$|Kirchherr {{was brought}} up by her widowed mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, in Eimsbütteler Strasse, in a wealthy part of the Hamburg suburb of Altona. Sutcliffe met Kirchherr in the Kaiserkeller club, where she went to watch the Beatles perform. After a photo session with the group, Kirchherr invited them to her mother's house for tea and showed them her bedroom; {{decorated}} in black, including the furniture, with silver foil {{on the walls and}} a large tree branch hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Sutcliffe began dating Kirchherr shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, {{features}} a life-size {{model of a}} mother blue whale with her calf suspended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of its main hall. The Beaty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia, Canada, houses a display of a blue whale skeleton (skull is cast replica) directly on the main campus boulevard. A real skeleton of a blue whale at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa was also unveiled in May 2010. The Royal Ontario Museum obtained a blue whale, which died in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2014, and began an exhibition in 2016 to display its skeleton in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} of the vault is another significant feature of English cathedrals. The vaults range from the simple quadripartite vault in the French manner at Chichester through increasingly elaborate forms including the multi-ribbed (“tierceron”) vault at Exeter, the similar vault with inter-connecting (“lierne”) ribs at Norwich, the still more elaborate variation at Winchester, the array of unique lierne vaults at Bristol, the net-like stellar vaulting of the choirs at Gloucester and York, the fan vaulting of the retro-choir at Peterborough, and the pendant vaulting of the choir at Oxford, where elaborate long stone bosses are suspended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> like lanterns. Many of the more elaborate forms are unique to England, with stellar vaulting also occurring in Spain and Germany.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} crown molding around the room on the walls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{to the top of the}} blackboards.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode parodies the {{title of the}} 1988 cult film, Hell Comes to Frogtown. In the opening scene of the episode, Peter, Joe, Quagmire and Cleveland are shown playing ping pong at the local bar. Once Joe accidentally hits their final ping pong ball out a window, Peter {{responds}} by forcing the puppet character Mr. Moose, from the children's television series Captain Kangaroo, to tell a knock-knock joke. This causes hundreds of ping pong balls to cascade <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> above them. Going on to exclaim the amount of fun he is having, Peter recounts his performance in a Broadway musical version of the 1984 film Red Dawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{two people}} fencing {{take off their}} masks, which reveal them to be Madonna and her doppelgänger {{surprised}} to see each other; they resume their violent fighting. The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall. Different artifacts from the Bond films {{are present in the}} room and the two Madonna's fight through them. Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an electric chair.|$|E

50|$|Another solo in 2004 took Veeraraghvan's {{scrutiny}} of the strangeness of perception further. This untitled exhibition questioned the limits of sight playing optical tricks on the viewers. The show was made to resemble a fair or playground. White cotton curtains created a labyrinth, while wires studded with coloured light bulbs dangled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> <b>The</b> last installation was called How Many Shadows Have You?, and comprised tremulous, multi-hued shadows of viewers on gallery walls. A series of seven photographic prints made from unexposed negatives also reflected passersby in their colourful depths.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in New York, Mary finds that Jacqueline sold her cosmetics business eight months earlier. Jacqueline's {{close friend and}} former employee, Frances Fallon (Isabel Jewell), claims to have seen Jacqueline the week before, and suggests that Mary visit Dante's, an Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. Mary locates the restaurant, and discovers that Jacqueline has rented a room above the store, without having moved in. Mary convinces the owners to let her see the room, which she finds empty aside from a wooden chair and above it a noose hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> This makes Mary more anxious and determined to find her sister.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling),</b> was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
5|$|Padayappa {{launched}} {{production at}} the Ragavendra Kalyana Mandapam on 1 October 1998. The film's climax scene {{was one of the}} first to be shot, and was filmed in one take using two cameras. Around 2,000 extras were used for the scene. The car that was used in the scene which introduced Neelambari in the film belonged to Ravikumar. Ravikumar used the newly purchased car in the film at Rajinikanth's insistence. Filming also took place in Mysore. The Vadapalani-based shop, D. V. Nehru wigs, supplied the wigs that were sported by Ganesan in the film. In an August 2016 interview with Sudhir Srinivasan of The Hindu, Ravikumar mentioned that a scene where Padayappa uses his dupatta to pull down a swing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> on which he sits after not being given a chair to sit by Neelambari, was inspired by a sequence in the Indian epic Ramayana. The sequence features the Hindu god Hanuman making a seat using his tail after Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, does not provide the former a chair to sit.|$|E

50|$|In 1936-1937, {{the school}} {{district}} took advantage of federal Public Works Administration funds to add two classrooms, hallways, and restrooms. Heat for the rooms was provided by a boiler system, which replaced the wood-burning stoves used in the original classrooms. The intact boiler room {{is located in a}} small subfloor area underneath the boys’ restroom. The rooms were eventually equipped with oil heaters, and eventually gas heaters hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E
5|$|The Nobu Restaurant {{features}} an Asian motif and is spaciously arranged with only round tables, granting larger aisles than square tables would.

There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with the menu and dishes from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi the menu has variations on the dishes which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine to fall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> into a group of wrestlers huddled in the center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out of the hole to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
50|$|Nature {{became a}} method for {{decorative}} patterns in architectural details and urban structure. Everything was inspired by nature and became included with nature. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of <b>the</b> mosques and {{the walls of the}} palaces, kiosks and summer palaces (pavilions), which were all embellished with tiles, frescoes and hand-carved ornaments, to the kaftans, the yashmaks and so much more.

50|$|Plasterers will {{typically}} divide a room, (especially a {{large or}} high-ceilinged wall) into top and bottom.

5|$|The {{main event}} {{began with a}} stare down. Luger gained the early {{advantage}} and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna's groin. Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked {{him out of the}} ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by the all-American, hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the corner for a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved. Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash, and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette. Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> to celebrate the victory.|$|E
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) {{are built}} into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked {{on the ground}} near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E
5|$|The niche image {{carved on}} the {{southwest}} wall, near the Linga shrine (see 6 on plan) is the wedding of Shiva and Parvati. This legend is called the Kalyanasundara in Hindu texts. Parvati is seen standing to Shiva's right, the customary place for a Hindu bride at the wedding. The carvings are substantially damaged, but the ruined remains of the sculpture has been significant to scholarly studies of Hindu literature. In many surviving versions of the Puranas, the wedding takes place in King Parvata's palace. However, in this Elephanta Cave panel, the narrative shows some earlier version. Here King Parvata standing behind Parvati gives away the bride to Shiva while Brahma is the priest in the grotto relief. Gods, goddesses and celestial apsaras are cheering witness to the wedding. Vishnu is witness to the marriage, standing tall behind the sitting Brahma {{on the right side}} of the panel. Just above the main images rishi (sages) and a few characters hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> are seen blessing the wedding.|$|E
