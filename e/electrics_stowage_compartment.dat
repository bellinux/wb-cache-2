5000|$|ASLAV-C (Command) - A vehicle {{equipped}} with enhanced radio installation and radio masts, mapboard, <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments,</b> appropriate seating and annex. Armed {{with a single}} [...]50 calibre BMG M2 machine gun, although vehicles on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have been fitted with the Kongsberg Protector RWS.|$|R
25|$|To improve {{practicality}} further, self-levelling {{rear suspension}} and an integral load restraint system {{were added to}} the options list for the Tourer. Up to 100kg can be loaded onto the roof, which is more than rival executive cars of the time, and putting loads into the boot is made easier by the 544mm sill height. Four hinged chrome lashing eyes are fitted to the floor, and oddment <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments</b> and two recessed hooks are located in the side walls.|$|R
50|$|Landing craft are {{designed}} to carry troops, vehicles, or cargo from ship to shore under combat conditions, to unload, {{to withdraw from the}} beach, and to return to the ship. They are rugged, with powerful engines, and usually armed. There are many types in today's navies including hovercraft. They will typically have a power-operated bow ramp, a cargo well and after structures that house engine rooms, pilot houses, and <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments.</b> These boats are sometimes carried by larger ships.|$|R
50|$|The latest {{generation}} RFD Beaufort SEIE MK11 enables free ascent from a stricken submarine and provides extensive {{protection for the}} submariner on reaching the surface until rescued. A typical assembly comprises a submarine escape and immersion suit, an inner thermal liner, and a gas-inflated single-seat life raft, all contained in a protective <b>stowage</b> <b>compartment.</b> The intention of the suit {{is to keep the}} escapee dry and protected from cold shock during ascent, and to provide buoyancy, freeboard, and thermal insulation at the surface.|$|R

40|$|Airframe noise {{produced}} by aircraft components and their interactions on {{a model of}} a wide body transport was investigated in an open jet anechoic flow facility. The two-meter span model had leading edge and multigapped trailing edge flaps, undercarriage, and associated <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments.</b> Each of these components were extended and retracted so their individual and interactive contributions to the measured airframe noise could be determined. An analysis of variance was performed which revealed a statistical significance of the component interactions. Various airframe noise reduction techniques were tried to reduce airframe noise. The effects of these techniques on the model's lift and drag were also measured...|$|R
50|$|The MD-80 Advanced was to {{incorporate}} the advanced flight deck of the MD-88, including a choice of reference systems, with an inertial reference system as standard fitting and optional attitude-heading equipment. It was to be equipped with an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), an optional second flight management system (FMS), and light-emitting diode (LED) dot-matrix electronic engine and system displays. A Honeywell wind-shear computer and provision for an optional traffic-alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) were also to be included. A new interior would have a 12% increase in overhead baggage space and <b>stowage</b> <b>compartment</b> lights that come on when the doors open, {{as well as new}} video system featuring drop-down LCD monitors above.|$|R
500|$|By 20:15, the German fleet {{had faced}} the Grand Fleet {{for a second}} time and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed. Kaiser was now the fifth ship {{from the rear of the}} German line, ahead of only the four König-class battleships. Kaiser was hit twice in quick {{succession}} by heavy-caliber shells, at 20:23 and three minutes later. The Common Pointed, Capped, shells came from the [...] guns of [...] One shell penetrated the upper deck and landed in a hammock <b>stowage</b> <b>compartment</b> below the No. 7 casemate; the shell failed to explode and instead broke up on impact, starting a small fire that was quickly put out. The other shell probably exploded outside the ship.|$|R
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} the aircraft in June 2016 after an evaluation flight, AOPA reviewer Dave Hirschman concluded, [...] "the 153-mph true airspeed top speed {{in level flight}} is impressive, but what’s far more meaningful to backcountry pilots is the tremendous range and operational flexibility they’ll have at more economical cruise settings. At a true airspeed of 120 mph, for example, an XCub pilot can cut fuel burn to 6 gph or less and have about eight hours endurance from a full tank (50 gallons) of avgas. At a normal Super Cub cruise of 100 mph, the XCub can cover 1,000 statute miles...The XCub is exhilarating to fly and aesthetically appealing inside and out. The clever layout of the panel, passenger seating, and <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments</b> show it was built by people who know their customers and the features they value." ...|$|R
50|$|For role flexibility, {{individual}} aircraft {{can be easily}} converted between various mission types, such as transport, paradrop, aerial photography, surveillance, air medical services and search and rescue duties. A maximum of ten passengers, or a 2,200 lb payload, may be carried within the aircraft's main cabin area within the rear section of the fuselage; the standard passenger seats are designed to allow for rapid removal and may be stowed within an optional separate externally-accessed seat <b>stowage</b> <b>compartment</b> behind the main cabin. The main cabin area is furnished with soundproofing measures, ventilation, and heating as standard. A maximum of three fuel tanks can also be carried in the main cabin, accordingly reducing payload capacity, to increase the aircraft's flight endurance. In addition to the large sliding doors at {{either side of the}} main cabin, separate hinged doors are present {{on either side of the}} cockpit; an optional pilot-controlled trapdoor, to accommodate supply drops or surveillance payloads, may also be installed in the center of the cabin floor without any design changes required. Additional equipment include a firefighting system, aerial application system, underwing tanks, sand filters, propeller de-icing system, mudguard, tailwheel debris guard, oxygen system, and additional power distribution system.|$|R
40|$|Prefabricated timber raft is {{water-based}} {{recreational vehicle}} for drifting on rivers without rapids. It is a floating deck measuring 4. 5 m (length) X 3. 2 m (width) with a carrying capacity of 800 to 900 kg; appropriate for eight adults. It {{is made up}} of three major components: (1) float made from eight polyethylene drums, (2) frame made from timber boards (50 X 50 mm), and (3) deck made from three pieces of 4 mm thick waterproof plywoods. The drums and timber boards can be made from used materials whereas new plywoods are required for safety and durability. Minor components such as oars, masts, canvas and a <b>stowage</b> <b>compartment</b> are installed to facilitate the rafting crew in their expedition. The fundamental scheme of this raft is that it can be assembled or dismantled by eight adults within 25 minutes, costing RM 650 - 800 and can be utilized for more than five times. It is a cheap recreational and eco-friendly mode to spend leisure activities without causing pollution to the river. The minimum drift duration is four days with average drifting speed of 4. 2 km/h covering a distance of 30 to 35 km per day...|$|R
40|$|The FAA {{restraint}} system experiments consisted of 24 standard and modified seats, 2 standard galleys and 2 standard overhead compartments. Under the controlled impact demonstration (CID) program, the experimental {{objective was to}} demonstrate the effectiveness of individual {{restraint system}} designs when exposed to a survivable air-to-ground impact condition. What researchers were looking for was the performance exhibited by standard and modified designs, performance differences resulting from their installed cabin location, and interrelating performance demonstrated by test article and attaching floor and/or fuselage structure. The other restraint system experiment consisted of 2 standard overhead <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments</b> and 2 galley modules. Again, researchers were concerned with the retention of stowed equipment and carry-on articles. The overhead compartments were loaded with test weights up to their maximum capacity, {{and each of the}} galleys was filled with test articles: aft with normal galley equipment, forward with hazardous material test packages. A breakdown of instrumentation and distribution is given beginning with 11 instrumented type anthropomorphic dummies and 185 sensors which provided for acceleration and load measurements at the various experiment and associated structure locations. The onboard cameras provided additional coverage of these experiments, including the areas of cabin which were not instrumented. Test results showing the window-side leg forces versus pulse duration are given...|$|R
5000|$|Station wagons were {{available}} in both model lines, all featuring liftgates with fixed rear windows. These models had a cargo volume of [...] and load capacity of 1100 lb, which was 100 lb less than the intermediate and standard size Chrysler wagons. The liftgate opening was nearly 4 ft wide and 27.6 in high. With the rear seat folded down, the cargo area was 74 in long at the belt line and 43.2 in wide between the wheel houses. Premium station wagons in either the Aspen SE or Volaré Premier series featured simulated woodgrain on its exterior side panels. On Aspen SEs, the woodgrain was framed in simulated blond (painted metal) wood-look trim. On the Premiers, the side panels were trimmed in stainless steel frames accented in matte black. Aside from the brand badging and grilles unique on each brand, this station wagon trim element {{remains one of the}} few visual clues that differentiated the Aspen from the Volaré. Side covers of the cargo area were made of one-piece injection molded polypropylene. Covered, lockable <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments</b> of 1.5 ft3 L capacity were provided in these panels; these compartments were standard on the Aspen SEs and optional on the low-line wagons.|$|R
50|$|Before his watch, Austen {{is asked}} by Frenchy to draw his {{portrait}} {{to send to}} his daughter. Frenchy decides to leave the Navy when his enlistment is over and insists on paying for the portrait with gambling winnings, which Austen accepts on the condition it be sent to Frenchys family. The injured Edge sneaks out of his quarters, steals a pistol from a sailor on security duty, and plans to rape and kill both Fowler and Gray in the brig. On watch, the executive officer breaks down completely and insists that every crew member aboard the ship be polled {{to see if they}} hate him. The captain, listening from his sea cabin, relieves the executive officer, and orders Austen to find Edge, who has been seen prowling the ship. Edge intimidates the brig guard into opening the cell but he is thwarted when the prisoner with Fowler is not Gray but Slobodjian, who knows what Edge plans to do. He cuts Edge with a hidden knife to prevent him from using the gun. Edge hides his wound from the guard and leaves, realizing he would be unable to explain his behavior, taking refuge in a <b>stowage</b> <b>compartment.</b> Austen finds him however, and by refusing to fight Edge when challenged, breaks him down psychologically, recovering the pistol and leaving Edge to his own demons.|$|R
50|$|The Range Rover Long-Wheelbase Autobiography Black is {{a limited}} version of the 2014 Range Rover Long-Wheelbase for the US market, with the first 25 units in Valloire White {{pearlescent}} body colour. Changes include front grille and side vents and badging in black enamel and chrome, signature rear lamps, a chrome accent finish to the tailgate and auxiliary vents to the front, new exclusive 7-spoke 21-inch wheels with a high gloss polished finish, individualized front and rear seating package (bespoke seat cover design, front and rear leather seats with seat memory and climate control and massage function, adjustable 18-way front seat including upper seat articulation, two individual fully adjustable rear seats with lumbar massage and powered recline, new rear center console (electrically deployable tables covered in black leather with integrated USB charging sockets and cup holders, a chiller compartment, a ski hatch), 10.2-inch rear seat entertainment screens with navigation displays, a powered recliner calf rest at rear right seat), 10-colour configurable LED mood lighting (door handles and <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments,</b> {{along the lines of}} the veneered surfaces on the center console), leather-wrapped rear cargo trim, A-, B- and C-pillar trim, a perforated leather finish on the door insert, leather-wrapped seat backs, ski hatch, cargo trim and upper D-pillar; tread plates with an illuminated 'Autobiography Black' script, a brushed stainless steel tailgate trim, a choice of 3 interior colour schemes (Ebony/Lunar, Espresso/Tan, Dark Cherry/Ivory (with a unique dual-tone seat)).|$|R
40|$|Manned {{spacecraft}} {{will never}} be free of acceleration perturbations due to necessary motions of crewmembers. However, in most cases, the perturbations can be minimized or even isolated from sensitive experiments when required. The principal disturbances and methods of isolation are described. As the crew moves about the spacecraft, no external forces are applied and the average acceleration remains near zero. External force will be exerted when jets are fired for spacecraft attitude control or translation, and these must {{be transferred to the}} microgravity experiments. Transitory acceleration and vibration are produced by crew and equipment. The most significant on Orbiter have been wall push-offs used for body translation within the spacecraft, the exercise conducted on a treadmill within the middeck area, closing doors of <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments</b> and the vibration of some machinery, such as a sample centrifuge. For short periods of perhaps a few minutes, crew and equipment motion can be largely inhibited, but not for much longer intervals. It may be necessary to mount especially sensitive experiments on an isolation table, which can greatly reduce the acceleration transferred to the experiment. Either weak mechanical springs or, even better, a computer-controlled electromagnetic suspension can be used to effectively insulate the table from vibration at frequencies above about 0. 01 Hz. Another option is to free-float an experiment table within the spacecraft. All of the above-mentioned perturbations can be eliminated for some minutes if the entire experiment package is allowed to free-float within the spacecraft until a wall contact is made. Package acceleration levels should be maintainable below 10 (exp - 8) g sub o in this way...|$|R
40|$|The BIOLAB is a {{life science}} {{research}} facility of the European Space Agency (ESA), accommodated in the European COLUMBUS Module of the International Space Station. It is controlled and monitored by the Microgravity User Support Center as Facility Responsible Center at DLR, Cologne, Germany and supported by BIOTESC, Switzerland, on behalf of ESA. BIOLAB features several compartments which are necessary for life science experiments with small animals and plants, tissues, cells and bacteria. Experiment containers with various experimental set-ups can be manufactured according to the experiment needs. If required, the containers can be assembled within the BIOLAB BioGloveBox and/or stored in the two coolers/freezers (ranging from + 10 °C to - 20 °C). The experiments can be run in an incubator (+ 18 °C to + 40 °C) on two centrifuges (0. 001 g up to 2 g) to study the influence of microgravity, hypergravity and/or thresholds on the chosen test system. A video camera system mounted on the rotor platforms enables a regular control of the samples via telemetry from/to ground. Furthermore, a handling mechanism enables the transfer or liquids for, e. g. adding reagents, diluting samples or transferring a sample to the BIOLAB microscope (dark & bright field, phase contrast, up to 40 x magnifications) for in-flight analysis. This handling mechanism can interact by usage different syringes for transferring liquids between <b>stowage</b> <b>compartments</b> and experiment containers. Recently, two rather complex experiments (TRIPLELUX-A and -B) have been successfully performed in BIOLAB, elucidating the immunological effects of space flight conditions on mammalian and mollusk immune cells. The poster presentation will give an overview on BIOLAB features as well as recent and future operation activities...|$|R
50|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5 cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated crew <b>compartment,</b> <b>stowage</b> for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|R
