5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a <b>fire</b> <b>test</b> on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E
25|$|The crew of STS-130 began {{preparing}} {{the space shuttle}} Endeavour for landing. During the day commander George Zamka and pilot Terry Virts, with help from mission specialist and flight engineer Stephen Robinson checked out the Flight Control System (FCS) and did a hot <b>fire</b> <b>test</b> of the Reaction Control System (RCS). Commander Zamka also did communications checks with mission control through the tracking stations at Merit Island, White Sands Space Harbor and Edwards Air Force Base. These checks are routine for the day before landing and were all successful. While all the system checkouts were going on, {{the rest of the}} crew were stowing items no longer needed during the flight. During the early part of the day Stephen Robinson and Terry Virts also stowed and deactivated the space shuttle robotic arm. The entire crew also took time out of their day to conduct an in-flight interview with CNN, CNN Español and Univision.|$|E
500|$|Like the Navy, the Air Force has {{operated}} QF-4 target drones, serving with the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. It {{was expected that}} the F-4 would remain in the target role with the 82d ATRS until at least 2015, when they would be replaced by early versions of the F-16 Fighting Falcon converted to a QF-16 configuration. Several QF-4s also retain capability as manned aircraft and are maintained in historical color schemes, being displayed as part of Air Combat Command's Heritage Flight at air shows, base open houses, and other events while serving as non-expendable target aircraft during the week. On 19 November 2013, BAE Systems delivered the last QF-4 aerial target to the Air Force. The example had been in storage for over 20 years before being converted. Over 16 years, BAE had converted 314 F-4 and RF-4 Phantom IIs into QF-4s and QRF-4s, with each aircraft taking six months to adapt. As of December 2013, QF-4 and QRF-4 aircraft had flown over 16,000 manned and 600 unmanned training sorties, with 250 unmanned aircraft being shot down in firing exercises. The remaining QF-4s and QRF-4s held their training role until the first of 126 QF-16s were delivered by Boeing. The final flight of an Air Force QF-4 from Tyndall AFB took place on 27 May 2015 to Holloman AFB. After Tyndall AFB ceased operations, the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group at Holloman became the fleet of 22 QF-4s' last remaining operator. [...] The base continued using them to fly manned test and unmanned live <b>fire</b> <b>test</b> support and Foreign Military Sales testing, with the final unmanned flight taking place in August 2016. The type was officially retired from US military service with a four ship flight at Holloman during an event on December 21, 2016. In January 2017, the remaining airframes were to be demilitarized.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2016, a Falcon 9 {{exploded}} {{during a}} propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launch static <b>fire</b> <b>test.</b> The payload, the Spacecom Amos-6 communications satellite valued at $200 million, was destroyed. Musk described the event as the [...] "most difficult and complex failure" [...] ever in SpaceX's history; SpaceX reviewed nearly 3,000 channels of telemetry and video data covering {{a period of}} 35–55 milliseconds for the postmortem. Musk reported the explosion {{was caused by the}} liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and it ignited with carbon composite helium vessels. The rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong, and SpaceX finally returned to flight in January 2017.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crash was}} the first fire {{incident}} on the 747 Combi and one of few fires on widebody aircraft. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, characterised the Flight 295 fire as significant for this reason. [...] Barry Strauch of the NTSB visited Boeing's headquarters to inquire about the Combi's design. Boeing's <b>fire</b> <b>test</b> in the Combi models did not accurately match {{the conditions of the}} Helderberg's cargo hold; in accordance with federal US rules, the Boeing test involved setting a bale of tobacco leaves ablaze. The fire stayed within the cargo hold. The air in the passenger cabin was designed to have a marginally higher pressure than cargo area hold, so if a crew member {{opened the door to the}} cargo hold, the air from the passenger cabin would flow into the cargo hold, stopping any smoke or gases from exiting through the door.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

A launching dynamic model is established, and simulation analysis is done by using ADAMS software and external trajectory procedure. The self-propelled gun model is actuated in the virtual scene by the dynamic analysis data.
