40|$|Would urban {{air quality}} and climate improve if we {{replaced}} the fossil fuels by molecular hydrogen (H 2) as an energy carrier? A quantitative {{answer to this}} question requires a thorough understanding of the current role of H 2 in the Earth’s atmosphere. On its own, H 2 does not impact climate, as for example carbon dioxide or methane. However, increasing levels of H 2 in the stratosphere can lead to increased ozone loss due to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds. Additionally, the atmospheric lifetime of methane could increase because both H 2 and methane are removed by photochemical oxidation with the hydroxyl radical. Consequently, the lifetime of the strong greenhouse gas methane could be prolonged. During the last two decades, more and more experimental data have become available to put tighter constraints on the different sources and sinks that contribute to the global H 2 cycle. However, the main removal process, dry deposition due to microbial/enzymatic decomposition of H 2 in the soils, still has a rather large uncertainty between 40 - 99 Tg/yr globally. This is a highly uncertain number compared to the <b>estimated</b> <b>overall</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> 136 - 166 Tg present in the troposphere. The photochemical removal of H 2 from the atmosphere is estimated at 14 - 24 Tg/yr. Together with the estimates for the burden and dry deposition, this implies a tropospheric lifetime of H 2 between 1. 1 - 3. 1 years. The atmospheric H 2 is replenished by emissions from the Earth’s surfaces due to fossil fuel burning (5 - 25 Tg/yr), biomass burning (7 - 21 Tg/yr) and nitrogen fixation processes in the oceans (1 - 11 Tg/yr) and soils (0 - 11 Tg/yr). H 2 is photochemically produced from methane (15 - 21 Tg/yr) and non-methane hydrocarbons (10 - 25 Tg/yr) in the atmosphere. These uncertainties suggest that at present, the global hydrogen cycle is poorly understood. However, this statement would do little justice to the scientific quality of most studies so far. The main purpose of the research in this thesis is to show that the global tropospheric budget of H 2 can be constrained quite well with available measurements. The study starts with the derivation of a full hydrogen isotope chemistry scheme to use the measured deuterium content in atmospheric H 2 as an additional constraint for the global budget. This new chemistry scheme is subsequently evaluated and the most important parameters in the photochemistry are identified. A condensed version of the new chemistry scheme is implemented in the global TM 5 model. The new model results are verified using available measurements of H 2 mixing ratios and isotopic compositions from two global flask sampling networks and the EuroHydros network. Finally, a new tropospheric budget is derived for H 2. The tropospheric burden is estimated at 165 ± 8 Tg and the removal of H 2 by deposition and photochemical oxidation are estimated at 53 ± 4 and 23 ± 2 Tg/yr, respectively. The main (photochemical) source is estimated at 37 ± 4 Tg/yr. From these numbers, a tropospheric lifetime of 2. 2 ± 0. 2 yr for H 2 is derived. These new ranges of uncertainty allow for a much more accurate evaluation of the impact of future increases in H 2 emissions on air quality and climate...|$|E

This paper is {{a review of the}} state-of-the-art trip generation methods for land use transportation impact estimation. First, it provides an overview of the more recent available and peer-reviewed estimation methods.

These themes include: (a) the ability to <b>estimate</b> <b>overall</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> activity; (b) built environment and multimodal estimation; (c) socio-and economic demographics; (d) mixed and/or multiuse methods; and (e) land use (dis) aggregation.

40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates {{performance}} and energy characteristics of software algorithms for long integer arithmetic. We analyze {{and compare the}} number of RISC-like processor instructions (e. g. singleprecision multiplication, addition, load, and store instructions) required for the execution of different algorithms such as Schoolbook multiplication, Karatsuba and Comba multiplication, as well as Montgomery reduction. Our analysis shows {{that a combination of}} Karatsuba-Comba multiplication and Montgomery reduction (the so-called KCM method) allows to achieve better performance than other algorithms for modular multiplication. Furthermore, we present a simple model to compare the energy-efficiency of arithmetic algorithms. This model considers the clock cycles and average current consumption of the base instructions to <b>estimate</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy consumed during the execution of an algorithm. Our experiments, conducted on a StrongARM SA- 1100 processor, indicate that a 1024 -bit KCM multiplication consumes about 22 % less energy than other modular multiplication techniques. ...|$|R

METHODS: The algorithm first <b>estimates</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> glucose oxidized during exercise {{on the basis of the}} patient's physical fitness, exercise intensity, and duration. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> supplemental CHO to be consumed before or during the effort represents a fraction of the burned quantity depending on the patient's usual therapy and insulin sensitivity and on the time of day the exercise is performed. The algorithm was tested in 27 patients by comparing the estimated <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> supplemental CHO with the actual amounts required to complete 1 -h constant-intensity walks.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of the LM 193 dual voltage comparator has been studied at different TID dose rate profiles, including several different constant dose rates and a variable dose rate that simulates {{the behavior of a}} solar flare. A comparison of results following constant dose rate vs. variable dose rates is made to explore how well the constant dose rates used for typical part testing predict the performance during a simulated space-like mission. Testing at a constant dose rate equal to the lowest dose rate seen during the simulated flare provides an extremely conservative <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>overall</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> degradation. A constant dose rate equal to the average dose rate is also more conservative than the variable rate. It appears that, for this part, weighting the dose rates by the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> total dose received at each rate (rather than the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time at each dose rate) results in an average rate that produces an <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> degradation that is a reasonable approximation to that received by the variable rate...|$|R
