40|$|In {{the present}} work we {{investigate}} the physicochemical interactions between silica and nanofibrillar cellulose (CNF) with a multi component system (MCS) obtained from an enzymatic reaction of a laccase enzyme and a short-chain organic molecule, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5 -trihydroxybenzoate (commonly known as lauryl gallate, LG) {{as well as}} sulphonated lignin (SL). Hydrophobic chains of enzyme-modified LG were coupled onto CNF and silica surfaces by direct adsorption of the MCS. Quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM-D), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle (WCA) were used to monitor in situ and characterize the hydrophobization process. Efficient adsorption of the MCS onto CNF and silica surfaces increased their WCA by 88 ° and 78 °, respectively. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurements revealed an effect of the enzyme on LG: reducing particle size from several microns down to 300 nm. The laccase (Lacc) treatment {{in the presence of}} SL reduced even more the LG particle size to 80 nm through a dispersive effect of SLPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the use of}} laccase enzymes to couple short nonpolar chains containing aromatic groups onto flax fibers and nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) with different lignin contents. Trametes villosa, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, and Myceliophthora thermophila were used to facilitate surface coupling and to produce materials with different levels of hydrophobicity. Heat treatment of fiber webs after lacccase-mediated coupling markedly increased the resistance to water absorption. The highest hydrophobization levels of flax fibers was achieved by coupling <b>dodecyl</b> <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5 -trihydroxybenzoate (HB-C 12), which yielded water contact angles (WCAs) of 80 − 96 degrees and water absorption times (drop tests) of ca. 73 min. The results from apparent aromatic content and FTIR analyses confirmed the laccase-mediated coupling of HB-C 12 onto the cellulose fibers. Ultrathin films of NFC were also used as substrates for enzyme-mediated hydrophobization with HBC 12. In these cases, WCAs {{in the range of}} 87 − 104 degrees were achieved, depending on the conditions. Quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM) was used to study the dynamics and the extent of the coupling process onto cellulose. The results help to better understand the mechanisms involved in laccase-mediated hydrophobization and provide a proof of a biotechnological platform for the development of value-added fiber productsPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method has}} been developed for the surface hydrophobisation of cellulose-based materials by coating it with a functionalised solution (FS), in which sonicated lauryl gallate (LG, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5,-trihydroxybenzoate), sulfonated kraft lignin, and the enzyme laccase play a pivotal role. The rapid treatment with FS increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose sheets considerably. The FS retention on the paper surface was analysed {{as a function of}} refining and application of additives. The properties of the functionalised sheets were assessed by the water-drop test (WDT), and the surface free energy (SFE) was determined via contact angle (CA) measurements in a goniophotometer. WDT resulted in long absorption times of up to 4000 s and CA values were around 130 °. Functionalised solution modification of eucalyptus paper sheets decreased SFE essentially from 55 mJ m- 2 to 10 mJ m- 2. ATR-FTIR suggested that FS was grafted onto the cellulosic sheets. The stability of FS and the control solutions were characterised by Z potential and light scattering measurements. The functionalised solution method is a one-step roll-to-roll process, which is easy to perform also in industrial application without additional investments. It has a potential to substitute the traditional hydrophobing processes. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophobic {{particles}} {{based on}} <b>dodecyl</b> <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5 -trihydroxybenzoate (LG) were coupled {{onto the surface}} of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and silica by treatment with a multicomponent colloidal system (MCS) derived from the laccase-mediated reaction of LG {{in the presence of a}} sulfonated lignin (SL). Surface modification upon treatment with MCS was monitored insitu and in real time by quartz crystal microgravimetry. The colloidal stability of MCS and its components in water was followed by measuring space- and time-resolved light transmission and back scattering. The sulfonated lignin increased dispersion stability and reduced the characteristic MCS particle size [from approximate to 4 to approximate to 80 nm, according to AFM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) ]. It also facilitated the surface enzymatic reaction that led to adsorption and coupling of MCS onto CNFs and silica surfaces. The combined effect of reduced surface energy and surface roughness by MCS treatment produced an increase in water contact angle on CNFs and silica of about 90 and 80 degrees, respectively. Surface pretreatment with chitosan further increased the extent of MCS adsorption on the surfaces. This method represents a sustainable alternative to traditional approaches for cellulose hydrophobization and a step forward in implementing green routes for surface modification.

40|$|The enthalpies of {{reactions}} of (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(C 2 H 4) (1) {{with a series}} of HEAr compounds (E = O, S, Se; Ar = aryl), leading to the formation of (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (EAr) complexes, have been measured by anaerobic solution calorimetry in C 6 H 6 at 30. 0 degrees C. These reactions are rapid and quantitative under the calorimetry conditions. The measured reaction enthalpies span a range of some 35 kcal/mol. The relative stability scale established is as follows: (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (OC 6 H <b>4</b> -p-CH <b>3)</b> < (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (OC 6 H 5) < (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (OC 6 H 4 -p-Cl) < (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (OC 6 H 4 -p-NO 2) < (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (SC 6 H <b>4</b> -p-CH <b>3)</b> < (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (SC 6 H 5) < (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (SC 6 H 4 -p-Cl) approximate to (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (SeC 6 H 5) < (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(H) (SC 6 H 4 -p-NO 2). A single-crystal X-ray structure of one of these complexes, (PMe <b>3)</b> (<b>4)</b> Ru(SC 6 H 5) H (7), is reported. The measured enthalpies of reaction display a dependence on the acidity of HEAr...|$|R

Upon acclimation to <b>3.</b> <b>4</b> microM pentachlorophenol for 6 months, the methanogenic consortium removed chlorines from the ortho, meta, and para positions of pentachlorophenol and its reductive dechlorination products. Pentachlorophenol was degraded to produce 2, <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5 -tetrachlorophenol, 2, <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 6 -tetrachlorophenol, and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorophenol. Dechlorination of 2, <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5 -tetrachlorophenol produced <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5 -trichlorophenol, which was subsequently degraded to produce <b>3,</b> <b>4</b> -dichlorophenol and <b>3,</b> 5 -dichlorophenol. 2, <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 6 -Tetrachlorophenol was dechlorinated at the ortho and meta positions to produce 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol. 2, 3, 5, 6 -Tetrachlorophenol yielded 2, 3, 5 -trichlorophenol, followed by production of 3, 5 -dichlorophenol. 2, 4, 6 -Trichlorophenol was degraded to form 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol was dechlorinated at two positions to form 2, <b>4</b> -dichlorophenol and <b>3,</b> <b>4</b> -dichlorophenol. Of the three dichlorophenols produced (2, <b>4</b> -dichlorophenol, <b>3,</b> <b>4</b> -dichlorophenol, and <b>3,</b> 5 -dichlorophenol), only 2, 4 -dichlorophenol was degraded significantly within 3 weeks, to produce 4 -chlorophenol...|$|R

Analysis of the hydrolysis of [4, 5 - 32 P]Ins(1, <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5) P 4 showed that for both fractions the 5 -phosphate of Ins(1, <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5) P 4 was removed and inositol 1, <b>3,</b> <b>4</b> -trisphosphate [Ins(1, <b>3,</b> <b>4)</b> P 3] was specifically produced. In the soluble fraction, Ins(1, <b>3,</b> <b>4)</b> P <b>3</b> was further hydrolysed at the 1 -phosphate position to inositol <b>3,</b> <b>4</b> -bisphosphate[Ins(3, 4) P 2]. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the soluble fraction separated the phosphatase activities into three peaks. The first hydrolysed both Ins(1, <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> 5) P 4 and inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate, the second inositol 1 -phosphate and the third Ins(1, <b>3,</b> <b>4)</b> P <b>3</b> and inositol 1, 4 -bisphosphate, [Ins(1, 4) P 2]. Further purification of the third peak on either Sephacryl S- 200 or Blue Sepharose could not dissociate these two activities [i. e. with Ins(1, 4) P 2 and Ins(1, <b>3,</b> <b>4)</b> P <b>3</b> as substrates].
