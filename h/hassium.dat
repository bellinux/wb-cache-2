5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{selection}} of a volatile <b>hassium</b> compound (<b>hassium</b> tetroxide) for gas-phase chemical studies was clear from the beginning, the chemical characterization of <b>hassium</b> was considered a difficult task for a long time. Although <b>hassium</b> isotopes were first synthesized in 1984, it was not until 1996 that a <b>hassium</b> isotope long-lived enough to allow chemical studies to be performed was synthesized. Unfortunately, this <b>hassium</b> isotope, 269Hs, was then synthesized indirectly from the decay of 277Cn; not only are indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies, but also the reaction that produced the isotope 277Cn had a low yield (its cross-section was only 1 pb), and thus did not provide enough <b>hassium</b> atoms for a chemical investigation. The direct synthesis of 269Hs and 270Hs in the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,xn)274−xHs (x = 4 or 5) appeared more promising, as the cross-section for this reaction was somewhat larger, at 7 pb. This yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium. New techniques for irradiation, separation, and detection had to be introduced before <b>hassium</b> could be successfully characterized chemically as a typical member of group 8 in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{members of}} group 8 have relatively high melting points (Fe, 1538°C; Ru, 2334°C; Os, 3033°C). Much like them, <b>hassium</b> {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of <b>hassium</b> has not been precisely calculated. <b>Hassium</b> should crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic <b>hassium</b> is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). <b>Hassium</b> is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough <b>hassium</b> to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Osmium is the densest element of the first 6 periods, and its heavier congener <b>hassium</b> {{is expected to be the}} densest element of the first 7 periods.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hassium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Hs and atomic number 108. It {{is named after}} the German state of Hesse. It is {{a synthetic}} element and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 277Hs, has a half-life of approximately 30seconds. More than 100atoms of <b>hassium</b> have been synthesized to date.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural <b>hassium.</b> This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no results have been released, strongly implying that no natural <b>hassium</b> was found. The possible extent of primordial <b>hassium</b> on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. <b>Hassium</b> {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that <b>hassium</b> behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium in group 8. The chemical properties of <b>hassium</b> are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, <b>hassium</b> is expected to be a silvery metal that reacts readily with oxygen in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hassium</b> is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial <b>hassium</b> would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of <b>hassium</b> might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium and osmium {{have very}} similar {{chemistry}} {{due to the}} lanthanide contraction, but iron shows some differences from them: for example, although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. Consequently, {{in preparation for the}} chemical characterization of <b>hassium,</b> researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron, as <b>hassium</b> was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the actinide contraction. Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(C5H5)2), ferrocene may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{measured}} deposition temperature {{indicated that}} hassium(VIII) oxide is less volatile than osmium tetroxide, OsO4, and places <b>hassium</b> firmly in group 8. However, the enthalpy of adsorption for HsO4 measured, (−46 ± 2) kJ/mol, {{was significantly lower}} than what was predicted, (−36.7 ± 1.5) kJ/mol, indicating that OsO4 was more volatile than HsO4, contradicting earlier calculations, which implied {{that they should have}} very similar volatilities. For comparison, the value for OsO4 is (−39 ± 1) kJ/mol. It is possible that <b>hassium</b> tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals (silicon nitride and silicon dioxide) used for the detector; further research is required, including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of 269Hs and comparisons with RuO4 in addition to OsO4.|$|E
5|$|Various {{calculations}} {{show that}} <b>hassium</b> {{should be the}} heaviest known group 8 element, consistent with the periodic law. Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of osmium, with a few deviations arising from relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hassium</b> {{was officially}} {{discovered}} in 1984 by a German research {{team led by}} Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of lead-208 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 to produce 3atoms of the isotope hassium-265.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since <b>hassium</b> is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical <b>hassium</b> isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of <b>hassium</b> in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chemistry}} {{experiments were}} performed using gas thermochromatography in 2001, using 172Os and 173Os as a reference. During the experiment, 5 <b>hassium</b> atoms were synthesized using the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,5n)269Hs. They were then thermalized and oxidized {{in a mixture}} of helium and oxygen gas to form the tetroxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hassium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 263 to 277 (with the exceptions of 272, 274, and 276), three of which, hassium-265, hassium-267, hassium-269, have known metastable states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some also undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|The proton-rich {{isotopes}} from 258Sg to 261Sg {{were directly}} produced by cold fusion; all heavier isotopes were produced from the repeated alpha decay of the heavier elements <b>hassium,</b> darmstadtium, and flerovium, with the exceptions of the isotopes 263mSg, 264Sg, 265Sg, and 265mSg, which were directly produced by hot fusion through irradiation of actinide targets. The twelve isotopes of seaborgium have half-lives ranging from 92microseconds for 261Sg to 3.1minutes for 269Sg.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a Russian research {{team led by}} Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, using reactions that would generate the isotopes hassium-270 and hassium-264. The data was uncertain and they carried out new experiments on <b>hassium</b> five years later, where these two isotopes as well as hassium-263 were produced; the hassium-264 experiment was conducted again and confirmed in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of <b>hassium</b> atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has <b>hassium</b> in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above <b>hassium</b> (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and <b>hassium</b> (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 a {{committee}} of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named hahnium (Hn) after the German physicist Otto Hahn, after an older suggestion of ottohahnium (Oh) {{in spite of the}} long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name, so that elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner (meitnerium) would be next to each other, honoring their joint discovery of nuclear fission. This was because they felt that Hesse did not merit an element being named after it. After protests from the German discoverers and the American Chemical Society, IUPAC relented and the name <b>hassium</b> (Hs) was adopted internationally in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure, similarly to its lighter congener iridium.

In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a body-centered cubic crystal structure, similar to its lighter congener tungsten. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 35.0g/cm3, which would be the fourth-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only bohrium (37.1g/cm3), meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and <b>hassium</b> (41g/cm3), the three following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from seaborgium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough seaborgium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be {{obtained}} from two sources: the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half-lives for isotones and the large gap in the alpha Q value for isotonic nuclei of <b>hassium</b> and darmstadtium. For spontaneous fission, it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the isotonic nuclei 268Sg, 270Hs and 272Ds. Since the isotopes 268Sg and 272Ds are not currently known, and fission of 270Hs has not been measured, this method cannot yet be used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. Good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs, 271Ds and 273Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus 272Ds.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{questions}} raised by Kulakov were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a <b>hassium</b> isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Hahn's death did {{not stop}} his public acclamation. Proposals were made at {{different}} times, first in 1971 by American chemists, that the newly synthesized element no. 105 should be named hahnium in Hahn's honor; in 1997 the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) named it dubnium, after the Russian research center in Dubna (see element naming controversy). Although element 108 was given the name <b>hassium</b> (after Hesse) by its officially-recognized German discoverers in 1992, a 1994 IUPAC committee recommended that it be named hahnium (Hn), {{in spite of the}} long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name.

500|$|The name <b>hassium</b> was {{proposed}} by Peter Armbruster and his colleagues, the officially recognised German discoverers, in 1992, {{derived from the}} Latin name (Hassia) for the German state of Hesse where the institute is located. Using Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, <b>hassium</b> should be known as eka-osmium. In 1979, during the Transfermium Wars (but before the synthesis of <b>hassium),</b> IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called unniloctium (with the corresponding symbol of Uno), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it [...] "element 108", with the symbol of E108, (108), or even simply 108, or used the proposed name [...] "hassium".|$|E
500|$|<b>Hassium</b> is {{the sixth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals {{and is expected to}} be much like the platinum group metals. [...] Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of osmium, implying that hassium's properties would resemble those of the other group 8 elements, iron, ruthenium, and osmium. Some of these properties were confirmed by gas-phase chemistry experiments. The group 8 elements portray a wide variety of oxidation states, but ruthenium and osmium readily portray their group oxidation state of +8 (the second-highest known oxidation state for any element, which is very rare for other elements) and this state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus <b>hassium</b> is expected to form a stable +8 state. Analogously to its lighter congeners, <b>hassium</b> is expected to also show other stable lower oxidation states, such as +6, +5, +4, +3, and +2. Indeed, hassium(IV) is expected to be more stable than hassium(VIII) in aqueous solution.|$|E
500|$|An {{experiment}} {{determining the}} chemical properties of a transactinide {{would need to}} compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds {{of some of its}} lighter homologues: for example, in the chemical characterization of <b>hassium,</b> <b>hassium</b> tetroxide (HsO4) was compared with the analogous osmium compound, osmium tetroxide (OsO4). In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium, the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium(III) oxide (Rh2O3) and rhodium(III) chloride (RhCl3). However, macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000°C and the chloride would not until 780°C, and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles: these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium, as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500°C.Rh with different carrier gases |author=Haenssler, F.

The nuclear shell model, introduced in the late 1960s, stated that the protons and neutrons formed shells within a nucleus, somewhat analogous to electrons forming electron shells within an atom. The noble gases are unreactive due to their having full electron shells; thus it was theorized that elements with full nuclear shells – having so-called [...] "magic" [...] numbers of protons or neutrons – would be stabilized against radioactive decay. A doubly magic isotope, having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons, would be especially stabilized, and it was calculated that the next doubly magic isotope after lead-208 would be flerovium-298 with 114 protons and 184 neutrons, which would form the centre of a so-called [...] "island of stability". This island of stability, supposedly ranging from copernicium (element 112) to oganesson (118), would come after a long [...] "sea of instability" [...] from elements 101 (mendelevium) to 111 (roentgenium), and the flerovium isotopes in it were speculated in 1966 to have half-lives in excess of a hundredmillionyears. It took thirty years for the first isotopes of flerovium to be synthesized. More recent work suggests that the local islands of stability around <b>hassium</b> and flerovium are due to these nuclei being respectively deformed and oblate, which make them resistant to spontaneous fission, and that the true island of stability for spherical nuclei occurs at around unbibium-306 (with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).|$|E

For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 281Ds, the most stable confirmed darmstadtium isotope, is 11seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of darmstadtium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the darmstadtium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of darmstadtium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and <b>hassium</b> could be reused. However, the experimental chemistry of darmstadtium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium.|$|E
