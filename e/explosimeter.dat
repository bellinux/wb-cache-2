50|$|A {{flashback}} arrestor is {{installed in the}} device to avoid the <b>explosimeter</b> igniting the sample external to the device.|$|E
5000|$|Note, {{that the}} {{detection}} readings of an <b>explosimeter</b> are only accurate if the gas being sampled {{has the same}} characteristics and response as the calibration gas. Most explosimeters are calibrated to methane or hydrogen.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>explosimeter</b> is a gas {{detector}} {{which is used}} to measure the amount of combustible gases present in a sample. When a percentage of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of an atmosphere is exceeded, an alarm signal on the instrument is activated.

25|$|Percentage {{reading on}} {{combustible}} air monitors {{should not be}} confused with the LEL concentrations. <b>Explosimeters</b> designed and calibrated to a specific gas may show the relative concentration of the atmosphere to the LEL—the LEL being 100%. A 5% displayed LEL reading for methane, for example, would be equivalent to 5% multiplied by 5.0%, or approximately 0.25% methane by volume at 20 degrees C. Control of the explosion hazard is usually achieved by sufficient natural or mechanical ventilation, to limit the concentration of flammable gases or vapors to a maximum level of 25% of their lower explosive or flammable limit.|$|R
40|$|Sensors used in <b>explosimeters</b> for the {{detection}} of explosive gases are generally catalytic. The most widespread are catalytic pellets. A metallic oxidation catalyst is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to oxidize the gas. The oxidation reaction increases the temperature of the catalyst which increases its electrical resistance, whose amplitude is proportional to the gas concentration. In the 1950 s we developed a sensor of this type for the mining industry. It was based on a platinum filament and destined to detect methane, responsible for mine explosions. The filament is distinguished from the catalytic pellets by its operating temperature: 1000 °C instead of 600 °C, which confers on it the advantage of being relatively insensitive to fouling and catalyst poisoning. The disadvantage, however, is rapid wear, preventing it from operating permanently. The measurement technique thus involves energizing the sensor just long enough to make the measurement and then turning it off {{for as long as the}} application permits. The first instruments of this time could run for 100, 000 measurements, or about 9 months at the rhythm of one measurement every 4 minutes. By improving the filament heating technique, the measurement capacity has been increased considerably: 10, 000, 000 measurements with the last methanemeter recently marketed, or a lifetime of 1. 5 years at the practically continuous measurement rhythm of once every 5 seconds. Endowed with these performance characteristics, the platinum filament sensor is today a reliable solution for explosimetry, in particular in environments polluted with certain catalyst poisons such as sulfur-containing products, which other catalytic sensors resist poorly...|$|R
50|$|The Wheatstone bridge {{illustrates}} {{the concept of}} a difference measurement, which can be extremely accurate. Variations on the Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure capacitance, inductance, impedance and other quantities, such as the amount of combustible gases in a sample, with an <b>explosimeter.</b> The Kelvin bridge was specially adapted from the Wheatstone bridge for measuring very low resistances. In many cases, the significance of measuring the unknown resistance is related to measuring the impact of some physical phenomenon (such as force, temperature, pressure, etc.) which thereby allows the use of Wheatstone bridge in measuring those elements indirectly.|$|E
