40|$|Background: Following {{infection}} with M. tuberculosis, children are {{at increased risk}} of progression to tuberculosis disease; a condition that can be challenging to diagnose. New estimation approaches for children have highlighted the gap between incidence and notifications, and suggest there is much more isoniazid-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) disease than is identified. No work has yet quantified the burden of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infection,</b> considered other types of drug-resistance, or accounted for sampling uncertainty. Methods: We combined a mathematical model of tuberculosis in children with an analysis of drug-resistance patterns to produce country-level, regional, and global estimates of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infection</b> and disease. We estimated the proportions of tuberculosis cases at a country-level with: isoniazid-monoresistance (HMR), rifampicin mono-resistance, MDR, fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR, second-line injectable resistant MDR, and MDR with resistance to both a fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable (XDR). Findings: We estimate 850, 000 children developed tuberculosis in 2014; 58, 000 with HMR-tuberculosis, 25, 000 with MDR-tuberculosis, and 1, 200 with XDR-tuberculosis. We estimate 67 million children are infected with M. tuberculosis; 5 million with HMR, 2 million with MDR, and 100, 000 with XDR.

Many marine natural products (MNPs) —for example, neoechinulin B—have been found to be promising drug candidates to alleviate the mortality and morbidity rates caused by <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infections,</b> and several MNP-based anti-infectives have already entered phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, with six approved for usage by the US Food and Drug Administration and one by the EU.

This paper presents a deterministic HIV- 1 model to examine the mechanisms underlying the emergence of drug-resistance during therapy.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{emergence}} of macrocyclic lactone resistance in canine heartworm poses a substantial threat {{to what is}} currently the only effective, FDA-approved available method of prevention. Further study of the biotypes is necessary to understand the mechanism of resistance and evaluate novel prevention options. Identifying cases of <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infection</b> remains problematic, however, especially when poor compliance and insufficient testing are concerns. Furthermore, a definitive demonstration of resistance requires experimental infection and treatment, which is prohibitively costly. Methods With the aim of identifying likely cases of macrocyclic lactone-resistant heartworm and preventing their continued spread, we describe an algorithm for determining the likelihood of drug resistance and appropriate treatment strategies for each case. Results This algorithm relies on the microfilarial suppression test (MFST), which has been used previously as an efficient and discrete measure of suspected resistance. By standardizing this method in a format that is readily available to practitioners, it could become possible to preliminarily survey the emergence and spread of resistance.

Methods Overarching factors contributing to antimicrobial resistance were identified following a review of literature. The factors were then described in plain language and attached to ballot boxes at a public engagement event organised by a university. Responses to each factor were counted {{at the end of}} the event. Results Four hundred five responses were received from 3750 visitors (11 % response rate). Nearly half of responses (192 / 405, 47 [*]·[*] 4 %) considered the misuse/overuse of antibiotics in humans as the main determinant of antimicrobial resistance.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of influenza drug resistance has become {{of particular interest}} as current planning for an influenza pandemic involves using massive amounts of antiviral drugs. We use semi-stochastic simulations to examine the {{emergence of}} drug resistant mutants {{during the course of}} a single infection within a patient in the presence and absence of antiviral therapy. We specifically examine three factors and their effect on the emergence of drug-resistant mutants: antiviral mechanism, the immune response, and surface proteins. We find that adamantanes, because they act at the start of the replication cycle to prevent infection, are less likely to produce drug-resistant mutants than NAIs, which act at the end of the replication cycle. A mismatch between surface proteins and internal RNA results in drug-resistant mutants being less likely to emerge, and emerging later in the infection because the mismatch gives antivirals a second chance to prevent propagation of the mutation. The immune response subdues slow growing infections, further reducing the probability that a drug resistant mutant will emerge and yield a <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infection.</b> These findings improve our understanding of the factors that contribute to the emergence of drug resistance {{during the course of a}} single influenza infection...|$|E

A variety of studies have shown that drug-resistant S. pneumoniae infections are linked to antimicrobial use. It has been hypothesized that persons of high socioeconomic status are at increased risk for a <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infection</b> because of greater access to antimicrobial drugs. To assess whether median household income is associated with increased risk of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae infections, the authors geocoded and linked data from population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease with data from the 1990 US Census. Among invasive pneumococcal isolates from Atlanta, Georgia, in 1994, increasing proportions of penicillin-nonsusceptible isolates were associated with higher median household incomes (x 2 for trend, 15. 17; p = 0. 002). Despite higher rates of invasive pneumococcal disease among blacks and persons who resided within lower median household income areas, white patients in areas with higher median household income had a higher risk of being infected with strains that were not susceptible to penicillin (Wilcoxon rank sum, Z = 2. 66, p = 0. 008). These findings demonstrated the utility of geocoding and US Census data in describing the epidemiology of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and also provided more evidence that socioeconomic factors may influence the development of drug resistance.

40|$|Phagocytosis {{is a key}} {{mechanism}} of innate immunity, and promotion of phagosome maturation may represent a therapeutic target to enhance antibacterial host response. Phagosome maturation is favored by the timely and coordinated intervention of lipids and may be altered in infections. Here we used apoptotic body-like liposomes (ABL) to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to innate cells, and then tested their function in models of pathogen-inhibited and host-impaired phagosome maturation. Stimulation of macrophages with ABLs carrying phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate (PI 3 P) or PI 5 P increased intracellular killing of BCG, by inducing phagosome acidification and ROS generation. Moreover, ABLs carrying PA or PI 5 P enhanced ROS-mediated intracellular killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in macrophages expressing a pharmacologically-inhibited or a naturally-mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Finally, we show that bronchoalveolar lavage cells from patients with <b>drug-resistant</b> pulmonary <b>infections</b> increased significantly their capacity to kill in vivo acquired bacterial pathogens when ex vivo stimulated with PA-or PI 5 P-loaded ABLs. Altogether, these results provide the proof of concept of the efficacy of bioactive lipids delivered by ABL to enhance phagosome maturation dependent antimicrobial response, as an additional host-directed strategy aimed at the control of chronic, recurrent or <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

In this study, the de novo design of α-helical peptides with idealized facial amphiphilicities, based on {{an understanding of the}} pertinent features of protein secondary structures, is presented. Synthetic amphiphiles composed of the backbone sequence (X 1 Y 1 Y 2 X 2) n, where X 1 and X 2 are hydrophobic residues (Leu or Ile or Trp), Y 1 and Y 2 are cationic residues (Lys), and n is the number repeat units (2 or 2. 5 or 3), demonstrated potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates of drug-susceptible and multi-drug resistant bacteria. Live-cell imaging revealed that the most selective peptide, (LKKL) 3, promoted rapid permeabilization of bacterial membranes. Importantly, (LKKL) 3 not only suppressed biofilm growth, but effectively disrupted mature biofilms after only 2 h of treatment. The peptides (LKKL) 3 and (WKKW) 3 suppressed the production of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators to levels of unstimulated controls at low micromolar concentrations.

Sequencing of multiple genomes of relat- ed strains has enabled the delineation of pathogen evo- lution and facilitated the tracking of bacterial pathogens globally. Other recent theoretical and empirical {{studies have shown that}} pathogen evolution is significantly influenced by ecological factors, such as the distribution of hosts within the environment and the effects of co- infection. We suggest that the time is ripe for experi- mentalists to use genomics in conjunction with evolu- tionary ecology experiments to further understanding of how bacterial pathogens evolve...|$|R
50|$|In November, 2004, the CDC {{reported}} {{an increasing number}} of A. baumannii bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the Iraq/Kuwait region during Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom were treated. Most of these were multidrug-resistant. Among one set of isolates from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 13 (35%) were susceptible to imipenem only, and two (4%) were resistant to all drugs tested. One antimicrobial agent, colistin (polymyxin E), has been used to treat infections with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii; however, antimicrobial susceptibility testing for colistin was not performed on isolates described in this report. Because A. baumannii can survive on dry surfaces up to 20 days, they pose a high risk of spread and contamination in hospitals, potentially putting immunocompromised and other patients at risk for <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infections</b> that are often fatal and, in general, expensive to treat.|$|R
40|$|Increasing <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>infections</b> {{have drawn}} {{research}} interest towards examining environmental bacteria {{and the discovery}} that many factors, including elevated metal conditions, contribute to proliferation of antibiotic resistance (AR). This study examined 90 garden soils from Western Australia to evaluate predictions of antibiotic resistance genes from total metal conditions by comparing the concentrations of 12 metals and 13 genes related to tetracycline, beta-lactam and sulphonamide resistance. Relationships existed between metals and genes, but trends varied. All metals, except Se and Co, were related {{to at least one}} AR gene in terms of absolute gene numbers, but only Al, Mn and Pb were associated with a higher percentage of soil bacteria exhibiting resistance, which is a possible indicator of population selection. Correlations improved when multiple factors were considered simultaneously in a multiple linear regression model, suggesting the possibility of additive effects occurring. Soil-metal concentrations must be considered when determining risks of AR in the environment and the proliferation of resistance...|$|R
