5|$|<b>Friday</b> <b>morning</b> {{the wind}} shifted again, {{this time to}} the north. The {{firefighting}} finally started to show some semblance of organization, and efforts were waged to stop {{the fire in the}} neighborhood around Magstræde.

The wind was now blowing northwest and the firefighting moved via Snaregade to Nybrogade, Naboløs and Gammel Strand, but failed to save Nybrogade.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The <b>Friday</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes.

The two Mercedes drivers ended third and fourth quickest; Michael Schumacher ahead of Rosberg. Vettel and Webber set the fifth and eighth fastest times respectively for Red Bull; they were separated by the Renault cars of Kubica and Vitaly Petrov. Alonso and Adrian Sutil rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was disrupted with two minutes remaining when Sutil ran wide at turn eight, which caused him to spin backwards and crash into the barriers, breaking his front wing and both front tyres. The session was prematurely ended due to the limited time running.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The <b>Friday</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and}} fourth sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each.

The two Benetton drivers were seventh and eighth (with Wurz ahead of Fisichella), and the Williams cars of Ralf Schumacher and Button completed the top ten. Alesi's Prost had a fuel-pressure problem which prevented him from completing a timed lap, and he was the slowest overall. In the second practice session, due to a slow rear puncture Coulthard's first-session lap was still the fastest; Häkkinen had the second-fastest time. Jaguar driver Johnny Herbert changed his car's balance, improving its performance and finishing third-fastest. Villeneuve moved into fourth after changes to his car's setup; Michael Schumacher slipped to fifth, and Wurz finished sixth.

Mercedes confirmed their good form from pre-season testing and topped the time sheets by a considerable margin {{in the first}} two practice sessions on Friday, with Nico Rosberg fastest in both outings. Valtteri Bottas in the Williams was third fastest on <b>Friday</b> <b>morning,</b> some 1.2 seconds down on Rosberg's time. Ferrari's new signing Sebastian Vettel was third on Friday afternoon, seven-tenths of a second down on Rosberg. Toro Rosso showed promising times, outperforming their sister team Red Bull in the first session. Only 16 cars participated on <b>Friday</b> <b>morning.</b> Sauber kept to the garage due to their legal troubles while Manor Marussia was unable to get their cars running all weekend. The Saubers did go out for the second session, while local favourite Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa missed the session due to problems with their cars.

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday.

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, all three sessions were disrupted and little running took place. During {{the first session}} on <b>Friday</b> <b>morning,</b> a spillage of diesel on track prevented the cars from going out on until very late in the session. Eventually, Nico Hülkenberg topped the session for Force India, ahead of his compatriots Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Since water was used to clear the surface, the first laps were run on intermediate tyres by most drivers, with both Williams cars being equipped with full wet tyres, but Valtteri Bottas spun on them entering the pit lane. Later, the track dried enough to use slick tyres, Fernando Alonso being the first to do so. Due to the limited running, the last minutes were busy with most cars out on track. Marcus Ericsson however was confined to the sidelines as he stopped with an engine problem. As Lewis Hamilton spun on his last timed lap, he needed to settle for seventh fastest.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The <b>Friday</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Conditions were hot and sunny for the Friday practice sessions. Several drivers went off the track due to the track being dusty. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap of the first session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 41.175 seconds, ahead of McLaren teammates Hamilton and Button. Kubica was fourth-fastest; Massa and Vettel were fifth and sixth. Webber, Michael Schumacher, Alonso and Rubens Barrichello rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Bruno Senna's left-side view mirror became detached from his Hispania F110, which grazed the Brazilian driver's helmet, and was run over by Sébastien Buemi heading into turn 12, which caused the session to be stopped to allow marshals to clear the track of debris.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The <b>Friday</b> <b>morning</b> and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning.

Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E
