5000|$|Luigi Galvani, an Italian physicist, {{discovered}} something he named [...] "animal electricity" [...] when two different metals were connected {{in series with}} a <b>frog's</b> <b>leg</b> and to one another. Volta realised that the <b>frog's</b> <b>leg</b> served as both a conductor of electricity (what we would now call an electrolyte) and as a detector of electricity. He replaced the <b>frog's</b> <b>leg</b> with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{different}} versions of the story. In recent years SMU's website has claimed the following.TCU and SMU fans began the tradition back in 1946.

A TCU fan, seeing this desecration of the [...] "frog", went over and told him that eating the <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> was going well beyond the rivalry and that they should let the game decide who would get the skillet and the <b>frog</b> <b>legs.</b> SMU won the game, and the skillet and <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> went to SMU.

5000|$|The first {{mention of}} voltaic electricity, {{although}} not recognized as such at the time, was probably made by Johann Georg Sulzer in 1767, who, upon placing a small disc of zinc under {{his tongue and}} a small disc of copper over it, observed a peculiar taste when the respective metals touched at their edges. Sulzer assumed that when the metals came together they were set into vibration, acting upon the nerves of the tongue to produce the effects noticed. In 1790, Prof. Luigi Alyisio Galvani of Bologna, while conducting experiments on [...] "animal electricity", noticed the twitching of a <b>frogs</b> <b>legs</b> {{in the presence of}} an electric machine. He observed that a frogs muscle, suspended on an iron balustrade by a copper hook passing through its dorsal column, underwent lively convulsions without any extraneous cause, the electric machine being at this time absent.|$|E
5000|$|An {{article from}} TCU {{magazine}} tells the following story."The first [...] "Battle for the Iron Skillet" [...] occurred on November 30, 1946, as college football boomed after World War II. Weeks {{prior to the}} game, SMU’s Student Council proposed the idea of presenting a trophy to the winning team. TCU accepted the idea, and the two schools' governing bodies met in Dallas {{to set up the}} rules of the traveling trophy, which became the Iron Skillet." [...] The TCU magazine article has this to say about the other story [...] "One mystery remains: Why a skillet? History books provide scant details. Some claim that an SMU fan in the 1950s was caught frying <b>frogs</b> <b>legs</b> in a skillet at a tailgate before the game, and a TCU fan wagered that the winner should take the pan home, but that conflicts with a published report of the skillet originating with the councils." ...|$|E
