40|$|In this study, a {{bench scale}} forward osmosis (FO) process was {{operated}} using two commonly available FO membranes in different orientations {{in order to}} examine the removal of foulants in the coal seam gas (CSG) associated water, the water flux and fouling behaviours of the process were also investigated. After 48 h of fouling simulation experiment, the water flux declined by approximately 55 and 35 % of its initial level in the TFC-PRO and CTA-PRO modes (support layer facing the feed), respectively, while the flux <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the TFC-FO and CTA-FO modes (active layer facing the feed) was insignificant. The flux <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> PRO <b>modes</b> was caused by the compounding effects of internal concentration polarisation and membrane fouling. However, the declined flux was completely recovered to its initial level following the hydraulic cleaning using deionised water. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) and major inorganic scalants (Ca, Mg and silica) in the CSG feed were effectively removed by using the FO process. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the FO process shows promising potential to be employed as an effective pre-treatment for membrane purification of CSG associated water...|$|R

Although previous studies largely agree {{that there is an}} age-related <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the “default <b>mode</b> network,” how age affects other resting-state networks, such as motion-related networks, is still controversial.

The results revealed age-related disruptions in functional connectivity in all five identified cognitive networks, namely the default mode network, cognitive-auditory, cognitive-speech (or speech-related somatosensory) and right and left fronto-parietal networks, whereas such age effects were not observed in the three identified emotion networks. In addition, we observed age-related <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> functional connectivity in three visual and three motor/visuospatial networks. Older adults showed greater functional connectivity in regions outside four out of the five identified cognitive networks, consistent with the dedifferentiation effect previously observed in task-based fMRI studies.

However, {{it is not known}} if the mode of locomotion (i. e. swimming, cycling or running) influences the age-related <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> sport performance in sprinting and endurance events. METHODS: To examine the age-related <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> three different <b>modes</b> of locomotion (i. e. swimming, cycling and running) for endurance and sprint events, the world best performances achieved for males in the age-groups 18 - 39 years, 40 - 44 years, 45 - 49 years, 50 - 54 years, 55 - 59 years, 60 - 64 years, 65 - 69 years, 70 - 74 years, 75 - 79 years and 80 - 84 years, were compared in swimming (1500 -m and 50 -m), cycling (1 -h and 200 -m) and running (10 -km and 100 -m). Each performance was considered as an average speed (throughout the distance) and the age-related <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> performance was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} world record (regardless of age group) for that discipline. RESULTS: The results showed that the age-related <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> 1 -h track cycling is less pronounced compared to 1500 -m swimming and 10 -km running after 60 years.

Methods: Observational, prospective and multicenter study based on a wide source of data incoming from 50 Intensive Care Units in Spain during 15 years, from April 1996 to December 2010. Demographic, clinical, etiological and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables were collected before pacemaker implantation. Type of intervention, electrical measurement at implantation, model and serial number of devices and electrodes as well as early complications (before hospital discharge) were also recorded.

40|$|This paper {{responds}} to the extremely low rates of completion (collectively less than ten percent) of MOOC based courses by contending that education is not merely the provisioning of content, but that its more primary function is the performance of 'order words' that subjectivise teacher and student through language's power of incorporeal transformation. Using Deleuze and Guattari's provocative theory of language presented in the 'Postulates of Linguistics' from A Thousand Plateaus, the paper reflects upon their claim that language is more properly concerned with ordering and compliance through 'order words' rather than representing or conveying information, {{to argue that the}} subjectivising power of the performative is imperative to the acquisition of knowledge. Teaching as performativity is poorly served when removed from its affective investments, and the performance of information is vital to its retention and re-presentation. As the burgeoning world of MOOCs and digital interfaces instantiate a rapid <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> traditional <b>modes</b> of face-to-face communication, the disciplinary regime of the classroom which once produced the identity of teacher and student through affective encounter and performative language makes way for the asynchronous 'passwords' of the control society. Without recourse to the negotiation of power through language and the feedback of affective encounter, the digital's rigid system of passwords promote the programmatic over the dialogic and risk aversion instead of experimentation. Learning and teaching requires performance and performance requires bodies in space, and this paper will discuss why this will forever be the case. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} seven {{metropolitan regions}} {{that are all}} experiencing rapid motorisation and are perhaps appearing to capitulate to the automobile. Through 20 years of changes, evidenced in systematic data from the mid- 1990 s, a different perspective is found. None of the urban regions appear near to or even capable of becoming automobile cities. Physical limits are already being reached that make higher levels of private motorised mobility very problematic if transport systems are to remain functional and the cities livable. These limits appear already to be reversing the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> non-motorised <b>modes</b> and creating an upturn in transit systems, especially urban rail. That these cities {{have been able to}} either hold their own, or somewhat increase their share of total motorised mobility by transit over a 20 -year period, is some indication that they are ‘hitting mobility walls’ much sooner in the motorisation path than cities in North America and Australia, which grew up with and were designed around the spatial needs of cars. Like many cities in the developed world that have shown a decoupling of car use and total passenger mobility from GDP growth from 1995 to 2005, there is now evidence that this is happening in less wealthy cities. This is important because it assists global and local goals for reduced CO 2 from passenger transport, while allowing for economic progress. Such evidence suggests that automobile dependence is not an irresistible force in emerging economies...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed 9170 patients who had undergone stress-rest MPI between January 2004 and June 2013. Patients were assessed for change in demographics, risk factors, and frequency of abnormal and normal MPI. RESULTS: Overall mean age and male predominance of studied cohort was ≈ 55 years and ≈ 55 : 45 (M:F), respectively, with no appreciable decline or rise. Marked <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> exercise as <b>mode</b> of stress (from 71 % to 35 %, p value significant) was noted during the study period. Regarding the risk factors for CAD, only hypertension was noted to have a significant rising trend during the study period. Trend of MPI results over study period was found non-significant from 2004 till 2006 but from 2007 onward (except 2008), a marginal but significant <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> abnormal MPIs (from 45 % to 42 %; significant p value) and rise in normal MPI (from 55 % to 58 %; significant p value) was noted. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that over the past 8. 5 years, a marginal but significant <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> abnormal and a rise in normal MPIs trend have been observed. An exorbitant rise in use of vasodilator as a method of stress was also observed. We envisaged a follow-up study to ascertain lower negative predictive value of vasodilator as a possible reason and till than results of this and other such studies must be read cautious...|$|R
40|$|Walking and cycling {{are healthy}} and {{sustainable}} means of transport. These forms of active travel contribute to daily physical activity, aerobic fitness, and cardiovascular health while helping {{to protect against}} obesity, diabetes, and various other diseases. 1 - 9 The mounting evidence on {{the health benefits of}} walking and cycling has led to public health advocacy for more walking and cycling to improve individual health and to reduce air pollution, carbon emissions, congestion, noise, traffic dangers, and other harmful impacts of car use. 10 - 15 Thus, it is important to monitor rates of walking and cycling over time and to assess differences among population subgroups. Rates of active travel to work <b>declined</b> sharply <b>in</b> the United States over the past few decades. The US Census Bureau reported a declining proportion of workers walking to work (as their main mode of transport) from 10. 3 % in 1960 to 2. 9 % in 2009. 16, 17 Bicycling to work has only been reported since 1980, but it increased from 0. 4 % in 1980 to 0. 6 % in 2009. The share of workers taking public transport fell from 12. 6 % in 1960 to 4. 7 % in 2000, but then rose to 5. 0 % by 2009. Most public transport trips involve walking to get to and from public transport stops, but the Census only reports the main mode. Thus, the sharp <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> public transport <b>mode</b> share since 1960 also suggests a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> walk trips combined with public transport until 2000 and then a slight increase between 2000 and 2009 (see Supplemental Table A, available as a supplement to the online version of this article a...|$|R

40|$|For {{reasons of}} energy efficiency, {{health and the}} {{avoidance}} of climate change, it is desirable to encourage walking and cycling. However, step changes {{will be required to}} reverse years of <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> these transport <b>modes.</b> Recent thinking about how these might be achieved have concentrated on traditional transport policy measures, namely economic, engineering and information based instruments, while little emphasis has been put on the aesthetic dimension how the attractiveness of the built environment might be a significant factor in influencing walking and cycling. This paper argues that conceptualization of the aesthetic attractiveness of the street scene necessary to make walking and cycling pleasurable experiences is made difficult by the high degree of subjectivity involved and the likelihood that attitudes to the street scene may change in the future. In response to such problems, the paper suggests {{that there is a need}} for philosophical analysis of the issues involved. An introduction to such analysis is provided by a review of aesthetic thinking about landscapes and townscapes. This concentrates on research concerning the relevance of the forerunners of modern aesthetics, the eighteenth-century philosophers Hume and Kant, who attempted to tackle, on a generalized level, the types of problem raised here. As a result of this review, it is clear that there are no simple formulae or mechanisms by which aesthetic assessments can be applied off the shelf. Rather, the consideration of the historical philosophical arguments historically made about aesthetics can help provide a platform for generating insights on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{and influential}} literature finds {{a large and}} significant <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic volatility {{since the middle of}} the 1980 's. In this paper, I examine {{the extent to which the}} <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> annual and quarterly real output volatility since the onset of this period of Great Moderation can be attributed to changes in macroeconomic uncertainty and macroeconomic predictability. I use point forecasts of future real output growth from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) between 1969 and 2003 as a proxy for the predictable component of real output growth. The results indicate that declining predictability has played a significant role in the Great Moderation. Prior to the Great Moderation, professional forecasts explained roughly 30 percent of the variance in output growth. Post-moderation, the predictive ability of professional forecasts quickly vanished. This <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> predictability implies that interpreting the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the volatility of output shocks identified from a fixed parameter autoregressive model overstates the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic uncertainty by between 20 - 40 percent. I also examine forecasts of the probability of a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> real output from the SPF. Consistent with the findings from the point forecast data, these probability forecasts indicate that the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic uncertainty as measured from an autoregressive model is overstated. While both the average probability of a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> output and the uncertainty surrounding future <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> output computed from an autoregressive model decrease sharply after the mid- 1980 's, the SPF probability forecasts exhibit no such decrease.
