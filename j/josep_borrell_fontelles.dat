40|$|The European University Institute (EUI) and the Wharton Financial Institution Center (FIC) {{organized}} a conference entitled 'Life in the Eurozone With or Without Sovereign Default?' The event, {{which was held}} at the EUI in Florence, Italy, on 14 April 2011, was financed by the PEGGED project (Politics, Economics and Global Governance: The European Dimension) and a Sloan Foundation grant to the FIC. The conference brought together leading economists, historians, lawyers and policy makers to discuss the current economic situation in the Eurozone with particular emphasis on the issue of sovereign default. The aim was to have an open discussion on this timely and important topic to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} future development of the Eurozone. The European University Institute and the Wharton Financial Institutions Center held a conference in Florence, Italy in April 2011 that brought together leading economists, lawyers, historians and policy makers to discuss the current economic situation in the Eurozone with particular emphasis on the issue of sovereign default. This book summarizes the views presented there. The first part considers the current situation including the situations in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, the German constitution, EU law, the constraints on the ECB to buy up Eurozone government debt, and the European Financial Stability Fund. The second part covers how Eurozone sovereign bankruptcy might work, including collective action clauses, banking regulation given risky sovereign debt, the prevention of banking crises, and the sovereign equivalent of debtor-in-possession financing. The final part considers alternatives to sovereign bankruptcy including the possibility of leaving the Eurozone temporarily, an historical comparison of suspension of the Gold Standard, Argentina and other recent defaults, and the long run solution of Eurozone wide bonds and fiscal authority.

2500|$|For many, the {{political}} context surrounding the 2005 summit — the stagnation of the Middle East Peace Process, the US-led war on Iraq, {{the lack of}} democratisation in Arab countries, {{and the war on}} terror's negative effects on freedoms and human rights, among others—proved for many the inefficiency of the Barcelona Process for fulfilling its objectives of peace, stability and prosperity. Given these circumstances, even politicians that had been engaged with the Barcelona Process since its very beginnings, like the Spanish politician <b>Josep</b> <b>Borrell,</b> expressed their disappointment about the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and its incapacity to deliver results. Critiques from Southern Mediterranean countries blamed the Partnership's failure on Europe's lack of interest towards the Mediterranean in favour of its Eastern neighbourhood; whereas experts from the North accused Southern countries of only being interested on [...] "their own bi-lateral relationship with the EU" [...] while downplaying multilateral policies.|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} includes {{papers of}} an interdisciplinary conference in 2011 analysing multilevel governance {{problems of the}} international trading, environmental, development and rule-of-law systems as interdependent ‘aggregate public goods’. It begins with policy-oriented analyses from leading practitioners on the ‘gap between theory and practice’ in multilevel governance. The analyses of the ‘collective action problems’ are supplemented by case-studies on the world trading, environmental, development and related rule-of-law systems. Apart from assessing existing multilevel governance arrangements (such as the G 20 meetings), the conference papers explore alternative strategies for rendering multilevel governance more effective, for instance by promoting public-private partnerships, empowering private actors through stronger cosmopolitan rights, enhancing legal-judicial accountability of governments and by promoting overall coherence through transnational rule-of-law systems. The papers explore emerging principles for multilevel political governance (like ‘responsible sovereignty’, unilateral protection of ‘common concerns’) {{as well as new}} forms of multilevel judicial governance strengthening transnational rule-of-law in international trade, investment and environmental regulation. •	Introduction and Overview: Lack of Adequate Theories, Rules and Institutions for the Central Policy Challenge in the 21 st Century? •	Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann 1 •	Multilevel Governance of Interdependent Public Goods: Approaches by Political Practitioners Global Governance: From Theory to Practice •	Pascal Lamy 25 •	The EU and the European Parliament in International Trade and Climate Change Negotiations •	<b>Josep</b> <b>Borrell</b> 31 •	Collective Action Problems Impeding Collective Supply of Interdependent Public •	Goods: Economic, Political and Legal Analyses Global Public Goods: Explaining their Underprovision •	Inge Kaul 41 •	Problems of Policy-Design based on Insufficient Conceptualization: The Case of “Public Goods” •	Friedrich Kratochwil 61 •	Case Studies on Multilevel Governance of ‘Interface Problems’ of the International Trading, Environmental and Development Systems The G 20 and Global Economic Governance: Lessons from Multilevel European Governance? •	Jan Wouters and Thomas Ramopoulos 73 •	Multilevel Governance Problems at the Intersection of Trade, Health and the ‘Global Knowledge Economy’ •	Frederick M.

40|$|On February 4, 2011, {{the first}} {{roundtable}} of the ITO took {{place under the}} auspices of the RSC at EUI in Fiesole, Florence. Participants critically discussed the current observed deadlocks in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and advanced some preliminary thoughts on the way out. The group discussions were presided by <b>Josep</b> <b>Borrell,</b> the President of EUI, and led in the morning by Rufus Yerxa (Deputy Director General at the WTO), who provided an overall assessment of the issues that emerge as ‘ground-stoppers’ at this stage. In the follow up, the discussion was divided equally between four speakers: Michael Punke, the Ambassador of the United States to the WTO, gave the US perspective on the round; Lu Xiankun, the First Secretary in the Permanent Delegation of the Peoples’ Republic of China, explained the position of its country on what needs to be done to wrap up the round; Signe Ratso, Director for WTO Affairs at the European Commission, gave the European Union (EU) perspective, and finally, Vital Moreira, Head of the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament provided the reaction of the European citizenry on what is being discussed in Geneva. The discussions during the morning session concentrated on the current agenda of the Doha Round. Miguel Maduro, Director of the Global Governance Programme, acted as overall discussant. In the afternoon, there were presentations by five academics and the focus was equally distributed to the current- as well as a more ‘normative’ agenda that should eventually occupy the minds of trade negotiators: André Sapir (ULB) focused on the institutional design of the WTO and asked whether, in its current form, it can do justice to the new emerging issues; he drew a parallel between the multilateral- and the preferential agenda (as evidenced in the many preferential trade agreements that have recently seen the light of the day) and, noting the discrepancy, he asked whether it is time for the WTO to rethink its mandate if it is to continue to be policy relevant for its membership. Patrick Messerlin (Sciences Po) discussed the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ agenda as is, and as it should have been negotiated in the current round. He observed that key issues in the old agenda have largely remained outside the realm of current negotiations, whereas the progress in new issues does not even match de facto practiced liberalization: he used practice and offers in the services sector to illustrate this last point. He went on to state that one should not attach too many hopes on negotiating topics that have been hailed as innovative and meeting the aspirations of developing countries (such as the Aid for Trade initiative) for, in all likelihood, they will fall short of addressing actual needs. Henrik Horn (IFN), and Petros C. Mavroidis (Columbia & Neuchâtel) presented a short paper on the negotiations regarding dispute settlement. In their view, some of the issues currently on the agenda are quite important and deserve their inclusion in the talks. They remarked nonetheless, that progress has been made on peripheral issues, while discussion on key issues has so far been confined to little if any progress. They further regret that, the mounting criticism regarding the quality and internal consistency of reports (judgments) notwithstanding, negotiators did not find it opportune to include agency design in their discussions. Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann (EUI) asked the question whether the single undertaking-approach, whereby WTO Members accept to be party to (almost) all agreements concluded during a trade round should continue to be practiced in the future. He advanced both conceptual- and Realpolitik considerations to cast doubt to this perspective. He goes as far as to argue that even in the approach is followed at the end of the current round, there are reasons to believe that implementing efforts will not do justice to a similar commitment. This is the first of our Trade Policy Briefs that we will be circulating at the end of Chatham House rules-inspired conferences at the premises of RSC at EUI. Our aim is to bring together on regular basis a group of academics and policy makers to discuss the multilateral trade agenda as it emerges and evolves. The Doha round is going through tough times and at this stage it is impossible to predict its outcome. This is the central message coming from the meeting held on February 4, 2011 at EUI (RSCAS). For reasons having to do with domestic political economy, but also the inability to adjust to the emerging multi-polar reality, negotiators find it hard to come to grips with whatever is required to conclude the round. The most problematic feature is the absence of a Plan B: what do in case current design of talks fails to deliver? Maybe it is time to rethink ambitions and strategies, while accepting that an imminent conclusion has become a remote possibility. Introductory Remarks, Petros C.
