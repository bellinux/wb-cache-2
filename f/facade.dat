5|$|The {{original}} <b>facade,</b> oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the portico, was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. The <b>facade</b> is simply designed with its upper half hidden by an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects the <b>facade</b> and the portico. The portico was added as an extension to the <b>facade</b> in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the year of construction of the <b>facade</b> (1875) was invisible due to church renovations. Two religious images, both dated 1885, is found on the portico's niches: St. Joseph and the child Jesus on the uppermost niche and the Immaculate Conception, patroness, on the central niche.|$|E

The findings from both studies extend previous research by demonstrating that high levels of perceived organizational support and leader member exchange significantly reduce <b>facades</b> of conformity.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{shows the}} results of a {{research}} aimed at assessing the amount of energy that can be produced by solar envelopes (<b>facades</b> and roofs) in urban contexts. A preliminary set of simulations was carried out, through dynamic yearly analyses on a sample building, to identify the main parameters influencing the availability of solar radiation and to optimize the building's shape. The general target is to maximise solar radiation available on the external building envelope, in order to exploit it through building integrated solar systems. Furthermore, the effect of reflected solar radiation has been analysed by simulating different finishing materials (green <b>façades,</b> glazed <b>façades,</b> concrete <b>façades</b> and aluminium <b>façades)</b> on the neighbouring buildings...|$|R
