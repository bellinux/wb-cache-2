5|$|In the 1970s, most of {{the former}} Overhill sites were {{submerged}} by the <b>impoundment</b> of the Little Tennessee River in a Tennessee Valley Authority project. But, archaeologists conducted extensive excavations prior to this, during which they identified {{most of the}} Overhill towns and extracted thousands of artifacts, helping them develop volumes of invaluable information regarding the region's Cherokee and pre-Cherokee inhabitants. Different cultures of indigenous peoples had lived along the river for 12,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The river then {{runs along}} the west of V. Everit Macy Park. As part of the park facilities, the Saw Mill River is impounded into Woodlands Lake, the largest <b>impoundment</b> on the Saw Mill River, used as a water supply by the local {{communities}} of Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry, whose northern village line is just to the south. The river runs close to {{the boundary between the}} two, as the Thruway gradually veers away to the southeast just past the Ashford Avenue bridge.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Reproductive {{success and}} {{foraging}} effort of Pacific loons (Gavia pacifica) were compared between <b>impoundments</b> and natural ponds in the Prudhoe Bay oil field, Alaska, in 1992 and 1993. Pacific loons successfully reproduced on both <b>impoundments</b> and ponds. Though success {{tended to be}} lower on <b>impoundments,</b> {{no significant differences were}} detected between the two water body types. The principal cause of reproductive failure on both <b>impoundments</b> and ponds in 1993 appears to have been predation by arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) during incubation. Predation losses on <b>impoundments</b> often were associated with large water-level drawdowns, which apparently increased opportunities for predation of stranded clutches. I found no differences in chick mortality or adult foraging effort between <b>impoundments</b> and ponds. Over 99 % of the prey items delivered to chicks were invertebrates captured in freshwater wetlands. Reproductive output of Pacific loons may be improved by increasing the stability of water levels at <b>impoundments</b> used for nesting. I found no evidence that draining <b>impoundments</b> would improve habitat for loons (or invertebrate-eating waterfowl species) at Prudhoe Bay.

40|$|During August and September 1998, Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC {{performed}} a remedial action within <b>Impoundments</b> 3539 and 3540 (<b>Impoundments</b> C and D, respectively) {{in accordance with}} the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act Record of Decision (ROD) for the Surface <b>Impoundments</b> Operable Unit. The remedial action included removal of sediments and 0. 1 ft of subimpoundment soil. A post-remedial action radiological survey was conducted to provide data to support the Bethel Valley ROD. Data was obtained from (1) a walkover survey for residual gamma radiation on the base of the <b>impoundments,</b> (2) smear surveys for transferable contamination on remaining riprap, and (3) representative sampling of subimpoundment soils.

5|$|Continuing south-southwest, {{the river}} {{along with the}} parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other <b>impoundment</b> of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) {{to the south of}} where the river entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook.

5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued {{to expand in}} the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads as the dominant form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked <b>impoundment</b> on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance of the marsh. The Folcroft Landfill and the Clearview Landfill operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The former is {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, demolition waste, and medical waste. A number of businesses operated at the site of the Clearview Landfill after its closing.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the company}}, perpetually undercapitalized {{by its own}} admission, faced {{mounting}} financial troubles. On July 10, the company had to post an indemnity bond to avoid the <b>impoundment</b> of President Arthur for a disputed bill owed to Morse Dry Dock for the ship's 1924 refit. The following month, President Arthur was used as collateral for $100,000 loan from a Bronx bank, {{but it was too}} little, too late. American Palestine Line was placed in receivership on September 11 by federal judge Thomas D. Thacher of the U.S. District Court after suit was brought by a creditor. Eight days later, President Arthur, docked at the foot of West 34th Street, experienced a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold that brought out both land-based firefighters and the New York City Fire Department fireboat James Duane. In December, the line was accused of fraud in some of its prior financial dealings, charges the company denied. By the time all the legal wrangling was finished, President Arthur was back {{in the hands of the}} USSB, and the furniture and fixtures of the American Palestine offices were sold at public auction by the company's receiver in early March 1926.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod is {{the apex}} aquatic {{predator}} in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way, including finned fishes such as smaller Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), {{as well as}} crustaceans such as yabbies, freshwater shrimp, and Murray crayfish. Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and <b>impoundment</b> habitats, and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|E
30|$|In some {{developing}} countries like China, cost-effective phytostabilization technologies are more in need. Till 2012, China has accumulated more than 12, 000 tailings <b>impoundments,</b> 3000 {{of which are}} with a volume greater than 106  m 3. Unfortunately, most of the inactive <b>impoundments,</b> particularly the smaller ones, have not been properly closed. Many have even unknown liability subjects [2]. Worse, China’s tailings <b>impoundments</b> are mostly located in densely populated areas, e.g. the central China and northeast China, and many are just adjacent to arable land. This complicates the management, and the proper closure of these tailings ponds has been an economic burden to the nation.|$|R

25|$|The Refuge {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of {{wildlife}} despite its urban location. Birdwatchers have recorded over 300 species of birds in and around the Refuge, 85 of which nest here. Migratory birds like warblers, egrets, sandpipers, and a large variety of ducks, within the Atlantic Flyway, use the refuge as a resting/feeding spot during spring and fall flights. Since water levels can be controlled in the <b>impoundment,</b> the water is often drained in early fall at the refuge. This serves both to reduce the large population of invasive carp and makes the <b>impoundment</b> a large mudflat, which renders it very attractive to migrating shorebirds. The water levels is raised later in the fall so waterfowl can use the <b>impoundment.</b>|$|E
