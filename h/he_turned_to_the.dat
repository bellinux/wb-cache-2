5|$|Dallas {{joined the}} Port Curtis Militia in 1913, and was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant {{prior to the}} outbreak of World WarI. Believing he had little chance of gaining {{a place in the}} recently established Australian Flying Corps, he applied to join the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC), but was rejected. Undaunted, he travelled from Queensland to Melbourne, where he impressed Minister Without Portfolio J.A.Jensen. Jensen gave the young aspirant a letter of introduction to the Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir George Reid. Dallas paid his own passage to England and, once there, applied once more to the RFC. Rejected again, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and was accepted, topping the entrance examination over 83 other students. He was commissioned a flight sub-lieutenant and began training at Hendon in June 1915, gaining Pilot's License #1512 on 5August.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{classical}} music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were {{strongly influenced by}} jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American {{classical music}} more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ballet and then serial music. Charles Ives {{was one of the}} earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was {{initially}} welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered peacekeeping. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach Congolese sovereignty. Lumumba also sought {{the assistance of the}} United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused. Frustrated, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo. Lumumba's actions distanced him {{from the rest of the}} government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years later}} at the {{conclusion}} of the war, Baldwin declined an offer from Yale for a divinity professorship. Instead of resuming his ministerial or educational vocation after the war, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study of law. In 1783 he was admitted to the bar.|$|E
25|$|Sun's {{efforts to}} obtain {{aid from the}} Western {{countries}} were ignored, thus <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union in 1921. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Communist Party of China, which would eventually found the People's Republic of China. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.|$|E
25|$|Following Gershwin, {{the first}} major {{composer}} was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. His works included the Symphony for Organ and Orchestra (which was well received, earning him comparisons to Stravinsky), the jazz-affected Music for the Theatre, the music for the ballet Appalachian Spring and the Piano Variations. Later, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ballet and then serial music.|$|E

25|$|The main villains of {{both the}} franchises also share many similarities. Tom Riddle was once also {{a student of the}} hero's mentor, Dumbledore at Hogwarts, also {{studying}} to be a wizard before he turned evil and transformed into Voldemort. Likewise, Anakin Skywalker was also a student of the hero's mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi with the Jedi Order training to be a Jedi Knight before <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dark Side and transformed into Darth Vader.|$|E
25|$|He {{depended}} {{on the east coast}} trade for his guns and gunpowder, which passed through the territory of his rivals, making supplies expensive and unreliable. Instead <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west coast, sending his nephew Molenga to the Ovimbundu and Portuguese traders around Benguela in Angola, and a trader there called Coimbra became his supplier. The Luba people to his north-west had controlled the west coast trade, but Msiri took it over and halted their southwards expansion.|$|E
25|$|On 4 December, M'ba {{was elected}} to replace Gondjout as Secretary General of the BDG. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{opposition}} to strengthen his position. With Aubame, he formed a number of sufficiently balanced political unions {{to appeal to the}} electorate. On 12 February, they won 99.75% of the vote. The same day, M'ba was elected President of Gabon, being the only candidate. In thanks for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister to replace André Gustave Anguilé.|$|E

25|$|Coffey's opinion {{considered}} three issues: {{whether the}} district court had properly found Churchill's criticisms of Waters, Davis and cross-training did not touch on {{a matter of public}} concern, whether the appellants' failure to determine that before firing her had been a due process violation and whether they were entitled to qualified immunity from the suit since they argued there was no settled law on the subject. To resolve the first issue, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relevant case law on the subject.|$|E
25|$|In his {{adolescence}} <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> martial art Taekwondo to help calm his restless mind.

After he graduated from Dankook University in 1977 with a B.S. degree in clinical pathology and physical education, he opened a health clinic, which according to his own account did well. He soon married and settled down to raise a family.|$|E
25|$|Michael's road to {{the throne}} had been of {{questionable}} legality, and that fact earned him many enemies. Additionally, he oversaw an empire which was strongly dependent on foreign powers, and had an immense need for gold to fund its great military expenses. It is not surprising, therefore, that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jews and other minorities (most notably the Armenians) {{as a source of}} support in an embattled state of affairs, and when the ethnic majority and the mainstream elite had grown unfriendly toward him.|$|E

25|$|By 1921 Sun {{had become}} {{president}} of the southern government. He spent his remaining years trying to consolidate his regime and achieve unity with the north. His efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were fruitless, however, and in 1920 <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. For political expediency, though, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP).|$|E
25|$|Charles {{relied on}} two precedents, the Supreme Court's Paul v. Davis and the Second Circuit's own Rosenberg v. Martin, Jerry Rosenberg's case, {{to support his}} {{argument}} that the injury to Lauro's reputation did not in itself deprive him of his constitutional rights. Writing for the panel, Guido Calabresi, former dean of Yale Law School, rejected those two arguments since in neither case had the plaintiffs asserted a Fourth Amendment violation, as Lauro had. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> perp walk itself, which he agreed {{seemed to be a}} question of first impression.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Steele's Bayou expedition, Grant had lost his last chance to attack the Confederate right flank. Porter, together with most others, thought that the Union forces should pull back to Memphis to regroup and consider what to do next. Grant, however, had no such inclination, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prospect of attacking the Confederate left. Porter unhesitatingly accepted Grant's position, and he immediately began to advise the general how best to incorporate the Navy into his plans. The ensuing close working arrangement between the two men became {{an important part of the}} rest of the Vicksburg campaign.|$|E

25|$|Domingo Ortega {{suffered}} an automobile accident, and his proxy, Dominguín, asked Sánchez {{to substitute for}} him in Manzanares, on 11 August 1934. This came at a bad time for Sánchez, but because the bulls were great {{he did not want}} to seem like he was avoiding them. He had no car, no hotel, not even a cuadrilla (bullfighting team). For the first time in his life, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lottery and drew two tickets with the numbers of the bulls of Ayala that he was scheduled to fight. The first, number 16, Granadino, docile, thin-horned and coarse-skinned, nevertheless gored him.|$|E
25|$|The May Fourth Movement {{helped to}} rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 Sun Yat-sen had become {{commander-in-chief}} {{of a rival}} military government in Guangzhou in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1920 <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP).|$|E
25|$|In 1834 he was {{appointed}} professor of physics. But in 1839, he contracted an eye disorder while studying the phenomena of color and vision, and, after much suffering, resigned. Subsequently recovering, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study {{of the mind and}} its relations with the body, giving public lectures on the subjects dealt with in his books. Whilst lying in bed Fechner had an insight into the relationship between mental sensations and material sensations. This insight proved to be significant in the development of psychology as there was now a quantitative relationship between the mental and physical worlds.|$|E
