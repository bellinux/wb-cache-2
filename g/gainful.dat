5|$|Harvey was not {{embroiled in}} the {{political}} arguments surrounding the action, as he had resigned his commission on 23 May 1809, before the attack went ahead, in protest at Cochrane's preferment. Returning to the Navy a year later on 21 March 1810, Harvey was never again called to active service, Gambier blocking his efforts to obtain <b>gainful</b> employment. Despite his failure {{to return to the}} sea, Harvey's seniority brought more promotions; he made vice-admiral in 1810 and finally became a full admiral in 1819. He was also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815 when the order was reformed, becoming a Knight Grand Cross in 1825. Harvey's retirement included a further period in politics, returning to his seat as MP for Essex between 1820 and 1830.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek <b>gainful</b> employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} {{home from the}} {{sanatorium}} in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at <b>gainful</b> employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, {{he was laid off}} and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.|$|E
5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on to suggest that a liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and <b>gainful</b> employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E
5|$|Several Land Reform Acts were enacted {{to provide}} {{ownership}} rights to poor farmers. Up to September 2001, more than 20,000,000 acres (80,000km²) of land had been distributed to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and the landless poor. The thrust of banking policy in India {{has been to}} improve banking facilities in the rural areas. The Minimum Wages Act of 1948 empowers government to fix minimum wages for employees engaged in various employments. The Consumer Protection Act of 1986 provides for the better protection of consumers. The act is intended to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to the consumers' grievances, award relief and compensation wherever appropriate to the consumer. The Equal Remuneration Act of 1976, provides for equal pay for equal work {{for both men and}} women. The Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana was launched in 2001 to attain the objective of <b>gainful</b> employment for the rural poor. The programme was implemented through the Panchayati Raj institutions.|$|E
5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and <b>gainful</b> employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E
25|$|His {{endeavours}} {{were aimed}} at minimising safety hazards for everyone, preventing further colossal losses the people and country incur, promoting social exclusion for all and enhancing productive and <b>gainful</b> opportunities for the widest possible range of persons, dis-abled persons in particular, in their day-to-day lives.|$|E
25|$|Around 150 Conservative MPs {{lost their}} {{seats in the}} 1997 general election. Many of them {{struggled}} to find <b>gainful</b> employment and a new role in life for themselves. This was particularly difficult for former ministers who had become accustomed to the status, emoluments and perks that went with their old jobs.|$|E
25|$|Economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} rights, related to the conditions necessary to meet basic human needs such as food, shelter, education, health care, and <b>gainful</b> employment. Included are rights to education, adequate housing, food, water, the highest attainable standard of health, the right to work and rights at work, {{as well as the}} cultural rights of minorities and indigenous peoples.|$|E
25|$|Once Arab women {{scientists}} and engineers graduate, they may come up against barriers to finding <b>gainful</b> employment. These include a misalignment between university programmes and labour market demand – a phenomenon which also affects men –, a lack of awareness about what a career in their chosen field entails, family bias against working in mixed-gender environments {{and a lack of}} female role models.|$|E
25|$|Around 1942 or 1943, her {{relationship}} with Metcalf had deteriorated to a breaking point due to Wood's unfaithful sexual activities and lack of any <b>gainful</b> employment. Metcalf offered Wood money {{to move out of}} their shared house and effectively ended their sixteen-year relationship. Once the separation was complete, Metcalf reportedly never spoke to Wood again, even when Wood, dying, is said to have requested to see her.|$|E
25|$|Various unapproved acts {{such as the}} {{promotion}} of chain letters that contain prayers or {{the belief that the}} use of a statue of Saint Joseph can speed up the sale of a house have been discouraged as non-pious, superstitious and against Catholic values. In general, acts and beliefs that aim at the manipulation of divine power for specific <b>gainful</b> purposes are always condemned as contrary to Catholic devotional practices.|$|E
25|$|Around 85% of the {{newcomers}} were under age 45, and 51% had a university education, so most integrated quite rapidly into Argentine society, albeit with some initial difficulties finding <b>gainful</b> employment. These also included some 200 Romanian Gypsy families that arrived in 1998, and 140 more Romanian Gypsies who migrated to Uruguay in 1999, {{but only to}} enter Argentina later by crossing the Uruguay river through Fray Bentos, Salto or Colonia.|$|E
25|$|Because {{virtually}} all of the artwork at the missions served either a devotional or didactic purpose, there was no underlying reason for the mission residents to record their surroundings graphically; visitors, however, found them to be objects of curiosity. During the 1850s a number of artists found <b>gainful</b> employment as draftsmen attached to expeditions sent to map the Pacific coastline and the border between California and Mexico (as well as plot practical railroad routes); many of the drawings were reproduced as lithographs in the expedition reports.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2005, after {{a service}} at Saint Anthony of Padua Church in Greenwich Village, Gigante's body was cremated at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. He {{is survived by}} eight {{children}} (five from {{his wife and three}} from his mistress). He also has prominent cousins from Boston (who spell their name both Gigante and Giganti.) Since Gigante's death, his family continued to live well. According to a 2011 report by Jerry Capeci, Gigante’s relatives earn nearly $2 million a year as <b>gainful</b> employees of companies on the New Jersey waterfront.|$|E
25|$|Legal status {{can thus}} {{lead to a}} {{restructuring}} of traditional family roles. Family members who may have previously been the primary breadwinners {{in the country of}} origin may be unable to find <b>gainful</b> employment due to their undocumented status. Family members who are legal citizens and thus have access to a wider range of employment opportunities may therefore hold a greater measure of power within the family. When these family members are children, who might traditionally be expected to defer to their elders, such an imbalance in legal status may create an upheaval in the traditional familial relations.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy the Gaza Strip until 1967. Egypt never annexed the Gaza Strip, but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor. The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine, roughly a quarter of those who fled or were expelled from their homes during, and in the aftermath of, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War into Gaza resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living. Because the Egyptian government restricted movement to and from the Gaza Strip, its inhabitants could not look elsewhere for <b>gainful</b> employment.|$|E
25|$|Andreas Hug {{was born}} in Zurich, Switzerland on September 7, 1964. His father, Arthur, was a Swiss of French descent and was in French Foreign Legionnaire. He died in Thailand under mysterious {{circumstances}} without ever seeing his son. Hug's mother, Madelaine Hug-Baumann, was German. She was forced to pursue <b>gainful</b> employment. Unable to care for Andy, she immediately put him up for adoption and he spent {{the first three years}} of his life in an orphanage until his care was taken over by his grandparents along with his brother, Charly, and sister, Fabienne. His grandmother, Fridy, and grandfather, Herrmann Baumann, a bricklayer, raised them in Wohlen in the Canton of Aargau.|$|E
25|$|In 1965 {{he married}} schoolteacher Linda Moore in Bakersfield, but they {{divorced}} two years later. Unable {{to find any}} <b>gainful</b> employment, he became a migrant worker. Dalkowski experienced problems with alcohol abuse. He drank heavily {{as a player and}} his drinking escalated after the end of his career. He received help from the Association of Professional Ball Players of America (APBPA) periodically from 1974 to 1992 and went through rehabilitation. He was able to find a job and stay sober for several months but soon went back to drinking. The APBPA stopped providing financial assistance to him because he was using the funds to purchase alcohol.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} growing overlap between the Vocational Education and Training (VET), {{organised}} under the National Training System, and Higher Education sectors in Australia. Courses are primarily taken by those aged over 18, however in some vocational and general academic courses a minority of students enter at the minimum school-leaving age of 16, although from May 2009 Federal Government policy calls {{for young people to}} be in education, <b>gainful</b> employment, or training until age 17 (Year 12 qualification) with tightening of income support payments to age 20 if not undertaking further training. This tends to happen particularly at Technical and Further Education colleges (TAFE), and is less likely to happen at a university or a private institution.|$|E
25|$|La Luz sites {{the example}} of his {{grandfather}} – who worked in a key New Deal program implemented in 1935 by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) led by then Governor of Puerto Rico Rexford Tugwell, a close ally and former top advisor to FDR. The government effort provided an ongoing domino effect of positive economic recovery and relief for the impoverished families including La Luz’s grandfather, whose business had collapsed from the devastation caused by the San Felipe (1928) and the San Ciprian (1932) hurricanes that wiped out major farm crops and ruined hundreds of small farmers and merchants in the island. His grandfather was able to secure <b>gainful</b> employment {{in one of the}} PRRA programs thus joining the ranks of the Federal Civil Service that allowed him to support his large family.|$|E
25|$|Transitional housing {{provides}} {{temporary housing}} for the certain segments of the homeless population, including working homeless, and is set up to transition their residents into permanent, affordable housing. It's not in an emergency homeless shelter but usually a room or apartment in a residence with support services. The transitional time can be short, for example, one or two years, {{and in that time}} the person must file for and get permanent housing and usually some <b>gainful</b> employment or income, even if Social Security or assistance. Sometimes, the transitional housing residence program charges a room and board fee, maybe 30% of an individual's income, which is sometimes partially or fully refunded after the person procures a permanent place to live in. In the USA, federal funding for transitional housing programs was originally allocated in the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1986.|$|E
25|$|In most states, the {{decision}} of whether an inmate is paroled is vested in a paroling authority such as a parole board. Mere good conduct while incarcerated {{in and of itself}} does not necessarily guarantee that an inmate will be paroled. Other factors may enter into {{the decision}} to grant or deny parole, most commonly the establishment of a permanent residence and immediate, <b>gainful</b> employment or some other clearly visible means of self-support upon release (such as Social Security if the prisoner is old enough to qualify). Many states now permit sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (such as for murder and espionage), and any prisoner not sentenced to either this or the death penalty will eventually have the right to petition for release (one stateAlaskamaintains neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without parole as sentencing options).|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{compelling}} seismogram from the 1940 event in El Centro, strong-motion seismology was not explicitly sought until later events occurred—the San Fernando earthquake made evident {{the need for}} more data for earthquake engineering applications. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and ground response stations. By the late 1980s, the program had instrumented more than 450 structures, bridges, dams, and power plants. The 1979 Imperial Valley and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were presented as <b>gainful</b> events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully instrumented government building that was shaken to the point of failure.|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{voted for}} the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001. Ryan is a {{supporter}} of for-profit colleges and opposed the <b>gainful</b> employment rule, which would have ensured that vocational schools whose students were unable to obtain employment would stop receiving federal aid. Ryan is a supporter of private school vouchers and voted to extend the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Finally {{there is}} a {{government}} paramilitary force, created in 1997 under President Laurent Kabila. The National Service is tasked with providing the army with food and with training the youth {{in a range of}} reconstruction and developmental activities. There is not much further information available, and no internet-accessible source details the relationship of the National Service to other armed forces bodies; it is not listed in the constitution. President Kabila, {{in one of the few}} comments available, says National Service will provide a <b>gainful</b> activity for street children. Obligatory civil service administered through the armed forces was also proposed under the Mobutu regime during the 'radicalisation' programme of December 1974-January 1975; the FAZ was opposed to the measure and the plan 'took several months to die.' ...|$|E
500|$|The {{nation and}} the {{constitution}} survived {{the rising tide of}} financial and political corruption during President Grant's two terms in office from 1869 to 1877. With slavery no longer the clear moral issue for the American people, and absent the dynamic leadership of Abraham Lincoln taken by an assassin's bullet, the nation for a while floundered in the seas of financial and political indulgence. The high-water mark of the flood of corruption that swept the nation took place in 1874, after Benjamin Bristow was put in charge to reform the Treasury. [...] In 1873, Grant's friend and publisher, Mark Twain, along with coauthor Charles Dudley Warner, called this American era of speculation and corruption the Gilded Age. Between 1870 and 1900, the United States population nearly doubled in size, <b>gainful</b> employment increased by 132 percent, and non farm labor constituted 60 percent of the work force.|$|E

Maria's father Abijah White, a wealthy {{merchant}} from Watertown, insisted that their wedding be postponed until Lowell had <b>gainful</b> employment. They were finally married on December 26, 1844, shortly after the groom published Conversations on the Old Poets, a collection of his previously published essays. A friend described their relationship as [...] "the very picture of a True Marriage". Lowell himself believed that she was made up [...] "half of earth {{and more than half of}} Heaven". She, too, wrote poetry, and the next twelve years of Lowell's life were deeply affected by her influence.

500|$|Their Child is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film begins with Ellen Stokes whose extravagant lifestyle is outside {{the means of the}} family. While their only son is hosting a birthday party, the husband informs Ellen that they are financially ruined because of her. Ellen attempts to get money from her uncle, who refuses, and a friend of the family soon comes to her aid with a loan. Ellen is deceptive in telling who provided the money and her jealous husband soon learns the truth. In anger, he takes the child and leaves. The child soon returns to Ellen and she whisks him away to a new home where she fails to obtain <b>gainful</b> employment. The son decides to sell newspapers for some money and in this job is recognized by his father, soon the family is reunited. Marie Eline played the role of [...] "their child" [...] and was likely so well disguised that the reviewer for The Nickelodeon believed her to be a boy. The film was released on October 21, 1910, and was met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The 1960 United States Census {{recorded}} just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, {{making it the}} least-populated state in the United States at that time. Interior Alaska contained about 28,000 residents, and promoters suggested that the dam's benefits would vastly outweigh the costs to the few residents who would be displaced. An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing [...] "not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world {{and it would be}} difficult to find an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding." [...] In a 1963 letter responding to a Sports Illustrated article about the dam, Gruening wrote, As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than they are now. Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief. Construction of the Rampart Dam will give them ample <b>gainful</b> employment, and in their new locations, chosen by them on the lake's borders, they will have better homes, better community facilities and a permanent income from now nonexistent activities, generated by the lake.|$|E
