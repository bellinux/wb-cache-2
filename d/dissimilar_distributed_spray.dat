50|$|The {{height of}} each spray nozzle {{above the surface}} of the pond should be between 1.5 m and 2.0 m. The spray nozzles {{themselves}} should be chosen so as to provide the desired spray pattern diameter at the pond surface, while yielding a maximum spray height of 2.5 m or more above the nozzle. This will provide an adequate contact time between the air and water and should be achievable with a delivery pressure of between 50 and 75 kPa across the nozzles. The performance of a spray pond depends to a large degree on the effectiveness of the spray nozzles which are installed. Ideally, the chosen nozzles should provide a fine, evenly <b>distributed</b> <b>spray</b> in conical form, be capable of passing small particles of suspended matter without blocking and be readily dismantled for cleaning. Typical droplet sizes which are achieved by spray pond nozzles vary between 3 mm and 6 mm. While providing better cooling performance because of their increased surface-to-volume ratios, the generation of droplets of smaller size would require an excessive pressure drop across the nozzles and could lead to increased wind-drift losses from the pond.|$|R

As expected, with a coarse droplet spectrum, there is less material {{at the base of}} the canopy compared to the middle and the top (Figures  1 and 2). Unexpectedly, the distributions of dye on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces were similar throughout the canopy profile, resulting in better coverage on the abaxial leaf surfaces {{at the base of the}} inner canopy. The high coverage of dye on the abaxial leaf surfaces was possible due to a helicopter downwash effect, which moved the leaves and exposed both sides of the leaf surfaces to the spray.|$|R

A 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation is performed by coupling the two-fluid model and the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) drag. The prediction agrees well with the available data and the secondary flow phenomenon is captured. The simulation reveals that the M-shape <b>distributed</b> feed <b>sprays</b> interact with the W-shape distributed solid particles and then cause the undesirable W-shape distribution of the matching ratio of catalysts to feed. The transformation of such uneven distribution to the finally core-annular distribution heavily depends on the secondary flow, whereas its mechanism {{can be explained by}} using the Kutta-joukowski lift theorem. The increase of the feed spray velocity facilitates the feed diffusion and reduces the transition region. However, excessively high jet velocity may intensify the back-mixing near the wall and causes intense attrition or breakage of catalysts and thereby an increase of costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

Poison control methods are effective in reducing rat populations to nonthreatening sizes, but rat populations often rebound to normal size within months. Besides their highly adaptive foraging behavior and fast reproduction, the exact mechanisms for their rebound is unclear and are still being studied.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this year's work has been {{to develop a new}} dry cooling tower surface. The new surface {{utilizes}} a modification of film type packing in wet cooling towers. It is a concept which may eliminate excessive water loss. Cost of fabrication, and effectiveness of heat transfer surface were among the major design considerations. Based on preliminary water wetting investigations over simple geometric surfaces, a conductive plate was shaped to form a series of V-troughs. It provided open chennelled water flow separated by fin-like dry surfaces, and simultaneously self <b>distributed</b> random <b>spraying</b> water. The design not only channels the water flow, but also provides a convenient means to vary the air-water interfacial area to the water-plate and dry plate contact area. Varying these ratios will become necessary as optimization studies are completed. To investigate the effectiveness of this design and of future advanced wet-dry concepts, a model heat transfer test apparatus was constructed. It provided operating conditions (water temperature, water flow rates and air flow rates) similar to those of existing wet cooling tower packing sections. All of the design requirements have been satisfied: hot water flow recirculation and counter flow air stream. A computer simulation of the proposed surface was made. The simulation modeled heat and mass transfer from the air-water interface as well as heat transfer from the dry surface area. Initial parametric runs were made using the program. They indicate that when the ratio of wet surface area to total surface area is five percent, approximately seventy-five percent of the energy transfer takes place as sensible heat transfer; whereas, for a wet tower at similar conditions approximately eighty-five percent of the total energy transfer takes place by evaporation.

40|$|Background. P 63 {{immunostaining}} {{has been}} considered as potential prognostic factor in laryngeal cancer. Considering that P 63 is mainly nuclear stain, a possible correlation between the texture of P 63 -stained nuclei and the tumor’s grade could be of value to diagnosis, since this {{may be related to}} biologic information imprinted as texture on P 63 expressed nuclei. Objective. To investigate the association between P 63 stained nuclei and histologic grade in laryngeal tumor lesions. Methods. Biopsy specimens from laryngeal tumour lesions of 55 patients diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas were immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for P 63 expression. Four images were digitized from each patient’s IHC specimens. P 63 positively expressed nuclei were identified, the percentage of P 63 expressed nuclei was computed, and 118 textural, morphological, shape, and architectural features were calculated from each one of the 55 laryngeal lesions. Data were split into the low grade (21 grade I lesions) and high grade (34 grade II and grade III lesions) classes for statistical analysis. Results. With advancing grade, P 63 expression decreased, P 63 stained nuclei appeared of lower image intensity, more inhomogeneous, of higher local contrast, contained smaller randomly <b>distributed</b> <b>dissimilar</b> structures and had irregular shape.

5000|$|The {{interacting}} molecular {{structures that}} break {{the structure of}} solvent exchange the heat or the oscillations or the electron clouds on weakening cohesive force (CF) of solvent. However the solvent structure opposes the interaction of solute molecules to maintain its own structures. Thus the friction and triction both are developed. The triction depicts a thermodynamic restriction to break down or disrupt the solvent structure by solute interaction. Contrary to the triction the friction depicts a molecular force restriction. The thermodynamic disruption of solvent structure leads to develop intermolecular forces (IMF). Friccohesity of solute solvent interactions predicts a quantitative disruption of CF and formation of IMF in the same proportion. Thus the friccohesity is kinetic concept materialized through friction and triction both. Thus in solubilization or dispersion sciences the friccohesity predicts a level of solute and solvent interaction through molecular interaction engineering. Friccohesity becomes a most mobile theory to accommodate the geometrical spaces to support the electronic contact between the similar molecules with definite CF and <b>dissimilar</b> molecules or <b>distributing</b> force factor or friction to overcome opposing resistance. The friccohesity becomes a modern model to simulate not only the molecular contact but also successful exchange of the interacting activities in terms of activation energy, entropy, and Gibbs energy defined by triction.|$|R

The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the filter media and ponding on the surface.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the electrostatic powder coating industry an increase in deposition efficiency and a controlled decrease in film thickness are constantly strived for. If adjustments to the size distribution of powders are made {{in order to improve}} the process in any way {{it is important that the}} excellent physical properties of the coating are not sacrificed. The aim of this study is to gain an understanding of the effects of particle size on the packing and final film properties of electrostatically sprayed coatings so that-recommendations can be made to increase the effectiveness of the process. Experimental studies involved the production of stoved sample coatings of various thicknesses obtained by spraying narrow size ranges of a commercial powder using a reproducible coating method. A testing programme was developed to assess the effect of particle size on the physical properties of the films produced. A three way comparison of physical property, size of sprayed powder and coating thickness has been compiled and results are discussed. It was observed that particle size had no significant physical effect on film properties. A method for determining a spreading factor, representative of the flow characteristics of a given powder, was developed. Observations from these stoving experiments suggested that the excellent flow properties of the powder used in earlier experiments accounted for the small variations in those results. However photomicrographs of typical coatings showed that large particles were dominant in the upper layers of packings. A loss of fines was identified from size analysis of various powders on coated plates compared to the original feed materials. Computer plots simulating the packing of particles on a substrate showed similar trends. Integration of the trajectory equation for individual particles, represented by means of a force balance, was carried out with consideration of all interparticulate electrostatic forces of the packed layer together with field and aerodynamic forces. Simulations of packings of monosized and size <b>distributed</b> powders <b>sprayed</b> at various transport air velocities show that, as a packing increases in thickness, various sizes behave differently. The results from these theoretical experiments give indications for the explanation of previous results...|$|R
40|$|Three recent global {{economic}} trends are shifting forest livelihoods and ‘development’ intervention in Mozambique. These trends are China’s growing influence in Africa, large–scale land grabbing {{and climate change}} politics. Based on eighteen months of mixed–methods research between 2009 and 2011, this dissertation examines the interactions of these global trends with day–to–day social, political and ecological processes in two rural communities in Zambézia Province (central Mozambique) —one in the miombo woodlands of Maganja da Costa district and the other near expanding timber plantations in Gurué district. The community in Maganja da Costa {{is at the center}} of clashes between conservation groups and illegal loggers selling precious hardwoods to China. The community in Gurué is responding to a Presidential mandate for every local leader to establish ‘forests’ (predominantly exotic monocultures) that represent a dispersed form of land grabbing. Drawing on recent agendas within the field of feminist political ecology, the author highlights key encounters or ‘place–events’ (following Doreen Massey) that explain the complex historical, political and ecological dynamics shaping contemporary forest transformation in Zambézia. These place–events can only be understood through attention to bodies and identity performance, key sites where assemblages of power and meaning are enacted and negotiated. This approach provides insight into less visible dimensions of landscape change by moving beyond commodity chain analysis and local/national/global hierarchies of causality. Examples of place–events examined include: girls becoming women through scarification with battery acid in a forest grove; men singing about their boss’ wife as they haul timber; NGO staff <b>distributing</b> pesticide <b>spray</b> information pamphlets in an anti–malaria campaign and elite women beating their husbands for planting ‘government’ trees. Attention to bodily performances that fundamentally constitute these place–events demonstrates how interventions in the name of sustainable development play out and often fail. It also elucidates how some loggers are able to extract valuable timber more than others. In fact, local community members see all of these outsiders—despite their distinct ideologies—as equally foreign based on similar ‘outsider’ bodily comportment. Such embodied dynamics are political and cultural, and they should be a key concern for anyone involved in shaping the future of Mozambique’s forests. 10000 - 01 - 0...|$|R

METHODS: An airbrush device (Baxter) was used to spray both human expanded osteoarthritic chondrocytes and choncrocytes with their pericellular matrix (chondrons) at 1 × 10 (6) cells/ml fibrin glue (Tissucol, Baxter) in vitro. Depth-dependent cell viability was assessed for both methods with confocal microscopy. Constructs were cultured for 21 days to assess matrix production. A controlled human cadaveric study (n = 8) was performed to test the feasibility of the procedure in which defects were filled with either arthroscopic airbrushing or needle extrusion. All knees were subjected to 60 min of continuous passive motion and scored on outline attachment and defect filling. RESULTS: Spraying both chondrocytes and chondrons in fibrin glue resulted in a homogenous cell distribution throughout the scaffold. No difference in viability or matrix production between application methods was found nor between chondrons and chondrocytes. The cadaveric study revealed that airbrushing was highly feasible, and that defect filling through needle extrusion was more difficult to perform based on fibrin glue adhesion and gravity-induced seepage. Defect outline and coverage scores were consistently higher for extrusion, albeit not statistically significant.

40|$|Abstract Background Schistosomiasis japonica, {{caused by}} contact with Schistosoma japonicum cercaria-infested water when washing, bathing or production, remains a major public-health concern in China. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of a suspension concentrate of niclosamide (SCN) on killing cercaria of S. japonicum that float on the water surface, and its toxicity to fish, so as to establish an emergency-treatment intervention for rapidly killing cercaria and eliminating water infectivity. Results At 30 min after spraying 100 mg/L SCN, with niclosamide dosages of 0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 03, 0. 04 g/m 2, the water infectivity reduced significantly and no infectivity was found at 60 min after spraying SCN. The surface of static water was sprayed with 100 mg/L SCN, the peak concentration was found at 0 min, and the solution diffused to site with a water depth of 10 cm after 10 min. 30 min later, SCN diffused to the whole water body, and <b>distributed</b> evenly.

40|$|A {{visualization}} {{system is}} being developed out {{of the need to}} monitor, interpret, and make decisions based on the information from several thousand sensors during experimental testing to facilitate development and validation of structural health monitoring algorithms. As an added benefit the system will enable complete real-time sensor assessment of complex test specimens. Complex structural specimens are routinely tested that have hundreds or thousands of sensors. During a test, it is impossible for a single researcher to effectively monitor all the sensors and subsequently interesting phenomena occur that are not recognized until post-test analysis. The ability to detect and alert the researcher to these unexpected phenomena as the test progresses will significantly enhance the understanding and utilization of complex test articles. Utilization is increased by the ability to halt a test when the health monitoring algorithm response is not satisfactory or when an unexpected phenomenon occurs, enabling focused investigation potentially through the installation of additional sensors. Often if the test continues, structural changes make it impossible to reproduce the conditions that exhibited the phenomena. The prohibitive time and costs associated with fabrication, sensoring, and subsequent testing of additional test articles generally makes it impossible to further investigate the phenomena. A scalable architecture is described to address the complex computational demands of structural health monitoring algorithm development and laboratory experimental test monitoring. The researcher monitors the test using a photographic quality 3 D graphical model with actual sensor locations identified. In addition, researchers can quickly activate plots displaying time or load versus selected sensor response along with the expected values and predefined limits. The architecture has several key features. First, <b>distributed</b> <b>dissimilar</b> computers may be seamlessly integrated into the information flow. Second, virtual sensors may be defined that are complex functions of existing sensors or other virtual sensors. Virtual sensors represent a calculated value not directly measured by particular physical instrument. They can be used, for example, to represent the maximum difference in a range of sensors or the calculated buckling load based on the current strains. Third, the architecture enables autonomous response to preconceived events, where by the system can be configured to suspend or abort a test if a failure is detected in the load introduction system. Fourth, the architecture is designed to allow cooperative monitoring and control of the test progression from multiple stations both remote and local to the test system. To illustrate the architecture, a preliminary implementation is described monitoring the Stitched Composite Wing recently tested at LaRC...|$|R
