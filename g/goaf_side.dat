30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Fig.  9 {{that there}} were rupture-dilative rock areas along the {{goaf-side}} direction of the retained roadway which was bounded by rupture line, that was the fracture stable development zone defined in previous section. The overlying strata caving form in goaf under the retained roadway was similar to that of open-off cut on the <b>goaf</b> <b>side.</b> The roof periodic caving phenomenon did exist in both directions of the working face. Roof on the <b>goaf</b> <b>side</b> under the retained roadway broke in the form of “cantilever” and layered caving. The cantilever breaking point acted as a rotation axis of the overlying strata. Due to differences in the physical, mechanical and geometric parameters, the breaking period of the overlying strata varies, resulting in the formation of a stable structure of fracture development, and this structure can’t be compacted because of lateral stability region balanced action. The fracture closure zone exists in the middle of goaf. The fracture stable development zone {{is on the side of}} retained roadway. A fan-shaped fracture region is formed in this area (or “O” ring), which is also gas accumulation area.|$|E
30|$|These {{results suggest}} that, the roof on the <b>goaf</b> <b>side</b> of the {{retained}} roadway broke {{in the form}} of “cantilever” because of the support of filling wall. The unanchored end of the cantilever was in upper direction and on the outer side of filling wall. There wasn’t significant deformation and failure in the roof of the retained roadway, indicating that the filling wall could ensure the stability of a retained roadway. In inclination direction, the “arch-in-arch” structure space–time evolution existed in the pillarless mining. The initial caving arch and periodic caving arch constituted the lower arch, the overlying fracture zone and bending zone made up the upper arch, the lower arch was contained within the upper arch, and the upper arch expanded constantly in the longitudinal and vertical directions in which the lower arch moved forward at the same time.|$|E
40|$|Goaf-side entry {{driving in}} {{underground}} coal mines could greatly improve coal recovery rates. However, {{it becomes more}} difficult to maintain stability, especially in deep coal mines. Pillar width plays {{a pivotal role in}} the stability of goaf-side entry driving. To obtain a reasonable and appropriate narrow pillar width, theoretical calculations of the widths of mining-damaged zone and limit equilibrium zone in the pillar are derived according to limit equilibrium theory. Based on the stability issues of goaf-side entry driving in the first island longwall coal face (LCF) at a depth of 800 m below the surface in Guqiao Coal Mine in China, a numerical model is established by FLAC software to analyze the stability of the surrounding rock of goaf-side entry driving during excavation, using various coal pillar widths and support schemes. The results obtained from theoretical calculations, numerical simulation, and engineering practice indicate that an 8 -m-wide coal pillar is relatively reasonable, appropriate, and feasible. Field measurements show that deformations of the surrounding rock could be efficiently controlled 31 days after the support schemes were implemented in goaf-side entry driving with an 8 -m-wide narrow pillar along the adjacent <b>goaf</b> <b>side</b> with a compaction duration of 10 months. The mining influence range of the overlying LCF on the stability of goaf-side entry driving is found to be the area from 50 m ahead of the LCF to 70 m behind the LCF as it passes over the measurement point...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The roof side broken brings serious {{security}} {{risks in}} the construction in coal mine. The geological structure of faults and folds that encountered in coal mine and the affect of abutment pressure in the <b>goaf</b> creat roof <b>side</b> broken. If {{in the way of}} reinforced support to control the surrounding rock, it is difficult to achieve the expected security. Especially if the roof side broken appears in the mining gateway, controlling the surrounding rock by the way of reinforced support causes waste of materials and the supporting effect is limited. So, combined with the distribution of abutment pressure of the surrounding rock in broken roadway, starting from the nature change of the surrounding rock, through injection of Malisan to change the broken condition of surrounding rock, the broken roadway is effectively. under control. Abutment Pressure Distribution of the Surrounding Rock in Broken Roadway The surrounding rock broken is caused by the geological structure, also caused by the abutment pressure in mining. The abutment pressure produces mainly in the island coal face. Under normal circumstances, island face support pressure distribution is similar to the shape of a saddle. Because of the superposition of abutment pressure caused by mining and this abutment pressure, there is a large pressure concentration area in the side of rock body of the working face roof, and the are...|$|R
40|$|The first mining of a {{protective}} coal seam through ascending stress-relief mining {{is one of}} the most effective techniques for eliminating the risk of coal and gas outburst during the exploitation of multiple coal seams containing high rich gas. However, the difficulty of controlling roadway stability in the upper protected coal seam above the goaf increases greatly after ascending mining. Based on the geological conditions in Guqiao Coal Mine in China, a numerical simulation model is established by means of Itasca 2 ̆ 7 s Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) software in order to analyze the influence of the ascending mining on the stress distribution of the overlying rock strata and the stability of the roadway with different support parameters in the upper protected coal seam. The results show the impact scopes of stress relief and concentration zones in the overlying rock strata are up to approximately 100 m and 90 m above the goaf. The vertical stress, plastic zone and displacements in one sidewall of the roadway in the upper protected coal seam are bigger than that of the other sidewall close to the underlying <b>goaf</b> <b>side.</b> However, the stability of the roadways can be improved efficiently by using the appropriate support scheme including high strength and pre-stressed thread steel bolt support combined with pre-stressed cables. Field measurements indicate that the displacements of the surrounding rock could be controlled efficiently in 41 days when the roadway is excavated in the upper protected coal seam above the goaf with a compaction duration of 150 days...|$|E
