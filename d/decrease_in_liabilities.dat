Although longevity risk is traditionally viewed as unhedgeable, a market for mortality-linked derivatives is developing since the early 2000 s. In this thesis I forecast mortality rates with the well-known Lee-Carter model. With these forecasts I price longevity index swaps using Monte Carlo simulations and the equivalent utility pricing principle. In order to hedge against longevity risk with the longevity index swaps I use a static approach. I analyse in what matter hedging longevity risk influences a stylised market value balance sheet for Nationale-Nederlanden under the Solvency II regulations. I find that the solvency capital requirements and the risk margin on the market value balance sheet decrease if longevity risk is hedged. The hedging costs involved are lower than the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities,</b> i. e. longevity index swaps provide...|$|E

Merger is a merger of two or more companies that then there is only one surviving company, while another company was dissolved. Merger objectives used in this research is the company's growth, synergy, and market share. While financial performance is measured using the financial ratios: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Debt to Equity Ratio, and Total Asset Turnover. The data used in this research is secondary data. The object of this research is PT Kalbe Farma Tbk, which merged with PT Dankos Laboratories Tbk and PT Enseval in 2005. Data analysis methods used is trend analysis. The research result shows that with merger, PT Kalbe Farma Tbk can growth through an increase in assets, equity, and profit, as well as a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities.</b> PT Kalbe Farma Tbk not obtain synergies, but the market share of PT Kalbe Farma Tbk is increase.

2500|$|In an {{accounting}} sense, assets are recorded on the left-hand side (debit) of asset accounts, {{because they are}} typically shown on the left-hand side of the accounting equation (A=L+SE/OE).

The Cost Estimation Model is a tool {{that can be used to}} calculate the costs of waste management at LANL for the aforementioned waste types, under several different scenarios. Each waste category at LANL is managed in a separate fashion, according to Department of Energy requirements and state and federal regulations. The cost of the waste management process for each waste category has not previously been well documented. In particular, the costs associated with the handling, treatment and storage of the waste have not been well understood. It is anticipated that greater knowledge of these costs will encourage waste generators at the Laboratory to apply waste minimization techniques to current operations. Expected benefits of waste minimization are a reduction <b>in</b> waste volume, <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> and lower waste management costs...|$|R
40|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that {{financial}} satisfaction is, among other domains, an important determinant of overall individual wellbeing. Contrary to the common belief that financial satisfaction mainly depends on an individual's income, evidence for the U. S. indicates that life course financial satisfaction steadily increases from the thirties onwards, whereas life course income shows an inverted U-pattern with a peak at midlife. To judge from other studies in the U. S. and Norway, this pattern for financial satisfaction is not unique. The aim of the present analysis is to explore the determinants of this life course financial satisfaction pattern, taking into account not only income but also the possible impact of assets and liabilities. The analysis suggests that while income has the expected positive relation, increasing financial satisfaction at older age can be partly explained by <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities</b> and increases <b>in</b> financial assets, and that assets and liabilities considered separately provide a better explanation than net wealth. In addition, reduction in the dependency burden at old age leads to increased financial satisfaction while the deterioration of health has a negative impact. The data are from the second and third waves of the U. S. National Survey of Families and Households...|$|R
25|$|Before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), {{a defined}} benefit plan {{maintained}} a funding standard account, which was charged {{annually for the}} cost of benefits earned during the year and credited for employer contributions. Increases <b>in</b> the plan's <b>liabilities</b> due to benefit improvements, changes in actuarial assumptions, and any other reasons were amortized and charged to the account; <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> the plan's <b>liabilities</b> were amortized and credited to the account. Every year, the employer was required to contribute the amount necessary to keep the funding standard account from falling below $0 at year-end.|$|R
2500|$|The PPA has {{different}} funding requirements for multiemployer pension plans, which preserve {{most of the}} pre-PPA funding rules, including the funding standard account. Under PPA, increases and <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> the plan's <b>liabilities</b> are amortized, but the amortization period for benefit improvements adopted after 2007 are shortened. As with single-employer plans, multiemployer pension plans that are significantly underfunded are subject to restrictions. The restrictions, which may limit the plan's ability to improve benefits or require the plan to reduce employees' benefits, vary depending whether a pension plan's funding status is termed [...] "endangered", [...] "seriously endangered", or [...] "critical". The restrictions accompanying each deficient funding status are progressively more severe as funding status worsens.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThe three {{essays in}} this {{dissertation}} share in common {{an attempt to}} study the effect on subjective well-being of psychological processes along with objective conditions traditionally emphasized in economics.; Do people adapt rapidly and completely to marriage as {{a recent study of}} German data concludes? I analyze the role of adaptation ­ i. e whether people fairly quickly revert to their previous level of well-being ­ following the formation of partnerships using the German Socio-Economic Panel. On average, marriage has a lasting impact on life satisfaction, equal in magnitude to the effect of cohabitation prior to marriage. The findings do not support the popular notion in psychology that individuals always revert to a set level of happiness no matter how life circumstances change.; Does financial satisfaction only depend on income? In the second essay, I explore the determinants of financial satisfaction, including not only income but also the impact of assets and liabilities. Financial satisfaction steadily increases over the life cycle, whereas household income shows an inverted U-pattern with a peak at midlife. While income has the expected positive relation, increasing financial satisfaction at older age can be partly explained by <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> <b>liabilities</b> and increases <b>in</b> financial assets. In addition, reduction in the dependency burden at old age leads to increased financial satisfaction while the deterioration of health has a negative impact.; Is adaptation different with regard to economic and non-economic circumstances? In thelast essay I analyze differences in the life cycle patterns of aspirations and attainments in the pecuniary and non-pecuniary domains. Pecuniary aspirations ­ i. e. aspirations for material goods continue to increase over the life course, whereas non pecuniary aspirations ­ i. e. aspirations for family, work and health ­ remain constant or decline. The implication is that the steady increase in pecuniary aspirations can undermine the pursuit of happiness. In contrast, aspirations with regards to marriage do not increase; a finding which supports the results of the first essay that marriage has a lasting effect on well-being. The empirical analysis is based on responses to Roper surveys on the "good life"...|$|R
50|$|The {{reference}} to “contractual term” {{requires that the}} model incorporates the effect of vesting on the valuation. As above, option holders may not exercise their option prior to their vesting date, and during this time the option is effectively European in style. “Blackout periods”, similarly, requires that the model recognizes that the option may not be exercised during the quarter (or other period) preceding the release of financial results (or other corporate event), when employees would be precluded from trade in company securities; see Insider trading. During other times, exercise would be allowed, and the option is effectively American there. Given this pattern, the ESO, in total, is therefore a Bermudan option. Note that employees leaving the company prior to vesting will forfeit unvested options, which results <b>in</b> a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the company's <b>liability</b> here, and this too must {{be incorporated into the}} valuation.|$|R

25|$|On revaluation, the {{multiplier}} is adjusted so {{that the}} overall increase <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> across {{the country is in}} line with the Retail Prices Index, a measure of inflation. A property whose rateable value changes exactly in line with the national average would see an inflation-only rise <b>in</b> <b>liability.</b> Conversely, properties with unusually large changes in rateable value would have a significant change <b>in</b> <b>liability.</b> To smooth these jumps <b>in</b> <b>liability,</b> schemes of transitional relief have been applied to each rating list. These operate by restricting the proportion by which liability may change per year, both upwards and downwards. The 1990 and 1995 transitional relief schemes required funding from the Treasury, while the 2000 list scheme was designed to be revenue-neutral over the lifetime of the list, albeit with Treasury funding at the beginning. The Local Government Act 2003 required that all revaluations in England feature a revenue-neutral scheme, beginning with the 2005 rating list. Transitional relief applies only to changes <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> between rating lists, not changes within lists. For example, under the 2005 transitional relief scheme in England, if a rateable value had risen by 20%, the rise <b>in</b> <b>liability</b> would be restricted to 12.5% in the first year, 17.5% in the second year, and the full 20% in the third year (different restrictions would apply for a small business). Transitional relief schemes have been applied to the 1990, 1995, and 2000 rating lists in England and Wales, and to the 2005 rating list in England.|$|R
