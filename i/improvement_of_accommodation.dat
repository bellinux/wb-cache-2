A campaign for the remodelling of licensed premises spread through the state, resulting in the <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> offered by both country and city hotels. Typical hotel layouts included a bar (or multiple bars), cold rooms and storage, lounges and parlours, dining room and kitchen on the ground floor, with bedrooms, lounge and shared guest bathroom facilities on the first floor. Large function spaces were made possible by the use of folding doors or partitions between the lounge and dining rooms, and separate entrances for guests and bar patrons continued to be a requirement. The Commission insisted on the provision of services such as running water to all bars and bedrooms, hot and cold if possible.|$|E

Thus, realizing {{the importance of}} human-centred trait, a long-term plan that {{is led by the}} Construction Industry Development Board Malaysia (CIDB) has been designed to improve accommodation and facilities of workers at construction site. In conjunction to that, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards Malaysia (SIRIM) has developed Malaysia Standard (MS 2593 : 2015) as the guideline for <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and facilities for workers which is able to contribute to the achievement of the target in the Construction Industry Transformation Programme (CITP). However, a phenomenon that is centred on the level of itscorroboration compared with other similar guidelines has been voiced by some practitioners of construction, especially when the guideline are likely to be the basis of a new related act. Therefore, based on MS 2593 : 2015, this introductory research is conducted to qualitatively analyse the corroborative level of the guideline compared to its counterpart guidelines. By using a comprehensive document analysis method which anchored to frequency approach and assisted by NVivo v. 8 software, the report found out that the Malaysia-based guideline is on par to the restwith some introduction of new variables (especially towards leisure and social aspects). Thus, further research on gauging industry’s willingness and existing compliance rates is deemed appropriate in order to inculcate positive impacts towards the objectives of MS 2593 : 2015, and subsequently contributes to the formation of the forthcoming corresponding act...|$|E
40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Any school that denies that intercultural and interracial differences exist and that lacks effective accommodation strategies for all its learners could thwart learners ' feelings of truly belonging to the school. This could leave them feeling like outsiders — an experience that could {{have a negative impact}} on their school careers and future lives. This article investigates, from an educational psychological frame of reference, the situation of black 1 Grade 9 learners in historically white suburban schools as learners in transition between two worlds, with specific reference to the individual, family and school/cultural dimensions. An in-depth look into the life-worlds of a group of such learners was obtained by means of a literature study, questionnaires and individual interviews. To ensure a holistic perspective on problems and possible solutions, an 18 -factor culture general framework was used as a basis and applied to the South African situation. The study found that black Grade 9 learners attending historically white suburban schools faced difficult scholastic, social and emotional challenges. These included dealing with high scholastic demands whilst lacking the required educational background as well as financial, social and environmental resources; coping with or antipathy towards the Afrikaans language; a perceived "differentness " in habits and appearance and especially coming to terms with their experience of racism in school. Learners ' strengths were also highlighted. The <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> strategies by the school to promote multicultural and anti-racist harmony in schools is discussed.

We combined layers of ferrite+cerium oxide with YBCO to see their effect both on the structure of the YBCO and on flux pinning. The deposition temperature of the ferrite greatly affects its structure and also the saturation magnetization. Combined with YBCO, the magnetic layer distorts the structure of YBCO, although, for example, the critical temperature remains rather unchanged. According to the structural results achieved here, the magnetic pinning layer is best positioned on the top of YBCO. This way, an improvement in Jc(B) is seen in all the field range, and also, a clear <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>accommodation</b> field was measured.

He opened information bureaux in all of New Zealand's major cities. He encouraged the development of tourist attractions and businesses, most notably in Rotorua, improved the government owned spas and health resorts, and oversaw the establishment of the scenic reserve network. The health resorts owned by the Government, such as Rotorua, Hanmer Springs and Te Aroha, were transferred to the Department's control when it was created in 1901. Others were added or purchased during the following few years. By 1906 there were 17 reserves under control of the Department.

Pond-produced shrimps, however, do not always accord to the intention of cold storage companies at expected price. The companies even sometimes reject the request due to poor quality of the product. The decreasing shrimp quality may be due to maintenance process by the pond farmers as well as the improper collectors. In the other hand, importing countries have decided more and more restricted requirements for the imported fishing products. This study was held in Muara Jawa, Anggana, and Muara Badak Districts using techniques of data collection of in-depth interview with twelve respondents.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of tourism on demand of hotel room type and its tariff. In addition, tourists’ behaviours were observed to understand demand of hotel room type because they contribute to the development of hotel industry. Four main factors were chosen as the main factors before choosing a hotel that are price, location, facility and accessibility. These factors were analyse using two methods that are descriptive analysis and multidimensional scalling analysis. The result of this analysis showed that tourist chose 2 - star hotels and below as their preferred accommodation. Apart from that, this research further analyse hotel room tariff for the hotel type that was chosen by tourists using simple linear regression. This is useful as a simple guideline for hotel industry. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved...|$|R
