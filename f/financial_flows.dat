5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and <b>financial</b> <b>flows,</b> from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} {{presentation}} a modern axiomatic approach to financial arithmetic. At the first, the axiomatic financial arithmetic theory was proposed by Peccati who has introduced the axiomatic definition of the future value. This theory has been extensively developed in past years. Proposed approach to financial arithmetic is based on the <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> utility concept. This utility function is defined as linear extension of multicriteria comparison determined by the time preference and the capital preference. Then the present value is equal to <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> utility. Therefore, the law of diminishing marginal wealth utility has been considered as additional feature of the present value. The future value is defined as the inverse of utility function. This definition is a generalization of the Peccati one. The net present value is given as the unique additive extension of <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> utility. Moreover, the synergy effect and the diversification effect will be discussed. At the end, the axiomatic present value definition will be specified in three ways...|$|R

Since 1991, the government has followed a programme of economic liberalisation and stabilisation by removing exchange controls, floating the exchange rate, cutting tariffs, stabilising the Jamaican currency, reducing inflation and removing restrictions on foreign investment. Emphasis {{has been placed on}} maintaining strict fiscal discipline, greater openness to trade and <b>financial</b> <b>flows,</b> market liberalisation and reduction in the size of government. During this period, a large share of the economy was returned to private sector ownership through divestment and privatisation programmes.|$|E

High Reynolds number leads to a chaotic regime transition only in frame of strange attractor model.|$|E

If the tax is generally applied at high rates, it will severely impair financial operations and create international liquidity problems, especially if derivatives are taxed as well." [...] However, on 16 June 1995 Spahn suggested that [...] "Most of the difficulties of the Tobin tax could be resolved, possibly with a two-tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax and an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates." [...] This new form of tax, the Spahn tax, was later approved by the Belgian Federal Parliament in 2004.|$|E

Traditionally waqf (sichan in Chinese) and haiwande system are the two major financial resources for maintaining the madrasa education in Yunnan. Based on the field research which was conducted in Yongjian town in Dali Bai Autonomous prefecture, this paper shows how those two systems work among the Chinese Muslims. The difference between waqf and haiwande system can be paraphrases as the difference between community and network. While the <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> from the waqf is basically based on each village community, the <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> from the haiwande system can be far beyond the village boundary. Finally this paper indicated the importance to investigate the historical interaction between the nation building process and the local madrasa education...|$|R

40|$|Logistics’ {{contribution}} to corporate performance has increased over recent years, particularly due to supply chain innovations. Opposed to common innovations {{focusing on the}} improvement of product or information flow, supply chain finance (SCF) targets the <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> and allows buying firms and their suppliers to improve working capital and reduce costs. However, the adoption process of SCF is complex and rather unexplored in academia. This article provides an early step in building knowledge about SCF and in particular how firms adopt SCF, why they adopt differently, and what role suppliers play in the adoption process. The objective was therefore {{to close the gap}} between our knowledge on product and information flow oriented innovations and <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> innovations along the supply chain, namely SCF. For this explorative research, we opted for an inductive multiple case study approach with six European firms. Based on our findings, four sets of propositions are posited and an extended SCF adoption framework is proposed revolving around the interrelated adoption processes of buying firms and their corresponding supplier bases...|$|R

50|$|The {{opening of}} a {{financial}} account of the balance of payments has been important during the last decade.

Moreover, holding reserves, {{as a consequence of}} the increasing of <b>financial</b> <b>flows,</b> is known as Guidotti-Greenspan rule that states a country should hold liquid reserves equal to their foreign liabilities coming due within a year. For example, international wholesale financing relied more on Korean banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, when the Korean Won depreciated strongly, because the Korean banks' ratio of short-term external debt to reserves was close to 100%, which exacerbated the perception of vulnerability.|$|E
