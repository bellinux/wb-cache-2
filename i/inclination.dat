5|$|The <b>inclination</b> {{distribution}} of Jupiter-family (or ecliptic) comets would become broader {{under the influence}} of Planet Nine. Jupiter-family comets originate primarily from the scattering objects, trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes that vary over time due to distant encounters with Neptune. In a model including Planet Nine, the scattering objects that reach large semi-major axes dynamically interact with Planet Nine, increasing their inclinations. As a result, the population of the scattering objects, and the population of comets derived from it, is left with a broader <b>inclination</b> distribution. This <b>inclination</b> distribution is broader than is observed, in contrast to a five-planet Nice model without a Planet Nine that can closely match the observed <b>inclination</b> distribution.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the <b>inclination</b> of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the <b>inclination</b> of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E

In order to prime their approach or avoidance motivational orientations, participants watched brief videos, the content of which (positive or negative depictions of alcohol, or neutral) varied by experimental group. Immediately after watching the videos, participants completed self-report (Approach and Avoidance of Alcohol Questionnaire; all studies) and implicit (visual probe task in study 1, stimulus-response compatibility task in studies 2 and 3) measures of alcohol-related approach and avoidance. In study 3, we incorporated an additional experimental manipulation of thought suppression {{in an attempt to}} maximize the influence of the videos on implicit measures. Findings were consistent across all three studies: increases in self-reported approach <b>inclinations</b> were mirrored by decreases in avoidance <b>inclinations,</b> and vice versa. However, a combined analysis of data from all studies demonstrated that changes in approach <b>inclinations</b> were partially independent of changes in avoidance <b>inclinations.</b> There were no effects on implicit alcohol-related processing biases, although methodological issues may partially account for these findings.

40|$|Aims and Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess crown angulations, crown <b>inclinations,</b> and tooth size {{discrepancy}} in a sample population from Davangere, South India. Materials and Methods: One hundred adults (50 male and 50 female) of age 18 - 30 years, with Angle′s class I ideal occlusion and balanced profiles, were selected for the study. Study models were prepared and crown angulations and crown <b>inclinations</b> were measured using a customized protractor device. Bolton′s analysis was used to measure the tooth size discrepancies. Results: Maxillary and mandibular teeth had less crown angulations. Maxillary and mandibular incisors and maxillary molars showed increased crown <b>inclinations,</b> whereas mandibular molars and premolars had less crown <b>inclinations</b> than the original Andrews sample. The mean maxillary and mandibular tooth size ratios, overall and anterior, were similar to Bolton′s ratios.

We deny the presupposition: We say that whether or not they should, they do not. 6 In section 1, we distinguish between something being evidence and its playing an evidential-role.

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the <b>inclination</b> of the orbit, which in general is unknown.
