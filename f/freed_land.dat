40|$|The {{continued}} {{removal of}} human resource {{from the rural}} areas through migration has consequences for the agricultural sector. This study profiled the socio-economic characteristics of male migrants and examined {{their views on the}} possible problems created by migrating from rural communities and the benefits they expect would accrue to the communities. A total of 120 respondents were randomly selected from 4 major parks in Akinyele Local Government Area of Ibadan, Oyo-State. These were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The items for the perceptions were rated on a 5 -point Likert scale; respondents were classified based on age and year of migration while the data collected were analyzed using simple descriptive methods and non-parametric techniques. The results showed that migrants perceived increased food prices {{as a direct result of}} migration and they try to cushion its effect by seeking output markets and improved inputs for the farmers back home. The mean score obtained for test statements showed that they significantly influenced migrants’ perceptions and decisions. The older but recently migrated migrants considered migration as being beneficial to farming because it <b>freed</b> <b>land</b> for others to use. Also, by living in urban areas, they earned enough money and now remit money back home for farm labor expenses. Young and recent migrants saw market creation as an advantage of migration. The young and early migrants perceived the mis-use of subsidized inputs on the farm as a negative effect of migration. The study shows that migrant’s views vary but it also suggests that migrants to urban centers could be key in introducing innovative ideas in agricultural practices and agribusiness development to rural sectors...|$|E

40|$|The Devonian Period was {{characterized}} by major changes in both the terrestrial biosphere, e. g. the evolution of trees and seed plants {{and the appearance of}} multi-storied forests, and in the marine biosphere, e. g. an extended biotic crisis that decimated tropical marine benthos, especially the stromatoporoid-tabulate coral reef community. Teleconnections between these terrestrial and marine events are poorly understood, but a key may lie in the role of soils as a geochemical interface between the lithosphere and atmosphere/hydrosphere, and the role of land plants in mediating weathering processes at this interface. The effectiveness of terrestrial floras in weathering was significantly enhanced as a consequence of increases in the size and geographic extent of vascular land plants during the Devonian. In this regard, the most important palaeobotanical innovations were (1) arborescence (tree stature), which increased maximum depths of root penetration and rhizoturbation, and (2) the seed habit, which <b>freed</b> <b>land</b> plants from reproductive dependence on moist lowland habitats and allowed colonization of drier upland and primary successional areas. These developments resulted in a transient intensification of pedogenesis (soil formation) and to large increases in the thickness and areal extent of soils. Enhanced chemical weathering may have led to increased riverine nutrient fluxes that promoted development of eutrophic conditions in epicontinental seaways, resulting in algal blooms, widespread bottomwater anoxia, and high sedimentary organic carbon fluxes. Long-term effects included drawdown of atmospheric pCO 2 and global cooling, leading to a brief Late Devonian glaciation, which set the stage for icehouse conditions during the Permo-Carboniferous. This model provides a framework for understanding links between early land plant evolution and coeval marine anoxic and biotic events, but further testing of Devonian terrestrial-marine teleconnections is needed...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} small towns in the Great Plains have {{recently}} started to offer <b>free</b> <b>land</b> and other incentives to entice new residents {{in the hope of}} reversing persistent depopulation. Based on in-depth interviews, this study assesses the initial performance of the <b>free</b> <b>land</b> programs in six small towns in central Kansas and analyzes the factors that have affected the migration decisions of the new residents. The initial results of these programs have been impressive. Not only have they attracted multiple new residents and increased enrollments in local schools, but they have also elevated long-time residents 2 ̆ 7 pride in their community and created a positive synergy. The new residents 2 ̆ 7 migration decisions were influenced by a number of push and pull factors. The <b>free</b> <b>land</b> and other incentives are not enough to trigger migration, but they have effectively changed some migrants 2 ̆ 7 destination choice to a small town in central Kansas. Without the <b>free</b> <b>land,</b> most new residents, particularly those from out of state, would not have moved there. Contrary to our expectations, the relative locations of small towns with respect to larger cities do not appear to have affected new residents 2 ̆ 7 destination choice...|$|R
