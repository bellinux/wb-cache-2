25|$|Brainard & Doupe (2000) posit a {{model in}} which LMAN (of the {{anterior}} forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard & Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led {{to the loss of}} song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been <b>deafened</b> led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in <b>deafened</b> birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).|$|E

During the battle on April 7, supported dismounted infantry {{with a pair of}} M1A1 Abrams, and turning onto a narrow street, he opened his hatch for better visibility despite the constant RPG-7 attacks. He was wounded in action in an ambush when a rocket propelled grenade struck him in the head. Blinded and <b>deafened,</b> he struggled to maintain consciousness until his tank was moved out of danger, then was evacuated to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. After a prolonged stay, he was sent back to the United States, ultimately losing his right eye (due to damage to the optic nerve) and hearing in his right ear. At Naval Medical Center San Diego, some of the vision in his remaining left eye was restored by the hospital’s medical professionals, while his ocular prosthesis features the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor instead of a pupil. On November 10, 2005, he was awarded the Silver Star for actions in combat. and medically retired at the rank of Gunnery Sergeant on April 22.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hijackers}} noticed the airstars moving towards them, they {{recognised}} the imminent assault. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, {{it became apparent}} that it was elevated too much higher than the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to the an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs. After a short delay in re positioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets. The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft. Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin. The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and <b>deafened</b> occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage. The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Through a window, Borderie jumped out of the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers {{in the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|E

40|$|In animal {{models of}} deafness, {{administration}} of an aminoglycoside {{in combination with}} a loop diuretic is often applied to produce a rapid loss of cochlear hair cells. However, {{the extent to which}} surviving hair cells remain functional after such a <b>deafening</b> procedure varies. In a longitudinal electrocochleographical study, we investigated the variability of cochlear function between and within guinea pigs after combined administration of kanamycin and furosemide. Concurrently, histological data were obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after <b>deafening</b> treatment. The main measures in our study were compound action potential (CAP) thresholds, percentage of surviving hair cells and packing density of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs). One day after <b>deafening</b> treatment, we found threshold shifts widely varying among animals from 0 to 100 dB. The variability decreased after 2 days, and in 18 out of 20 animals threshold shifts greater than 55 dB were found 4 - 7 days after <b>deafening.</b> Remarkably, in the majority of animals, thresholds decreased by up to 25 dB after 7 days indicating functional recovery. As expected, final thresholds were negatively correlated to the percentage of surviving hair cells. Notably, the percentage of surviving hair cells might be predicted on the basis of thresholds observed one day after <b>deafening.</b> SGC packing density, which rapidly decreased with the period after <b>deafening</b> treatment and correlated to the percentage of surviving inner hair cells, was not a determining factor for the CAP thresholds...|$|R

2500|$|Early {{experiments}} by Thorpe in 1954 {{showed the}} importance of a bird being able to hear a tutor's song. When birds are raised in isolation, away from the influence of conspecific males, they still sing. While the song they produce, called [...] "isolate song", resembles the song of a wild bird, it shows distinctly different characteristics from the wild song and lacks its complexity. The importance of the bird being able to hear itself sing in the sensorimotor period was later discovered by Konishi. Birds <b>deafened</b> before the song-crystallization period went on to produce songs that were distinctly different from the wild type and isolate song. Since the emergence of these findings, investigators have been searching for the neural pathways that facilitate sensory/sensorimotor learning and mediating the matching of the bird's own song with the memorized song template.|$|E

Darkness gathers around, far distant thunder rolls over the trembling hills; the black clouds with august majesty and power, moves slowly forwards, shading regions of towering hills, and threatening all the destructions of a thunderstorm; all around is now still as death, not a whisper is heard, but a total inactivity and silence seems to pervade the earth; the birds afraid to utter a chirrup, and in low tremulous voices take leave of each other, seeking covert and safety; every insect is silenced, and nothing heard but the roaring of the approaching hurricane; the mighty cloud now expands its sable wings, extending from North to South, and is driven irresistibly {{on by the}} tumultuous winds, spreading his livid wings around the gloomy concave, armed with terrors of thunder and fiery shafts of lightning; now the lofty forests bend low beneath its fury, their limbs and wavy boughs are tossed about and catch hold of each other; the mountains tremble and seem to reel about, and the ancient hills to be shaken to their foundations: the furious storm sweeps along, smoaking through the vale and over the resounding hills; {{the face of the}} earth is obscured by the deluge descending from the firmament, and I am <b>deafened</b> by the din of thunder; the tempestuous scene damps my spirits, and my horse sinks under me at the tremendous peals, as I hasten for the plain." ...|$|E
