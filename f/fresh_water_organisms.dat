This material shows broad absorbance in the visible light spectra. Light sensitive fucoxanthin pigment of diatoms that contain hydroxyl (âOH) groups, play a vital role in the formation of silver cluster {{on the surface of}} diatom cells and its growth process. Involvement of the compounds and proteins of the diatoms which are responsible for reduction of metal ions and stabilization of the grown nanoparticles on diatom cells, are confirmed by FTIR analysis. Investigations are done to see if the synthesized samples acted as sensing material in the fabrication of a room temperature sensor of dissolved ammonia. With increase in ammonia concentration the visible light absorption peaks tend to higher intensity with blue shift due to the formation of [Ag(NH 3) 2]+ complexes causing repulsion between the Ag nanoparticles and consequently lead to the formation of smaller Ag nanoparticles. The intensity of absorption of the as-synthesized material is linearly correlated with the concentration of dissolved ammonia as observed from 0 to 100 ppm. The use of naturally occurring diatoms for Ag nanoparticles synthesis has the benefits of amenability for large-scale easy production. Also the experimental findings indicate that the as-synthesized material can act as fast and reliable sensing material. Keywords: Diatoms, Fucoxanthin, Silver nanoparticles, Ammonia senso...|$|R

50|$|Methylobacillus is a {{group of}} methylotrophic aerobic bacteria, and they can be found in large numbers in marine and <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> ecosystems.

According to Bonnie et al., methane gas is far more efficient at absorbing infrared radiation than carbon dioxide gas, and “the concentration of methane has been increasing at an alarming rate of 1% per year for the last 150 year to 200 years.” The role that these methylotrophs play in carbon cycling may help us understand, and eventually combat global warming.

40|$|The role of land {{plants in}} {{establishing}} our present day atmosphere is analysed. Before {{the evolution of}} land plants, photosynthesis by marine and <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>organisms</b> was not intensive enough to deplete CO 2 from the atmosphere, the concentration of which {{was more than the}} order of magnitude higher than present. With the appearance of land plants, the exudation of organic acids by roots, following respiratory and photorespiratory metabolism, led to phosphate weathering from rocks thus increasing aquatic productivity. Weathering also replaced silicates by carbonates, thus decreasing the atmospheric CO 2 concentration. As a result of both intensive photosynthesis and weathering, CO 2 was depleted from the atmosphere down to low values approaching the compensation point of land plants. During the same time period, the atmospheric O 2 concentration increased to maximum levels about 300 million years ago (Permo-Carboniferous boundary), establishing an O 2 /CO 2 ratio above 1000. At this point, land plant productivity and weathering strongly decreased, exerting negative feedback on aquatic productivity. Increased CO 2 concentrations were triggered by asteroid impacts and volcanic activity and in the Mesozoic era could be related to the gymnosperm flora with lower metabolic and weathering rates. A high O 2 /CO 2 ratio is metabolically linked to the formation of citrate and oxalate, the main factors causing weathering, and to the production of reactiv...|$|E

For <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>organisms,</b> more than 90 % of them are captive bred, but over 90 % of commercial marine organisms are wild-caught. Wild-caught organisms come mainly from coral reefs and adjacent areas. Destructive collection techniques, such as cyanide, quinaldine, even dynamite or explosives, are commonly used. These techniques not only affect the target fi sh but causes terrible damages to the ecosystems and the reef habitat itself, as well as coral and crustacean bleaching. This damage has not been assessed globally, but locally, where populations have been overharvested; it has created environmental imbalances due to the selective fi sheries focused on a few species, sexes or ages with high market value. A number of measures can be taken {{in order to reduce}} the environmental damage.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carassius auratus {{placed in}} a dilute sodium {{chloride}} solution (400 gM) is able to absorb sodium and chloride ions at very different rates, or to absorb one ion and to lose the other. This is the case not only for fish which have been previously kept in choline chloride or sodium sulfate solutions or deionized water, in order to stimulate their absorption processes, but also in control fish which have not been deprived of sodium or chloride. The absorption of sodium or chloride appears to be unaffected {{by the presence of}} a nonpermeant co-ion such as choline or sulfate. Conductivity measurements of the external medium show that during ion uptake the conductivity is constant or increases slowly. This suggests the existence of exchange processes between the ions absorbed and endogenous ions excreted. It is unlikely that potassium or calcium is exchanged for sodium, because of the low permeability of the gills to these ions. Finally, the flux ratios observed for both sodium and chloride ions in the present investigation can only be explained, in relation to their electrochemical gradients across the gills, in terms of active transport. <b>Fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>organisms</b> maintain a concentration gradient between the electrolytes of their internal medium and those of their very dilute external medium. Invertebrates, fish, and amphibians have been the objects of numerous investigations designed to elucidate the processes by which they maintain this gradient.

Despite the experimental biases that have limited the analytical performance of ISEs through apparently high detection limits and modest selectivities, there has been a plethora of research in the application of ISEs in the monitoring of environmentally important trace metals and anions in natural waters and soils. Most popular has been the analysis of free metals in natural waters, as this parameter is known to be a master variable in the uptake and toxicology of trace metals on aquatic biota reflecting the bioavailability of trace metals in the environment. Furthermore, as copper is a major trace metal in coastal waters due to its extensive use in antifouling paints on sea vessels and structures, there are many reports in the literature {{on the use of the}} copper ISE in assays of either free copper or the copper complexing capacity of natural waters and soil peats. Moreover, there have been a variety of studies showing a strong correlation between free copper levels and the toxicity of copper on a variety of marine and <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>organisms.</b> Nevertheless, there are numerous reports in the literature that have used ISEs to monitor important anions such as fluoride, phosphate, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, chloride, cyanide, etc., as well as other important cations such as ammonium and chromium(VI) in waste and natural waters. In conclusion, this review will present new and interesting perspectives on the application of ISEs in environmental analysis using approaches such as real-time remote monitoring of water quality, shipboard monitoring of environmentally important analytes using flow analysis instrumentation, the use of robust all-solid-state ISEs in submersible instruments for long-term deployment in the field, and innovative analytical approaches such as backside calibration and switchtrodes that avoid standard addition analysis and the concomitant perturbation in analyte speciation in natural samples...|$|E
