40|$|Urban {{drainage}} is one {{of basic}} facilities and infrastructure of a town which is cincidered quite important. Agood city needs to consider {{the condition of the}} drainage system, because if a settlement is flooded, it will greatly impact the lives of the city. Buildings will be easily damage, environments will be unhealthy and settlements will turn into slumps. The case of flooding is not only in big cities but also emerged in the town of Semarapura that extents only, 5, 151 km 2. From the conditions on ground, puddles can still be found in some locations, so based on the fact it is necessary to issue reviewing Semarapura drainage system to improve the drainage system in the region. The study in this research has the sense of a systematic search of the drainage problems from an investigation in order to get treatment effort. The approach applied in this research was exploratory and descriptive analytical approach. Data were collected through questionnaires an in-depth interviewers with selected agencies using purposive sampling method. Data analysis was perfomed by descriptive qualitative using likert scale to measure the attidudes, opinions and perceptions of tge performance of the drainage system. The analysis was performed with the aids of SPSS version 20. 0, through several stage of the test process to the data sample. The result of the study showed that the influence of the level of maintenance operation, technical management and overall was high at 93, 5 % with the regression equation Y = - 4. 874 + 0. 405 X 1 + 0. 228 X 2 + 0. 089 X 3 and the remaining 6. 5 % was influenced by other <b>factors.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> {{it can be seen that}} the maintenance operations were more dominantly affected on the performance of the drainage system in Semarapura town District of klungkung compared with management and technical.

We present theoretical arguments supported by numerical data of high precision and find scaling laws as {{function of the}} porosity. For the channel openings we observe a crossover to a highly correlated regime at small porosities. The distribution of velocities through these channels scales with {{the square of the}} porosity. The fluxes {{turn out to be the}} convolution of velocity and channel width corrected by a geometrical factor. Furthermore, while the distribution of velocities follows a Gaussian, the fluxes are distributed according to a stretched exponential with exponent 1 / 2.
