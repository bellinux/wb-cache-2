25|$|There were {{different}} artists who collaborated {{in this project}} especially inside the theater. Located at the main lobby were sculptures of Adam and Eve done by Francesco Riccardo Monti,who resided in Manila from 1930 up to his death in 1958. Isabelo Tampingco, a Filipino artist designed the Philippine plant-themed carvings in the interior spaces including the lobby while National Artist Fernando Amorsolo painted the murals The Dance and The History of Music located {{at the ends of}} the balcony. The grillwork on small balconies looking out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> was exceptionally elegant transitions from Art Nouveau to Art Deco, expressed by Lourdes Montinola in her book. The two black posts {{at the bottom of the}} staircases were decorated with glass mosaic tiles.|$|E
500|$|Thunderbirds Are Go was {{screened}} for United Artists executives {{to a positive}} response before receiving its premiere at the London Pavilion in Piccadilly on 12 December 1966. Opening at a gala for the Barnardo's Charity, several crew and actors were in attendance, including Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Grade, Cliff Richard and his sister Donella and The Shadows. The exterior of the Pavilion, adorned with neon and representations of the Thunderbird machines, led <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> in which puppets and models from the film had been put on display, with publicity posters promising audiences [...] "The Most Advanced Spacecraft Ever Created" [...] and stipulating that [...] "Adults Should Be Accompanied By Children". The Band of the Royal Marines provided a rendition of the [...] "Thunderbirds March" [...] {{both before and after}} the screening.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 McTell's 'Walk <b>Into</b> <b>The</b> Morning' {{tour was}} a sellout success, {{creating}} such long queues {{to talk to}} him at his customary 'meet and greet' sessions after concerts, that he was forced to announce in June 2006 that he would no longer be coming out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyers</b> after shows to chat with fans.|$|R
50|$|Five sets of {{entrance}} doors lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vestibule, {{decorated with}} pilasters. Three sets of doors with wrought-iron bars and cast-iron handles lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> double-height <b>foyer</b> with galleries on three sides. <b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> has a coffered ceiling, a large central chandelier, four smaller ones and six pairs of wall lights, all in Gothic style. On the far side, a grand staircase {{leads to the}} galleries and the balcony seating area. The back wall is entirely panelled with gilded frames with rounded and pointed arches. The four outer bays are decorated with figures painted in Italian Renaissance style, probably by Vladmir Polunin (1880-1957).|$|R
2500|$|The flat-room {{section was}} further divided <b>into</b> two sections, <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> on <b>the</b> west side, and {{a suite of}} rooms to the east. [...] When the attic was used for {{ordinance}} work, they were used as a pantry, wardrobe and storage rooms. The area was illuminated by six windows along <b>the</b> <b>foyer's</b> west wall. Outside windows also provided light along {{the north and south}} sides. The roof had four octagonal skylight windows to provide light to the interior rooms, in addition to a twenty-foot arched window.|$|R

60|$|The little party {{left the}} {{restaurant}} {{a few minutes}} later on their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> for coffee. The Princess contrived to pass out with Forrest as her companion.|$|E

6000|$|A man slouched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lofty <b>foyer</b> of <b>the</b> Hotel Voltaire {{and paused}} uncertainly, as if {{awed by the}} splendor of the place. A boy in uniform hastened to relieve him of his hand baggage, which {{consisted}} of a [...] "roll-me-up" [...] or [...] "carryall" [...] of brown canvas, strapped around the middle, such as one often sees in traveling on the Continent. It seemed a much used and abused affair and painted upon the ends were the dimmed initials: [...] "J. J." ...|$|R
50|$|Entry to {{the temple}} is through the Baba Kharak Singh Marg (Road). The {{approach}} is {{through a set of}} marble steps from the road level leading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main <b>foyer</b> of <b>the</b> temple through massive silver-plated doors, which are engraved with scenes of the epic Ramayana story. <b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> is ventilated with clerestory windows that are adorned with paintings of Hanuman in the cardinal directions depicting his four aspects. Below each Hanuman painting, the full text of Tulsidas’s Sundar Kand is inscribed on the marble tablets affixed on the walls. The Sanctum Sanctorum, which houses the Hanuman idol, is on the north wall {{on the right side of}} <b>the</b> entry <b>foyer</b> (pictured), with <b>the</b> idol facing the southern direction in a small bas-relief carving (pictured). Images of Radha and Krishna, a central triumvirate of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita are also installed to the right of the Hanuman idol on the same wall.|$|R
50|$|Two {{concrete}} columns with minimalist, stylised capitals {{frame the}} entrance from <b>the</b> stairwell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first floor <b>foyer.</b> This room has a terrazzo floor, rendered walls, and a flat plaster ceiling with moulded plaster cornice. A reception window is framed with clear finished timber {{and the room}} is hung with clear finished timber honour boards {{some of which are}} memorials to past students, teachers, and local citizens.|$|R
6000|$|... "Baron," [...] Bernadine said suavely, linking his {{arm through}} the other man's as they passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> [...] "there are times when candour even amongst enemies becomes an admirable quality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} {{wonderful}} place," [...] {{the doctor}} admitted. [...] "We had luncheon, my friend and I, in the grillroom, but we came {{for a few minutes}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> to watch the people from the restaurant." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{took their}} leave, and Jocelyn Thew, {{almost as though}} against his will, walked back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> {{after a few minutes}} of hesitation, and sat there twirling the rose between his fingers, with his eyes fixed upon the {{interior}} of the restaurant. He had the air of one waiting.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Wimperis, Simpson and Guthrie; interior partly by Serge Chermayeff, with interior bronze friezes by sculptor Anthony Gibbons Grinling. The theatre is built in steel and concrete and is notable for its elegant and clean lines of design. The theatre was refurbished in 1950—the original gold and silver décor was painted over in red, and candelabras and chandeliers were added. In 1987, in order to restore the original décor, the theatre was once again refurbished, this time by Carl Toms. The theatre has a circular entrance foyer, with Grinling's bronze frieze depicting nude figures in exercise poses, <b>the</b> theme continues <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main <b>foyer,</b> with dancing nudes, marble pilaster up lighters and concealed lighting.|$|R
50|$|The {{coffee shop}} has recent {{fittings}} and furnishings, although {{sections of the}} Art Deco-style cornice here appear to be original fabric. Closest to the street are two simple rectangular openings, while the opening closest to <b>the</b> grand <b>foyer</b> has a timber frame and semi-circular fanlight with frosted glass lights. Two openings nearest the Mall have been in-filled during the 1979-1980 renovation. The lift and main staircase to the upper floors of the Regent Building are accessed through {{the rear of the}} coffee shop and sit in the eastern corner of this part of the building. At {{the far end of the}} entrance hall, a set of marble steps spanning its full width lead up to a landing enclosed by three sets of original double doors opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>foyer.</b> Two handrails made of copper with brass divide <b>the</b> stair <b>into</b> three. <b>The</b> double doors are made from timber and have full-height glass lights and chrome fittings. The threshold is polished granite.|$|R
5000|$|Like the exterior, the {{interior}} also reflects the Classical Revival style. The main entrance was relocated {{to the basement}} level to accommodate everyone regardless of disability. <b>The</b> entrance opens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main <b>foyer,</b> which contains <b>the</b> original gold, black, and white speckled terrazzo flooring framed by a base of red Verona marble. The grand staircase is composed of Napoleon gray marble treads and buff-colored marble risers. The balustrade is made of cast iron and features vine-like curved scrolls with floral accents, fitted between bands of floral discs and squares. A mural is located above the lower stairs and portrays pioneers and a blacksmith. It is possibly a Works Project Administration commission. [...] A plaster coffered ceiling completes the entrance hall.|$|R
60|$|Deyes {{bowed and}} turned away. The room now was almost in darkness, {{and the people}} were {{streaming}} out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer.</b> Macheson paid the bill and followed {{in the wake of}} the others. Seeing him approach alone, Wilhelmina welcomed him with a smile, and drew her skirts on one side to make room for him to sit down. He glanced doubtfully around. She raised her eyebrows.|$|E
60|$|Edith {{slipped out}} of her evening cloak and came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> of the Opera House, a spotless vision of white. For a moment {{she looked at her}} {{cavalier}} in something like amazement. It did not need the red handkerchief, a corner of which was creeping out from behind his waistcoat, to convince her that some extraordinary change had taken place in Burton. He was looking pale and confused, and his quiet naturalness of manner had altogether disappeared. He came towards her awkwardly, swinging a pair of white kid gloves in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|Jacob {{had endured}} a cheap {{dinner at a}} popular {{restaurant}} and circle seats at a music hall with uncomplaining good humour, but the evening, if anything, had increased his depression. He wandered {{into one of the}} clubs of which he was a member, only to find there was not a soul there whom he had ever seen before in his life. He came out within half an hour, but a spirit of unrest had seized him. Instead of going up to his rooms, he wandered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> of the great hotel, in the private part of which his suite was situated, and watched the people coming out from supper. Again, as he sat alone, he was conscious of that feeling of isolation. Every man seemed to be accompanied by a woman who for the moment, at any rate, was content to give her whole attention to the task of entertaining her companion. There were little parties, older people some of them, but always with that connecting link of friendship and good-fellowship. Jacob sat grimly back in the shadows and watched. Perhaps it would have been better, he thought, if he had remained a poor traveller. He would have found some little, hardly used, teashop waitress, or perhaps the daughter of one of his customers, or a little shopgirl whom he had hustled in the Tube,--some one whose life might have touched his and brought into it the genial flavour of companionship. As it was-- ...|$|E
50|$|The {{two levels}} of the gallery {{open to the public}} are linked by a pair of cast {{concrete}} staircases. These staircases, and lavatories at an intermediate level, are accommodated in a concrete box in between the eastern and western parts of the indoor galleries. One of these staircases also runs down to street level with access (now emergency only) to Belvedere Road; the other extends down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> private entrance <b>foyer,</b> at lower level, {{on the north side of}} the building. This almost hidden private entrance is located below <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> and external walkway on the north facade, above the car park and near the overhanging Purcell Room auditorium. The screens advertising the British Film Institute and Museum of the Moving Image which enclosed the car park by the central access road were removed in 2008, giving a more open feel to the ground level area at the west end.|$|R
50|$|As a whole, the {{interior}} was remarkably demonstrative of the early 1970s, {{the period in which}} the cinema was refurbished as a twin complex. <b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> is stepped, not unlike the grand picture palaces of the interwar period where entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cinema was staged to heighten the experience of arrival. <b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> had upper and lower areas with a consistent decorative scheme throughout. The cinemas were located above <b>the</b> <b>foyers</b> and are arranged back-to-back with a shared projection room between them.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> has {{a marble}} tiled floor which {{continues}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lounge and dining rooms and borders the carpeted stair. <b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> and stair walls are panelled with timber veneer to first floor height and <b>the</b> door <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen has a glass porthole. The entrance door has a sandblasted panel with the inscription CHATEAU NOUS, and all doors and architraves are stained timber with chrome door hardware.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the curtain}} had fallen upon {{the first act}} of [...] "Don Giovanni" [...] he turned round in his place to observe the house. Presently, {{in one of the}} boxes, he {{perceived}} Urbain de Bellegarde and his wife. The little marquise was sweeping the house very busily with a glass, and Newman, supposing that she saw him, determined to go and bid her good evening. M. de Bellegarde was leaning against a column, motionless, looking straight in front of him, with one hand in the breast of his white waistcoat and the other resting his hat on his thigh. Newman was about to leave his place when he noticed in that obscure region devoted to the small boxes which in France are called, not inaptly, [...] "bathing-tubs," [...] a face which even the dim light and the distance could not make wholly indistinct. It was the face of a young and pretty woman, and it was surmounted with a coiffure of pink roses and diamonds. This person was looking round the house, and her fan was moving to and fro with the most practiced grace; when she lowered it, Newman perceived a pair of plump white shoulders and the edge of a rose-colored dress. Beside her, very close to the shoulders and talking, apparently with an earnestness which it pleased her scantily to heed, sat {{a young man with a}} red face and a very low shirt-collar. A moment's gazing left Newman with no doubts; the pretty young woman was Noemie Nioche. He looked hard into the depths of the box, thinking her father might perhaps be in attendance, but from what he could see the young man's eloquence had no other auditor. Newman at last made his way out, and in doing so he passed beneath the baignoire of Mademoiselle Noemie. She saw him as he approached and gave him a nod and smile which seemed meant as an assurance that she was still a good-natured girl, in spite of her enviable rise in the world. Newman passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> and walked through it. Suddenly he paused in front of a gentleman seated on one of the divans. The gentleman's elbows were on his knees; he was leaning forward and staring at the pavement, lost apparently in meditations of a somewhat gloomy cast. But in spite of his bent head Newman recognized him, and in a moment sat down beside him. Then the gentleman looked up and displayed the expressive countenance of Valentin de Bellegarde.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the church}} is a 2.6-metre tall statue of Christ by Jan Znoj, which is {{surrounded}} by earthenware reliefs of the apostles and Czech heroes of the Reformation. The reliefs continue <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> where {{there is also a}} statue of Bishop Jan Blahoslav by the sculptor František Bílek. The sculptural decorations are by Jaroslav Horejc.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} opens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> {{which has an}} intact interior featuring a decorative plaster ceiling and cornice, polished timber floors and timber joinery including wall and counter panelling with inlaid timber detailing, a main stair, reception area and early furniture. The public bar, adjacent private bar and the main lounge open off the foyer.|$|E
50|$|The main {{change to}} the {{building}} is that <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> has been expanded and pushed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> auditorium, s. This space has a low, false ceiling of acoustic tiles, and the floor, which was formerly raked {{and part of the}} auditorium, has been raised and levelled. A ticket box and candy-bar are located on the western side of <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> and there are toilets on the eastern side. The auditorium is accessed from doorways at either side of the rear wall of <b>the</b> <b>foyer.</b> Above <b>the</b> renovated <b>foyer</b> is <b>the</b> projection booth, which is the original bio-box, accessed from steep, narrow timber stairs behind the ticket box on the western side, and near the men's toilets on the eastern side.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>foyer</b> {{has three}} bars; <b>the</b> Penderyn Awen <b>Foyer</b> Bar on level 2, <b>the</b> Horizons <b>Foyer</b> Bar on level 4, and <b>the</b> Stones <b>Foyer</b> Bar on level 5. ffresh {{restaurant}} is also situated in <b>the</b> <b>foyer,</b> along with Crema, {{which is a}} coffee shop, Hufen, which is an Ice cream parlour and One, which is a wine bar. Free performances also take place during the day in <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> on <b>the</b> Glanfa Stage.|$|R
50|$|The theatre is {{organised}} {{around the}} central auditorium, with flanking sides accommodating {{a restaurant and}} toilets to the north; and a cafe, commercial kitchen, organ room and storage to the south. <b>The</b> small <b>foyer</b> has a plain battened fibreboard ceiling sloping towards the auditorium and accommodates a recently fitted bar and ticket booth. It opens to the sides to the restaurant and cafe. A timber framed partition lined with fibreboard separates <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> and auditorium. A dress circle sits above <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> and is reached {{by a set of}} timber stairs {{to the left of the}} doorway from <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> auditorium. The dress circle has a sloping timber floor and accommodates several rows of moveable seats. The bio-box standing to the rear of the dress circle is newly lined with plasterboard and accommodates the electronic console controlling the film projection.|$|R
50|$|Those in the {{orchestra}} section exited <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> {{and out of the}} front door, but those in the dress circle and gallery who escaped the fireball could not reach the foyer because the iron grates that barred the stairways were still in place. The largest death toll was at the base of these stairways, where hundreds of people were trampled, crushed, or asphyxiated.|$|E
50|$|Enables {{a player}} to create a secret passage. After playing the card, the player puts one of the plastic secret passage doors in the room (s)he is {{currently}} in, and then places another secret passage door and his/her pawn into another room. One restriction is that a secret passage door cannot be put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foyer.</b> And secondly, a player with a claimed treasure chest cannot move though a secret passage.|$|E
50|$|Exterior Openings - The {{exterior}} doors into the house, a double {{door in the}} front and single door in the back, were now through the foyer. The original room 1 door facing the north was closed in and replaced by a window identical to the one used in the new room 2 windows. An interior door was cut through the massive beams in the west wall of room 1 for passage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} an Australian {{architect}} called Mr Smith working for the Watkins Partnership in Bristol. The most striking feature is the fin structure (to {{the left of the}} frontage) that spreads upwards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air above the cinema. The size of this fin runs about 23 feet <b>into</b> <b>the</b> building, (about the depth of <b>the</b> <b>foyer).</b> Originally, there was a glass lit central feature rising the full height and according to the plan had the words [...] "cinema & café" [...] detailed into it. This feature today has been boxed over.Inside, <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> executes a visual trick. The auditorium is set at a different angle to the façade by roughly 25 degrees. By creating a circular <b>foyer</b> <b>the</b> architect has disguised this fact, as without obvious side and back walls the patrons were unlikely to notice the change in direction. From <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> were doors to a small lounge (off to the left - originally they had gold coloured rattan chairs and glass topped rattan tables) and stairs to the café, above <b>the</b> <b>foyer.</b> Light gained entry to the café by the large windows running across the frontage, the kitchen was placed under the large fin structure with a single window beyond the fin.|$|R
50|$|A base of dark glazed bricks {{runs the}} length of the structure, its {{horizontal}} line enhanced by a corrugated iron awning with wooden supports and diagonal metal bracing which shelters the railway siding and loading bays, some of which are arched. An unusual feature of this store are double doors which slide <b>into</b> <b>the</b> brick walls, their width determined by the size of a wool bale. A decoratively moulded central doorway leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main entrance <b>foyer</b> and offices which are timber panelled. A large passenger lift complemented by a modern timber staircase provides access to the next level. As usual for woolstores built before the First World War, the hardwood upper floors are supported by massive timber posts and braced by herring-boned struts, while the ground floor is concrete.|$|R
50|$|The {{hall was}} re-roofed in 1975, and a damp course {{inserted}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main building in 1976. The facades were cleaned in 1978, and <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> and {{interior of the}} hall have been remodelled.|$|R
