60|$|He {{found that}} the point {{selected}} {{for the establishment of}} the fort was a plain of sand, on which little herbage of any kind grew. In rear of the house there was a belt of stunted bushes, which, as he went onward into the interior, became a wood of stunted firs. This seemed to grow a little more dense farther inland, and finally terminated {{at the base of the}} distant and rugged mountains of the interior. In fact, he found that he was established on a sandbank which had either been thrown up by the sea, or at no very remote period had formed part of its bed. Returning home so as to enter by the front door, he observed an enclosed space a few hundred yards distant from the fort. Curious to know what it was, he walked up to it, and, looking over the stockade, beheld numerous little mounds of sand with wooden crosses at the head of them. It was the burial-ground of the <b>establishment.</b> <b>Trade</b> had been carried on here by a few adventurous white men before the fort was built. Some of their number having died, a space had been enclosed as a burying-ground. The Roman Catholic Indians afterwards used it, and it was eventually consecrated with much ceremony by a priest.|$|E

50|$|The unrest {{began with}} a series of student {{occupation}} protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism and traditional institutions, values and order. It then spread to factories with strikes involving 11 million workers, more than 22% of the total population of France at the time, for two continuous weeks. The movement was characterized by its spontaneous and de-centralized wildcat disposition; this created contrast and sometimes even conflict between itself and the <b>establishment,</b> <b>trade</b> unions and workers' parties. It was the largest general strike ever attempted in France, and the first nationwide wildcat general strike.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the analytical implications of service-sector liberalization, and in particular the role of market structure in transport services. We focus here explicitly on cross-border trade in services, and the interaction of international trade with market structure and public regulation. Of course, in many ways the insights from the theoretical literature on international trade apply equally to goods and services. This is particularly true for cross-border trade. There are, however, some important differences. One is the role of which has important analytical implications. The significance of proximity for service transactions means that 'trade' in the case of services often requires a mix of cross-border transactions and local establishment (i. e., FDI). The importance of trade through affiliates is illustrated, for the case of the United States. The United States is the leading service exporter, with $ 245. 7 billion in 1998. The level of U. S. service sales through affiliates (<b>establishment</b> <b>trade)</b> is comparable. Establishment sales amounted to $ 258 billion in 1997, which compares to $ 240 billion in direct exports...|$|E

40|$|Trade {{unions have}} been in {{existence}} for many years. Although their introduction was generally met with resistance, since their <b>establishment</b> <b>trade</b> unions have been important agents of social change worldwide. Over the years, trade unions {{have been in}}volved in politics and other societal activities. In South Africa, trade unions for many years not only fought for worker’s rights within the workplace but also beyond the workplace. Trade unions started as friendly societies aimed at assisting their members with various matters, including offering financial help for education purposes and also in cases of illnesses. Although the main purpose of trade unions is to regulate relations between employees and their employers, trade unions perform other functions in society which can be broadly referred to as their social responsibility role. Unlike corporate social responsibility, which is recognised and formalised, trade union social responsibility is not, with the role and importance of social responsibility for trade unions having been largely ignored. This thesis aims at changing this by investigating their core responsibilities and their social responsibilities and subsequently making recommendations on how trade unions could recognise and accommodate their social responsibilities in their activities. It also considers factors that could assist trade unions in fulfilling their social responsibilities. Trade unions generally obtain legislative support for their core responsibilities, but not their social responsibilities; however this should not obstruct trade unions in such endeavours. As modern organisations it is high time that trade unions make a contribution towards sustainable development through their social responsibility role. Private LawLL...|$|E
