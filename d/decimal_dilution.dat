40|$|Fixed {{strains of}} {{neurotropic}} viruses {{are characterized by}} relative inabifity to enter {{the central nervous system}} after peripheral inoculation. In previous communications (1) it was emphasized that a fixed strain of equine encephalomyelitis virus had very weak invasive powers when injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The incidence of infection after intramuscular inoculation could be sharply increased by the injection of 50 per cent glycerine intraperitoneally in adequate amounts (1). The present paper attempts to determine under what conditions this phenomenon is operative, whether it can be produced by other agents, and to gain some suggestions as to the mechanism involved. Methods In the present study the same strain of fixed E. E. virus used previously was employed.

40|$|Most {{probable}} number (MPN) and colony-forming-unit (CFU) {{estimates of}} fecal coliform bacteria concentration are common measures of water quality in coastal shellfish harvesting and recreational waters. Estimating procedures for MPN and CFU have intrinsic variability and {{are subject to}} additional uncertainty arising from minor variations in experimental protocol. It has been observed empirically that the standard multiple-tube fermentation (MTF) <b>decimal</b> <b>dilution</b> analysis MPN procedure is more variable than the membrane filtration CFU procedure, and that MTFderived MPN estimates are somewhat higher on average than CFU estimates, on split samples from the same water bodies. We construct a probabilistic model that provides a clear theoretical explanation for the variability in, and discrepancy between, MPN and CFU measurements. We then compare our model to water quality samples analyzed using both MPN and CFU procedures, and find that the (often large) observed differences between MPN and CFU values for the same water body are well within the ranges predicted by our probabilistic model. Our results indicate that MPN and CFU intra-sample variability does not stem from human error or laboratory procedure variability, but is instead a simple consequence of the probabilistic basis for calculating the MPN.

40|$|Aims: A {{laboratory}} assay for comparative {{characterization of}} various faecal matrices {{with respect to}} faecal indicator organism (FIO) release using, artificial rain water. Methods and Results: Fresh sheep and beef-cattle faeces, dairy cattle slurry and beef cattle farm yard manure (FYM) were collected from commercial units in south-west England and applied to 20 randomized 1 m 2 plots established on permanent grassland. Representative samples from each faecal matrix (n = 5) were collected on four occasions over 16 days. One gram of each sample was transferred to a sterile vial to which 9 ml of standard local rain was carefully pipetted. The vial was then rotated through 360 °, 20 times in 60 s to 'simulate' a standardized interaction of the faecal material with rainfall, providing an assay of comparative release potential. Appropriate <b>decimal</b> <b>dilutions</b> were prepared from the eluent. Following agitation, with a sterile spatula, the remaining faecal material and eluent in the vials were vortex mixed for 60 s before <b>decimal</b> <b>dilutions</b> were prepared from the resulting mixture, providing a quantitative assessment of the total FIO in the sample from which percentage release could be determined. Bacterial concentrations were enumerated in duplicate by membrane filtration following standard methods for FIO. Significant differences in release kinetics of Escherichia coli and enterococci {{from each of the}} faecal matrices were determined. Conclusions: Differences in release from each faecal substrate and between FIO type (E. coli and intestinal enterococci) were observed in this laboratory study. The order of release of E. coli from the faecal matrices (greatest to least, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total present) was dairy cattle slurry > beef cattle FYM > beef-cattle faeces > sheep faeces.

The UV transmission for homeopathic preparations of CuSO 4 preparations was significantly lower than in controls. The transmission seemed to be also lower for both SiO 2 and S, but not significant. The mean effect size (95 % confidence interval) was similar for the homeopathic preparations: CuSO 4 (pooled data) 0. 0544 % (0. 0260 – 0. 0827 %), SiO 2 0. 0323 % (– 0. 0064 % to 0. 0710 %) and S 0. 0281 % (– 0. 0520 % to 0. 1082 %).

40|$|Introduction: Oral Candidiasis is an opportunist fungal infection, {{with high}} {{incidence}} in HIV and immunosuppressed patients and Candida albicans {{is the most}} common causing agent. In some cases, it can evolve to resistant injuries to antifungal conventional therapy. According to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopeia (BHP) [1], biotherapic medicines are prepared from chemically undefined biological products. Biotherapics created by Brazilian doctor Roberto Costa (RC) have a different homeopathic compounding technique, as its dynamization starts from the ethiologic agent of the illness in its alive form, which present higher capability to stimulate the host immunological system [2, 3]. &# 13; &# 13; Aim: The goal of this study was evaluate the physical-chemical and microbiological stability of Candida albicans RC potencies under different conditions of storage. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: To prepare the biotherapics, one part of Candida albicans yeast suspension (109 cell/ml) was diluted in 9 parts of sterile distillated water. After preparing this 1 : 10 dilution, the sample was undergone 100 succussions, resulting in the first <b>decimal</b> <b>dilution</b> (1 x). Then, one part of this solution was diluted in 9 parts of sterile distillated water and submitted to 100 succussions, generating the 2 x. This process was successively repeated following BHP, until 30 x. Water 30 x was prepared by the same technique, as control. All the solutions were prepared in aseptic and sterile conditions. Biotherapics 6 x, 12 x, 18 x, 24 x, 30 x and water 30 x were storage under refrigeration (2 to 8 Ã‚Â°C) and at room temperate (25 Ã‚Â°C) during 8 weeks. Every 15 days, the following parameters were analyzed: pH, electrical conductivity, UV absorbance (260 and 280 nm). Microbiological analyses were performed after 3 weeks by colony forming unit (CFU) method [4]. &# 13; &# 13; Results: The preliminary analyses performed at times zero, 15, 30 and 45 days suggest that electrical conductivity of these solutions tend to increase proportionally to storage time without significant differences due to temperature storage conditions. There was no statistically significant difference detected in pH values. Measures of absorbance of different biotherapic potencies under both conditions of storage are in course. Microbiological analyses showed no colony growth, but in the 1 x sample analyzed at time zero, indicating the viability of the fungus. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: Further experiments are being carried out in order to confirm the preliminary data obtained...|$|E
40|$|Strict and facultative culturable {{anaerobic}} bacteria {{from the}} digestive tract of six American black vultures (Coragyps atratus Bechstein 1793) were isolated and identified. After capture, the birds received a non-contaminated diet for one week to eliminate possible allochthonous microorganisms. Then, specimens collected from tongue, stomach and intestines were weighed, submitted to <b>decimal</b> <b>dilution</b> in an anaerobic chamber, inoculated into culture media and incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 37 ºC for enumeration, isolation and identification. Isolated bacteria were submitted to tests to detect possible antagonisms between them. The total bacterial population along {{the digestive tract}} ranged from 3. 46 ± 0. 39 log CFU/g in the stomach to 10. 75 ± 0. 37 log CFU/g in the distal intestine. Some bacteria were isolated {{for the first time}} from the digestive tract of C. atratus: Actinomyces bovis, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Micrococcus luteus, Neisseria sicca, Clostridium bifermentans, Enterobacter agglomerans, Peptostreptococcus sp., Sarcina sp., Serratia odorifera, and Shigella flexneri. Associations between microorganisms were observed during isolation on two occasions, one involving A. bovis and N. sicca, and the other involving A. bovis and a Gram-negative rod. Hetero-, iso- and autoantagonisms were observed, suggesting the ecological role of these indigenous microorganisms in terms of population auto-control and environmental barrier in the digestive tract of carrion-feeding birds. As bactérias anaeróbias estritas e facultativas cultiváveis do trato digestivo de seis urubus (Coragyps atratus Bechstein 1793) foram isoladas e identificadas. Após a captura, as aves receberam uma alimentação de baixa contaminação durante uma semana para eliminar possíveis microorganismos alóctonos. A seguir, amostras colhidas na língua, estomago e intestinos foram pesadas, submetidas a diluições decimais numa câmara anaeróbia, inoculadas em meios de cultura e incubadas em aerobiose e anaerobiose a 37 ºC para enumeração, isolamento e identificação. As bactérias isoladas foram usadas posteriormente como produtoras e reveladoras para detectar possíveis fenômenos de antagonismo. A população bacteriana total ao longo do trato digestivo variou de 3, 46 ± 0, 39 log UFC/g no estômago até 10, 75 ± 0, 37 log UFC/g no intestino distal. Algumas bactérias foram isoladas pela primeira vez do trato digestivo de C. atratus: Actinomyces bovis, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Micrococcus luteus, Neisseria sicca, Clostridium bifermentans, Enterobacter agglomerans, Peptostreptococcus sp., Sarcina sp., Serratia odorifera, and Shigella flexneri. Associações entre microorganismos foram observadas durante o isolamento em dois casos, um envolvendo A. bovis e N. sicca, e o outro envolvendo A. bovis e um bastonete Gram-negativo.

40|$|Escherichia coli, the {{preferred}} bacterial indicator for fecal pollution in fresh waters, does {{not conform to}} the concept of an indicator microorganism because it is rapidly killed or inactivated by seawater. This series of papers investigated the value of coliphage, a virus which infects E. coli, as an indicator of pollution in saline waters. In order to be an accurate indicator an organism must (1) be ubiquitous in wastewater, (2) survive and be detectable at least as long as the harmful organisms, and (3) be easy to isolate and identify. A review of the literature determined that coliphage were more resistant than the common bacterial indicators to physico-chemical factors such as inorganic ions, temperature, heavy metals, nutrients, and antibiotics. Coliphage correlation with their bacterial hosts and similarities in behavior to the pathogenic viruses make them both bacterial and viral indicators. Various culture media and host culture strains were investigated for maximum plaque forming unit (pfu) production. Two way analysis of variance showed that selection of a suitable host was of paramount importance. While selection of the culture medium was significant, it was of lesser importance. Host strain ATCC 13706 and tryptic soy agar gave the highest recovery of pfu 2 ̆ 7 s. One ml log phase E. coli host culture, five ml of water sample or dilution, and five ml of culture media (maintained at 44. 5 C) were combined in a sterile screw cap tube, mixed, poured into a sterile 100 X 15 mm petri dish, and incubated at 35 C. Plaque forming units were counted after 24 hrs. and expressed per 100 ml of sample. The method proved repeatable; the titer of frozen phage aliquots declined slightly over 77 days but, the slope of the trend was not significantly different from zero at the 0. 10 level (r = 0. 55). These repeated analyses were done with different batches of media and hosts and represent a test of total method repeatability. Bench studies utilizing a <b>decimal</b> <b>dilution</b> series of sewage contaminated freshwater and uncontaminated seawater showed that both coliform and coliphage closely follow a theoretical dilution curve immediately after dilution with seawater. However, coliform bacteria die off at a higher rate than coliphage at higher salinities over time. Field validation studies in fresh and brackish water (3 ̆c 10 3 ̆eppt) compared coliphage with total and fecal coliforms (n = 53) and gave correlation coefficients of 0. 98 and 0. 91 respectively. The regression equation for these samples was: log coliphage = 0. 983 (log total coliform) - 1. 001 The combined total coliform/coliphage relationship at 68 saltwater (3 ̆e 10 ppt) stations yielded a correlation coefficient of 0. 45. Coliphage are a logical choice for a fecal indicator in marine waters since their titers are closely related to total and fecal coliform in freshwater, survive much better than coliforms in seawater, and they can be enumerated by a simple method which is not subject to salinity artifacts. The constant relation of coliphage and coliforms in freshwater indicate a possible link to current water quality standards based on total or fecal coliforms. Since coliphage pfu are a rather constant 8 - 10...|$|E
40|$|A reverse {{transcription}} Linear-After-The-Exponential {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT LATE-PCR) assay was evaluated for detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). This pan-serotypic assay targets highly conserved sequences within the 3 D (RNA polymerase) region of the FMDV genome, and uses end-point hybridisation analysis of a single mismatch-tolerant low temperature probe to confirm {{the identity of the}} amplicons. An Armored RNA served as an internal control to validate virus negative results. The ability of the assay to identify FMDV was directly compared to a real-time RT-PCR assay routinely used by reference laboratories. The analytical sensitivity of the RT LATE-PCR assay was 10 genomic copies and the dynamic range of the test was identical to real-time RT-PCR based on <b>decimal</b> <b>dilutions</b> of an FMDV-positive sample. This pan-serotypic assay was able to detect FMDV in a broad range of clinical samples collected from field cases of FMD (n = 121), while samples of other viruses causing vesicular disease in livestock and genetic relatives of FMDV were negative. In addition to the laboratory-based utility of this diagnostic test, the RT LATE-PCR assay format has potential application for use in a portable ("point-of-care") device designed to achieve rapid detection of FMDV in the field...|$|R

Its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects have been proved, however there are no reports of activity on cell growth. Proliferation of MDBK (Madin Darby Bovine Kidney) cells was evaluated {{under the influence of}} different concentrations of Copaiba oleoresin. Control groups consisted of cells in medium without addition of oleoresin (M group) and cells in the medium with application of the solvent Tween 80 at dilution 10 - 3 (TM group). <b>Decimal</b> <b>dilutions</b> of 10 - 1 to 10 - 3 were shown to be toxic and, therefore, the proliferation studies were conducted from dilution 10 - 4 to 10 - 7. Cell growth was faster in all groups that received the Copaiba oleoresin dilutions in the first 24 hours, specially the 10 - 5 dilution group, which proliferation rate was 5, 47 higher than that of M group. It was concluded that Copaiba oleoresin stimulates cell multiplication, which may be one mechanism of its positive effect on wound healing, in association with those previously known...|$|R

This slurry formed a reference sample and {{was placed in}} sterilized jars, frozen, and used as needed throughout the experiments. A second slurry {{was prepared}} {{in a similar manner}} from a frozen beef pot pie and a chicken pot pie, and was used as a control in only one experiment.

The natural flora was found to exert an inhibitory effect upon the growth of the added microorganisms after incubation at 35 C for 18 hr. The inhibitory effect on growth was in part due to pH. The predominating organism isolated from the natural flora after incubation was a lactobacillus, which, when added in mixture with the test organisms in sterilized slurry, did not exert the profound inhibitory effect observed in the case of the natural flora.

40|$|Background: Since ancient times, {{preparations}} {{from traditional}} medicinal plants e. g. Arnica montana, Calendula officinalis or Hypericum perforatum {{have been used}} for different wound healing purposes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the efficacy of the commercial low dilution homeopathic remedy SimilasanÃ‚Â® Arnica plus Spray, a preparation of Arnica montana 4 x, Calendula officinalis 4 x, Hypericum perforatum 4 x and Symphytum officinale 6 x (0712 - 2) and medium diluted SIM WuS (Petroleum 15 x, Arnica montana 15 x, Calcium fluoratum 12 x, Calendula officinalis 12 x, Hepar sulfuris 12 x and Mercurius solubilis 15 x; 1101 - 4), on the wound healing in cultured NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Both remedies were from Similasan AG (Jonen, Switzerland) and prepared according the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP) following descriptions 4 a for arnica, 3 a for marigold and St. JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wort, 2 a for comfrey, 5 a for petroleum, and 6 for calcium fluoride, hepar sulfuris and mercurius solubilis. &# 13; Materials and Methods: Cell proliferation, migration and wound closure promoting effect of the preparations (0712 - 2, 1101 - 4) and their succussed solvents (0712 - 1, 1101 - 3) were investigated on mouse NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Cell viability was determined by WST- 1 assay, cell growth using BrdU uptake, cell migration by chemotaxis assay and wound closure by CytoSelect Ã¢â€žÂ¢Wound Healing Assay Kit which generated a defined wound area. All assays were performed in three independent controlled experiments. In some experiments diluted unsuccussed alcohol (0712 - 3) was also investigated. &# 13; Results: Preparations (0712 - 1), (0712 - 2), (0712 - 3), (1101 - 3) and (1101 - 4) were investigated at <b>decimal</b> <b>dilution</b> steps from 1 x to 4 x. Cell viabilty was not affected by any of the substances and (0712 - 1) and (0712 - 2) showed no stimulating effect on cell proliferation. Preparation (0712 - 2) exerted a stimulating effect on fibroblast migration (31. 7 %) vs 15 % with succussed solvent (0712 - 1) at 1 : 100 dilutions (p 0. 05). Positive control 2 ng/ml EGF increased migratory activity of cells by 49. 8 %. Preparation (0712 - 2) at a dilution of 1 : 100 promoted in vitro wound closure by 59. 5 % and differed significantly (p< 0. 001) from succussed solvent (0712 - 1), which caused 22. 1 % wound closure. Medium diluted remedy (1101 - 4) exerted accelerating effect on wound closure after 14 h of treatment. Wounded area was closed by 20 % with (1101 - 4) and 13 % by (1101 - 3) compared to untreated control. Succussed solvent (1101 - 3) caused about 23 % and the remedy (1101 - 4) about 30 % wound closure after 24 h. Remedy (1101 - 4) and succussed solvent (1101 - 3) modestly stimulated cell growth at dilutions 1 : 100 and 1 : 1000 by about 25 % and 15 %, respectively. No statistically significant differences between preparations 1101 - 3 and 1101 - 4 could be detected. &# 13; Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the SimilasanÃ‚Â® Arnica plus low dilution homeopathic remedy exerted wound healing potential, which is a result of increased ability of fibroblasts to migrate without affecting cell proliferation. Medium diluted preparation SIM WuS exerted stimulating effect on the wound closure accompanied by a cell proliferating effect. &# 13; Used in vitro wound closure test was sensitive enough for low dilutions preparation, however for medium diluted preparation despite of a trend, no significant differences could be detected...|$|E

A susceptible host, a cariogenic oral microflora(mainly mutans streptococci) and a suitable substrate are necessaryconditions for the development of caries. Chlorhexidine is one of themost effective antimicrobial agents available for dental use in reducing the proportion of some microorganisms, especially the mutansstreptococci. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare theeffectiveness of two manipulated forms of chlorhexidine 1 % (gel andtoothpaste) in reducing the salivary levels of mutans streptococci,which are used by schoolchildren in supervised toothbrushing, outsidethe dental clinic. Material and methods: The sample of 30 childrenwas divided into two groups: group A (toothpaste) and group B (gel). Applications were performed once a week for 4 weeks. Saliva sampleswere collected prior to the first brushing and 30 minutes after the last one. Serial <b>decimal</b> <b>dilutions</b> of saliva samples were prepared up to 10 - 3 dilution, and these samples were inoculated in Mitis Salivarius bacitracin sucrose agar, selective for growth of mutans streptococci.

40|$|DURAN-REYNALS (1940) was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the multiple haemorrhages that may occur when the Rous 1 sarcoma virus is injected into young chicks or embryos, and showed that this effect, which he called the " Haemorrhagic Disease " (H. D.), could occur independently {{and in the absence of}} sarcomatous induction (Milford and Duran-Reynals, 1943). This reaction has been used as a basis for assay of the virus (Borsos and Bang, 1957). Vigier (1954) showed that the MH 2 virus would produce H. D. in embryos, especially young ones inoculated with large doses of virus. The disease was attributed by Milford and Duran-Reynals (1943) to a necrotising action of the virus on the endothelial cells, and this aspect has been given prominence in many theoretical discussions on viruses as indicating a link between the necrotising viruses and those causing cell proliferation. The present study casts doubt upon this necrotising activity, and thus implies that this presumed linkage is not a valid concept. METHODS All fowls used were from the Brown Leghorn flock of the Centre, believed to be free from naturally-occurring neoplastic viruses. Many of the observations relate to titrations carried out by the method of Carr and Harris (1951) using <b>decimal</b> <b>dilutions</b> of virus inoculated into groups of young chicks.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} devoted to the production of bioethanol from lignocellulose, as cheap and abundant feedstock. The process requires a pretreatment of biomass, which may involve the formation of inhibitory compounds. Many works report on ethanol production from biomass hydrolysates, but only few focus on the selection of yeasts able to both tolerate inhibitors and ferment with high yield. In this work an isolation program from oenological environments (grape marcs) started in order to select new yeasts for the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Marcs were incubated with or without a cocktail of inhibitors at 30 and 40 °C. At regular intervals marcs were collected and, after appropriate <b>decimal</b> <b>dilutions,</b> plated on agar dishes with and without inhibitors. More than 500 strains were isolated and genetically identified by ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequencing. Much effort was spent to identify yeasts belonging to Saccharomyces cerevisae, the most promising candidate for bioethanol production. S. cerevisiae strains were screened for their ability to grow in industrial medium containing increasing inhibitors concentrations and few isolates showed high tolerance to organic acids and furans. This study will allow the selection of few yeast strains suitable for the production of bioethanol from different types of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. The inhibitors tolerance of selected yeasts may be further increased by molecular biology techniques...|$|R
40|$|The N-methylated {{resistance}} inducers act {{within two}} concentration ranges characterized by suppression of infection rates. Between these active ranges {{there is always}} an inactive range (5 - 7 <b>decimal</b> <b>dilutions)</b> characterized in general by {{a high rate of}} infection. This unique phenomenon is called the double immune response, which means a non-linear effect. If the time interval between pre-treatment and inoculation increases the active concentration values for the double immune response shift towards original higher dose values because of the continuous metabolism of methylated inducer in the host plant. The inactive range between the two active dose values remains the same. The multiple pre-treatment of plants with the inducer gives contrasting results: the active dose ranges shifted towards the original lower values. It seems that the two active concentrations of the inducer are always the same. Methylated inducers are potential formaldehyde (HCHO) generators. HCHO generates a time- and dose-dependent immunostimulating activity. HCHO (mainly in bound form) and H 2 O 2 can interact and the singlet oxygen and excited HCHO can be formed. The singlet oxygen may participate in the oxidation of water molecules and in biological systems previously unknown oxidants including dihydrogen trioxide and ozone, can be generated. It seems that these reactive molecules-from HCHO to O 3 - form the biochemical basis of the double immune response of plants to pathogens...|$|R
