500|$|In late August, Dorsetshire {{participated in}} the search for the heavy cruiser [...] Dorsetshire, Eagle and the light cruiser [...] left Freetown on 29 August, though they were unable to locate the German raider. On 4 November, Dorsetshire and the {{auxiliary}} cruiser , were sent to investigate reports of a German surface raider in the South Atlantic but neither ship <b>found</b> <b>anything.</b> In November–December, WS-24, a convoy of 10 troop transport ships, steamed out from Halifax, Canada en route to Basra, Iraq. After arriving in Cape Town on 9 December, Dorsetshire took over the escort duties and the convoy was diverted to Bombay, where it arrived on 24 December.|$|E
500|$|Outside the Convention in Philadelphia, {{there was}} a {{national}} convening of the Society of the Cincinnati. Washington {{was said to be}} embarrassed.

The Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia and New York convention was meeting to redefine its Confession, dropping the faith requirement for civil authority to prohibit false worship. Protestant Episcopalian Washington attended a Roman Catholic Mass and dinner. Revolution veteran Jonas Phillips, of the Mikveh Israel Synagogue, petitioned the Convention to avoid a national oath including belief in both Old and New Testaments. Merchants of Providence, Rhode Island, petitioned for consideration, though their Assembly had not sent a delegation.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Selena opened two boutiques called Selena Etc. in Corpus Christi and San Antonio; {{they were}} {{equipped}} with in-house beauty salons. Quintanilla, Jr. thought Saldívar {{was a potential}} candidate to run the businesses because the family would be touring the country. He believed she was the best choice because of her success running the fan club. The family agreed; in January 1994, Saldívar became {{the manager of the}} boutiques. In September 1994, Selena signed Saldívar as her registered agent in San Antonio. After being hired to run the boutiques, Saldívar moved from South San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena. In an interview with Primer Impacto in 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. said he [...] "always mistrusted Saldívar", though the family never <b>found</b> <b>anything</b> odd about Saldívar's behavior. Saldívar was authorized to write and cash checks, and had access to bank accounts associated with the fan club and boutiques.|$|E
500|$|The {{disappointment}} of Infinite inspired Eminem {{to create the}} alter ego Slim Shady: [...] "Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it." [...] Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and {{in the spring of}} 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. [...] After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. [...] He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. [...] Dr. Dre recalled, [...] "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never <b>found</b> <b>anything</b> from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'" [...] Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.|$|E
500|$|Origen's letters do not survive. However, most {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} letters that circulated {{in the era of}} Eusebius and Jerome were genuine. It is also reasonable that Origen, a man with close contacts in the Christian Arab community, would have taken a particular interest in the first Arab emperor. The scholar K. J. Neumann argued that, since Origen would have known the faith of the imperial couple, he must have written about it in the letters listed at 6.36.3. Since Eusebius read these letters, and does not mention that the emperor was Christian (Neumann understands the passage at 6.34 to reflect Eusebius' disbelief in Philip's Christianity), we must conclude that Philip was not Christian, and was neither baptized nor made catechumen. Against Neumann, Shahîd argues that, if Eusebius had <b>found</b> <b>anything</b> in the letters to disprove Philip's Christianity, he would have clearly outlined it in this passage—as the biographer of Constantine, it would have been in his interest to undermine any other claimants to the title [...] "first Christian emperor". Moreover, this segment of the Historia is a catalog of Origen's works and correspondence; the contents of the letters are irrelevant.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, {{the usually}} soft-spoken Sakuraba {{surprised}} many with complaints that Akiyama's {{body had been}} greased. The referee in charge subsequently checked Akiyama's body and gave indication to ringside officials {{that he had not}} <b>found</b> <b>anything</b> unusual. In the aftermath of the fight the controversy escalated drastically and new accusations of weighed gloves also surfaced. To deal with the growing controversy, K-1 launched an investigation to look into the accusations against Akiyama. Although Akiyama's gloves were found to be regulation, video-tape revealed Akiyama administering a lotion to his skin. Akiyama—who attested he was simply treating his dry skin—was found to have been [...] "negligent" [...] and disqualified. The fight was subsequently declared a no-contest and Akiyama's purse was withheld. A press conference followed, wherein Akiyama—now heavily maligned by the Japanese sports media—offered a public apology.|$|E
2500|$|Although Lassalle was {{a member}} of the Communist League, his {{politics}} were strongly opposed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; indeed Marx's essay Critique of the Gotha Program is written in part as a reaction to Lassalle's conception of the socialist state. [...] Marx and Engels thought that Lassalle was not a true Communist as he directly influenced Bismarck's government (albeit in secret) in favor of universal manhood suffrage, among other issues. In February 1864 Lassalle wrote to Engels, claiming that he although had been a republican since infancy [...] "I have never <b>found</b> <b>anything</b> as ridiculous, corrupt, and in the long run impossible as constitutionalism ... I have come to the conviction that nothing could have a greater future or a more beneficent role than the monarchy, if it could only make up its mind to become a social monarchy. In that case I would passionately bear its banner, and the constitutional theories would be quickly enough thrown into the lumber room". Élie Halévy would later write on this situation: ...|$|E
2500|$|The opera {{historian}} Harold Rosenthal {{wrote of}} the Moody-Manners company: [...] "With the Carl Rosa company, it was the principal training ground for British artists {{in the years before}} World War I." [...] Manners held strong views about the training given by British music academies to young singers. In his view students were not equipped for a professional career because they were trained in the principal operatic roles rather than in the chorus parts, which almost all singers new to the profession would need to sing before being promoted to leading roles. He instanced his own early career: [...] "I studied both at the Royal Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Academy, London, and then in Italy, and when I came back to London, all I could get was an engagement in comic opera where I sang for eighteen months before I could become a principal. It was not till over six years after I left my studies that I <b>found</b> <b>anything</b> I had learnt at the academies of any value to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|At this point, Beredine, believing U-175 {{to still}} be in the fight, put Spencer about to ram the U-boat but the escort commander, Commander Paul Heineman, ordered him to [...] "heave to" [...] and put a {{boarding}} party across instead. As the remaining Germans began to jump into the sea, the Spencers boarding party attempted to get into the U-boat to search for documents and survivors. The boat quickly began to go under, though, and as a result they were forced to make a hasty departure without having <b>found</b> <b>anything.</b> Of the 54 men that had embarked in U-175, 13 were killed, 19 were rescued by Spencer and 22 were picked up by Duane, where they were formally taken prisoner, treated for their wounds and provided with dry clothing and warm food. Meanwhile, the battle for the convoy continued. A number of other boats, including U-382, U-226 and U-264 were badly damaged in the ensuing engagement and the Allies would later reinforce the escort around convoy HX-233 and increase the air assets assigned to it. In response, on 18 April, BdU canceled operations against the convoy, which subsequently arrived in Liverpool on 21 April, having lost only one of its 57 ships.|$|E
2500|$|For {{several weeks}} Australian signals {{intelligence}} (SIGINT) had tracked a radio transmitter from {{the headquarters of}} the 275th Regiment moving westwards to a position just north of Long Tan using radio direction finding; however, extensive patrolling failed to find the unit. Provided by the top secret 547 Signals Troop, the reports began on 29 July {{at the height of the}} false alarm, with the radio detected moving towards Nui Dat from a position north of Xuyen Moc. It continued at a rate of [...] a day and by 13 August was located near the Nui Dat 2 feature, a hill in the vicinity of Long Tan, [...] east of Nui Dat. Although direction finding only indicated the movement of the radio, and no transmissions had been intercepted, it suggested the presence of the 275th Regiment, or at least a reconnaissance party of that unit. While deception could not be ruled out, Jackson took the threat seriously and a number of company patrols were sent out. Yet the existence of a SIGINT capability was a closely guarded secret, and knowledge of the source of the reports had been limited to Jackson, his two intelligence officers, and the 1 ATF operations officer, while neither battalion commander had access. On 15 August D Company, 6 RAR patrolled to Nui Dat 2 and returned through the Long Tan rubber plantation. The following day A Company, 6 RAR departed on a three-day patrol on a route which included Nui Dat 2 and the ridge to the north-west. Any sizeable Viet Cong force in the vicinity would have been located, but neither patrol <b>found</b> <b>anything</b> of significance. SAS patrols focused on the Nui Dinh hills to the west.|$|E
