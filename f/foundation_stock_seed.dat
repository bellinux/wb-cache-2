40|$|There is {{conflicting}} informations {{regarding the}} advantages of planting of <b>stock</b> <b>seed</b> (SS) over Extension Seed (ES) classes. An experiment to study the effect of different seedclasses on grain yield and yield components of five rice varieties was carried out at two locations i. e. Sukamandi and Muara Field Station during the wet and dry season of 2009. The treatment consisted of five rice varieties, namely: Ciherang, Mekongga, IR 64, Cigeulis and Situ Bagendit, and their respective seed classes: namely breeder <b>seed,</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>seed,</b> <b>stock</b> <b>seed</b> and extension seed. The experiment was arranged in a split plot design with three replications, where rice varieties were as main plots and seed classes as sub plots. Variables to be evaluated consisted of: quality of seed before sowing, plant growth, yield components and grain yield. Performance of the observed variable of each rice variety derived from four different seed-classes in each location and planting season were not significantly different. Differences of seed classes only affected the percentage of seed purity. There {{was no significant difference}} on the grain yield and the seed yield obtained from different seed classes of each variety. These results disprove the belief that the higher seed class the higher productivity, which was found to be a wrong perception. Seed certification is designed to maintain the genetic purity of variety and not to increase the productivity...|$|R

40|$|Officially {{released}} varieties in Ghana are all {{selections from}} exotic introductions. Following release, no {{effort was made}} to maintain pathogen-tested <b>foundation</b> <b>seed</b> <b>stocks.</b> Pathogen-tested plants of 4 released varieties were introduced to Ghana and compared with released varieties to confirm a) that they were the same varieties and b) to evaluate whether pathogen-tested planting material of these varieties could be used to increase yield and quality. Planting material of cultivars and introduced pathogen-tested materials of the same genotypes were field multiplied at Fumesua, Ghana, before planting in replicated trials at 2 locations during the 2011 growing season. Standard morphological descriptors and molecular markers were used to assess equality of genotypes, while yield and virus symptoms during growth were used to determine benefits of using pathogen-tested planting material. Morphologically, Otoo and Sauti were more similar to their putative ramets than Faara and Okumkom. Mogamba, the putative ramet of Otoo, recorded the highest yield among the pathogentested clones at the two locations, while also expressing low virus symptoms. Otoo also had the highest yield and lowest virus ratings among the released varieties. Tanzania a pathogen tested ramet of Sauti had the worst virus score across locations. TIS 3017 (CIP 440064), the pathogen-tested putative ramet of Faara did not yield well though it did not express severe virus symptoms...|$|R

All animals were subjected to the identification of the prion protein PrP gene. The lower genetic diversity of alleles and genotypes of scrapie in stud rams (three genotypes and two alleles) and in rams for further breeding (five genotypes and three alleles) than in ewes of the <b>foundation</b> <b>stock</b> (eight genotypes and five alleles) and in flock replacement ewes (five genotypes and three alleles) was found. In case of flock replacement ewes, rams for further breeding and stud rams an increasing in the frequency of genotypes and alleles containing the ARR allele was observed as opposed to decreasing in the frequency of alleles: ARQ, AHQ and ARH. In <b>foundation</b> <b>stock</b> ewes during {{the first two years of}} research the not scrapie resistant allele VRQ was observed. In the third year of the study it was completely eliminated from the flock.
