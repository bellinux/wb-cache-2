40|$|Background: In {{the absence}} of stochasticity, {{allometric}} growth throughout ontogeny is axiomatically described by the logarithm-transformed power-law model, ht~log a bzk w t, where ht:h(t) and w t:w(t) are the logarithmic sizes of two traits {{at any given time}} t. Realistically, however, stochasticity is an inherent property of ontogenetic allometry. Due to the inherent stochasticity in both ht and w t, the ontogenetic allometry coefficients, log a b and k, can vary with t and have intricate temporal distributions that are governed by the central and mixed moments of the random ontogenetic growth functions, ht and w t. Unfortunately, there is no probabilistic model for analyzing these informative ontogenetic statistical moments. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study treats <b>ht</b> and <b>wt</b> as correlated stochastic processes to formulate the exact probabilistic version of each of the ontogenetic allometry coefficients. In particular, the statistical dynamics of relative growth is addressed by analyzing the allometric growth factors that affect the temporal distribution of the probabilistic version of the relative growth rate, k:DtðuSVtTÞ=DtðvSVtTÞ, where SVtT is the expected value of the ratio of stochastic <b>ht</b> to stochastic <b>wt,</b> and uSVtT and vSVtT are the numerator and the denominator of SVtT, respectively. These allometric growth factors, which provide important insight into ontogenetic allometry but appear only when stochasticity is introduced, describe the central and mixed moments of <b>ht</b> and <b>wt</b> as differentiable real-valued functions of t...|$|R

Physical characteristics for a 1 l Ss included <b>ht,</b> <b>wt,</b> and % fat. Ss were tested for volitional peak VO 2 on the treadmill using the Skinner et al. (1971) protocol. Variables measured were VE max, RER, HR max, and peak VO 2 (l-min - 1 ml/kg/min-l). A 9 -min run for distance was also performed by the Ss. A multiple regression technique was used to predict peak 90 from the 9 -min run distance. The resulting r value when predicting peak VO 2 in ml/kg/min from the 9 -min distance was 0. 693. The r value for prediction of peak VO 2 in l'min from the 9 -min run distance was 0. 583.

A and Ht were the only variables which contributed significantly to PRV. A, <b>Ht,</b> and <b>Wt</b> were the only variables to contribute significantly to PFRC. A test-retest correlation between two trials of RV (r=. 99) and FRC (r=. 98) determinations indicated that reliable measures were taken by the closed circuit oxygen dilution technique. Through the use of multiple step-wise regression the following PRV and PFRC formulas were developed: PRV (liters) =. 0260376 (A) +. 0256005 (Ht) - 3. 89794 PFRC (liters) =. 0493365 (Ht) +. 0116958 (A) -. 00919313 (Wt) - 6. 20966 The standard error of estimation (S.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} postnatal {{growth of}} extremely {{low birth weight}} infants (ELBW, < 1, 000 g) until 36 months of corrected age (CA), and to relate growth outcome to anthropometric parameters at birth, sex, fetal growth status (small or appropriate for gestational age [...] SGA/AGA), period of admission and major perinatal events. STUDY DESIGN/METHOD: Weight (Wt), height (Ht) and head circumference (HC) were assessed in 159 ELBW infants. Data were standardized with Z-scores following Usher and McLean and Sempe growth curves. Uni- and multivariate statistical analysis were performed. RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 851. 2 +/- 116. 5 g. Z-scores decreased from birth to term, at a deeper rate for AGA than for SGA infants (p< 0. 005 for <b>Ht,</b> <b>Wt,</b> and HC). Between term and 36 months, growth was better in SGA compared with AGA infants (p= 0. 003 for Ht). Multivariate analysis showed that anthropometric parameters at birth were positive determinants for Wt, Ht and HC at term, and also for Wt and Ht at 36 months CA (Z-scores). Oxygen therapy after 36 weeks of post-conceptional age was a negative determinant influencing growth at 36 months CA (Z-scores).

Study design: Retrospective cohort study. Subjects: One hundred one children with a BW Outcome measures: Height (Ht), weight (Wt), occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) at birth, 15 months and 2 years corrected age and 3. 5 and 5. 5 years.

For AGA infants we found substantial catch-down growth in lit (15. 4 %) and Wt (33. 8 %). Cognitive and motor outcome was normal in 76. 2 % and 41. 6 % of the 101 children. A significantly higher percentage of normal cognitive outcome was found in AGA infants with Wt growth remaining at >=- 2 SDS compared to AGA infants with catch-down growth (83 % vs 63 %). Next, SGA infants who caught-up in OFC had a higher prevalence of normal cognitive outcome compared to SGA infants who did not catch-up in OFC. Furthermore, a higher percentage of severely delayed motor outcome was found in SGA infants without catch-up growth in Wt compared to SGA infants who caught-up in Wt (61. 5 % vs 32. 2 %). Conclusions: Catch-up growth in Ht. Wt/Ht and OFC occurred in the majority of the SGA infants with a BW =- 2 SDS have a better cognitive and motor developmental outcome at 5. 5 years of age.

40|$|Background: Rapid {{development}} in neonatal care {{during the past}} years has significantly improved long-term survival of extreme preterm born (EPB) infants creating a population of children with a high frequency of disabilities. Being lighter and shorter, as compared to full-term (FT) born child, predisposes the EPB infants to intensive nutritional interventions aiming for growth-promoting effect. The existing cross-sectional preterm growth charts reflect an intrauterine growth but are used for monitoring of extra uterine growth. Long-term data on postnatal growth are sparse. The aim of this thesis was to describe the growth pattern and morbidity from birth to 10 years in hospital-based cohort of EPB infants born 1990 - 2002 in Sweden and treated at Karolinska University Hospital (KS), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and/or Sahlgrenska hospital (SH). Paper I covers retrospective longitudinal cohort of 162 infants born before 26 + 0 weeks of gestation. We studied body weight (<b>Wt),</b> height (<b>Ht)</b> and head circumference (HC) from birth to FT age and compared it to the new Swedish birth size reference. We showed {{that the majority of}} the infants showed a pronounced postnatal growth restriction (PGR) and at discharge from NICU, 75 % of initially appropriate for gestational age infants were below – 2 SDS for at least one of the body size variables. Paper II is a retrospective review of 114 children born before 25 + 0 weeks of gestation; we studied the frequency of ROP and visual acuity (VA). We found that 75 % of the children developed severe ROP (stage ≥ 3), often in combination with additional functional deficits as a consequence of brain dysfunction. Normal VA (> 0. 8) in at least one eye was found in 50 % of all infants, more common in girls, while visual impairment (VA < 0. 33) was more common in boys. Paper III is a retrospective longitudinal study of 123 children born before 26 + 0 weeks of gestation; morbidity and body <b>Wt,</b> <b>Ht,</b> HC from FT to 10 years were studied comparing with the Swedish growth reference. We showed that a significant catch up (CU) in <b>Ht</b> and <b>Wt</b> occured; by age 10 years the attained mean Ht was in accordance with the genetic potential. Significant cognitive, motor disorder and/ or developmental comorbidity were found in 48 % boys and 34 % girls and severe ROP in 79 % and 66 % respectively. In Paper IV, we studied the magnitude of catch-up (CU) growth 10 years after FT age and its impact for attained <b>Ht</b> and <b>Wt</b> during childhood in the cohort from Paper III. We showed that the most pronounced CU growth in both <b>Wt</b> and <b>Ht</b> occurred during the first year after FT age; followed by a plateau between 1 and 2 years but with more pronounced <b>Wt</b> than <b>Ht</b> development, a trend that continued until 10 years. Children with rapid CU in Wt three months after FT age were significantly heavier and taller at 1 and 2 years but not taller at 10 years compared to children with slower growth tempo. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that EPB infants show a continuous PGR in <b>Wt,</b> <b>Ht</b> and HC as compared to birth size references. Neither the birth-size derived growth curves nor the presented charts are supposed to be used as a single prescriptive standard for extra uterine growth of this population. By 10 years of age the majority of children had reached normal or near-normal Ht close to their genetic potential but Wt development was higher than Ht development, possibly leading to a disadvantageous metabolic situation. EPB infants, especially boys are at high risk for visual impairment and therefore rehabilitation of these children with a combination of disabilities is a challenge. The most challenging period is between birth and FT, which may be a critical window for development of the central nervous system...|$|R

This study attempts to validate the use of Sri Lankan based body composition assessment tools {{on a group of}} 5 - 15 year old Australian children of Sri Lankan origin. The study was conducted at the Body Composition Laboratory of the Children’s Nutrition Research Centre at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Height (<b>Ht),</b> weight (<b>Wt),</b> segmental length (Lsegment name) and skinfold thickness (SFT) were measured. The whole body and segmental bio impedance analysis (BIA) were also measured. The body composition determined by the deuterium dilution technique (criterion method) was compared with the assessments done using prediction equations developed on Sri Lankan children. 27 boys and 15 girls were studied. All predictions of body composition parameters, except percentage fat mass (FM) assessed by the SFT-FM equation in girls gave statistically significant correlations with the criterion method. They had a low mean bias and most were not influenced by the measured parameter. Although living in a different socioeconomic state, the equations developed on children of the same ethnic background gives a better predictive value of body composition. This highlights the ethnic influence on body composition...|$|R

40|$|Rewarding {{effects of}} ethanol may be {{mediated}} {{in part by}} endogenous opioids. Ethanol alters β-endorphin synthesis and release. β-endorphin heterozygous (HT) and knockout (KO) mice consume higher levels of a low-concentrated alcohol solution and show heightened predisposition to self-administer ethanol in comparison with wild-type (WT) mice (Grisel et al., 1999). This {{study was conducted in}} order to: i) re-analyze and extend previous results in terms of ethanol consumption profiles of β-endorphin deficient mice; and ii) analyze conditioned aversive learning mediated by ethanol postabsorptive effects as a function of genetic capabilities to synthesize β-endorphin. In Experiment 1, mice were evaluated in terms of consumption of a low (7 %) ethanol solution in a two-bottle free choice paradigm. Ethanol concentration was then increased to 10 % and voluntary intake consumption was tested. WT mice displayed significantly higher consumption levels and ethanol-preference scores than did KO mice, independently from ethanol concentration. HT mice drank more ethanol than did KO mice. In Experiment 2, mice (KO, <b>HT</b> and <b>WT)</b> were tested in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm in which a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution was paired with a 2 -g/kg ethanol dose. Only HT and KO displayed a conditioned aversion when using 2 -g/kg ethanol as unconditioned stimulus. The present results indicate that total or partial deficiency of β-endorphin synthesis reduces ethanol preference and consumption. Furthermore, this study indicates that the lack of β-endorphin synthesis exacerbates ethanol’s aversive postabsorptive effects which can in turn modulate self-administration patterns of the drug...|$|R

These data were then used to evaluate compositional changes, adjustment procedures and to estimate genetic parameters. Linear as well as linear and quadratic regressions of each trait on age were performed on the pooled data and on an individual animal basis. These regression lines were plotted to assess the changes in each trait throughout the test period. Results suggest that mean individual animal linear and quadratic regression equations more clearly describe the compositional changes during the test period than linear regression equations. Comparing adjustment procedures involving one, two or all four measurements on each animal indicate that two measurements taken 30 to 60 days apart, when the contemporary group average age is near 365 days can provide accurate adjustment to a year of age.

40|$|AbstractThe {{vertebrate}} intestinal epithelium is renewed continuously from {{stem cells}} {{at the base}} of the crypt in mammals or base of the fold in fish over the life of the organism. As stem cells divide, newly formed epithelial cells make an initial choice between a secretory or enterocyte fate. This choice has previously been demonstrated to involve Notch signaling as well as Atonal and Her transcription factors in both embryogenesis and adults. Here, we demonstrate that in contrast to the atoh 1 in mammals, ascl 1 a is responsible for formation of secretory cells in zebrafish. ascl 1 a−/− embryos lack all intestinal epithelial secretory cells and instead differentiate into enterocytes. ascl 1 a−/− embryos also fail to induce intestinal epithelial expression of deltaD suggesting that ascl 1 a plays a role in initiation of Notch signaling. Inhibition of Notch signaling increases the number of ascl 1 a and deltaD expressing intestinal epithelial cells as well as the number of developing secretory cells during two specific time periods: between 30 and 34 hpf and again between 64 and 74 hpf. Loss of enteroendocrine products results in loss of anterograde motility in ascl 1 a−/− embryos. 5 HT produced by enterochromaffin cells is critical in motility and secretion within the intestine. We find that addition of exogenous 5 HT to ascl 1 a−/− embryos at near physiological levels (measured by differential pulse voltammetry) induce anterograde motility at similar levels to wild type velocity, distance, and frequency. Removal or doubling the concentration of 5 <b>HT</b> in <b>WT</b> embryos does not significantly affect anterograde motility, suggesting that the loss of additional enteroendocrine products in ascl 1 a−/− embryos also contributes to intestinal motility. Thus, zebrafish intestinal epithelial cells appear to have a common secretory progenitor from which all subtypes form. Loss of enteroendocrine cells reveals the critical need for enteroendocrine products in maintenance of normal intestinal motility...|$|R

We find λ(t) ∼ t 1 / 4, and for the pinch dimensions, h(t) ∼ t − 1 / 2 and w(t) ∼ t − 1 / 4. These results may play a useful role for the discussion of later instabilitites leading to a global film thinning and drainage, as first discussed by K. Mysels under the name “marginal regeneration”. Early experiments by K. Mysels and coworkers [1] showed that a vertical soap film, suspended on a frame, (and made with “mobile ” surfactant) thins out by nucleation and growth of black, thin spots near the Plateau borders. They called this process “marginal regeneration”. There are in fact (at least) two steps in marginal regeneration: a) The pressure in the Plateau border is lower than the pressure in the film. This thins out the film near the border, and leads to a “pinch”. b) The pinched state must have an intrinsic instability leading t...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Despite {{the vital}} effects of zinc on infant growth, the low zinc store of mothers {{especially}} in poor communities {{may lead to}} low content of zinc in their newborns. In the first 6 months of life, the young infant has a relatively high zinc requirement to support the very rapid growth of early infancy and growth retarding continues to be highly prevalent among children in low-Income countries. In this study we evaluated the effect of zinc supplementation on the infant growth and development. Materials and methods: In a randomized double blind controlled field trial, 500 lactating women were identified and enrolled into the study within 2 week of delivery. They were enrolled only if they intended to exclusively breast feed for 6 to 12 months. Height (Ht), head circumference HC, weight and development milestone were evaluated monthly to 12 months. Data were analyzed using spss 10 software. Results: <b>WT.</b> <b>HT.</b> and HC in infants of trial group {{were significantly higher than}} control group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: A 20 (TNFAIP 3) is a {{pleiotropic}} NFκB-dependent {{gene that}} terminates NFκB activation {{in response to}} inflammatory stimuli. The potent anti-inflammatory properties of A 20 are well characterized in several organs. However, {{little is known about}} its role in the brain. In this study, we investigated the brain phenotype of A 20 heterozygous (HT) and knockout (KO) mice. Methods: The inflammatory status of A 20 wild type (<b>WT),</b> <b>HT</b> and KO brain was determined by immunostaining, quantitative PCR, and Western blot analysis. Cytokines secretion was evaluated by ELISA. Quantitative results were statistically analyzed by ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test. Results: Total loss of A 20 caused remarkable reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis, as determined by F 4 / 80 and GFAP immunostaining. Glial activation correlated with significantly higher mRNA and protein levels of the pro-inflammatory molecules TNF, IL- 6, and MCP- 1 in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of A 20 KO, as compared to WT. Basal and TNF/LPS-induced cytokine production was significantly higher in A 20 deficient mouse primary astrocytes and in a mouse microglia cell line. Brain endothelium of A 20 KO mice demonstrated baseline activation as shown by increased vascular immunostaining for ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1, and mRNA levels of E-selectin. In addition, total loss of A 20 increased basal brain oxidative/nitrosative stress, as indicated by higher iNOS and NADPH oxidase subunit gp 91 phox levels, correlating with increased protein nitration, gauged by nitrotyrosine immunostaining...|$|R
