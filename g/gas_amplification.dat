40|$|AbstractThe {{search for}} neutrinoless double beta decay (0 νββ) is an {{important}} topic in contemporary physics with many active experiments. New projects are planning to use high-pressure xenon gas as both source and detection medium. The secondary scintillation processes available in noble <b>gases</b> permit large <b>amplification</b> with negligible statistical fluctuations, offering the prospect of energy resolution approaching the Fano factor limit. This Letter reports results for xenon secondary scintillation yield, at room temperature, {{as a function of}} electric field in the gas scintillation gap for pressures ranging from 2 to 10 bar. A Large Area Avalanche Photodiode (LAAPD) collected the VUV secondary scintillation produced in the gas. X-rays directly absorbed in the LAAPD are used as a reference for determining the number of charge carriers produced by the scintillation pulse and, hence, the number of photons impinging the LAAPD. The number of photons produced per drifting electron and per kilovolt, the so-called scintillation amplification parameter, displays a small increase with pressure, ranging from 141 ± 6 at 2 bar to 170 ± 10 at 8 bar. In our setup, this parameter does not increase above 8 bar due to non-negligible electron attachment. The results are in good agreement with those presented in the literature in the 1 to 3 bar range. The increase of the scintillation amplification parameter with pressure for high gas densities has been also observed in former work at cryogenic temperatures...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} of the two-stream {{instability}} in stellar disks with counter-rotating components of stars and/or gas is stimulated by recently discovered counter-rotating spiral and S 0 galaxies. Strong linear two-stream instability of tightly-wrapped spiral waves is found for one and two-armed waves with the pattern angular speed of the unstable waves always intermediate between the angular speed of the co-rotating matter (+Ω) {{and that of the}} counter-rotating matter (-Ω). The instability arises from the interaction of positive and negative energy modes in the co- and counter-rotating components. The unstable waves are in general convective - they move in radius and radial wavenumber space - with the result that amplification of the advected wave {{is more important than the}} local growth rate. For a galaxy of co-rotating stars and counter-rotating stars of mass-fraction ξ_* < 1 2, or of counter-rotating gas of mass-fraction ξ_g < 1 2, the largest amplification is usually for the one-armed leading waves (with respect to the co-rotating stars). For the case of both counter-rotating stars and <b>gas,</b> the largest <b>amplifications</b> are for ξ_*+ξ_g ≈ 1 2, also for one-armed leading waves. The two-armed trailing waves usually have smaller amplifications. The growth rates and amplifications all decrease as the velocity spreads of the stars and/or gas increase.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} several wafer {{post-processing}} steps {{have been applied}} to CMOS chips. <b>Amplification</b> <b>gas</b> strucutures are built {{on top of the}} microchips. A complete radiation imaging detector is obtained this way. Integrated Micromegas-like and GEM-like structures were fabricated on top of Timepix CMOS chips. Single electron efficiency, measured by counting the number of detected electrons from an 55 Fe conversion in Ar/iC 4 H 10 (95 / 5) was found to be well above 90 %. The detector provides high single electron efficiency, three dimensional reconstruction of charged particles trajectory, a fine pixel pitch and it has a low mass. All these features make it a suitable candidate for tracking of charged particles in future detectors like ATLAS or CMS after the LHC upgrade or the International Linear Collider. Micromegas-like and GEM-like structures can be fairly compared as same materials and dimentions can be used. It was found that GEM-like structures having a big amount of insulator perform worse than similar Micromegas-like structures. The maximum achievable gain before sparks is lower for GEM-like that for Micromegas-like. When the amount of insulator is reduced in the GEM-like structures, having recessed insulator walls with respect to the metal electrodes, the performance is similar to Micromegas-like structures. Multistage detectors on top of Timepix chips were also built using wafer postprocessing. Tge devices were fully operational and cosmic rays could be detected. The spark rate of multistage detectors compared to single detectors must be studied. Also the signal development in these detectors is expected to be faster that in single stage detectors. Spark damage is a commong problem in gaseous detectors. Sparks can destroy the readout electronics. We have deposited a-Si:H and SiRN on Timepix chips. We have shown that these high resistive layer deposited on top of the CMOS chip can help to reduce the spark problems. Discharges energy is reduced and microchips can survive the discharges that before would destroy them. Future detectors are not required any more not to spark as they can now be made spark proof. Integrated detectors can suffer reliability problems because of degradation due to moisture exposure. Also mechanical attacks will make the devices not to work.
