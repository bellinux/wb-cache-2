40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the main {{changes in the}} distribution of food and drinks in Argentina, which began with the economic, political and social crisis in 2001. The territory used by some of the social actors involved, such as businesses of different sizes (supermarkets and neighborhood stores) and people (consumers), will no longer respond exclusively to a global order or to territorial verticalities. Many of these new tendencies will be led by local norms connected with territorial <b>horizontalities.</b> The most important of these changes is the fact that consumption has become oriented towards: sales, smaller packaging, second and third brands, supermarkets' own brands, new shopping frequencies, a combination of several distribution channels with the so-called "back-to-the-neighborhood" phenomenon, and single-item shopping...|$|R
40|$|In {{face of the}} {{modernization}} taking place in Brazilian territory in the last decades and the rethink of the State's functions with the deepen social-spacial unequalities specially after 1980 ’s, the companies started {{to have a new}} importance as mitigate agents of these problems using the, as called, social responsibility. This speech sets up an unseen psychosphere promoted by the foundations and institutes of the companies which multiplies in this period, as the certifications and the private standards also do. We view, firstly, to do a periodisation that search the companies' social acts' basements and the valors that prescribed the relation between the company and the place it is installed. Nowadays, when searching how these actions occur territorially, we established three basics organizations: focused, punctual and diffuse actions. Each organization presupposes a specific combination of verticalities and <b>horizontalities</b> that aim to diferential relations between the place's dynamic and the companies' actions. In this way, we attempted to demystify the corporate strategy through {{the manner in which it}} uses the territory...|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} of original <b>horizontality</b> {{states that the}} deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments {{in a wide variety}} of environments supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{of the house is}} steel-reinforced, with a buff-colored stucco exterior, built on a concrete foundation. Its overall design and decoration emphasizes a clean, modern aesthetic while serving practical functions and staying in harmony with natural surroundings. Overhanging eaves, with a 7-foot projection of the roof at the front (east) side of the house, emphasize the building’s <b>horizontality</b> while also regulating heat and light at its entrance. A front wall of art glass windows connects the dwelling’s interior to the garden, with bands of windows on the upper story adding to the sense of <b>horizontality.</b> Wooden piers and trim were all given “jin-di-sugi” treatment, a wood-aging technique based on traditional Japanese techniques using the application of chemicals or burning to artificially age wood.|$|E
25|$|Metastudies show a male {{advantage}} in mental rotation and assessing <b>horizontality</b> and verticality {{and a female}} {{advantage in}} spatial memory. A proposed hypothesis is {{that men and women}} evolved different mental abilities to adapt to their different roles in society. This explanation suggests that men may have evolved greater spatial abilities as a result of certain behaviors, such as navigating during a hunt. Similarly, this hypothesis suggests that women may have evolved to devote more mental resources to remembering locations of food sources in relation to objects and other features in order to gather food.|$|E
25|$|Due to its dual {{commercial}} and residential purpose, the building's facade design received a different treatment than those of most other homes of the time. Thus, in the first level, the neoclassical elements are austere; the exterior is articulated by {{the doors and windows}} openings. These openings are framed by moldings and pilasters resembling Tuscan columns. The pilasters are crowned by an unadorned, flat architrave that runs along the entire facade, clearly dividing the commercial first floor from the residential upper level. The second level received a more complex treatment, to emphasize its residential and, thus, social significance. The upper level facade is completely articulated around its many openings. There are 13 sets of wooden double doors with adjustable louvers, nine facing Calle Castillo and four overlooking Paseo Atocha. Each doorway is accentuated by a combination of balconies, plaster moldings and pediments, all framed by a rhythmic articulation of Corinthian pilasters. The balconies have the original 19th century wrought iron grilles. The facade is crowned with a sober, but strong entablature. The Tuscan and Corinthian pilaster accent the building verticality, against its massive and dominating <b>horizontality.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Palazzo dei Conservatori ("Palace of the Conservators") {{was built}} in the Middle Ages for the local {{magistrate}} on top of a sixth-century BC temple dedicated to Jupiter [...] "Maximus Capitolinus". Michelangelo's renovation of it incorporated the first use of a giant order that spanned two storeys, here with a range of Corinthian pilasters and subsidiary Ionic columns flanking the ground-floor loggia openings and the second-floor windows. Michelangelo’s new portico is a reinvention of older ideas. The portico contains entablatures and a flat, coffer-like ceiling. The entablatures rest on columns set at the front of each bay, while matching half-columns stand against the back wall. Each pilaster forms a compound unit with the pier and column on either side of it. Colossal pilasters set on large bases join the portico and the upper story. All of the windows are capped with segmental pediments. A balustrade fringing the roof emphasizes the emphatic <b>horizontality</b> of the whole against which the vertical lines of the orders rise in majestic contrast. The verticality of the colossal order creates the feeling of a self-contained space while the <b>horizontality</b> of the entablatures and balustrades emphasize the longitudinal axis of the piazza. The palazzo’s facade was updated by Michelangelo in the 1530s and again later numerous times.|$|E
2500|$|One {{component}} which {{epitomizes the}} transitional {{nature of the}} Hills-DeCaro House is the dual-pitched, Japanese inspired roof which recalls similar roof designs for the Harry C. Goodrich House and George W. Smith House, both completed ten years prior. [...] However, the cantilevered eaves of the Hills-Decaro house are even deeper – stretching 5.5feet (1.67m) on the upper story – and the fascia is even thicker than those of its early predecessors. [...] When paired with the unique, stepped shingle pattern, these adjustments further accentuate the Prairie style <b>horizontality</b> of the house.|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{the fossil}} record [...] of an {{evolutionary}} progression typically consists of species that suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear hundreds of thousands or millions of years later, without any change in external appearance. Graphically, these fossil species are represented by horizontal lines, whose lengths depict how long each of them existed. The <b>horizontality</b> of the lines illustrates the unchanging appearance {{of each of the}} fossil species depicted on the graph. During each species' existence new species appear at random intervals, each also lasting many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in appearance. The degree of relatedness and the lines of descent of these concurrent species is generally impossible to determine. This is illustrated in the following diagram depicting the evolution of modern humans from the time that the hominins separated from the line that led to the evolution of our closest living primate relatives, the chimpanzees.|$|E
2500|$|Havemeyer Building [...] This {{building}} {{located at}} 290 Greenwich Avenue {{was the first}} to be built {{in the area of the}} Greenwich Municipal Center Historic District. It was designed by Loring and Phipps and has a Richardsonian Romanesque design with a pronounced <b>horizontality,</b> and further accented by several architectural elements. These include the Syrian arch surrounding the recessed entrance and the elliptical-arched loggia in front of the auditorium wing. The building was originally built for use as a public school, the Havemeyer School, in 1892 by New York philanthropist Henry O. Havemeyer. This building set the standard for architectural design and site planning that would be adhered to by the newer buildings in the Municipal Center district. In front of the building are two war memorials: one for World War II and the Korean War (built 1956), and another to the memory of Col. Raynal Bolling (built 1921). It is currently used by the Greenwich Board of Education.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the focal}} point of Louis XIV's fourth (and last) {{building}} campaign (1699–1710), the fifth and final chapel of the château of Versailles is an unreserved masterpiece. [...] Begun in 1689, construction was halted due to the War of the League of Augsburg; Jules Hardouin-Mansart resumed construction in 1699. Hardouin-Mansart continued working on the project until his death in 1708, at which time his brother-in-law, Robert de Cotte, finished the project (Blondel, 1752–1756; Marie, 1972, 1976; Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993). [...] It was to become the largest of the royal chapels at Versailles, and in fact the height of its vaulting alone was allowed to disturb the rather severe <b>horizontality</b> everywhere else apparent in the palace's roof-line, leading to the design being badly treated by some contemporaries at the time, most notably perhaps by the duc de Saint-Simon, who characterized it as an [...] "enormous catafalque". Nevertheless, the magnificent interior has been widely admired to the present day and served as inspiration for Luigi Vanvitelli when he designed the chapel for the Palace of Caserta (Defilippis, 1968).|$|E
2500|$|Many studies {{investigating}} the spatial abilities {{of men and}} women have found no significant differences, though metastudies show a male advantage in mental rotation and assessing <b>horizontality</b> and verticality, and a female advantage in spatial memory. The sexual division of labor has been proposed as an explanation for these cognitive differences. Those differences disappear with a short training [...] or when given a favorable image of woman ability. Furthermore, the individual differences are greater than the average differences, which isn't therefore a valid prediction of a man or woman cognitive ability. This hypothesis argues that males needed the ability to follow prey over long distances and to accurately target their game with projectile technology, and, as a result, male specialization in hunting prowess would have spurred the selection for increased spatial and navigational ability. Similarly, the ability to remember the locations of underground storage organs and other vegetation would have led to an increase in overall efficiency and decrease in total energy expenditure since the time spent searching for food would decrease. Natural selection based on behaviors that increase hunting success and energetic efficiency would bear a positive influence on reproductive success. However, recent research suggests that the sexual division of labor developed relatively recently and that gender roles were not always the same in early-human cultures, contradicting the theory that each sex is naturally predisposed to different types of work.|$|E

60|$|But the Venetians seem to {{have had}} a morbid horror of arches which were not on a level. They could not endure the {{appearance}} of the roof of one arch bearing against the side of another; and rather than introduce the idea of obliquity into bearing curves, they abandoned the arch principle altogether; so that even in their richest Gothic staircases, where trefoiled arches, exquisitely decorated, are used on the landings, they ran the shafts on the sloping stair simply into the bar of stone above them, and used the excessively ugly and valueless arrangement of Fig. II., rather than sacrifice the sacred <b>horizontality</b> of their arch system.|$|E

As he watched, the dead flat of the scenery overpowered him, though he was fully alive to the beauty of that untarnished early summer green which was worn for the nonce by the poorest blade.

But, {{for the sake of the}} second contrast, we are to have gracefulness and ease, as well as <b>horizontality.</b> Then we must break the line of the roof into different elevations, yet not making the difference great, or we shall have visible verticals. And this must not be done at random.|$|E
60|$|The rambler who, for old {{association}} {{or other}} reasons, should trace the forsaken coach-road running {{almost in a}} meridional line from Bristol to the south shore of England, would find himself during {{the latter half of}} his journey in the vicinity of some extensive woodlands, interspersed with apple-orchards. Here the trees, timber or fruit-bearing, as the case may be, make the wayside hedges ragged by their drip and shade, stretching over the road with easeful <b>horizontality,</b> as if they found the unsubstantial air an adequate support for their limbs.

6000|$|... § 10. To {{return to}} the Cervin. The view of it given on the left hand in Plate +38+ shows the ridge in about its narrowest profile; and shows also that this ridge is {{composed}} of beds of rock shelving across it, apparently horizontal, or nearly so, at the top, and sloping considerably southwards (to the spectator's left), at the bottom. How far this slope {{is a consequence of}} the advance of the nearest angle giving a steep perspective to the beds, I cannot say; my own belief would have been that a great deal of it is thus deceptive, the beds lying as the tiles do in the somewhat anomalous, but perfectly conceivable house-roof, Fig. 79. Saussure, however, attributes to the beds themselves a very considerable slope. But be this as it may, the main facts of the thinness of the beds, their comparative <b>horizontality,</b> and the daring swordsweep by which the whole mountain has been hewn out of them, are from this spot comprehensible at a glance. Visible, I should have said; but eternally, and to the uttermost, incomprehensible. Every geologist who speaks of this mountain seems to be struck by the wonderfulness of its calm sculpture--the absence of all aspect of convulsion, and yet the stern chiselling of so vast a mass into its precipitous isolation leaving no ruin nor débris near it. [...] "Quelle force n'a-t-il pas fallu," [...] exclaims M. Saussure, [...] "pour rompre, et pour balayer tout ce qui manque à cette pyramide!" [...] "What an overturn of all ancient ideas in Geology," [...] says Professor Forbes, [...] "to find a pinnacle of 15,000 feet high [above the sea] sharp as a pyramid, and with perpendicular precipices of thousands of feet on every hand, to be a representative of the older chalk formation; and what a difficulty to conceive the nature of a convulsion (even with unlimited power), which could produce a configuration like the Mont Cervin rising from the glacier of Zmutt!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were so {{fortunate}} as {{to reach the}} beach at spring-tide low-water, and to find, admirably exposed, by far the finest example of a submerged forest which I have ever seen. It occupied a rectangular area, extending from the small river or stream at {{the western end of}} the inlet, about one furlong eastward; and from the low-water line thirty yards up the strand. The lower or seaward portion of the forest area, occupying about two-thirds of its entire breadth, consisted of a brownish drab-coloured clay, which was crowded with vegetable débris, such as small twigs, leaves, and nuts. There were also numerous prostrate trunks and branches of trees, lying partly imbedded in the clay, without anything like a prevalent direction. The trunks varied from six inches to upwards of two feet in diameter. Much of the wood was found to have a reddish or bright pink hue, when fresh surfaces were exposed. Some of it, as well as many of the twigs, had almost become a sort of ligneous pulp, while other examples were firm, and gave a sharp crackling sound on being broken. Several large stumps projected above the clay in a vertical direction, and sent roots and rootlets into the soil in all directions and to considerable distances. It was obvious that the movement by which the submergence was effected had been so uniform as not to destroy the approximate <b>horizontality</b> of the old forest ground. One fine example was noted of a large prostrate trunk having its roots still attached, some of them sticking up above the clay, while others were buried in it. Hazelnuts were extremely abundant--some entire, others broken, and some obviously gnawed.... It has been stated that the forest area reached the spring-tide low-water line; hence as the greatest tidal range on this coast amounts to eighteen feet, we are warranted in inferring that the subsidence amounted to eighteen feet as a minimum, even if we suppose that some of the trees grew in a soil the surface of which was not above the level of high water. There is satisfactory evidence that in Torbay it was not less than forty feet, and that in Falmouth Harbour it amounted to at least sixty-seven feet."[79] ...|$|E
60|$|The upper line {{of surface}} of the {{calcareous}} stratum, which is so conspicuous from being quite white and so nearly horizontal, ranges for miles along the coast, {{at the height of}} about sixty feet above the sea. The sheet of basalt, by which it is capped, is on an average eighty feet in thickness. Westward of Porto Praya beyond Red Hill, the white stratum with the superincumbent basalt is covered up by more recent streams. Northward of Signal Post Hill, I could follow it with my eye, trending away for several miles along the sea cliffs. The distance thus observed is about seven miles; but I cannot doubt from its regularity that it extends much farther. In some ravines at right angles to the coast, it is seen gently dipping towards the sea, probably with the same inclination as when deposited round the ancient shores of the island. I found only one inland section, namely, {{at the base of the}} hill marked A, where, at the height of some hundred feet, this bed was exposed; it here rested on the usual compact augitic rock associated with wacke, and was covered by the widespread sheet of modern basaltic lava. Some exceptions occur to the <b>horizontality</b> of the white stratum: at Quail Island, its upper surface is only forty feet above the level of the sea; here also the capping of lava is only between twelve and fifteen feet in thickness; on the other hand, at the north-east side of Porto Praya harbour, the calcareous stratum, as well as the rock on which it rests, attain a height above the average level: the inequality of level in these two cases is not, as I believe, owing to unequal elevation, but to original irregularities at the bottom of the sea. Of this fact, at Quail Island, there was clear evidence in the calcareous deposit being in one part of much greater than the average thickness, and in another part being entirely absent; in this latter case, the modern basaltic lavas rested directly on those of more ancient origin.|$|E
