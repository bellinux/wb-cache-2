5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was unusual <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two groups did not merge until 1881).|$|E

5|$|The Bedouins, the Ghatafan {{and other}} Confederates from Najd {{had already been}} {{compromised}} by Muhammad's negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than any particular prejudice against Islam.

5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five indigenous communities in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2010 season, Bouygues Telecom {{announced}} that they wished to reduce their involvement in financing the team, and were interested <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> their partnership with the squad. This was on the proviso that team manager Jean-René Bernaudeau could find a primary sponsor that would allow Bouygues Telecom to contribute €1 million to the team's budget, {{but the rest of}} its finances would be covered by an incoming sponsor. At this point in time, the team had lodged an application to become a UCI ProTeam once again in 2011. Following his victory in the inaugural Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, Voeckler was complacent about his team's future, believing his team manager Bernaudeau would eventually find a sponsor. Bernaudeau himself was still hopeful of acquiring a deal at that point, but that deadlines were working against him in order for the team to return as a professional team from the 2011 season onwards.|$|E

5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{served in}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories until Alberta became a {{province}} in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy speaker and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education. His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend {{the boundaries of the}} Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works. He was considered a possible member of Haultain's executive council, likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to George Bulyea. He joined many of his fellow MLAs <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} the last attempt by Indonesian forces to launch a major raid into Malaysian territory, and was a {{propaganda}} disaster for the Indonesian government. Dissent grew in military and political circles, particularly over the perceived foolishness of incumbent President Sukarno <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> the conflict, and on 30 September elements of the army revolted against him. Despite the speedy defeat of the rebels, Sukarno's rivals, particularly in the army, blamed the uprising on him and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). The conflict subsequently began to wind down, and a peace treaty ending the Confrontation was signed in August 1966. The increasingly unpopular Sukarno was forced to step down from office the next year.|$|E

5|$|Government {{estimates}} from 2003 put the literacy rate at 98.6 percent, with {{no significant difference}} between the sexes. Educational standards have been traditionally high, although still far from European benchmarks and <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> deterioration for the past decade. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had deteriorated. State expenditures for education are far below the European Union average. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. Bulgaria ranked 45th out of 72 countries surveyed. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. The State provides free education in primary and secondary public schools. The educational process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. High schools can be technical, vocational, general or specialised in a certain discipline, while higher education consists of a 4-year bachelor degree and a 1-year master's degree.|$|E
5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result <b>in</b> <b>continuing</b> evolution and diversification.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this note}} we {{introduce}} a new algorithm to compute the continued fraction of a real number. The main difference to the classical algorithm is that our algorithm uses only the number itself to be developed <b>in</b> <b>continued</b> fraction <b>in</b> {{every step of the}} iteration process, i. e. the number to be developed <b>in</b> <b>continued</b> fraction is not altered during the steps of the iteration process. By this way the cumulative numerical errors of the floating point computations of the traditional algorithm can be avoided...|$|R
