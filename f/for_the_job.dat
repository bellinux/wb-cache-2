5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man {{selection}} panel installed Miller as captain in place of Morris.

Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new MapReduce cloud service model, Cura, for provisioning cost-effective MapReduce {{services in a}} cloud. In contrast to existing MapReduce cloud services such as a generic compute cloud or a dedicated MapReduce cloud, Cura {{has a number of}} unique benefits. Firstly, Cura is designed to provide a cost-effective solution to efficiently handle MapReduce production workloads that have a significant amount of interactive jobs. Secondly, unlike existing services that require customers to decide the resources to be used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs,</b> Cura leverages MapReduce profiling to automatically create the best cluster configuration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs.</b> While <b>the</b> existing models allow only a per-job resource optimization <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs,</b> Cura implements a globally efficient resource allocation scheme that significantly reduces the resource usage cost in the cloud. Thirdly, Cura leverages unique optimization opportunities when dealing with workloads that can withstand some slack. By effectively multiplexing the available cloud resources among <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> based on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> requirements, Cura achieves significantly lower resource usage costs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs.</b> Cura’s core resource management schemes include cost-aware resource provisioning, VM-aware scheduling and online virtual machine reconfiguration. Our experimental results using Facebook-like workload traces show that our techniques lead to more than 80 % reduction in the cloud compute infrastructure cost with upto 65 % reduction in job response times...|$|R

5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, {{one of the first}} magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E
5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> they presumed to do.

It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
