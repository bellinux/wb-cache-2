40|$|Purpose: of this paper: The {{paper is}} focused on {{presenting}} {{the outcome of the}} task set before its author by Professor Leszek A. Dobrzanski seven years ago, when he was a Dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland, concerning {{the development and implementation of}} the Faculty concept of research projects and education <b>in</b> automatic control, <b>mechatronics</b> and robotics. Design/methodology/approach: The assumptions of the task and short description of the outcome of the activities undertaken for the creation of a laboratory infrastructure are provided, together with research scop formulation and commercial results of cooperation with industrial companies. Findings: Following several years of activities coordinated by the author, particularly good conditions of educating <b>engineers</b> <b>in</b> <b>mechatronics</b> have been provided, including a unique laboratory infrastructure that is used both for research schemes, commercial projects <b>in</b> <b>mechatronics</b> and robotics conducted for industrial companies. Practical implications: Practical implications include a unique laboratory infrastructure and well developed and implemented projects in the field of mechatronics. Originality/value: This is a brand new paper...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the current understanding of mechatronics as an interdisciplinary subject. A {{conclusion is that}} mechatronics tends to attract contributions from many related fields, leading {{to a lack of}} focus as exemplified by many mechatronic conferences. Instead, the authors claim that <b>engineers</b> and researchers <b>in</b> <b>mechatronics</b> should concentrate on the opportunities and challenges arising specifically due to the interdisciplinary interactions which are characterizing <b>mechatronics.</b> Current practice <b>in</b> <b>mechatronics</b> engineering is characterised by a subsystem based approach by which integrated systems are built from technology homogeneous subsystems without a real demand on development of a certain technology {{as a result of its}} closer integration with other technologies. As opposed this it is claimed that mechatronics as an engineering science should focus on the interdisciplinary interactions, and based on these identify, formulate and conduct new research. The paper presents a s [...] ...|$|R
