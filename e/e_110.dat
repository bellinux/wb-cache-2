40|$|Transient {{holographic}} diffraction {{is observed}} {{for the green}} (GPR) and blue (BPR) absorbing proteorhodopsins (BAC 31 A 8 and HOT 75 M 1, respectively), {{as well as the}} GPR E 108 Q and BPR <b>E</b> <b>110</b> Q variants. In contrast to bacteriorhodopsin, where the metastable bR-M pair is responsible for generating diffraction, the pR and red-shifted N-like states fulfill that role in both the green and blue wild-type proteorhodopsins. The GPR E 108 Q and BPR <b>E</b> <b>110</b> Q variants, however, behave more similarly to their bacteriorhodopsin analogue, D 96 N, with diffraction arising from the PR M-state (strongly enhanced in both GPR E 108 Q and BPR <b>E</b> <b>110</b> Q). Of the four proteins evaluated, wild type (WT) GPR and GPR E 108 Q produce the highest diffraction efficiencies, Łmax, at 1 % for a 1. 7 OD sample. GPR E 108 Q, however, requires 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less laser intensity to generate Ł equivalent to WT GPR and BR D 96 N under similar conditions (as compared to literature values). WT BPR requires lower actinic powers than GPR but diffracts only about 30 % as well. BPR <b>E</b> <b>110</b> Q performs the most poorly of the four, with Łmax < 0. 05 % for a 1. 4 OD film. The Kramers-Kronig transformation and Koglenik’s coupled wave theory were used to predict the dispersion spectra and diffraction efficiency for the long M-state variants. To a first approximation, the gratings formed by all samples decay upon discontinuing the 520 nm actinic beams with a time constant characteristic of the appropriate intermediate: the N-like state for WT GPR and BPR and the M-state for GPR 108 Q and BPR <b>E</b> <b>110</b> Q...|$|E

40|$|The {{technical}} report {{is based on}} an earlier research on material properties of the M 5 structural material. Complementing this research with new M 5 data found in open literature, a set of correlations has been developed for the implementation to the TRANSURANUS code. This includes thermal, mechanical, and chemical (corrosion) properties of M 5. As an example, thermal capacity or burst stress correlations have been proposed using the available experimental data. The open literature provides a wide range of experimental data on M 5, but for some quantities they are not complete enough to be suitable for the implementation to the TRANSURANUS code. A balanced consideration of similarity of M 5 characteristics to those of Zircaloy- 4 (Zry- 4) or <b>E</b> <b>110</b> have therefore led to the recommendation to use some of these data selectively also for M 5.
