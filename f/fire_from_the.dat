5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they came under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half}} hours while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> air and from the fort, the attack bogged down to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to prevent}} the Dutch from {{refloating}} the grounded ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix, coming under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix {{to find that the}} Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenixs guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured. In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Air Traffic Control Officer John Davis, who was {{responsible}} for Flight 712 and had first spotted the port engine <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground, was appointed MBE.|$|E
50|$|A close {{examination}} of the trial transcript and the most reasonable interpretation of the evidence is that Davis killed Grimm while <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Avalon Hotel; McElfresh {{was killed by a}} Wobbly <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> IWW hall, and that Cassagranda was killed while running west on Second Avenue by a revolver probably fired by Davis <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Avalon Hotel.|$|R
5000|$|Chambered for the [...]357 Magnum, 9mm Parabellum, [...]40 S&W, or 9×21mm {{cartridges}} {{its most}} distinctive feature {{is that the}} barrel is on a low axis compared to other revolvers. <b>The</b> Rhino <b>fires</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lowermost chamber of the cylinder, rather than <b>firing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> topmost chamber.|$|R
60|$|At the top {{of their}} speed, they dashed down the road. No shot was <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wall, Dick's {{conjecture}} that the first impulse of the sentries would be to run down below having been justified. They were a couple of hundred yards away, before two shots were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gate. The bullets whistled by harmlessly.|$|R
5|$|San Martín's {{column was}} the first one to reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and the speed of the cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 10 U.S. {{aircraft}} {{were shot down}} by anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine. In total, the U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft machine-gunned Japanese survivors floating in the water. Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on the Japanese destroyers {{during the time that}} the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs {{from the first}} nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, {{but it was not}} a major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay, and prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E
5|$|By noon, Knyphausen and his Hessians {{restarted}} their advance. As soon as {{the tide}} was high enough, Mathew and his troops, accompanied by Howe, were ferried across the Harlem River. They landed under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up the hillside and dispersed the Americans until they reached a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans turned and ran towards the fort.|$|E

5|$|Deeper (average: 3m) {{and much}} wider (av. 10m) {{perimeter}} ditches (fossae). These would have flat floors {{rather than the}} traditional V-shape. Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other engines) to the walls. It would also concentrate attackers in an enclosed area where they would be exposed to missile <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> walls.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the bombers}} were intercepted.KG 2 lost five Do 17s in the attempt. Six Dorniers were also badly damaged. In return, {{accurate}} <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dornier gunners shot down two Hurricanes from the attacking Squadrons; No. 111, No. 151 and No. 74 Squadron led by Adolph Malan. Malan himself shot down one Do 17. Another source suggests {{the destruction of}} five Do 17s and another seven damaged. German manpower losses amounted to 11 killed in action and nine prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Firing {{began at}} 15:29 when Prudente {{unleashed}} a close range broadside at Centurion, followed immediately by <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ships of both sides. Centurion was damaged {{in the opening}} exchanges and by 16:00 had most of her sails and rigging torn. At this Renaud ordered his squadron to pull back to leeward out of range, each firing on Centurion as they passed.|$|E

5|$|Further west, the 9th Company of Nasu's 3rd Battalion charged {{straight}} into Puller's Company C at 01:15. Within five minutes, a Marine machine gun section led by Sergeant John Basilone killed almost {{every member of}} the 9th Company. By 01:25, heavy <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Marine divisional artillery was falling into Nasu's troop assembly and approach routes, causing heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Geißhardt, who {{was flying}} Fw 190 A-4 (Werknummer 7051—factory number) in Priller's Schwarm, was {{severely}} wounded in combat with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 Flying Fortress of the 306th Bomb Group on 5 April 1943. He {{had been hit}} by the defensive <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bombers. He was bleeding profusely from an abdominal wound but managed to make a smooth landing on the airfield at Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium. He succumbed to his injuries early the next morning on 6 April 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Brown {{was briefly}} hospitalized for hypertension, {{and near the}} end of his term, he {{underwent}} quadruple bypass surgery. While recovering from the surgery, Brown suffered a rare pulmonary disease, keeping him hospitalized for weeks, part of which he was comatose. He had no pulse for a period of time, and one of his lungs partially collapsed. Brown's office tried to conceal the seriousness of his condition, drawing <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> press. Following his recovery, he gave up smoking and took up jogging.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 1942 Marseille claimed six {{victories}} (nos. 127–132) but {{was hit by}} <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British-Canadian ace James Francis Edwards. Der Adler, a biweekly Nazi propaganda magazine {{published by}} the Luftwaffe, also reported his actions in volume 14 of 1942. Marseille was made famous through propaganda that treated fighter pilots as superstars. He regularly signed postcards with his image. Aside from Der Alder, his exploits were published in Die Berliner, Illustrierte, Zeitung and Die Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|On Fox Green, at {{the eastern}} end of Omaha, four {{sections}} of L/16 had survived their landing intact and were now leading elements of I/16, K/16 and E/116 up the slopes. With supporting <b>fire</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heavy weapons of M/16, tanks and destroyers, this force eliminated WN-60, which defended the draw at F-1; by 09:00, the 3rd battalion 16th RCT was moving inland.|$|E

50|$|The {{cavalier}} {{was also}} used as a gun signalling station. Three rounds were fired every day, at sunrise, noon and sunset. The former and the latter marked the opening and closing of the city gates. Gun signals continued to be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cavalier until around 1800, when they began to be <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearby Saluting Battery.|$|R
60|$|A battery on the eastward {{arm of the}} bay {{opened fire}} on the flag-ship, and this was also shelled. Twelve 8-inch shells were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> eastern forts, but all fell short. About five or six light shells were <b>fired</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> half {{completed}} batteries. Two of these whizzed over the New York, and one fell short.|$|R
