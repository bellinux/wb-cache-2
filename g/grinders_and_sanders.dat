5000|$|A {{widespread}} {{application of}} pneumatic motors is in hand-held tools, impact wrenches, pulse tools, screwdrivers, nut runners, drills, <b>grinders,</b> <b>sanders</b> <b>and</b> so on. Pneumatic motors {{are also used}} stationary {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Though overall energy efficiency of pneumatics tools is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools. They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power [...] and do not create sparks. They can be loaded to stop with full torque without damages.|$|R
