60|$|After {{that no more}} steamers came along, nor did I expect them. Warnings must by {{this time}} have been flying in all directions. But we {{had no reason to}} be {{dissatisfied}} with our first day. Between the Maplin Sands and the Nore we had sunk five ships of a total tonnage of about fifty thousand tons. Already the London markets would begin to feel the pinch. And Lloyd's--poor old Lloyd's--what a <b>demented</b> <b>state</b> it would be in! I could imagine the London evening papers and the howling in Fleet Street. We saw the result of our actions, for it was quite laughable to see the torpedo-boats buzzing like angry wasps out of Sheerness in the evening. They were darting in every direction across the estuary, and the aeroplanes and hydroplanes were like flights of crows, black dots against the red western sky. They quartered the whole river mouth, until they discovered us at last. Some sharp-sighted fellow with a telescope on board of a destroyer got a sight of our periscope, and came for us full speed. No doubt he would very gladly have rammed us, even if it had meant his own destruction, but that was not part of our programme at all. I sank her and ran her east-south-east with an occasional rise. Finally we brought her to, not very far from the Kentish coast, and the search- lights of our pursuers were far on the western skyline. There we lay quietly all night, for a submarine at night {{is nothing more than a}} very third-rate surface torpedo-boat. Besides, we were all weary and needed rest. Do not forget, you captains of men, when you grease and trim your pumps and compressors and rotators, that the human machine needs some tending also.|$|E
50|$|This is how events {{appear to}} the Alpha population. In reality, {{they are under}} the mental control of hostile aliens, who appear to the humans as family and friends {{comprising}} the crew of Superswift. The only person who can see them as they actually are is John Koenig. Three days previously while flying a reconnaissance mission, the Commander seemed to lose control of himself and, in his <b>demented</b> <b>state,</b> crashed {{in the vicinity of}} the nuclear-waste domes.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A 35 -year-old, {{previously}} healthy man presented psychiatric symptoms lasting four years, receiving {{treatment with}} neuroleptics. One year later he evolved with gait disequilibrium. After a further six months, cognitive symptoms were characterized with rapid evolution to a profound <b>demented</b> <b>state.</b> MRI showed signal changes in cerebral white matter and very long-chain fatty acids were detected in blood...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{elucidate}} the difference of hypothalamus- hypophysis dysregulation between depressive pseudodementia and dementia in aged popula- tion. Eight patients with pseudodementia due to major depression and eight patients with dementia of Alzheimer type or cerebral vascular dementia were investigated with the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test and the dexamethason supression test (DST). Plasma TSH level following injection of TRH and serum cortisol level after administration of dexamethason were measured. In the demented patients, both ΔTSH and serum cortisol level after administration of dexamethason were lower than those in the depressed patients. Since these differences were not significant, further investigation of the utility of TRH stimulation test and DST is necessary to improve our armamentarium for diagnosis and treatment of <b>demented</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use {{of music}} to {{decrease}} agitated behaviour of the <b>demented</b> elderly: the <b>state</b> of the science This paper reviews {{the state of the}} science of interventions using music to decrease the agitated behaviour of the demented elderly person. Seven research articles were located through computerized databases. The review of the literature suggested that music therapy is a useful intervention to help patients deal with a range of behaviour problems. However, overall weakness and limitations of studies are considerable. More rigorous research designs are required to evaluate the immediate and sustained physiological, psychological and sociological effects of music therapy on agitation behaviours of demented elderly. Some recommendations for future research are provided...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{cerebral}} beta amyloid (A beta) protein deposition is a necessary, but not sufficient, factor to develop the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present immunohistochemical study, we have investigated in AD the distribution of A beta associated proteins in the cerebral neocortex, in the cerebellar cortex where A beta plaques are mainly of the diffuse type, and also in the cerebral neocortex of non-demented patients with A beta plaques. Results show that immunolabeling for C 1 q, C 4 c, C 3 d, alpha 1 -ACT and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) occurs in the great majority of A beta plaques in all groups. ApoJ is present in A beta plaques of the cerebral neocortex in AD and in non-demented elderly, but is almost absent from those of the AD cerebellar cortex. C 4 Bp and P-component, in contrast to AD, rarely occurs in A beta plaques of the cerebral neocortex in the non-demented elderly. Heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) core protein and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) are absent in the diffuse A beta plaques in the AD cerebellum. These differences in distribution and expression of A beta associated proteins may be determined by brain region specific factors (cerebral cortex versus cerebellar cortex) and clinical <b>state</b> (<b>demented</b> versus non-demented cases). We suggest that, besides A beta peptide, certain A beta associated proteins are required for both amyloid plaque formation and for the induction of neurofibrillary change...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a long time since there were many elderly people in Japan. The medical care and costs for the elderly are enormous, and {{research}} to lower the mortality rate of the elderly is needed. We retrospectively investigated the prognostic factors for the survival of elderly patients who were hospitalized in the medical ward of our hospital. In total, 277 patients who were hospitalized between 1 January 2014 and 31 May 2017, were included in the retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses of items (vital signs, laboratory data, and so on) were performed, and significant differences between the survival group and death group were subjected to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Serum urea nitrogen levels and serum albumin levels provided a relatively high area under the curve (AUC). However, there was no item for which AUC exceeded 0. 70, and setting the cutoff value in this study was difficult. For treating the elderly, it is important to carefully evaluate each patient’s prognostic factors, including the <b>demented</b> <b>state,</b> renal function, and nutritional state; personalized treatment of each patient is also important...|$|E
