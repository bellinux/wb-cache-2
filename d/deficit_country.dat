2500|$|When {{exchange}} rates are fixed by a rigid gold standard, or when imbalances exist {{between members of}} a currency union such as the Eurozone, the standard approach to correct imbalances is by making changes to the domestic economy.

[...] When a country has a favourable trade balance, as a consequence of selling more than it buys it will experience a net inflow of gold. [...] The natural effect of this will be to increase the money supply, which leads to inflation and an increase in prices, which then tends to make its goods less competitive and so will decrease its trade surplus. [...] However the nation has the option of taking the gold out of economy (sterilising the inflationary effect) thus building up a hoard of gold and retaining its favourable balance of payments.

Prices will be reduced, making its exports more competitive, and thus correcting the imbalance. While the gold standard is generally considered to have been successful up until 1914, correction by deflation to the degree required by the large imbalances that arose after WWI proved painful, with deflationary policies contributing to prolonged unemployment but not re-establishing balance.

40|$|The {{overriding}} practical {{problem now}} is {{the tension between the}} global financial and market system and the national political and power structures. The main analytical short-coming lies in the failure to incorporate financial frictions, especially default, into our macro-economic models. Neither a move to a global sovereign authority, nor a reversion towards narrower economic nationalism, seems likely to take place in the near future. Meanwhile, the adjustment to economic imbalances remains asymmetric, with almost all the pressure on <b>deficit</b> <b>countries.</b> Almost by definition surplus countries are “virtuous”. But current account surpluses have to be matched by net capital outflows. Such capital flows to weaker <b>deficit</b> <b>countries</b> have often had unattractive returns. A program to give earlier and greater warnings of the risks of investing in <b>deficit</b> <b>countries</b> could lead to earlier policy reaction, and reduce the risk of crisis. ...|$|R

5000|$|Each item {{a member}} country {{exported}} would add bancors to its ICB account, and each item it imported would subtract bancors. Limits would {{be imposed on}} the amount of bancor a country could accumulate by selling more abroad than it bought, and {{on the amount of}} bancor debt it could rack up by buying more than it sold. This was to stop countries building up excessive surpluses or deficits. Each country's limits would be proportional to its share of world trade ... Once initial limits had been breached, deficit countries would be allowed to depreciate, and surplus countries to appreciate, their currencies. This would make <b>deficit</b> <b>country</b> goods cheaper, and surplus country goods more expensive, with the aim of stimulating a rebalancing of trade. Further bancor debit or credit position breaches would trigger mandatory action. For chronic debtors, this would include oligatory currency depreciation, rising interest payments to the ICB Reserve Fund, forced gold sales, and capital export restrictions. For chronic creditors, it would include currency appreciation and payment of a minimum of 5 percent interest on excess credits, rising to 10 percent on larger excess credits, to the ICB's Reserve Fund. Keynes never believed that creditors would actually pay what in effect were fines; rather, he believed they would take the necessary actions ... to avoid them.|$|E

40|$|The global {{imbalance}} {{explanation of}} the financial crisis of 2007 – 09 suggests that demand for riskless assets from countries with current account surpluses created fragility in countries with current account deficits, most notably in the United States. This paper examines this explanation by analyzing the geography of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits set up by large commercial banks. The paper shows that banks in surplus countries as well as banks in <b>deficit</b> <b>countries</b> manufactured riskless assets, totaling over $ 1. 2 trillion, by selling short-term ABCP to risk-averse investors, predominantly U. S. money market funds, and investing the proceeds primarily in long-term U. S. assets. As negative information about U. S. assets became apparent in August 2007, banks in both surplus and <b>deficit</b> <b>countries</b> experienced difficulties in rolling over ABCP and as a result suffered significant losses.

40|$|I got several {{comments}} from my audience {{to the effect}} that the story on the invention of real bills and discounting has only historical interest, and hardly any relevance to contemporary affairs. Actually, if the world is ever to return to a gold standard, we have to understand how it worked in the past. My researches show that economists have not succeeded in explaining its operation. They approached the issue from the position of mercantilism and from that of the Quantity Theory of Money. For example, theyexplained the adjustment mechanism governing foreign trade in terms of the international gold standard as follows. A country running a trade surplus is gaining gold while another running a deficit is losing it. The money supply of the surplus country grows, and that of the <b>deficit</b> <b>country</b> contracts. Other things being the same, there will be an increase in the price level in the surplus and a decrease in the <b>deficit</b> <b>country.</b> In the absence of trade barriers the surplus country will export less and import more, while the <b>deficit</b> <b>country</b> will export more and import less. This process will continue until the trade surplus/deficit disappears. International gold flows tend to reestablish equilibrium in the foreign trade accounts of gold standard countries, through their effect on the price level. So goes the argument. However, the available trade statistics show that this was not at all what was happening. International gold flows were negligible, and they were moved by other factors than payment for net imports. In fact, the adjustment mechanism worked not on the relative price levels, but on the discount rates of the trading countries. We must have a new theory of foreign trade, purged from the influence of mercantilism and the Quantity Theory of Money. In these Lectures I intend to develop this new theory of the gold standard in terms of the Real Bills Doctrine. Let us now return to The Secon...|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} a food <b>deficit</b> <b>country</b> for many years. Since 1994, however, grain {{production}} has increased steadily, with the largest crop on record reported in 1995 / 96. The apparent transition to food self-sufficiency is welcomed, yet it brings with it new development challenges. Grain prices {{in recent years have}} fallen far below their historical average. Concerns have arisen that lower prices may reverse the recent gains made in promoting use of fertilizer and improved seeds by smallholder farmers. In addition, national food selfsufficiency has not overcome the chronic food insecurity problem facing many people. Despite increased production and lower grain prices, {{a large segment of the}} rural population continues to be unable to secure an adequate food supply. The current situation is therefore one of food self-sufficiency co-existing with widespread poverty. Therefore, while there remains a clear need for continued food assistance for vulnerable groups, the typical method of importing food aid from donor countries was viewed as likely to exacerbate the country’s existing supply glut and further depress cereal prices to the detriment of agricultural production growth. To address this problem, the Government has arranged with donors to procure food aid from domestic markets through purchase from local traders...|$|E
