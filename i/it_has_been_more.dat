25|$|Lonnie Thompson and his {{research}} team have drilled ice cores from Quelccaya that date back almost 2,000 {{years and have}} used them to study changes in atmospheric conditions over this period. In these samples, the oxygen isotope ratio, oxygen-18 to oxygen-16, has risen abruptly in the last 50 years, an indicator of regional warming. As the ice cap is retreating, it is exposing almost perfectly preserved, unfossilized plant specimens that have been dated to 5,200 years before present, indicating that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 50 centuries since the ice cap was smaller than it is today.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{previously}} mentioned river terraces, the one known as TT-4 is only visible near Narros del Castillo (Ávila). Terrace TT-3 {{is the best}} preserved of the lot; although its height on {{the bed of the}} stream is not constant, it clearly stands out on the floodplain. Terrace TT-2 is quite well preserved as well, although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> heavily sculptured by other small tributaries of the Trabancos River. By contrast, terrace TT-1 is greatly eroded; although some sections survive to the south of the municipality of Alaejos (Valladolid), they are very difficult to differentiate from the colluvium floor that covers the Superficie de Alaejos. Entering into land in the municipality of Pollos, the stream stops to form river terraces, cutting traversely and lowering enough (between 40 and 60 meters) to meet the terrace deposits of the Duero River.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, beavers {{were brought}} to Tierra Del Fuego in {{southern}} Chile and Argentina for commercial fur production and introduced near Fagnano Lake. Although the fur enterprise failed, 25 mating pairs of beavers were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the main island, and to other islands in the archipelago, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. Although they have been considered an invasive species, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> recently shown that the beaver have some beneficial ecological effects on native fish {{and should not be}} considered wholly detrimental. Although the dominant Lenga beech (Nothofagus pumilio) forest can regenerate from stumps, most of the newly created beaver wetlands are being colonized by the rarer native Antarctic beech (Nothofagus antarctica). It is not known whether the shrubbier Antarctic beech will be succeeded by the originally dominant and larger Lengo beech, however, and the beaver wetlands are readily colonized by non-native plant species. In contrast, areas with introduced beaver were associated with increased populations of the native catadromous puye fish (Galaxias maculatus). Furthermore, the beavers did not seem to have a highly beneficial impact on the exotic brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) which have negative impacts on native stream fishes in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile. They have also been found to cross saltwater to islands northward; and reached the Chilean mainland in the 1990s. On balance, because of their landscape-wide modifications to the Fuegian environment and because biologists want to preserve the unique biota of the region, most favor their removal.|$|E

500|$|Andrade's final {{project was}} a long poem called [...] "Meditação Sôbre o Tietê." [...] The work is dense and difficult, and was {{dismissed}} by its early critics as [...] "without meaning", although recent work on <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> enthusiastic. [...] One critic, David T Haberly, has compared it favorably to William Carlos Williams's Paterson, a dense but influential unfinished epic using composite construction. [...] Like Paterson, it is a poem about a city; the [...] "Meditação" [...] is centered on the Tietê River, which flows through São Paulo. [...] The poem is simultaneously a summation of Andrade's career, commenting on poems written long before, and a love poem addressed {{to the river and}} to the city itself. [...] In both cases, the poem hints at a larger context: it compares the river to the Tagus in Lisbon and the Seine in Paris, as if claiming an international position for Andrade as well. [...] At the same time, the poem associates both Andrade's voice and the river with [...] "banzeiro," [...] a word from the Afro-Brazilian musical tradition: music that can unite man and river. [...] The poem is the definitive and final statement of Andrade's ambition and his nationalism.|$|E
500|$|As part of {{the bailout}} programme, Portugal was {{required}} to regain complete access to financial markets by September 2013. The first step towards this target was successfully taken on 3 October 2012, when the country managed to regain partial market access by selling a bond series with 3-year maturity. Once Portugal regains complete market access, measured as the moment it successfully manage to sell a bond series with a full 10-year maturity, {{it is expected to}} benefit from interventions by the ECB, which announced readiness to implement extended support in the form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMTs), aiming to bring governmental interest rates down to sustainable levels. A peak for the Portuguese 10-year governmental interest rates happened on 30 January 2012, where it reached 17.3% after the rating agencies had cut the governments credit rating to [...] "non-investment grade" [...] (also referred to as [...] "junk"). As of December 2012, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than halved to only 7%. A successful return to the long-term lending market was made by the issuing of a 5-year maturity bond series in January 2013, and the state regained complete lending access when it successfully issued a 10-year maturity bond series on 7 May 2013.|$|E
