Wildlife in Laos {{includes}} nearly 200 species of mammals, {{about the same}} number for reptiles and amphibians, and about 700 varieties of birds. Common mammals are gaurs (<b>wild</b> <b>oxen),</b> deer, bears, and monkeys. Endangered animals include elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, several types of <b>wild</b> <b>oxen,</b> monkeys, and gibbons. Snakes, skinks, frogs, and geckoes are abundant.

The king of Cornouaille proved to be the only person able to lift the body and place it on a bier, which healed his arm of an old wound. The <b>wild</b> <b>oxen</b> driving the cart walked straight to the saint's cell in the forest of Névez. There the body was interred and the little settlement of Locronan grew up around the burial place (§ 11).|$|R

5000|$|In India Prosopis spp {{had been}} {{introduced}} decades ago but it wasn’t until recently that its effects had been studied. This plant species has been pushing out the <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> ass (Equus hemionus khur). [...] This herbivorous mammal eats the pods of Prosopis spp, {{which is one of}} the intended purposes of its introduction. Through digesting and excreting the seeds the <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> asses are providing the habitat needed for germination. The 5,000 square-kilometer <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild</b> Ass Sanctuary is experiencing mesquite invasion of roughly 1.95 square-kilometers a year. By overtaking the land, the dense canopy cover of Prosopis spp has made it so native vegetation cannot grow. It has also made watering holes inaccessible to the animals within this region. This lack of resources and range is forcing the endangered <b>Indian</b> <b>wild</b> ass into human landscapes and agriculture fields and locals are killing these asses in order to protect their crops.|$|R
40|$|Presented diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{analysis}} of selected biologically active substances in different kinds of natural and peeled rice. In rice samples phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, content of saccharides and vitamin C were analysed. Active substances and saccharides were analysed by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and RP-HPLC-UV/VIS. Content of phenolic compounds and saccharides was measured before and after acid hydrolysis. The content of these compounds increased several times because of release of active substances from glycosides. As a part of diploma thesis basic sensory analysis was performed and consumer questionnaires were evaluated. The highest level of antioxidant activity was detected in <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild</b> rice. The highest content of total polyphenols and flavonoids was detected in Red Rice Natural before acid hydrolysis. After acid hydrolysis the highest content was detected in <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild</b> rice. The highest content of individual flavonoids, phenolic acids and catechins was detected in natural rice <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild,</b> Rice Three colours and in two samples of rice parboiled. The highest content of total and reducing saccharides was found in rice <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild</b> before hydrolysis, while after hydrolysis the content was very similar in all rice samples. The amount of individual monosaccharides after acid hydrolysis increased, while total content of disaccharides decreased. The highest value of simple sugars was detected in rice parboiled and <b>Indian</b> <b>Wild</b> rice.
