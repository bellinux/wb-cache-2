Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> its economic development potential.

25|$|Immigrant {{children}}—defined {{as those}} {{children under age}} eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation’s 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand their experiences <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing up in these families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families’ rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are {{denied the right to}} grow up with their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents.|$|E

So, I doubt not, {{it will continue to}} be for all time if it remains true to its great heritage and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty. But in view of the constitution, {{in the eye of the}} law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved....|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E
25|$|An {{asylum seeker}} is a {{displaced}} person or immigrant who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as the right to remain <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for complementary forms of protection. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the asylum seeker will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|E

500|$|Criticisms against Opus Dei have {{prompted}} Catholic scholars and writers like Piers Paul Read and Vittorio Messori to call Opus Dei {{a sign of}} contradiction, {{in reference to the}} biblical quote of Jesus as a [...] "sign that is spoken against". Said John Carmel Heenan, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster: [...] "One of the proofs of God's favor is to be a sign of contradiction. Almost all founders of societies in the Church have suffered. Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer is no exception. Opus Dei has been attacked and its motives misunderstood. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> elsewhere an inquiry has always vindicated Opus Dei." ...|$|E

500|$|Goldman and Berkman were {{released}} from prison during the United States' Red Scare of 1919–20, when public anxiety about wartime pro-German activities had morphed into a pervasive fear of Bolshevism {{and the prospect of}} an imminent radical revolution. Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer and J. Edgar Hoover, head of the US Department of Justice's General Intelligence Division, were intent on using the Anarchist Exclusion Act and its 1918 expansion to deport any non-citizens they could identify as advocates of anarchy or revolution. [...] "Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman," [...] Hoover wrote while they were in prison, [...] "are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> return to the community will result in undue harm." ...|$|E
500|$|Berkman and Goldman were {{released}} {{at the height}} of the first U.S. Red Scare; the Russian Revolutions of 1917, combined with anxiety about the war, produced a climate of anti-radical and anti-foreign sentiment. The U.S. Justice Department's General Intelligence Division, headed by J. Edgar Hoover and under the direction of Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer, initiated a series of raids to arrest leftists. While they were in prison, Hoover wrote: [...] "Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> if permitted to return to the community will result in undue harm." [...] Under the 1918 Anarchist Exclusion Act, the government deported Berkman, who had never applied for U.S. citizenship, along with Goldman and more than two hundred others, to Russia aboard the Buford.|$|E
