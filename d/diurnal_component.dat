5000|$|Some localities have unusual tidal characteristics, such as Gulf St Vincent, South Australia, {{where the}} amplitudes {{of the main}} semi-diurnal tide {{constituents}} are almost identical. At neap tides the semi-diurnal tide is virtually absent, resulting in the phenomenon known as a [...] "dodge tide"—a day-long period of slack water—occurring twice a month; this effect is accentuated near the equinoxes when the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> also vanishes, resulting {{in a period of}} 2-3 days of slack water.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{driver of}} the Sq current is the {{external}} (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height, while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights. A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component,</b> phase shifted by 180°. This {{appears to be the}} result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity [...] The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity. [...] Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150 km from the equator. Such enhancement of the Sq current by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. During a solar flare, bursts of solar radiation from the environment of an active sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet. During a solar eclipse, the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area. It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity. In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar thermosphere. This current system is called Ddyn.|$|E

40|$|The {{size and}} mass of Venus {{is similar to}} those of the Earth; however, its {{atmospheric}} dynamics are considerably different and they are poorly understood due to limited observations and computational difficulties. Here, we developed a data assimilation system based on the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) for a Venusian Atmospheric GCM for the Earth Simulator (VAFES), to make full use of the observational data. To examine the validity of the system, two datasets were assimilated separately into the VAFES forecasts forced with solar heating that excludes the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> Qz; one was created from a VAFES run forced with solar heating that includes the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> Qt, whereas the other was based on observations made by the Venus Monitoring Camera (VMC) onboard the Venus Express. The VAFES-LETKF system rapidly reduced the errors between the analysis and forecasts. In addition, the VAFES-LETKF system successfully reproduced the thermal tide excited by the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> of solar heating, even though the second datasets only included horizontal winds at a single altitude on the dayside with a long interval of approximately one Earth day. This advanced system could be useful in the analysis of future datasets from the Venus Climate Orbiter 'Akatsuki'...|$|E

The monthly rainfalls are estimated from the technique given by Wilheit et al.

40|$|This study investigates diurnal {{variations}} in lower-tropospheric wind over Japan during 2002 - 2008 {{using data from}} 31 stations of the Wind profiler Network and Data Acquisition System (WINDAS) and the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS). The diurnal and semidiurnal components are extracted and analyzed to identify the dominant processes for each height range and for each season. Near the surface, the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> is controlled by local wind systems (e. g., land-sea breezes) throughout the year. At 1 - 3 km, the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> is primarily controlled by the return currents of local wind systems, with additional influence by other disturbances; the superposition of these two wind systems generates amplitude maxima in spring (∼ 0. 5 m s^[- 1]) and autumn (∼ 0. 6 m s^[- 1]). At 3 - 5 km, the diurnal wind in DJF-MAM is controlled by medium-scale eastward traveling waves, which generate the amplitude maximum (∼ 0. 8 m s^[- 1]) in winter-spring. In JJA-SON, the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> is controlled by a large-scale wind system with an amplitude of ∼ 0. 3 m s^[- 1], probably related to the diurnal tide. At stations located on small islands located south of the Japanese mainland, the diurnal wind within the lower troposphere has different characteristics from those described above throughout the year. Throughout Japan, the semidiurnal wind component {{is controlled by the}} semidiurnal migrating tide above ∼ 1 km, and is influenced by local wind systems below ∼ 1 km.

40|$|In this study, {{the concept}} of scale {{analysis}} is applied to evaluate two state-of-science meteorological models, namely MM 5 and RAMS 3 b, currently being used to drive regional-scale air quality models. To this end, seasonal time series of observations and predictions for temperature, water vapor, and wind speed were spectrally decomposed into fluctuations operating on the intra-day, diurnal, synoptic and longer-term time scales. Traditional model evaluation statistics are also presented to illustrate how the method of spectral decomposition can help provide additional insight into the models ’ performance. The results indicate that both meteorological models under-represent the variance of fluctuations on the intra-day time scale. Correlations between model predictions and observations for temperature and wind speed are insignificant on the intra-day time scale, high for the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> because of the inherent diurnal cycle but low for the amplitude of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component,</b> and highest for the synoptic and longer-term components.

40|$|Context. The {{motion of}} small {{particles}} in planetary rings is affected {{in the long-term}} by radiation forces. While the Poynting-Robertson effect has been extensively discussed and applied to the dynamics of micron-sized ring particles, studies of thermal self-acceleration of particles are only in their infancy. Aims. We extend the pioneering work of Rubincam (2006, Icarus 184, 532) by a more thorough analytical formulation of both plane-tary and solar thermal forces on ring particles. Methods. Within a sparse disk model we analytically compute both seasonal and diurnal variants of the thermal forces and we demonstrate that the <b>diurnal</b> effect <b>components</b> vanish for a sample of rapidly rotating particles with randomly oriented spin axes. For sufficiently slowly rotating ring particles, though, these <b>diurnal</b> <b>components</b> might significantly modify the expected planetocentric secular drift rates of their orbits. We also {{take into account the}} orbital effects of Poynting-Robertson drag that begin to dominate the thermal forces for particles with sizes ≤ 5 mm. Our formulation of the Poynting-Robertson drag is the first to account properly for the influence of the planetary shadow. Results. We critically review the previous suggestion that Saturn’s A and B ring boundaries might correlate with radiative null-torque orbits of small particles. Using the best estimates of optical and thermal parameters of Saturn’s ring particles, we show that the mil-limetre to several centimetre size particles mostly drift inward to the planet with a characteristic radial speed νr ∼ 3 × 10 − 6 cm/s...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{response of}} circulation processes to external forcing has been quantified for the Columbia River estuary using in situ data from an existing coastal observatory. Circulation patterns were determined from four Acoustic Doppler Profilers (ADP) and several conductivity-temperature sensors {{placed in the}} two main channels. Because of the very strong river discharge, baroclinic processes {{play a crucial role}} in the circulation dynamics, and the interaction of the tidal and subtidal baroclinic pressure gradients plays a major role in structuring the velocity field. The input of river flow and the resulting low-frequency flow dynamics in the two channels are quite distinct. Current and salinity data were analyzed on two time scales?subtidal (or residual) and tidal (both <b>diurnal</b> and semidiurnal <b>components).</b> The residual currents in both channels usually showed a classical two-layer baroclinic circulation system with inflow at the bottom and outflow near the surface. However, this two-layer system is transient and breaks down under strong discharge and tidal conditions because of enhanced vertical mixing. Influence of shelf winds on estuarine processes was also observed via the interactions with upwelling and downwelling processes and coastal plume transport. The transient nature of residual inflow affects the long-term transport characteristics of the estuary. Effects of vertical mixing could also be seen at the tidal time scale. Tidal velocities were separated into their <b>diurnal</b> and semidiurnal <b>components</b> using continuous wavelet transforms to account for the nonstationary nature of velocity amplitudes. The vertical structure of velocity amplitudes were considerably altered by baroclinic gradients. This was particularly true for the <b>diurnal</b> <b>components,</b> where tidal asymmetry led to stronger tidal velocities near the bottom...|$|R
40|$|Solar heating {{generates a}} diurnal cycle in temperature, winds and {{pressure}} over the Earth. The direct solar heating {{of the atmosphere}} (e. g. absorption by ozone in the stratosphere) can act everywhere (Chapman and Lindzen, 1970), whereas indirect heating through surface fluxes will be inhomogeneous. Over land, the surface receives heat and transports it upward by small scale convection. The Rocky Mountains is a typical area for this (Banta and Schaaf, 1987). Several responses to diurnal heating are possible, e. g. sea breeze and mountain–plain circulation. Carbone et al. (2002), using radar composites, found eastward propagating diurnal precipitation systems over the Great Plains and the Mid-west, moving at a speed of about 20 m/s. In some other areas, such as the Bay of Bengal, satellites reveal a diurnal disturbance spreading southeastward parallel to the coast in winter with a propagation speed between 15 and 20 m/s (Yang and Slingo, 2001). In South America, diurnal convection propagates from the Andean ridge westward over the sea at a speed about 12 m/s (Mapes et al, 2003). The goal {{of this paper is}} to use hourly pressure data to reveal more properties of diurnal circulations. 2. Data analysis methods: The daily observed meteorological data like station pressure or sea level pressure data is a well recorded hourly data at hundreds of ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System) sites in the USA. By doing a harmonic analysis, we obtained the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> of the surface pressure with their amplitude and phase distribution over the United States (Mass et al, 1991). Our calculated phase of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> is given by the local solar time when the <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> of the surface pressure disturbance reaches its maximum.

40|$|International audienceTwo hourly-sampled time-series of soil-gas radon {{concentrations}} of durations {{of the order}} of a year have been investigated for periodic and anomalous phenomena. These time-series have been recorded in locations having little or no routine human behaviour and thus are effectively free of significant anthropogenic influences. One measurement site, Sur-Frêtes, is located in the French Alps, with saturated soil conditions; the second site, Syabru-Bensi, is located in Nepal, in a river terrace with unsaturated soil conditions. In such conditions, periodic components with periods ranging from 8 h to 7 days are often weak and intermittent and therefore, even in the presence of stationary forcing, difficult to identify. Two spectral decomposition techniques, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), have been applied to these time series and yield similar results. For Sur-Frêtes, weak diurnal and semi-diurnal components are observed with EMD, while SSA reveals only a <b>diurnal</b> <b>component.</b> In Syabru-Bensi, both EMD and SSA reveal a strong <b>diurnal</b> <b>component</b> and a weaker semi-diurnal component.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{data from the}} ion drift meter and the wind and {{temperature}} spectrometer on the DE 2 spacecraft to make statistical comparisons of the zonal ion and neutral drifts at dip latitudes (DLAT) in the +/- 35 deg range over all local times. Fourier analysis indicates that the superrotation and the <b>diurnal</b> <b>components</b> of both flows are strongly peaked at the dip equator, with the superrotation term becoming negative for the absolute value DLAT {{greater than or equal}} 20 deg. One interesting feature is the presence of a period (2200 - 0500 solar local time) in the 300 - 400 km altitude region near the dip equator where the ion drift is more strongly eastward than the neutral flow. This would seem to indicate the presence of an electric field source of greater strength than the F region dynamo elsewhere along the geomagnetic field line.

A considerable amount of effort {{has been made in}} searching for a conclusive origin of this apparent acceleration, however, without success till date. Detailed study of the data has revealed that an annual and a daily variation of the data exist and these can be interpreted as the fluctuating components of the apparent acceleration superimposed on the steady anomalous acceleration. Since these components are definitely related to the Earths motion an explanation has been found for these annual and diurnal fluctuations. The doppler effects due to the motions of the Earth are already incorporated in the model; there should thus be no residual redshift present in the results. It has been shown that the excess redshift of the signal between the Earth and Pioneer 10 due to inertial induction can manifest itself as the apparent acceleration of the spacecraft.

Inside about 10 Jupiter radii, the diffusion is probably driven by electric fields associated with the upper atmosphere dynamo which is driven by neutral winds in the ionosphere.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of over 50 planets around evolved stars {{and more than}} 35 debris discs orbiting white dwarfs highlight the increasing need to understand small body evolution around both early and asymptotic giant branch (GB) stars. Pebbles and asteroids are susceptible to strong accelerations from the intense luminosity and winds of GB stars. Here, we establish equations that can model time-varying GB stellar radiation, wind drag and mass loss. We derive the complete three-dimensional equations of motion in orbital elements due to (1) the Epstein and Stokes regimes of stellar wind drag, (2) Poynting-Robertson drag, and (3) the Yarkovsky drift with seasonal and <b>diurnal</b> <b>components.</b> We prove through averaging that the potential secular eccentricity and inclination excitation due to Yarkovsky drift can exceed that from Poynting-Robertson drag and radiation pressure by at least three orders of magnitude, possibly flinging asteroids which survive YORP spin-up into a widely dispersed cloud around the resulting white dwarf. The GB Yarkovsky effect alone may change an asteroid's orbital eccentricity by ten per cent in just one Myr. Damping perturbations from stellar wind drag {{can be just as}} extreme, but are strongly dependent on the highly uncertain local gas density and mean free path length.
