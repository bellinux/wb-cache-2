5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
5|$|After filming was completed, {{their public}} {{comments}} {{against each other}} propelled their animosity into a lifelong feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within 11 days of its nationwide release, and temporarily revived Crawford's career. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford secretly contacted {{each of the other}} Oscar nominees in the category (Katharine Hepburn, Lee Remick, Geraldine Page and Anne Bancroft, all East Coast-based actresses), {{to let them know that}} if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage when the absent Anne Bancroft was announced as the winner, and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed for the rest of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.|$|E

500|$|FDR {{aide and}} confidant Harry Hopkins, a widower, was close friends with Missy, {{especially}} after {{he moved into}} the White House himself in 1940.

[...] Settled there in comfort, she established a pattern to <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> she mostly followed for the next 20 years, her precise timetable determined by Palewski's varying availability.

However, she was very popular with the general public who knew her from her radio and motion picture appearances. It was during this phase of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> she first encouraged the Argentine population to refer to her not as [...] "Eva Perón" [...] but simply as [...] "Evita", which is a Spanish diminutive or affectionate nickname roughly equivalent to [...] "Little Eva" [...] or [...] "Evie." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking of her venture into art cinema years later, Bhatt commended her for not turning into [...] "a victim of her own success" [...] by refusing to become [...] "a part of the money-making machine". Mrinal Sen, who {{directed}} her in Antareen (1994), compared her to Sophia Loren and described her face as [...] "a landscape of desolation". According to Drishti (1990) director Govind Nihalani, Kapadia is [...] "genuinely interested in doing serious work, something that challenges her talent." [...] Following her success with Rudaali, a 1993 edition of Asiaweek reported that by this time Kapadia had long been [...] "a critic's darling".|$|E
500|$|... "Judas" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Lady Gaga, {{from her}} second studio album, Born This Way (2011). It was {{released}} four days ahead of schedule by Interscope Records on April 15, 2011. Written and produced by Lady Gaga and RedOne, [...] "Judas" [...] is a dance and electro house song about a woman {{in love with a}} man who betrayed her. It embodies the incidents that have haunted Gaga in the past, and its core meaning refers to the negative parts of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> she cannot escape. Gaga has further explained that the song was also about honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring oneself into the light. The artwork for the single was designed by Gaga in Microsoft Word. In spite of a polarizing impact on several religious groups, the song was generally well received by critics, who likened the song to [...] "Bad Romance" [...] with some noting it should have been the album's lead single.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, she {{published}} Assata: An Autobiography, {{which was}} written in Cuba. Her autobiography has been cited in relation to critical legal studies and critical race theory. The book does not give {{a detailed account of}} her involvement in the BLA or the events on the New Jersey Turnpike, except to say that the jury [...] "onvicted a woman with her hands up!" [...] It gives an account of her life beginning with her youth in the South and New York. Shakur challenges traditional styles of literary autobiography and offers a perspective on <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> is not easily accessible to the public. The book was published by Lawrence Hill & Company in the United States and Canada but the copyright is held by Zed Books Ltd. of London due to [...] "Son of Sam" [...] laws, which restrict who can receive profits from a book. In the six months preceding the publications of the book, Evelyn Williams, Shakur's aunt and attorney, made several trips to Cuba and served as a go-between with Hill. Her autobiography was republished in Britain in 2014 and a dramatized version performed on BBC Radio 4 in July 2017.|$|E
500|$|Shimomura lists Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, and Maurice Ravel {{as some of}} her {{influences}} on her personal website.

Despite these influences and her classical training, the diverse musical styles that she has used throughout her career and sometimes in the same soundtrack include [...] "rock, electronica, oriental, ambient, industrial, pop, symphonic, operatic, chiptune, and more". She draws inspiration for her songs from things in <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> move her emotionally, which she describes as [...] "a beautiful picture, scenery, tasting something delicious, scents that bring back memories, happy and sad things... Anything that moves my emotion gives me inspiration". Shimomura has also stated that she comes up with most of her songs when she is doing something that is [...] "not part of [...] daily routine, like traveling." [...] Although her influences are mostly classical, she has said that in her opinion her [...] "style has changed dramatically over the years, though the passion for music stays the same." [...] Shimomura has said that she believes that {{an important part of}} [...] "the creative process behind music" [...] is to [...] "convey a subtle message, something that comes from your imagination and sticks with the listener, without being overly specific about what it means", rather than only writing simple themes with obvious messages. Her favorite track that she has ever composed is [...] "Dearly Beloved" [...] from Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
500|$|During a {{press conference}} in Athens after the final, Kalomoira said that [...] "it was an honor... to {{represent}} Greece in this contest" [...] and thanked Greece because they supported her from the first moment she said she would compete. However, she reported later that she had returned to the United States because she felt mistreated by her record label and was not paid for several arrangements she had made with Heaven during her stay in Belgrade and had to pay for many things herself. In an interview with Downtown Magazine, Kalomoira's father stated that she was treated [...] "like dirt" [...] by Heaven Music and that she may or may not continue her singing career, but that it was up to her. In response, Makis Pounetzis, the new CEO of Heaven Music, claimed that he was [...] "surprised" [...] by Kalomoira's remarks and couldn't offer an explanation, though he did say that her contract would be honored should she choose to go back and sing again. Kalomoira returned to Greece in January 2009, and in an interview with Eleni Menegaki, she said that her Eurovision participation was the biggest thing that she has done in her career, and that it {{was also one of the}} most personal events in <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> will always be remembered with good memories. [...] When asked if she expected to do so well in the competition, she stated that she had always wanted to do well, but above all she wanted the Greek people to be proud of the performance regardless of how well it did. [...] In the same interview, host Eleni Menegaki stated that many, including herself, viewed Eurovision as a defining point in Kalomoira's career to date: her mature professional performance distanced her from the innocent little girl image associated with her participation in Fame Story.|$|E

500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of [...] "Lexmas", then Lana {{would have been able to}} truly love him.|$|E

In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms.
