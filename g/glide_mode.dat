When the projectile is 3,000 meters from the target, the guidance vanes extend, the target is acquired, and then the on-board guidance system adjusts the guidance vanes to maneuver onto the target.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glide</b> <b>mode</b> is {{used when}} the cloud ceiling and/or the {{visibility}} {{is too low}} to {{permit the use of}} the ballistic mode. A <b>glide</b> <b>mode</b> trajectory consists of two phases: a ballistic phase and a glide phase. At a predetermined point along the trajectory, the guidance vanes extend and there is a transition from ballistic phase to glide phase. Glide phase targeting logic is designed to ensure the largest possible angle of fall permitted by the cloud cover and the visibility. The target is acquired when the projectile is close enough to detect the laser illumination or when the projectile emerges from the cloud cover, whichever event occurs later in the trajectory. When a trajectory solution has been obtained, time-to-target and terminal velocity are checked to ensure that there will be enough time to maneuver and that the projectile is aerodynamically stableâ€”that it will not stall while maneuvering.|$|E

40|$|PETREL, a winged hybrid-driven {{underwater}} glider is a {{novel and}} practical marine survey platform which combines the features of legacy underwater glider and conventional AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle). It can {{be treated as a}} multi-rigid-body system with a floating base and a particular hydrodynamic profile. In this paper, theorems on linear and angular momentum are used to establish the dynamic equations of motion of each rigid body and the effect of translational and rotational motion of internal masses on the attitude control are taken into consideration. In addition, due to the unique external shape with fixed wings and deflectable rudders and the dual-drive operation in thrust and <b>glide</b> <b>modes,</b> the approaches of building dynamic model of conventional AUV and hydrodynamic model of submarine are introduced, and the tailored dynamic equations of the hybrid glider are formulated. Moreover, the behaviors of motion in glide and thrust operation are analyzed based on the simulation and the feasibility of the dynamic model is validated by data from lake field trials.

40|$|This work generalizes our {{previous}} works on fcc-bcc martensitic transformations {{to the larger}} family of transformations in the fcc-bcc-hcp system and to fcc-fcc mechanical twinning. The analytical expressions of the atomic displacements and lattice distortions are calculated directly from the orientation relationships without any adjustment of free parameter; the unique assumption is that the atoms are hard-spheres that cannot interpenetrate themselves. The habit planes are predicted on the simple criterion that they are unrotated by the distortion, {{and the results are}} compared to experimental observations published in literature. It is shown that shuffle is required for transformations implying the hcp phase because the hcp primitive Bravais lattice contains two atoms, instead of one for the fcc and bcc phases. A simple encoding of the lattice distortions and shuffles permits to attribute a groupoid structure to the transformations in the fcc-hcp-bcc system. The analytical expressions of the intermediate states are given and could be used to calculate activation energies. The martensitic distortion occurs in one-step, without shearing, and its accommodation generates orientation gradients in the parent phase, independently of its <b>glide</b> <b>modes.</b> The concept of reversibility is detailed on the basis of crystallographic and morphological arguments. The possibility to apply this approach to diffusion-limited martensitic transformations is discussed. Comment: 46 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

The man-lifting kite and glider program of 1961 forward also produced the Paresev and gave a wing that was to be used in popular hang gliding.|$|E

40|$|Correlations between {{yield stress}} #sigma#_y, uniform strain #epsilon#_u, mean work {{hardening}} coefficient and {{ultimate tensile stress}} of bcc. and fcc. polycrystalline metals are derived from microstructural related work hardening models. These relations are primarily formed by the dislocation <b>glide</b> <b>mode,</b> dynamic recovery and hardening mechanism. For glide by double kinks in screw dislocations at lower temperatures of bcc. - (L) metals the uniform strain drops with strengthening according to #epsilon#_u#propor to# 1 /#sigma#_y" 2 due to dominant lattice friction, precipitation or grain boundary hardening. In contrast, for fcc. alloys generally but also for bcc. -(H) metals at higher temperatures a comparably stronger strength dependency #epsilon#_u#approx =##epsilon#_u_,_ 0 [1 -(#sigma#_y/#sigma#_c) "z] with z= 1, 2 and #epsilon#_u_,_ 0 #<=# 0. 5 has been found. #sigma#_c describes the upper yield strength limit for work hardening and uniform strain appearance. This strength limit which for bcc. metals also arises for dominant dislocation hardening characterizes microstructural parameters like mean dislocation glide distance, glide systems or hardening mechanism. It correlates also to the mean work hardening coefficient and ultimate tensile as well as fracture strength. Especially the influence from the precipitation volume fraction and the grain size are considered. Critical values {{have been found to}} control the experimentally observed ductility minimum. The mechanism of precipitation hardening and its impact on uniform strain behaviour of bcc. and fcc. metals is different. In this case a diagram is given for the mechanism-related optimization of ductility. The influence of grain refinement on uniform strain is mainly formed by the additionally contribution of grain boundaries to dislocation generation, the dislocation <b>glide</b> <b>mode</b> and the resulted change in deformation mechanism from dislocation glide to creep or grain boundary sliding. Finally, the model is applied for analysis of ductility and deformation behaviour of austenitic Cr/Ni- and martensitic 9 - 12 % Cr steels especially with regard to hardening and microstructural changes by neutron irradiation, cold working or heat treatment. The effect of precipitation hardening on ductility will be discussed on spheroidized high-carbon steels. (orig.) 69 refs.

40|$|International audienceInstruments {{that belong}} to the gong family exhibit {{nonlinear}} dynamics at large amplitudes of vibration. In the specific case of the xiaoluo gong, this nonlinear behavior results in a pitch <b>glide</b> of several <b>modes</b> of the instrument in addition to harmonic distortion and internal resonances. This study applies a linear modal active control to a xiaoluo gong {{in an attempt to}} change its sound properties. First, a modal damping control of the fundamental mode based on a linear identification and a state space controller is applied in the small amplitude regime (no pitch glide). Results indicate that modal control influences not only the controlled mode but also the frequency components involved in distortion or internal resonance phenomena. Second, a modal damping control is performed in the large amplitude regime (in the presence of pitch glide). Results show that modal control does not affect the pitch glide. However, the controller becomes effective at a time trigger which is related to the instantaneous frequency...|$|R
40|$|Identification of {{chemical}} compounds with specific biological activities {{is an important}} step in both chemical biology and drug discovery. When the structure of the intended target is available, one approach is to use molecular docking programs to assess the chemical complementarity of small molecules with the target; such calculations provide a qualitative measure of affinity {{that can be used in}} virtual screening (VS) to rank order a list of compounds according to their potential to be active. rDock is a molecular docking program developed at Vernalis for high-throughput VS (HTVS) applications. Evolved from RiboDock, the program can be used against proteins and nucleic acids, is designed to be computationally very efficient and allows the user to incorporate additional constraints and information as a bias to guide docking. This article provides an overview of the program structure and features and compares rDock to two reference programs, AutoDock Vina (open source) and SchroÌˆdingerâ€™s Glide (commercial). In terms of computational speed for VS, rDock is faster than Vina and comparable to <b>Glide.</b> For binding <b>mode</b> prediction, rDock and Vina are superior to Glide. The VS performance of rDock is significantly better than Vina, but inferior to Glide for most systems unless pharmacophore constraints are used; in that case rDock and Glide are of equal performance.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{evolutionary}} history of marine mammals involved marked phys-iological and morphological modifications {{to change from}} terrestrial to aquatic locomotion. A consequence of this ancestry is that swimming is energetically ex-pensive for mammals in comparison to fish. This study examined the use of be-havioral strategies by marine mammals to circumvent these elevated locomotor costs during horizontal swimming and vertical diving. Intermittent forms of loco-motion, including wave-riding and porpoising when near the water surface, and prolonged gliding and a stroke and <b>glide</b> <b>mode</b> of propulsion when diving, enabled marine mammals {{to increase the efficiency}} of aquatic locomotion. Video instru-mentation packs (8 -mm camera, video recorder and time-depth microprocessor) deployed on deep diving bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), northern ele-phant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) revealed exceptionally long periods of gliding during descent to depth. Glide du-ration depended on depth and represented nearly 80 % of the descent for dives exceeding 200 m. Transitions in locomotor mode during diving were attributed to buoyancy changes with compression of the lungs at depth, and were associated with a 9 â€“ 60 % reduction in the energetic cost of dives for the species examined. By changing to intermittent locomotor patterns, marine mammals are able to increase travelling speed for little additional energetic cost when surface swimming, and to extend the duration of submergence despite limitations in oxygen stores when div-ing...|$|E
40|$|Human {{proto-oncogene}} tyrosine-protein kinase YES (YES) is a non {{receptor kinase}} belongs to Src family. This gene lies {{in close proximity}} to thymidylate synthase gene on chromosome 18, and a corresponding pseudogene has been found on chromosome 22. In hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma elevated human YES activity was observed. Inhibitors of human YES reported till date are in clinical trials and associated with several side effects. The present study was mainly aimed in homology modeling of human YES and discovery of novel lead molecules that inhibit YES kinase more efficiently with fewer side effects. Virtual screening and docking techniques were applied to identify novel lead molecule of YES kinase. As there was no reported human YES crystal structural data, the three dimensional structure of human YES was constructed based on template structure (PDB ID: 2 H 8 H) obtained through homology search using MODELLER 9 V 7. The model was refined, energy minimized and assessed through PROCHECK. Active site residues of human YES were identified from the homology model in complex with template ligand AZD 0530 and were further confirmed using CASTp. Five published inhibitors of YES family (Dasatinib, Bosutinib, SU 6656, AZD 0530 and CGP 77675) were identified through literature search. High throughput virtual screening method at Ligand. Info was applied for these five inhibitors to establish a library of 1932 structural analogs. LigPrep was used to generate possible conformations of each ligand molecules from structural analog library. The ligand duplicates conformers, ligands having reactive functional group and poor ADME properties were rejected from the prepared dataset. Glide 5. 5 was used to generate a grid box by picking the active site residues of human YES protein. Through sequential applications of stringent <b>mode</b> <b>glide</b> docking procedures from Glide HTVS to SP to XP respectively, 13 potential inhibitors were proposed. The docking complexes of each inhibitor with human YES protein were analyzed and lead &#x 2018; 1 &#x 2019; molecule was identified to have higher binding affinity to human YES protein (XP Gscore: - 12. 07 Kcal/mol) compared to existing published inhibitors and other 12 lead molecules. The lead &#x 2018; 1 &#x 2019; - human YES docking complex was highly stabilized through hydrogen bond network with amino acid residues Thr 348, Asp 358, Asp 414 and Phe 415. Moreover, from the results obtained we could decipher that lead &#x 2018; 1 &#x 2019; molecule can be raised into potential inhibitors after binding assays, substantiated experimental investigations and passing several phases of clinical trials...|$|R
