Based on morphology, size, and analogy to terrestrial <b>ground</b> <b>ice</b> forms, these Athabascan features are interpreted as pingos, collapsing pingos, pingo scars, and thermal contraction polygons, respectively. Thermal Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (THEMIS) data and geological features {{in the area are}} consistent with a sedimentary substrate underlying these features. These observations lead us to favor a <b>ground</b> <b>ice</b> interpretation, although we do not rule out volcanic and especially glaciofluvial hypotheses.

The <b>ground</b> <b>ice</b> implicit in the hypothesized thermal contraction polygons may have derived either from this flooding/ground water, or from atmospheric water vapor. The lack of obvious flood modification of the mounds and rimmed features indicates that they formed after the most recent flood inundated the area.

5000|$|Detailed {{studies of}} the paleontology, sedimentology, and {{stratigraphy}} of glacial and nonglacial deposits within the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent parts of the Weddell Sea and its Pacific continental shelf have found {{that it has become}} progressively glaciated as the climate of Antarctica dramatically and progressively cooled during the last 37 million years. This progressive cooling was contemporaneous with a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. During this climatic cooling, the Antarctic Peninsula was probably the last region of Antarctica to have been fully glaciated. Within the Antarctic Peninsula, mountain glaciation was initiated during the latest Eocene, about 37-34 [...] The transition from temperate, alpine glaciation to a dynamic ice sheet occurred about 12.8 [...] At this time, the Antarctic Peninsula formed as the bedrock islands underlying it were overridden and joined together by an ice sheet in the early Pliocene about 5.3-3.6 [...] During the Quaternary period, the size of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has fluctuated in response to glacial-interglacial cycles. During glacial epochs, this ice sheet was significantly thicker than it is currently and extended {{to the edge of the}} continental shelves. During interglacial epochs, the West Antarctica Ice Sheet was thinner than during glacial epochs and its margins lay significantly inland of the continental margins. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 to 18,000 years ago, the ice sheet covering the Antarctic Peninsula was significantly thicker than it is now. Except for a few isolated nunataks, the Antarctic Peninsula and its associated islands were completely buried by the ice sheet. In addition, the ice sheet extended past the present shoreline onto the Pacific outer continental shelf and completely filled the Weddell Sea up to the continental margin with <b>grounded</b> <b>ice.</b> The deglaciation of the Antarctic Peninsula largely occurred between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago as an interglacial climate was established in the region.

Within the Weddell Sea, the transition from <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> to a floating ice shelf occurred about 10,000 years ago. The deglaciation of some locations within the Antarctic Peninsula continued until 4,000 to 3,000 years ago. Within the Antarctic Peninsula, an interglacial climatic optimum occurred about 3,000 to 5,000 years ago. After the climate optimum, a distinct climate cooling, which lasted until historic times, occurred.|$|E

The <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> boundary is 53 610 km long; 74 % abuts to floating ice shelves or outlet glaciers, 19 % is adjacent to open or sea-ice covered ocean, and 7 % of the boundary ice terminates on land. The freely-floating boundary, called here the hydrostatic line, is the most landward position on ice shelves that expresses the full amplitude of oscillating ocean tides. It extends 27 521 km and is discontinuous. Positional (one-sigma) accuracies of the <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> boundary vary {{an order of magnitude}} ranging from +/- 52 m for the land and open-ocean terminating segments to +/- 502 m for the outlet glaciers. The hydrostatic line is less well positioned with errors over 2 km. Elevations along each line are selected from 6 candidate digital elevation models based on their agreement with ICESat elevation values and surface shape inferred from the Landsat imagery. Elevations along the hydrostatic line are converted to ice thicknesses by applying a firn-correction factor and a flotation criterion. BEDMAP-compiled data and other airborne data are compared to the ASAID elevations and ice thicknesses to arrive at quantitative (one-sigma) uncertainties of surface elevations of +/- 3. 6, +/- 9. 6, +/- 11. 4, +/- 30 and +/- 100 m for five ASAID-assigned confidence levels.

We characterize three sediment facies associations of two Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves (Larsen-A and Larsen Inlet). Subglacial facies consist mainly of basal till (diamicton) with high shear strengths deposited under a <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> sheet. Progressive upward decrease in shear strength reflects a gradual decrease in the confining vertical effective pressure of <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> during till deposition. Proximal ice-shell glacimarine facies (diamicton, gravel-rich and sand-rich facies, gravelly mud, dropstone Mud and sands muds) ere deposited by sub-ice-shelf rain out, bottom current activity and sediment gravity flows following decoupling of <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> from the sea-floor, Distal, he-shell glacimarine and/or open marine facies comprise terrigenous and diatom-bearing bioturbated muds and gravelly muds that contain limited ice-rafted debris these accumulated after recession of the grounding line to the coast, with coarse-grained surface sediments possible documenting most recent ice-shelf break-up.

In the Ross Sea, our analysis shows that West Antarctic glaciation had begun by the late Oligocene, much earlier than usually interpreted from the paleoceanographic proxy data. Continental ice probably existed on Marie Bird Land and other highland areas of the West Antarctica. In the central Ross Sea, ice caps nucleated on the subaerially elevated basement horst blocks of the Central and Coulman Highs. Ice caps waxed and waned across the shallow-marine platforms rimming these broad basement uplifts. These temperate glacial systems delivered much sediment to the surrounding deepwater shelf basins. Ice cap oscillations during the early and middle Miocene also included significant intervals of <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> retreat and resumption of widespread marine sedimentation. By the end of the middle Miocene, glaciation intensified, local ice caps coalesced, and <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> with cross-shelf ice streams eventually extended across the entire Ross Sea continental shelf.
