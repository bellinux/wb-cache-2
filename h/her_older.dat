Yet {{he did not feel}} it a contradiction that he should be sorry to see her so unlike <b>her</b> <b>old</b> self, and sorry {{at the same time to}} hear her speaking in <b>her</b> <b>old</b> manner. The two things seemed quite natural.|$|R

50|$|Enso-Gutzeit, {{the owner}} of Finnlines, took over the Finlandia from Finland Steamship Company on 16 June 1975, ceding Finncarrier to Finland SS Co in exchange.

5|$|Imelda {{finished}} Grade One in {{the nearby}} Holy Ghost College, where <b>her</b> <b>older</b> half-sisters also studied. Registration records of the College from school year 1936–1937 showed that Imelda did not enrol again. This disappearance was easily accounted for by two sets of pictures of Imelda, which were taken at her First Communion at the Holy Infant Academy in Tacloban, Leyte.|$|E

5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and <b>her</b> <b>older</b> brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post.

Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E

60|$|It {{would be}} a great thing for his mother to be left in <b>her</b> <b>old</b> house, among <b>her</b> <b>old</b> friends, in {{possession}} of <b>her</b> <b>old</b> income. As regarded money, they would all be sufficiently well provided for. For himself, his fellowship and his prescribed stipend would be more than enough. But there was something in the proposition that was very distasteful to him. He did not begrudge the money to his mother; but he did begrudge her the right of having it from any one but himself.|$|R

Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E
