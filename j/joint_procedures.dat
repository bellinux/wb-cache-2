5000|$|Thus the government's role {{during the}} AIDS crisis {{was seen as}} being more {{reactive}} than proactive, as described {{by members of the}} medical community such as Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, who saw that very few programs were being funded for AIDS prevention. When Dr. Boufford became president of the NYC Health and Hospitals Commission in 1985, five years after the AIDS crisis had hit New York City, her first task was to develop a primary care strategy for AIDS patients. Dr. Boufford's team encountered several problems: since governmental involvement had been delayed, doctors had to deal with terminally ill patients; the disease was still being viewed as a homosexual disease, so prevention and advertising was very limited; perhaps most importantly, funds were being used reactively instead of proactively. In a sense, Dr. Boufford reported, the HIV crisis transformed the care system, including housing, support, primary care, and coordinated care management, more than any previous medical crisis. She also explained that the hospitals had to become more like a family doctor rather than an ambulatory care system. When it came to funding, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) also had {{to make sure that the}} investments coming in were strengthening the system, especially because, as Dr. Boufford explained, [...] "we tend to fund acute care hospitals in the United States, and we're very hospital-oriented, very specialty-oriented country in terms of our investments ... we're over invested in acute healthcare." [...] On June 17, 1985, a meeting with voluntary hospitals was held to establish <b>joint</b> <b>procedures</b> for working with AIDS patients. The HHC began employee training programs, and created videos, discussions guides and booklets. The HHC also established protective guidelines for employees.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Major {{haemorrhage}} developing during oral or maxillofacial {{surgery is}} uncommon, but potentially life-threatening. Dental extractions in childhood are common, but blood loss is unusual. Case presentation: Here, we report a rare {{case of a}} complication developing during a trivial deciduous tooth extraction. We focus on the great difference between the preoperative orthopantomography and the maxillo-facial computed tomography obtained post-haemorrhage. Discussion: The surgical procedures most commonly associated with acute haemorrhage are orthognathic, oncological, and temporomandibular <b>joint</b> <b>procedures.</b> When acute haemorrhage develops, the surgeon must remain calm, temporarily arrest the bleeding, and ultimately definitively control it. Although ligation of the offending artery, vein, or vascular malformation is clearly the treatment of choice, identifying the offending vessel and gaining adequate access thereto are often difficult.

METHODS: All cases of SA in Iceland from 1990 - 2002 were identified by thorough review of the available medical information. The results of synovial fluid cultures from every microbiology department in Iceland were checked and positive culture results reviewed, as well as patient charts with a discharge diagnosis of septic arthritis (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) code M 009). RESULTS: A total of 253 cases of SA (69 children and 184 adults) were diagnosed in Iceland in 1990 - 2002, giving an average incidence of 7. 1 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants. The incidence of SA increased from 4. 2 cases/ 100, 000 in 1990 to 11. 0 cases/ 100, 000 in 2002. This rise in SA was primarily observed in adults where the incidence rose by 0. 61 cases/ 100, 000 per year (p< 0. 001). SA was iatrogenic in 41. 8 % of adults and the number of iatrogenic infections increased from 2. 8 cases/year in 1990 - 1994 to 9. 0 cases/year in 1998 - 2002 (p< 0. 01). The annual number of arthroscopies increased from 430 in 1990 - 1994 to 2303 in 1998 - 2002 (p< 0. 001) and there was a correlation between the total usage of intra-articular drugs in Iceland and the incidence of SA (p< 0. 01). The frequency of post-arthroscopy SA was 0. 14 % and post-arthrocentesis SA 0. 037 %. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SA has increased in recent years due to an increased number of arthroscopies and joint injections. Although the frequency of SA per procedure has not changed, these results emphasise the importance of sterile technique and firm indications for <b>joint</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Open <b>joint</b> <b>procedures</b> using bone anchors {{have shown}} {{clinical}} and radiograph good success, but post surgical disc position {{has not been}} documented with MRI imaging. We have designed a modified technique of using two bone anchors and 2 sutures to reposition the articular discs. This MRI study evaluates the post surgical success of this technique to reposition and stabilize the TMJ articular discs. Methods Consecutive 81 patients with unilateral TMJ internal derangement (ID) (81 TMJs) were treated between December 1, 2003, and December 1, 2006, at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Ninth Peoples Hospital, Shanghai, Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. All patients were subjected to magnetic resonance imaging before and one to seven days post surgery to determine disc position using the modified bone anchor technique. Results Postoperative MRIs (one to seven days) confirm that 77 of 81 joints were identified as excellent results and one joint was considered good for an overall effective rate of 96. 3 % (78 of 81 joints). Only 3. 7 % (3 of 81) of the joints were designated as poor results requiring a second open surgery.
