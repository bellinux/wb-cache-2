40|$|Using four {{samples from}} the United States and China, we {{developed}} two theoretically based abridged job insecurity (JI) scales to address researcher concerns with {{the length of the}} original 57 -item scale. These two scales contained all the components of the scale originally developed and validated by Ashford et al., 1989. Our abridged scale has 37 <b>items</b> (18 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> job features, 16 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> total job, and 3 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> powerlessness). We further developed a bare-bones scale with only 25 <b>items</b> (10 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> job features, 12 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> total job, and 3 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> powerlessness). Results show that the content and construct validities of both the abridged and the bare-bones scales are highly similar to the original JI scale. Our results provide support for the use of either the abridged or the bare-bones JI scales. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

30|$|The TBL model {{validated}} by both EFA and CFA {{suggests that the}} TBL model {{can be used as}} an accounting framework for consumers’ perceived sustainability of fashion brands. Since RQ 1 is asking the applicability of TBL model for both fast and sustainable fashion brands, individually, the analyses described above were repeated for a separate sample of fast fashion brands and sustainable fashion brands. Results were generally similar to that of analysis for the entire sample. However, several measurement <b>items</b> <b>for</b> the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability were not grouped together as theorized. For instance, for fast fashion brands, two <b>items</b> <b>for</b> social sustainability (“[xyz]’s products are made under safe and healthy working conditions, without child labor or sweatshops,” “[xyz] prefers local production of their clothing”) were grouped as one factor and the rest of two <b>items</b> <b>for</b> social sustainability and four <b>items</b> <b>for</b> environmental sustainability were grouped as another factor. For sustainable fashion brands, two <b>items</b> <b>for</b> environmental sustainability (“toxic chemicals are not used in production by [xyz],” “[xyz] adopts environmentally friendly production practices”) were grouped on one factor and the rest of two <b>items</b> <b>for</b> environmental sustainability and four <b>items</b> <b>for</b> social sustainability were grouped together as another factor. Yet for both groups of brands, economic sustainability was clearly represented as one single factor.|$|R
5|$|The batik {{industry}} of Java flourished {{from the late}} 1800s to early 1900s, but declined during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. With increasing preference of western clothing, the batik industry further declined following the Indonesian independence. Batik has somewhat revived {{at the turn of}} the 21st century, through the efforts of Indonesian fashion designers to innovate batik by incorporating new colours, fabrics, and patterns. Batik has become a fashion <b>item</b> <b>for</b> many Indonesians, and may be seen on shirts, dresses, or scarves for casual wear; it is a preferred replacement for jacket-and-tie at certain receptions. Traditional batik sarongs are still used in many occasions.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's release, an {{official}} prelude story {{was published by}} way of a multimedia web site. The interactive site was depicted as the diary of Antoine Cartier-Wells, founder of the Memorize corporation and creator of the Sensen brain implant, and it tells the story of Memorize during the 100 years preceding the start of the game. At the time of the game's release, a 24-page print comic book written by Matt Kindt and illustrated by Matthew Southworth was released by Dark Horse Comics, as an exclusive bonus <b>item</b> <b>for</b> those who pre-ordered the game from GameStop. Dark Horse later published a 184-page hardcover book featuring concept art and developer commentary. On 20 June 2013, another official prelude story was published, this time set months {{before the start of the}} game, and centring on the character of Nilin. Titled The Pandora Archive, it was written by British novelist Scott Harrison and published by Capcom as an e-book.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{created a}} greatly {{simplified}} version for the Game & Watch multiscreen. Other ports include the Amiga, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC booter, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to Nintendo's Family Computer (Famicom) console in 1983 {{as one of}} the system's three launch titles; the same version was an early title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). However, the cement factory level is not included, nor are most of the cutscenes since Nintendo did not have large enough cartridge ROMs available in the beginning. This port includes a new song composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the title screen; an arrangement of the tune appears in Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Animal Crossing for the GameCube and as an <b>item</b> <b>for</b> purchase on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U version is also the last game that was released to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Japanese version of the NES, the Famicom. The original arcade version of the game appears in the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64. Nintendo released the NES version on the e-Reader and for the Game Boy Advance Classic NES series in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The Famicom version of the game sold 840,000 units in Japan.|$|E

Forty-eight of 49 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> literacy were included, 37 of 49 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> numeracy, and 14 of 14 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> problem solving. The proportion of disengaged responses in the remaining items varied between 0.12 and 18.67 % for literacy, between 0.04 and 5.51 % for numeracy, and between 0.13 and 27.77 % for problem solving.|$|R
30|$|The test {{instrument}} (PROKLAS). Based {{on the model}} of professional knowledge used in Fig.  1, we developed 135 items to assess VET students’ knowledge of laboratory tasks. Except <b>for</b> one semi-open <b>item,</b> all items were designed in multiple-choice format. Some items contained pictograms or pictures to illustrate the context (e.g., biohazard characteristics of chemicals). Items developed stemmed from the two major fields of biochemistry (72 items, including those from pharmacology, molecular biology, and genetic engineering) and cell biology (63 items, including those from zoology, botany, and microbiology). Items addressed the three central laboratory tasks within each discipline, namely: RA (19 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> biochemistry and 29 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> cell biology), DM (20 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> biochemistry and 13 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> cell biology), and LT (33 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> biochemistry and 21 <b>items</b> <b>for</b> cell biology). The items developed addressed the two categories of knowledge in each laboratory task: declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge. Declarative knowledge was operationalized by items stimulating cognitive processes such as ‘remember and retrieve’. Procedural knowledge was operationalized by items stimulating cognitive processes such as ‘apply and understand’ according to Bloom’s taxonomy (Krathwohl 2002). The final set of 92 items is provided in the appendices in English and German (Additional files 1 and 2, respectively).|$|R
