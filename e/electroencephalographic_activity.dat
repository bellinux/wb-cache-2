50|$|At the {{cellular}} level, hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of cortical neurons reliably precedes any overt <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> of burst suppression. This hyperpolarization, {{which has been}} attributed to an increase in neuronal membrane potassium conductance, has been hypothesized {{to play a major role}} in the induction of burst suppression, supported by the induction of burst suppression through the application of a direct acting GABAA agonist, muscimol. In contrast, inhibition is diminished when burst suppression is induced through the use of isoflurane. Another theory is that alterations in brain metabolism regulate activity dependent slow modulation of ATP-gated potassium channel conductance which induces burst suppression. However, modulating inhibitory activity alone may not be sufficient for burst suppression, and modulation in excitatory synaptic efficiency, stemming from the depletion and subsequent recovery of interstitial calcium levels, could contribute to the induction of burst suppression.|$|E

Studying 33 volunteer subjects, {{the researchers found that}} subjective and objective measures of sleep varied according to lunar phase and thus may reflect human circalunar rhythmicity. Stringently controlled laboratory conditions, in a cross-sectional setting, were employed to exclude confounding effects such as increased light at night or the potential bias in perception. Measures of lunar influence on sleep structure, <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and secretion of the hormones melatonin and cortisol, were retrospectively analyzed. At no point, during and after the study, were volunteers or investigators aware of the posteriori analysis relative to lunar phase. Around full Moon it was found that electroencephalogram (EEG) delta activity during NREM sleep, an indicator of deep sleep, decreased by 30%, time to fall asleep increased by five minutes, and EEG-assessed total sleep duration was reduced by 20 minutes. These changes were associated with a decrease in subjective sleep quality and diminished endogenous melatonin levels.

40|$|Abstract—The locus coeruleus–noradrenergic system exerts an {{activating}} {{influence on}} forebrain neuronal and behavioral activity states. For example, in the anesthetized rat, unilateral locus coeruleus stimulation elicits bilateral activation of forebrain <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity.</b> Pretreatment with a noradrenergic b-antagonist blocks this effect, suggesting that b-receptors {{play a critical}} role in locus coeruleus-dependent activation of the forebrain. Consistent with this, stimulation of b-receptors located in certain basal forebrain structures evokes sustained periods of alert waking in the unanesthetized rat. Similar forebrain and behavioral activating effects are observed with a 1 -receptor stimulation within these basal forebrain regions. To assess the extent to which a 1 - and b-receptors contribute to the maintenance of behavioral and forebrain activation, we examined the electroencephalographic and behavioral effects of a 1 -, b- and combined a 1 /b-receptor blockade in the unanesthetized rat. Rats were treated individually or in combination with either varying doses of the a 1 -antagonist, prazosin (intraperitoneally), and/or the b-antagonist, timolol (intracerebroventricularly). Thirty minutes following treatment, animals were placed in a mildlyarousing novel environment, which has been demonstrated previously to elicit activation of central noradrenergic systems and sustained waking in vehicle-treated controls. Behavior and <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> were recorded and later scored. <b>Electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> was analysed using power spectrum analysis. The following were observed: (i) b-receptor blockade alone does not alter behavioral or electroencephalographic indices of alert waking; (ii) a 1 -receptor blockade alone increases high-voltage spindle activity in cortical <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> that wa...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sevoflurane {{may induce}} epileptiform <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> leading to {{unstable}} Bispectral Index numbers, underestimating the hypnotic depth of anesthesia. The authors developed {{a method for}} the quantification of epileptiform <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> during sevoflurane anesthesia. Methods: Electroencephalographic data from 60 patients under sevoflurane mask induction {{were used in the}} analysis. Electroencephalographic data were visually classified. A novel electroencephalogram-derived quantity, wavelet subband entropy (WSE), was developed. WSE variables were calculated from different frequency bands. Performance of the WSE in detection and quantification of epileptiform <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> and the ability of the WSE to recognize misleading Bispectral Index readings caused by epileptiform activity were evaluated. Results: Two WSE variables were found to be sufficient for the quantification of epileptiform activity: WSE from the frequency bands 4 - 16 and 16 - 32 Hz. The lower frequency band was used for monophasic pattern monitoring, and the higher frequency band was used for spike activity monitoring. WSE values of the lower and higher bands followed the time evolution of epileptiform activity with prediction probabilities of 0. 809 (SE, 0. 007) and 0. 804 (SE, 0. 007), respectively. In deep anesthesia with epileptiform activity, WSE detected electroencephalographic patterns causing Bispectral Index readings greater than 60, with event sensitivity of 97. 1 %. Conclusions: The developed method proved useful in detection and quantification of epileptiform <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity</b> during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the future, it may improve the understanding of electroencephalogram-derived information by assisting in recognizing misleading readings of depth-of-anesthesia monitors.

Methods: For 8 able-bodied (AB) and 6 cervical SCI participants, the net joint moment and <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activities</b> were recorded during isometric contractions of the right elbow in flexion and in extension at 3 force levels, that is, during intact and altered muscle contractions for SCI participants. The mean net moment and similar to 20 Hz ERD from C 3 electroencephalographic electrode were compared between AB and SCI participants. Results: In flexion, that is, during intact contractions for all participants, the mean net moment and the ERD increased with the required force level. In extension, that is, during altered contractions, the mean net moment increased for 3 SCI participants while it was almost zero for 3 other SCI participants. The associated ERD increased with the required force level for all participants. Conclusion: The cortical desynchronization was modulated by the intent to modulate the force level rather than the actual modulation of the force production.

Besides motor activity, EEG recordings were analyzed for <b>electroencephalographic</b> seizure <b>activity</b> and frequency characteristics using a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) based approach. Automatic seizure detection revealed severe <b>electroencephalographic</b> seizure <b>activity</b> in both M 1 and CA 1 deflection in APPswePS 1 dE 9 mice with gender-specific characteristics.

So far, {{only a few}} studies have focused on the hippocampal formation as a potential target for the effects induced by MDMA. In this study we sought to evaluate whether the intrinsic cells of the hippocampus might be modified chronically by ecstasy intake. In particular, we examined whether administration of MDMA, at doses producing hippocampal hyperexcitability also produces rearrangements of DNA strands measured by the comet assay. We found that MDMA, at very low doses, comparable with those self-administered by humans, produces acute oxidative stress and DNA single and double-strand breaks, which persist together with long-lasting metabolic changes in the hippocampal formation. These persisting effects are accompanied by behavioral sensitization, reduced seizure threshold and long-lasting slowing of <b>electroencephalographic</b> <b>activity,</b> and hyperexcitability of the hippocampus, without affecting the basal ganglia.
