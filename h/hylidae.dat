5|$|Bulgaria is {{a country}} in southeastern Europe {{situated}} entirely in the Balkan peninsula. Bulgaria is inhabited by 20 amphibian species, which makes the amphibians the least diverse class of vertebrates in the country. They include seven species of newts and salamanders from a single family, Salamandridae, as well as 13 frog and toad species from five families—Bombinatoridae, Bufonidae, <b>Hylidae,</b> Pelobatidae and Ranidae. The most recently classified species are the northern crested newt, identified in 2005, and the Macedonian crested newt, identified in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Ecnomiohyla rabborum is {{classified}} under the genus Ecnomiohyla of the treefrog subfamily Hylinae, family <b>Hylidae.</b> It was first described in 2008 {{by a team}} of herpetologists consisting of Joseph R. Mendelson III, Jay M. Savage, Edgardo Griffith, Heidi Ross, Brian Kubicki, and Ronald Gagliardo. During its discovery in 2005, it was initially misidentified by the team as Ecnomiohyla fimbrimembra, but Kubicki recognized it as a new species. The type specimens were raised in captivity. They were obtained from tadpoles collected by Griffith and Ross from an area near El Valle de Antón, Coclé, Panama on July 15, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Ecnomiohyla rabborum, {{commonly}} known as Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog, is an extinct species of frog in the family <b>Hylidae.</b> They were relatively large frogs that inhabited the forest canopies of central Panama. Like {{other members of the}} genus Ecnomiohyla, they were capable of gliding by spreading their enormous and fully webbed hands and feet during descent. The males of the species were highly territorial and would guard water-filled tree holes used for breeding. They were also the ones responsible for guarding and caring for the young, including providing food. They were the only known species of frog where the tadpoles derived nutrition by feeding on the skin cells of their fathers.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's herpetofauna {{consists}} of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade {{is believed to}} have arrived by flotsam dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto-Antillean vicariance. Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to have arrived to the West Indies (and Puerto Rico) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands. As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in general, {{has one of the highest}} percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: Bufonidae (2 species), <b>Hylidae</b> (3), Leptodactylidae (18) and Ranidae (2). Reptiles include turtles (freshwater and marine), lizards, worm lizards, snakes and a caiman.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hylidae</b> flying frogs (gliding). The other frog {{family that}} {{contains}} gliders.|$|E
25|$|Gliding {{has evolved}} {{independently}} in two families of tree frogs, the Old World Rhacophoridae and the New World <b>Hylidae.</b> Within each lineage {{there are a}} range of gliding abilities from non-gliding, to parachuting, to full gliding.|$|E
25|$|The tree frogs, of {{the family}} <b>Hylidae,</b> {{are one of the}} major {{families}} in Australia, with over 70 species. The tree frogs are split into three genera: Cyclorana, Litoria and Nyctimystes. The tree frogs of Australia have various habits, from completely arboreal to fossorial.|$|E
25|$|Fossil data {{suggests}} the tree frogs, {{of the family}} <b>Hylidae,</b> originated in South America after its separation from Africa. Outside Australia, tree frogs are widespread throughout much of North and South America, Europe and Asia. Tree frogs presumably migrated to Australia via Antarctica. Similarities in melanosomes between some Litoria and Phyllomedusa suggests {{a relationship between the}} South American and Australian tree frogs, however immunological evidence suggests an early divergence between the families.|$|E
25|$|Glass frogs {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to some green frogs of the genus Eleutherodactylus and to some tree frogs of the family <b>Hylidae.</b> However, hylid tree frogs have eyes that face to the side, whilst those of glass frogs face forward. Some species of green tree frogs (especially juveniles), such as Hyloscirtus palmeri and Hypsiboas pellucens, have the transparent abdominal skin typical of glass frogs, {{but they also have}} calcars on the heels, a character not present in any species of the Centrolenidae.|$|E
25|$|Tree frogs, of {{the family}} <b>Hylidae,</b> have {{successfully}} inhabited New Guinea. They are the most diverse family of frogs in New Guinea with over 100 species, and many more to be described. There are two genera represented in New Guinea, Litoria and Nyctimystes. Litoria are found throughout both Australia and New Guinea, however, {{only one of the}} 24 species of Nyctimystes has reached Australia. Nyctimystes are arboreal frogs, which lay their eggs in fast flowing streams, behind a rock to avoid it being flushed away. The tadpoles have modified mouths, which use suction to stick to rocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{amphibians}} of New Guinea {{consist of}} a highly diverse group of species, with over 320 described species, and many species still to be described. The amphibians of New Guinea, like most Gondwanan continents, are restricted {{to those of the}} order Anura, known as frogs and toads. There are six families represented in New Guinea. Four of these: Myobatrachidae, <b>Hylidae,</b> Ranidae and Microhylidae are native. Two specimens of Rhacophoridae, a family well represented in Asia, were discovered in 1926. They were thought to be introduced by humans, and to have become extinct on the island. The other family, Bufonidae, is only represented by two species: the cane toad (Rhinella marina) and the Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus). The cane toad was introduced from Australia in 1937 to control hawk moth larvae, which were eating sweet potato crops; they have since become common in non-forested areas. The common Asiatic toad was accidentally introduced, and is very abundant in a small area in the north-west, and may be spreading further throughout the island.|$|E

500|$|The name frog {{derives from}} Old English frogga, {{abbreviated}} to frox, forsc, and frosc, probably deriving from Proto-Indo-European preu = [...] "to jump". About 88% of amphibian species are {{classified in the}} order Anura. These include around 4,810 species in 33 families, of which the Leptodactylidae (1,100 spp.), <b>Hylidae</b> (800 spp.) and Ranidae (750 spp.) are the richest in species.|$|E
500|$|All {{species of}} Ranidae and <b>Hylidae</b> {{occurring}} in Puerto Rico are introduced. One species {{from the family}} Bufonidae, the cane toad, is introduced while the other, the Puerto Rican crested toad, is endemic and critically endangered. The cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the 1920s to control the populations of white-grub (Phyllophaga spp.), a sugar cane pest. All species from the family Leptodactylidae are native to the region. Of the 18 Leptodactylidae species, 17 are from the genus Eleutherodactylus and are commonly known in Puerto Rico as coquís. Three of these, the web-footed coquí, the golden coqui and the mottled coqui, {{are likely to be}} extinct. The golden coqui is the only live-bearing species from the family Leptodactylidae and Cook's robber frog (E. cooki) is the only Eleutherodactylus sp. that exhibits sexual dimorphism in both size and color. The common coquí (Eleutherodactylus coqui) is an unofficial national symbol of Puerto Rico and an important aspect of Puerto Rican culture. Since 14 of the 17 coquís are endemic to the archipelago, a common phrase used by Puerto Ricans to assert their national pride is [...] "De aquí como el coquí" [...] (From here Puerto Rico like the coquí).|$|E
500|$|Tree frogs live {{high in the}} canopy, {{where they}} {{scramble}} around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The [...] "true" [...] tree frogs belong to the family <b>Hylidae,</b> but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of convergent evolution. These include the glass frogs (Centrolenidae), the bush frogs (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae), and the shrub frogs (Rhacophoridae). Most tree frogs are under [...] in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis {{on the surface and}} also surface tension and viscosity. Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed. Some members of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet. The reticulated leaf frog (Phyllomedusa ayeaye) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.|$|E

2500|$|Australia {{has four}} {{families}} of native frogs and one introduced toad, the cane toad. In 1935 the cane toad {{was introduced to}} Australia in a failed attempt to control pests in sugarcane crops. It has since become a devastating pest, spreading across northern Australia. As well as competing with native insectivores for food, the cane toad produces a venom that is toxic to native fauna, {{as well as to}} humans. The Myobatrachidae, or southern frogs, are Australia's largest group of frogs, with 112 species classified into anywhere from 17 to 22 genera. A notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered Corroboree frog. The tree frogs, from family <b>Hylidae,</b> are common in high rainfall areas on the north and east coasts; there are 77 Australian species from three genera. The 18 species from two genera of the Microhylidae frogs are restricted to the rainforests of northern Australia and nearby habitats; the smallest species, the scanty frog, is from this family. There is a single species from the world's dominant frog group, family Ranidae — the Australian wood frog — which only occurs in the Queensland rainforests. As elsewhere, there has been a precipitous decline in Australia's frog populations in recent years. [...] Although the full reasons for the decline are uncertain, it can be at least partly attributed to the fatal amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Another theory for the decline might be, as research shows, that species from the Southern Hemisphere are on average 4.6 million years old, compared to an average 2.9 million years old for the Northern Hemisphere: Researchers believe this age difference is because of the history of severe ice ages in the Northern Hemisphere, which may drive older species to extinction.|$|E
