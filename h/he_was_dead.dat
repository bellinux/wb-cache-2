5|$|Claudius was a heretic in {{the view}} of Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, who later wrote to refute some of his teachings {{at the request of the}} emperor. The last {{recorded}} act of Claudius is in a charter of the monastery of St Peter at Novalesa in May 827. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> by the time Dungal finished his Responsa contra peruersas Claudii Taurinensis episcopi sententias late in 827, so it can be presumed that he died that year.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{name was}} {{mentioned}} {{several times during}} the Nuremberg trials, but Allied forces were convinced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> Irene and the family in Günzburg also said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> Working in West Germany, Nazi hunters Simon Wiesenthal and Hermann Langbein collected information from witnesses as to Mengele's wartime activities. In a search of the public records, Langbein found Mengele's divorce papers listing an address in Buenos Aires. He and Wiesenthal pressured West German authorities into drawing up an arrest warrant on 5 June 1959, and starting extradition proceedings. Initially Argentina turned down the request, because the fugitive was no longer living at the address given on the documents. By the time extradition was approved on 30 June 1960, Mengele had already fled to Paraguay, where he was living on a farm near the Argentine border.|$|E
5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis {{why he was}} so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon.

5|$|At the Santa Monica Pier, a magician, The Amazing Maleeni, twists {{his head}} {{completely}} around at a carnival, while Billy LaBonge, another magician, heckles Maleeni during the event. As he's leaving, his severed head falls completely off. Billy LaBonge is later questioned by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson); {{he tells the}} agents that he thought Maleeni was a ripoff. During the autopsy, Scully finds that, although Maleeni's head was cleanly cut off, {{he died of a}} heart attack. She also finds that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> for at least a month and refrigerated, even though the carnival manager spoke to him mere moments leading up to his head falling off.|$|E
5|$|During Boone's absence, {{his wife}} and {{children}} (except for Jemima) had returned to North Carolina, assuming <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> Upon his return to Boonesborough, some of the men expressed doubts about Boone's loyalty, since after surrendering the salt-making party, he had apparently lived quite happily among the Shawnees for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnees across the Ohio River, and then by helping to successfully defend Boonesborough against a 10-day siege led by Blackfish, which began on September 7, 1778.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead,</b> {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E

5|$|He shot 70 films {{over the}} sixteen {{years of his}} career, working with such {{prominent}} directors as William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, Michael Curtiz, Archie Mayo, and William Dieterle. He {{was a member of}} the American Society of Cinematographers by 1921, and he was also one of the inaugural members of the International Photographers branch of I.A.T.S.E.

5|$|His {{probable}} last {{occurrence in}} the sources concerned {{a conflict with}} Kinloss Abbey regarding the prebendal parish church of Avoch. The parish of Avoch lay within Thomas' diocese, but the Abbot of Kinloss claimed the primary right to possess it. A papal mandate was issued on 5 January 1325 to William de Lindores, the Chancellor of Ross, commanding him to judge the dispute. Bishop Thomas was almost certainly alive on that date, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> by 17 April, when Roger, canon of Abernethy, received papal provision to the bishopric of Ross, said to be vacant by Thomas' death.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; by the late 1140s, the major fighting in the war was over, giving way to an intractable stalemate, with only the occasional outbreak of fresh fighting. Several of Matilda's key supporters died: in 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, and Brian Fitz Count gradually withdrew from public life, probably eventually joining a monastery; by 1151 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> Many of Matilda's other followers joined the Second Crusade {{when it was announced}} in 1145, leaving the region for several years. Some of the Anglo-Norman barons made individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains, and many were not keen to pursue any further conflict.|$|E
5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began {{a routine}} interrogation. Himmler {{admitted}} who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead),</b> unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E

5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors.

5|$|Dalyngrigge's licence from Richard II {{permitted}} him to refortify his existing manor house, {{but instead}} he chose a fresh site to build a castle on. Construction was completed in one phase, {{and most of the}} castle is in the same architectural style. Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French. Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds. Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for {{the first years of the}} castle's construction. It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor. It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> by 1395.|$|E

Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body.

5|$|Sam {{died while}} him, Nathan and their {{associate}} Rafe Adler attempted {{to find the}} whereabouts of Henry Avery's Gunsway haul in a Panamanian prison.

In reality, he was imprisoned once again after his wounds were tended to,a distraught Nate did attempt to find him, still thinking he was alive but was lead to believe that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> by the guards who wanted Sam to rot in prison as revenge for them indirectly killing a guard. 15 years later, he tracks down a retired Nathan and convinces him {{to pick up where}} they left off in the search for the Gunsway haul by feeding Nathan a false breakout story. The story involves Hector Alcazar, who broke Sam free and demands half of the treasure of the Gunsway. These events kick off the main story of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It is later revealed that Rafe bribed the prison to release Sam, and that Sam double crossed Rafe to resume the search with Nathan.|$|E
