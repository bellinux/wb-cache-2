The effect {{of the presence of}} a rudder was also studied. Experiments were performed on two ship models with different hull characteristics. One of the models was also tested fitted with a rudder to investigate the effect of the rudder. The experiments were conducted in calm water with the ship model restrained from moving freely in any of the six directions. Models were oriented in different combinations of fixed <b>heel</b> <b>angles</b> and yaw angles, and towed at various forward speeds. The lift force and moment acting on the ship hull were measured and the lift coefficient and moment arm were calculated. [...] Experimental results show that the lift coefficient is a nonlinear function of the angle of attack. It is also dependent on <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and forward speed. The moment arm was found to be a nonlinear function of both <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and forward speed. Its value decreases as <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> increases. An empirical formula was derived from the experimental results to determine the equivalent linear damping coefficient for lift roll damping. The empirical formula shows that the equivalent linear damping coefficient is a nonlinear function of forward speed. The lift roll damping will increase with increasing forward speed. On the other hand, increasing <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> leads to a decrease {{in the value of the}} equivalent linear damping. Comparison between the empirical formula and Ikeda's formula indicates that Ikeda's formula underestimates the equivalent linear damping. The discrepancy increases with increasing forward speed.

40|$|A common {{practice}} during {{the design of}} a sailing yacht is to assume an ideal environment. The wind is constant in intensity and direction and the sea is calm. In this situation, an equilibrium between the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces and moments can be found. The equations of equilibrium are thus solved to find the best setup (combination of sails, sail trim, etc.) in order to achieve the maximum boat speed. This procedure is the core of a 'traditional' Velocity Prediction Program (VPP), which was first introduced in 1976. Since then many improvements have been made and nowadays VPPs are capable of dealing with the most diverse designs. However, in nearly forty years of life, the nature of these programs has not changed and, still, important dynamic effects caused by the real environment, are not taken into account. Investigating the performance of a yacht taking into account these effects, is far from easy. Indeed, the equations of equilibrium should be replaced by the more complicated equations of motion which need to be solved in the time domain. However, in recent years, the dynamic characteristics of a yacht sailing in waves and shifting winds (real environment) have become a more popular topic in the sailing yacht community. In the wake of the increasing interest towards this subject, the present work aims to investigate some important dynamic aspects. The effect of the surge motion and of the <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> on the motions of heave and pitch, and on the mean added resistance, are studied by means of towing-tank tests. These are performed on two models of series 4 of the Delft Systematic Yacht Hull Series. Then, time-domain simulations are performed to study the effect of a pitch-induced oscillating aerodynamic force on the seakeeping of yachts sailing upwind in waves. The aerodynamic force is calculated using a quasi-steady as well as an unsteady method, whereas the hydrodynamic {{part of the problem is}} tackled using a strip-theory program which is capable of considering asymmetric hull shapes (e. g. hulls with a <b>heeling</b> <b>angle).</b> The results show that surge has a small influence on the motions and on the mean added resistance alike. The <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> on the other hand, prove to have a large effect on the seakeeping of the models. This effect can be qualitatively predicted by the strip-theory program, although the trend is not always correct. Finally, in same cases, the aerodynamic force significantly affects the pitch and heave motions and this results in a considerable reduction of the added resistance in waves.

OpenFOAM software as a CFD method is applied, and its solver interDyMFoam is used to simulate the sloshing phenomenon and process the data. A good representation of the fluid motion evolution and a sound evaluation of the sloshing moment history are given. My sloshing case is a 2 D rectangular tank with the filling ratio of 0. 012, starting with an initial <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> of 8. 151 degrees, and the simulated time span is 7 seconds when the first two impacts have taken place. The obtained simulation sloshing moments are compared with the quasi-static moment, while an image comparison is also conducted between the tank test images and the simulation animation to validate the simulation. The damping effect on the tank is studied in time domain. The sloshing moment does not always dampen the tank motion. And it gradually catches up with the quasi-static moment in term of time, while its amplitude decays along with the tank motion. The simulated water motion is satisfactory in general with limited unphysical phenomena. Understanding and experience of interDyMFoam throughout the usage are shared. Consequently, the thesis offers a both qualitatively and quantitatively good study on the shallow water sloshing in transient excitation motion...|$|E

40|$|The initial {{stability}} of ship is currently evaluated by empirical formula {{based largely on}} a static approach. Evidently stability is affected by speed that causes variation of pressure distribution on the wetted surface of a ship's hull, and generated waves {{on the surface of}} water by the vessel's motion. Forces and moments resulting from bottom pressures, as the speed of the ship changes, are significantly different for the ship at rest and in a seaway. The principal aim of the research is to investigate the effect of variations of forward speed on stability of a ship in calm water. The thesis presents theoretical and experimental approaches of the research. The novelty of the research results leads to the conclusion that although increasing speed may improve the stability of a ship in some cases, it also depends on <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> or on any asymmetry of the wetted area of a hull. Taking into account unbalanced pressure distribution acting on the wetted surface of the hull in some cases, hence, decrease of stability is also possible. On a moving, partially immersed body, hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces predominate. These forces arise owing to interaction between the body's motion and its weight with respect to the surrounding water. In order to calculate these forces, the panel method of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been applied to identify the velocity and pressure distribution on the wetted surface of a ship's hull. The mathematical model adopted is based on the source distribution on the ship's hull, known as the Kelvin source. The model for a body travelling with steady forward speed, where its motion does not disturb the free surface, is known as double body theory. For consideration of waves generated by the motion of the ship on the free surface, a three dimensional linearised potential flow solution has been utilised. Comprehensive tests conducted in the UCL towing tank have established {{a better understanding of the}} significance of variation of ship's stability associated with forward speed in calm water. It is shown that an accurate judgement regarding the ship's stability cannot be made if only the effect of forward speed, as a single parameter, is considered. The <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> is another important parameter that must also be taken into account. The effects of a combination of both variables have been investigated, and are reported on. The research is presented showing that the applied CFD method may be an alternative method to assess stability of a ship in seaway, but there is a long way for the CFD approach to replace towing tank testing. At present, CFD may be used for consideration as a precursor to improve ship's stability in a real sea during the design stage, for modification, and before operation. It is hoped that in future the novel findings of the experimental approach of this research could be used as additional guidance to be incorporated within the stability documentation for individual ships at the design stage, and ship trials.

40|$|Side {{launching}} is {{a hectic}} and dynamic process. Once the procedure has begun, {{there is no}} stopping it and one can just hope the best. Unfortunately {{there is a serious}} risk of the ship getting damaged in the course of action. In shallow water the ship can capsize if the <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> is too large. If the ship is launched to slow it will fall back risking its chine hitting the slip way with damage {{to the bottom of the}} vessel. Therefore the management until the actual launch is crucial to get a successful launch. For ages now (uniform) ships have been produced and side launched in the Netherlands. It didn’t matter if the ships were made of wood or metal or the slope was rather flat or a bit more steep. By centuries of experience the management was good and the side launch well prepared. The side launch often proved to be successful. Indeed it was a weekly returning event and the many experiences were passed on from one worker to the other. However, nowadays the production of uniform ships is moving to cheap labor countries for obvious reasons. This movement threatens the continuation of Dutch shipyards. A number of shipyards have chosen to change their production to custom made ships, but this leads to other problems. These days the side launch has become a rare occurrence in the Netherlands and workers with experience are often retired. The changed parameters are becoming a risk and management is getting more difficult. Shipyards are in need for a methodology that can predict the outcome of a side launch, such that ship builders can in advance alter the parameters of the launch if needed and again minimize the risk of a failed side launch. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} focused on the use of mesh {{morphing}} to explore different trims of yachts sails. In particular, four trims of the fore and aft sail of a model-scale sailing yacht were modelled leading to 16 configurations in total. Sail pressure distributions were validated with wind-tunnel measurements for all the 16 configurations, and full verification and validation was performed for one of these conditions. The 16 configurations were modelled with two different approaches: generating a new mesh for each trim condition (standard method) and using a morphed version of the baseline condition. This second novel method, based on the use of radial basis functions to morph the mesh, allows the computational time of exploring different geometries with computational fluid dynamics to be significantly decreased. Good agreement is observed between the pressure distributions computed with new meshes and morphed meshes. In order to show an example of trim optimisation, a metamodel approach is defined for the estimation of the response surface using radial basis function interpolation in the parameter space. Thanks to the continuum nature of morphing approach, the optimal trim angles for the given flow condition could be verified using new full computational fluid dynamic simulations. The original full factorial map of 16 points was replaced with a new map of 9 points with an optimal space filling approach to understand the faithfulness of a reduced metamodel. In both cases optimal point is evaluated using a fine design of experiment table built using the metamodel (41 levels for each parameter). The maximum thrust is achieved at the same trim for both metamodels. Proposed method can be easily extended to a wide number of parameters. Such flexibility is demonstrated in the present paper showing the sensitivity of results with respect to apparent wind angle and <b>heeling</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{stability}} of a buoyant object {{at the surface}} is more complex, and it may remain stable even if the centre of gravity is above the centre of buoyancy, provided that when disturbed from the equilibrium position, the centre of buoyancy moves further to the same side that the centre of gravity moves, thus providing a positive righting moment. If this occurs, the floating object {{is said to have}} a positive metacentric height. This situation is typically valid for a range of <b>heel</b> <b>angles,</b> beyond which the centre of buoyancy does not move enough to provide a positive righting moment, and the object becomes unstable.

Also, as stability was only measured at very low <b>heel</b> <b>angles</b> (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing <b>angles</b> of <b>heel.</b> Interestingly, low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer.|$|R

40|$|For {{offshore}} installation projects Jumbo uses her J-class {{heavy lift crane}} vessels. The objects {{that need to be}} installed offshore are carried at deck or in the ship's hull. At location the object is lifted by the on-board heavy lift crane and slewed {{to the side of the}} ship. From the final overboard position the object can be lowered to the seabed. When the load is displaces by the slewing crane, the equilibrium of moments is disrupted and the ship will roll or heel. To reduce this moment change the ship pumps ballast water from one side to the other and causes a counter moment. This simple system has limited capacities and it was assumed that an improvement could reduce the duration of the lifting phase. This thesis is about a research to decrease the duration of the lifting phase for the Jumbo J-class, focussing on anti-heeling. To understand the context of the problem, research has been done on the company and the market she is operating in. Then the phenomenon of anti-heeling, the current ballast system and the operational limits were analysed. With the information obtained from this research a list of requirements and the load cases were selected. The analysis showed that the current system capacity is based on three manual controlled centrifugal pumps that can either been switch on or off. This system cannot easily vary the moment change and was believed to be limiting for lift operations. To find a new solution design methods are used to generate a variety of concepts. For five concept calculation has been done to predict their capacity and dimensions. The analysis showed that a new solution is unlikely to be financially attractive for the market Jumbo is operating in. Therefore the decision has been made to research the effects of the most economical potential solution. Variably frequency drives were applied to the pump system to see if the variations of the rotational speed of the pumps and therefore varying the flow rate would make easier to control the roll motions. Or even shorten the lift phase. To examine the ballast system and the sensitivities a model has been made. As this research focused on roll and heeling motions only, a 2 D model is used to predict heave, sway and roll motions. The model is based on the equilibrium of moments where the ship is exposed to wave induced moments and the moments caused by the crane and ballast system. The crane and ballast system are effected by the ship motions and therefore coupled to these motions. The model allows to automate the control of the crane motions and the pump rotations. This allowed the model to test different lift scenarios under different wave conditions. The results showed that the variable frequency drivers can result in smaller differences of the heeling angles. But the results also showed that the ballast system was not the most important limiting factor. It was the moment change caused by the crane. When the crane tip with hanging load was displaced with a certain speed, it caused an impulse making the ship oscillate around the static <b>heeling</b> <b>angle.</b> The amplitudes of these oscillations and the static <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> could be reduced by the ballast system. But the best results were shown when the stability properties of the vessel were improved. Increasing the effective metacentric height from 2. 25 to 3. 25 showed significantly reduce roll excitations. Other conclusions are that previously very conservative roll angles of 1 o were used, while the mast crane proved to handle roll angles of 4 o and larger depending on the load. Also the lay out of the current pump system leaves a lot of room of improvement. These improvements can be found in the recommendations as well as suggestions how to discover potential time savings during offshore operations.

A limit on the <b>heeling</b> <b>angle</b> of around 20 degree has been fixed in order to feel comfortable during sailing. A Dellenbaugh angle has been worked out and then a WinPP check has been used to understand the speed performance of the yacht. Comfort has been provided analysing form and function for all the items involved in the yacht in order to use the volume in an ergonomic way. The owner may want to show most of the minor harbour to his friends or just don’t have the limit of maximum draft. To supply at this demand a lifting keel has been fitted. The keel represent only one of the automated device which have been introduced in this yacht. The author idea is to produce a boat which can offer the possibility, even for less experienced people, to enjoy sailing. The answer to solution for this requirement is to have most of the device, which require human precision and strength, automated. Electric winches, self furling main and jib, hydraulic tender door and bimini have been provided to offer maximum comfort and simplicity. From the structure point of view, the size of the yacht imply to follow regulation for large vessel and in this case Lloyd’s Rules and Regulation for classification of special service craft (3) have been chose. Following the market trend for the same kind of yacht carbon has been used as building material. From the stability and safety point the yacht is complying with LY 2 (4) rules...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project was to explore the {{different}} physical effects that are involved when a ship is using the technology of wing sails as propulsion. The wing sails can provide a lot of thrust, but they also create a side force. This side force will force the ship {{to go with a}} yaw angle and a <b>heeling</b> <b>angle.</b> The consequence of these angles on the ship resistance was of interest. That is, what are the negative effects to be considered when calculating the potential thrust from a wing sail?Two ship models were selected and they were equipped with wing sails of considerable size. Realistic wind conditions were assumed. The goal was then to simulate the resulting force on these ships, from both the air and the water. In order to do this, a custom Boundary Element Method (BEM) was developed. This code can simulate the flow around an arbitrary amount of wings, with an arbitrary shape, under the assumption of potential flow. OpenCL was used to make the code fast, while the open source 3 D geometry software Blender was used for handling the geometry and post processing. The interaction effects for 8 wings in a row, under the assumption of potential flow, was explored. Some discussion about wing sails in general, along with some simple experiments involving foil shapes has also been done. In order to model the flow around a ship hull traveling with a yaw angle, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used, through the commercial software STAR CCM+. The author did some mistakes while using this software, but was able to at least estimate the effect of yaw on a ship. External experimental data was used to complement the data from the CFD simulations, so that reliable results could be produced in the end. It was found that yaw has a significant effect on the resistance of a ship, while heel has almost no effect at all. The side force generated by a ship hull is non-linear in nature, which is explained by the presence of cross flow drag. The results from the BEM code, the CFD simulations and some external experiments were coupled together to estimate the importance of yaw on a ship. It was discovered that even though a ship hull is a poor lifting surface, the resulting yaw angle for a ship under the influence of wing sails is not very large. The high density of water limits the yaw angles considerably. That is, at almost-head-wind conditions, the added resistance due to yaw is significantly reducing the effective thrust from a wing sail, but there is very little thrust at these wind conditions to begin with. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{safety of}} ships represents a major requirement from the operational point of view. Statistics on marine accident {{prove that the}} capsizing of ships due to critical environmental conditions represents a fundamental and, still, unsolved problem in marine engineering. The severe criteria on transverse stability given by the Classification Societies didn’t prove their effectiveness in evaluating the capsizing risk. Taking into account the above mentioned aspects, the authors are investigating different experimental methodologies developed in towing tanks in order to evaluate the transverse stability of ships on waves. The application {{is based on the}} results of the towing tank tests carried out for a 2700 dwt multipurpose cargo ship model. The experimental methodologies are used to provide a better understanding of physical mechanisms which lead to transverse stability for different <b>heeling</b> <b>angles</b> and to validate theoretical approaches in this respect...|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic {{forces are}} usually {{computed}} numerically or measured in a wind tunnel. These forces {{may be used}} to predict the performance of a yacht at full-scale. The aim of this project was to develop a new method to measure the forces and moments directly at full-scale. The theory was that by simultaneously measuring the shape of the sails and the pressures around them the force normal to the surface could be derived by summation of the product of the pressure, unit normal vector and the relevant area of the discretised sail shape. A code was written for the interpolations of the discrete shape and pressure measurements to the full sail shapes and pressures over them. The shape was then discretised and the pressure at the centre of each cell was assumed constant over it. The results were validated through testing at model-scale. The calculated forces and moments were compared directly to the results obtained from a force balance on which the model yacht was mounted. The results were also used in a VPP to assess the accuracy when predicting <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> and boat speed. The first test was conducted on a set of semi-rigid sails with surface mounted pressure taps. A study of the pressure distributions found using a VLM was used to optimise the pressure tap locations. The results were encouraging; however it appeared that the interference on the flow caused by the taps resulted in large under-predictions of the forces and moments. This lead to a second round of model testing using sails with internal pressure taps leaving the sail surfaces smooth. The results showed good agreement, although there was still a significant under-prediction of the drive force. Full-scale testing was carried out using a purpose built pressure measuring system. Although fullscale testing is extremely difficult due to the unsteady environment, good results were obtained where clear trends in the boat speed and <b>heel</b> <b>angle</b> were also seen in the calculated drive force and heeling moment...|$|R
40|$|A {{free surface}} Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver and a {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics method, the latter currently under development by the authors, {{have been applied}} to the evaluation of slamming loads (global forces and local pressures) over a series of two-dimensional cases for which experimental data (drop tests with a free falling rig) were available. In particular, numerical simulations were conducted on a wedge-shaped section with 30 u deadrise and on a ship bow section; in both cases, different <b>heel</b> <b>angles</b> and different drop speeds have been considered, to analyse {{a wide range of}} cases and to assess not only the accuracy of the numerical methods in a single case, but also their capability to capture significantly different conditions. Results from both methods are presented and compared with available measurements, allowing an assessment of these different techniques to be made and their relative merits and shortcomings to be observed...|$|R
