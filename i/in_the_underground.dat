5|$|Many Indiana {{residents}} participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> railroad. Two major arteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> railroad {{traveled through}} Indiana. Tell City, Evansville, and Jeffersonville were two gateways to the underground railroad. An important stopover was Westfield, where food and hiding places were provided to slaves {{trying to reach}} Canada. Other safe houses dotted Indiana, including one in Town Clock Church (pictured). Escaping slaves who entered Indiana would be ferried from safe house to safe house northward, usually into Michigan, where they could cross safely to Windsor, in Ontario, Canada.|$|E

5|$|With the end {{of slavery}} in the state, Indiana became a border state with the {{southern}} slave states. Hoosiers like Levi Coffin came {{to play an important}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Underground</b> Railroad that helped many slaves escape from the South. Indiana remained anti-slavery and in the American Civil War remained with the Union and contributed men to the war.|$|E

Tina Casale was the co-founder of C/Z Records in the 1980s (along with Chris Hanzsek), an indie label that recorded {{what has been called}} earliest grunge record, Deep Six, in 1986, which included Soundgarden, the Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, Green River, and the U-Men.|$|E

5|$|Except for the locks, the dam {{project was}} {{completed}} and fully functional as of July 4, 2012, {{when the last}} of the main water turbines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> plant began production. The ship lift was complete in December 2015. Each main water turbine has a capacity of 700MW. The dam body was completed in 2006. Coupling the dam's 32 main turbines with two smaller generators (50MW each) to power the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the dam is 22,500MW.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and roll, a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> music scene.|$|E
5|$|Power {{generation}} is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC)—a Central Enterprise SOE administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity {{hydroelectric power station}} with 34generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50MW, making a total capacity of 22,500MW. Among those 32 main generators, 14 are installed in {{the north side of}} the dam, 12 in the south side, and the remaining six <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> power plant in the mountain south of the dam. The expected annual electricity generation will be over 100TWh.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} groups that lacked representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Underground</b> State included the communist (Polish Workers Party (PPR) and its military arm, the Gwardia Ludowa), {{and the far}} right (Group Szaniec and its military arm, the Military Organization Lizard Union). Both the extreme left (the communists) and the extreme right (the nationalists) saw themselves {{in opposition to the}} Underground State. Only the PPR, however, opposed to Polish independence and supporting full inclusion of Poland in the Soviet Union, was seen as completely outside the framework of the State; the other groups were seen as a legitimate opposition. In 1944 PPR would become part of the PKWN Soviet puppet government.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by architect Charles Holden, and {{has been described as}} a significant work of modern architecture. On 19 February 1971, the station was Grade II listed.

At this point the screen fades and the mission is declared a success; it is presumed that the Nihilanth warps them back to Xen and installs the crystals in his cave.|$|E

5|$|To the band's consternation, {{they were}} forced to cancel their {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion.

5|$|When Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany in April 1940, Lie {{immediately}} started organising resistance, {{taking charge of}} free radio broadcasts from various locations in the country. For two months this work kept him in constant movement around Norway, and on 7 June 1940, when King Haakon VII and the government left the country for London, he was in Vadsø, replacing a broken transmitter. At this point further broadcasts became impossible, and Lie had {{to make his way}} south, through Finland and Sweden, to Oslo. Here he became involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> labour movement, mainly through printing newspapers and spreading information.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{conflicts}} with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, {{the album was}} renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986. Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> metal scene. To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven. In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s, Utica {{was known}} to aid more than 650 {{fugitive}} slaves; it {{played a major role}} as a station <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Underground</b> Railroad. The city was on a slave escape route from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. The route, used by Harriet Tubman to travel to Buffalo, guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right-of-way en route to Canada. Utica was the locus for Methodist preacher Orange Scott's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s, and Scott formed an abolitionist group there in 1843. Despite efforts by local abolitionists, pro-slavery riots and mobs, who wanted to protect the cotton mills, forced many abolitionist meetings to other cities.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Berlin (16 April 1945– 2 May 1945), Hitler and {{his staff}} lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>underground</b> Führerbunker while the Red Army approached.

On 2 May, General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov. Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide the next day after murdering their six children. On 4–8 May 1945, {{most of the remaining}} German armed forces surrendered unconditionally. The German Instrument of Surrender was signed 8 May, marking the end of the Nazi regime and the end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
