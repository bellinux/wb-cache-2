When such <b>income</b> <b>item</b> is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the deferred revenue is reduced.

An example is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later accounting period when its amount is deducted from accrued expenses. It shares characteristics with deferred income (or deferred revenue) with the difference that a liability to be covered latter is cash received from a counterpart, while goods or services are to be delivered in a latter period, when such <b>income</b> <b>item</b> is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from deferred revenues.|$|E
50|$|A Deferred expense or prepayment, prepaid expense, plural often prepaids, is {{an asset}} {{representing}} cash paid {{out to a}} counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later accounting period. For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, {{at the end of}} the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense. In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment. The deferred expense shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such <b>income</b> <b>item</b> is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated the considerable benefits of a "topic-based" interview structure for demographic surveys employing a household respondent (Moore and Moyer, 1998 a, 1998 b). As distinct from traditional person-based interviewing, which completes all questions about person 1, then recycles through the questions for person 2, and etc. for person 3 and all other household members, the topic-based approach is organized by topic: "Has John ever been divorced?" "How about Mary?" "And Tom [...] . ?" etc. Moore and Moyer (op cit) report that this structure increases interview efficiency, is preferred by both interviewers and respondents, reduces unit nonresponse, and in general reduces item nonresponse [...] with income items the notable exception. Loomis (1999) identifies the elevated tendency of topic-based interview respondents to produce blanket refusals for all income questions for all household members as the mechanism for the increase in <b>income</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse. This paper describes an experimental attempt to reduce item nonresponse to income questions in a topic-based interview, using a very brief statement immediately preceding the income questions to try to overcome respondents' reluctance to report by (a) acknowledging that such reluctance is not uncommon; (b) suggesting a cause of the reluctance (unfamiliarity) that avoids suggesting privacy concerns to those not troubled by them; and (c) emphasizing the valid, important, nonpersonal, statistical (i. e., nonthreatening) uses of the data. We find that use of this statement eliminates the <b>income</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse disadvantage for the topic-based interview treatment [...] {{and in some cases}} even reverses the effect.

In the subsequent waves the PAPI mode was partly replaced by CAPI. With this experimental longitudinal design we are able to control for possible interviewer effects in the analysis of mode effects. The paper assesses whether any mode effects are apparent for the response rate. Within the data, we examine monetary dimensions such as gross <b>income,</b> <b>item</b> and unit nonresponse rates.

This paper focuses on item nonresponse to income questions, because income data, collected in almost every survey, has been associated with a large amount of missing data. We will examine changes in nonresponse to the income questions in the Survey of Consumer Attitudes (SCA). SCA is a monthly RDD study; it asks respondents first to report their income in dollar amounts with an open-ended question. For those who do not provide an answer, they are followed up with a closed-ended question with income brackets. We will take a historical approach in studying 20 years of SCA data (from June 1986 to December 2005) and examine the trend of nonresponse to the income questions in SCA over time. Analyses indicate that <b>income</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse has decreased over time, and the decline is related to the unit nonresponse rate, the refusal and refusal conversion rates, and nonresponse to other items in the survey. We interpret these findings through both sample composition and respondent motivation.

40|$|Purpose: Identification {{of methods}} for {{presenting}} {{the components of}} other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity in the reporting practices of public companies in Poland and Germany. Methodology: A study of domestic and foreign literature was conducted with analysis of annual reports of public companies. The study followed the method of induction and to analyse the results, the structure similarity index was used. Results: The {{results of the study}} supported conclusions that the companies under study had not  developed a uniform presentation of the components of comprehensive income in their statements of changes in equity. Five options of presenting the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity were identified. Companies both from the WIG 30 and DAX  indices most frequently presented the statement of changes in equity in option 1, which consisted of presenting the total comprehensive <b>income</b> <b>item</b> in a row and detailed items of equity in columns in which capital gains and losses were recognized. The differentiated forms of presenting the components of comprehensive income made it difficult to compare financial statements. Scope of research: The survey examined the annual reports of the largest Polish and German public companies respectively from the WIG 30 and DAX indices. The components of other comprehensive income presented in the statements of changes in equity were the main subject of the study. Originality: Comparative studies on the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity by public companies in Poland and Germany have not yet been conducted. This was therefore the research gap addressed in this study. ...|$|E
