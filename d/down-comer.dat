40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{two independent}} safety investigations on critical and sub-critical heavy liquid metal cooled fast reactors using simple flow paths. The first investigation applies to locating the steam generators in the risers {{instead of the}} <b>down-comers</b> of a simple flow path designed sub-critical reactor of 600 MWth power. This was compared to a similar design, but with the steam generators located in the downcomers. The transients investigated were Total-Loss-of-Power and unprotected Loss-Of-Flow. It is shown that this reactor peaks at 1041 K after 29 hours during a Total-Loss-Of-Power accident. The difference between locating the steam generators in the risers and the downcomers is insignificant for this accident type. During an unprotected Loss-Of-Flow accident at full power the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 1010 K, which is 337 K above nominal outlet temperature. The second investigation concerns a 1426 MWth critical reactor where {{the influence of the}} core height versus the core outlet temperature is studied during an unprotected Loss-Of-Flow and Total-Loss-Of-Power accident. A pancake type core geometry of 1. 0 m height and 5. 8 m diameter, is compared to a compact core of 2 m height and 4. 5 m diameter. Moderators, like BeO and hydrides, and their influence on safety coefficients and burnup swings are also presented. Both cores incinerate transuranics from spent LWR fuel with minor actinde fraction of 5 %. We show that LFR can be designed both to breed and burn transuranics from LWRs. It is shown that the hydrides lead to the most favorable reactivity feedbacks, but the poorest reactivity swing.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a detailed Finite Element (FE) model of the Atucha II Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) for Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) analysis. This model simulates both the base and the cladding metal, the Cold Legs (CL), the Hot Legs (HL), the emergency systems penetrations with the corresponding nozzles. A complete RPV FE model is needed for the calculation of the stresses in the undamaged structure to be used as input for the calculation of the stress intensity factor KI by means of the “weight function” method. This is one step of the methodology developed at University of Pisa (UNIPI) for the deterministic analysis of PTS scenarios. Such methodology is based on the use of a chain of codes and starts with the thermal hydraulic analysis of the NPP with a system code (such as Relap 5, Cathare 2, etc.) for a selected transient scenario. The goal of this step is to estimate the cooling load induced on the internal RPV wall surface by the Emergency Core Coolant (ECC) injection, and provide boundary conditions for the next step. The region of interest is represented by the welding lines in the <b>down-comer</b> region. The next step consists of the 3 D analysis of the <b>down-comer</b> flow and of the temperature field in the RPV wall, using a CFD code with Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) capabilities.

40|$|The {{benchmark}} calculations {{performed by}} CRS 4 with Star-CD on a reference {{geometry of the}} MEGAPIE target are presented in this report (benchmark M 1). Scope of the benchmark is {{a comparison of the}} results obtained by the various partners involved in the MEGAPIE project using different codes and turbulence modelling approaches. The considered target geometry is the one with the final part of the guide tube slanted at an angle of about 9 degrees. The Pb-Bi flow in the last 2150 mm of the target have been simulated, including the calculation of the thermal field in all the solid structures (window, hull and flow guide). Due to geometrical symmetry, only half of the real domain was considered. Turbulence was simulated using a Chen k-ε model, combined with a Two-layer model in the most critical near-wall regions (window and flow guide in the spallation region) and with Wall Functions along the riser and the <b>down-comer.</b> Modified wall functions for low Prandtl number fluids were implemented. Results are presented for both cases with the beam footprint major axis parallel (benchmark M 1. 0) and normal (benchmark M 1. 1) to the guide-tube slant. In order to estimate the effect of the variation of the turbulent Prandtl number on the heat exchange, two calculation have been performed, one with Prt = 0. 9 and one using a relationship Prt = f(Ret, Pr), yielding a locally variable turbulent Prandtl number. Results show a very complex flow pattern in the spallation region, with 3 D vortex structures being generated in the reversing region and dragged along the rising duct. In case M 1. 0 with Prt = 0. 9, results show maximum window temperatures of 521 °C and 487 °C in the external and internal side respectively, with a maximum Pb-Bi temperature of 486 °C located nearby the window centre. The maximum flow velocity is 1. 35 m/s. A significant heat exchange takes place across the 1. 5 mm thick flow guide, causing a mean temperature increase along the <b>down-comer</b> of about 34 °C. Due to the high Reynolds number of the flow, the effect of using a variable Prt is limited to near wall regions, where the heat exchange is slightly reduced. The combination of a lower heat exchange across the flow guide (resulting in a lower temperature increase of the Pb-Bi along the <b>down-comer)</b> and a worse window cooling yielded a maximum window temperature of 524 °C, namely 3 °C more than in the case with Prt = 0. 9. In case M 1. 1, maximum window temperatures of 447 °C and 414 oC were found using Prt = 0. 9 with a maximum Pb-Bi temperature of 423 °C located in {{the central part of the}} spallation region.

The goal is to characterize the corium and debris flows from the core to accurately evaluate the corium pool propagation transient in the lower head and so the associated risk of vessel failure. In the case of LWR with heavy reflector, to evaluate the corium relocation into the lower head, we have to study the risk associated with focusing effect and the possibility to stabilize laterally the corium in core with a flooded <b>down-comer.</b> It is necessary to characterize the core degradation and the stratification of the corium pool that is formed in core. We assume that the core degradation until the corium pool formation and the corium pool propagation could be modeled separately. In this document, we present a simplified geometrical model (0 D model) for the in-core corium propagation transient. A degraded core with a formed corium pool is used as an initial state. This state can be obtained from a simulation computed with an integral code. This model does not use a grid for the core as integral codes do. Geometrical shapes and 0 D models are associated with the corium pool and the other components of the degraded core (debris, heavy reflector, core plate…). During the transient, these shapes evolve taking into account the thermal and stratification behavior of the corium pool and the melting of the core surrounding components.

40|$|Supercritical {{water-cooled}} reactors (SCWRs) {{are among}} the most promising advanced nuclear systems because of their high thermal efficiency [i. e., about 45 % vs. 33 % of current light water reactors (LWRs) ] and considerable plant simplification. SCWRs achieve this with superior thermodynamic conditions (i. e., high operating pressure and temperature), and by reducing the containment volume and eliminating the need for recirculation and jet pumps, pressurizer, steam generators, steam separators and dryers. The reference SCWR design in the U. S. is a direct cycle, thermal spectrum, light-water-cooled and moderated reactor with an operating pressure of 25 MPa and inlet/outlet coolant temperature of 280 / 500 °C. The inlet flow splits, partly to a <b>down-comer</b> and partly to a plenum {{at the top of the}} reactor pressure vessel to flow downward through the core in special water rods to the inlet plenum. This strategy is employed to provide good moderation at the top of the core, where the coolant density is only about 15 - 20 % that of liquid water. The SCWR uses a power conversion cycle similar to that used in supercritical fossil-fired plants: high- intermediate- and low-pressure turbines are employed with one moisture-separator re-heater and up to eight feedwater heaters. The reference power is 3575 MWt, the net electric power is 1600 MWe and the thermal efficiency is 44. 8 %.

The purpose of this report is to survey existing materials for fossil, fission and fusion applications and identify the materials research and development needed to establish the SCWR viabilitya with regard to possible materials of construction.

40|$|The {{document}} (in Italian) {{is part of}} {{a series}} of reports dealing with the design, the construction and the operation of the PIPER-ONE loop installed at the Scalbatraio Laboratory managed by DCMN (Dipartimento di Costruzioni Meccaniche e Nucleari – previously IIN, Istituto di Impianti Nucleari) of University of Pisa. PIPER-ONE was built in Italy {{as a consequence of the}} Three-Mile accident (1979) : it aimed at simulating the Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) performance following Small Break Loss of Coolant Accidents (SBLOCA). The natural circulation which occurs between <b>down-comer</b> and core into the vessel constitutes the reference thermal-hydraulic phenomenon which needed to be simulated. The concerned document allowed the finalization of the thermal-hydraulic design of a key peculiarity of the PIPER-ONE loop: the concerned peculiarity is the passive structure cooling/heating system. Any experimental loop (namely those characterized by full height scaling and full pressure) suffer of the scaling distortion caused by the high value of the ratio ‘passive structure area / volume of fluid’ which ends up (unavoidably) to be 10 – 50 times the ideal value which characterizes the prototype. As a consequence of this timing of accident is distorted too. Unavoidable (again) heat losses to environment contribute further to distortion in performance between prototype and model. It might be noted that during some period of an assigned transient scenario (e. g. during the depressurization time) passive structure transfer too much thermal power to the fluid (e. g. related to the ideal value or the value expected in the prototype); otherwise during long lasting transient heat losses cause too much thermal power removal from the fluid also distorting the natural circulation.. Cooling coils (e. g. a pipe welded around the entire loop) and electrical heating wire were wrapped around the passive structure of PIPER-ONE to optimize the scaling performance. The current report describes the design features of both the electrical coils (heaters) and the cooling coils (coolers). The PIPER-ONE loop was used for an International Standard Problem (ISP) by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) / Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) / Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (CSNI) during the middle of 80 ’s. The design and the operation of the loop constituted a milestone achievement in the area of nuclear thermal-hydraulics with main reference to the scaling...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the fracture mechanics in the technology of the nuclear power plant is mainly connected {{to the risk of}} a catastrophic brittle rupture of the reactor pressure vessel. There are no feasible countermeasures that can mitigate the effects of such an event that impair the capability to maintain the core covered even in the case of properly functioning of the emergency systems. The origin of the problem is related to the aggressive environment in which the vessel operates for long term (e. g. more than 40 years), characterized by high neutron flux during normal operation. Over time, the vessel steel becomes progressively more brittle in the region adjacent to the core. If a vessel had a preexisting flaw of critical size and certain severe system transients occurred, this flaw could propagate rapidly through the vessel, resulting in a through-wall crack. The severe transients that can lead the nuclear power plant in such conditions, known as Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS), are characterized by rapid cooling (i. e., thermal shock) of the a part of the internal reactor pressure vessel surface that may be combined with repressurization can create locally a sudden increase of the stresses inside the vessel wall and lead to the suddenly growth of the flaw inside the vessel thickness. Based on the long operational experience from nuclear power plants equipped with reactor pressure vessel all over the world, it is possible to conclude that the simultaneous occurrence of critical-size flaws, embrittled vessel, and a severe PTS transient is a very low probability event. Moreover, additional studies performed at utilities and regulatory authorities levels have shown that the RPV can operate well beyond the original design life (40 years) because of the large safety margin adopted in the design phase. A better understanding and knowledge of the materials behavior, improvement in simulating in a more realistic way the plant systems and operational characteristics and a better evaluation of the loads on the RPV wall during the PTS scenarios, have shown that the analysis performed during the 80 ’s were overly conservative, based on the tools and knowledge available at that time. Nowadays the use of best estimate approach in the analyses, combined with tools for the uncertainty evaluation is taking more consideration to reduce the safety margins, even from the regulatory point of view. The US NRC has started the process to revise the technical base of the PTS analysis for a more risk-informed oriented approach. This change has the aim to remove the un-quantified conservatisms in all the steps of the PTS analysis, from the selection of the transients, the adopted codes and the criteria for conducting the analysis itself thus allow a more realistic prediction. This change will not affect the safety, because beside the operational experience, several analysis performed by thermal hydraulic, fracture mechanics and Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) point of view, have shown that the reactor fleet has little probability of exceeding the limits on the frequency of reactor vessel failure established from NRC guidelines on core damage frequency and large early release frequency through the period of license extension. These calculations demonstrate that, even through the period of license extension, the likelihood of vessel failure attributable to PTS is extremely low (≈ 10 - 8 /year) for all domestic pressurized water reactors. Different analytical approaches have been developed for the evaluation of the safety margin for the brittle crack propagation in the rector pressure vessel under PTS conditions. Due to the different disciplines involved in the analysis: thermal-hydraulics, structural mechanics and fracture mechanics, different specialized computer codes are adopted for solving single part of the problem. The aims of this chapter is to present all the steps of a typical PTS analysis base on the methodology developed at University of Pisa with discussion and example calculation results for each tool adopted and their use, based on a more realistic best estimate approach. This methodology starts with the analysis of the selected scenario by mean a System Thermal-Hydraulic (SYS-TH) code such as RELAP 5 [2][3], RELAP 5 - 3 D [1], CATHARE 2 [4][6], etc. for the analysis of the global behavior of the plant and for the evaluation of the primary side pressure and fluid temperature at the <b>down-comer</b> inlet. For a more deep investigation of the cooling load on the rector pressure vessel internal surface at small scale, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code is used. The calculated temperature profile in the <b>down-comer</b> region is transferred to a Finite Element (FE) structural mechanics code for the evaluation of the stresses inside the RPV wall. The stresses induced by the pressure in the primary side are also evaluated. The stress intensity factor at crack tip is evaluated by mean the weight function method based on a simple integration of the stresses along the crack border multiplied by the weight function. The values obtained are compared with the critical stress intensity factor typical of the reactor pressure vessel base material for the evaluation of the safety margin...|$|E
40|$|The Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) {{has long}} been {{considered}} one of the most reliable components in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Nowadays, a general target for the countries that produce nuclear energy is to extend the operation life of existing plants. From this point of view, the RPV is one of the major components that may limit the useful life of the nuclear plant. The risk for the RPV structural integrity is connected to the presence of a flaw of sufficient size, a high level of embrittlement due to radiation damage, and the occurrence of a thermal-hydraulic transient inducing strong stresses in the vessel wall. Severe loading conditions are produced during a Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) event, in which an overcooling may induce strong thermal stresses while the internal pressure can be maintained at high level or the system can be re-pressurized during the transient. Such conditions are generated in a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) transient during the emergency injection. In recent years, important progresses have been made in the development of analysis methods and tools for the best estimation of the thermal and pressure loads on the vessel wall. In this direction, the US-NRC published in 2007 a document aimed at reviewing the rules adopted in PTS analysis, established in the 1980 s, containing significant conservatisms, for a Best Estimate (BE) approach combined with uncertainty assessment. In this paper, the methodology for Fracture Mechanics analysis developed at University of Pisa aimed to perform parametric analysis assuming various shapes and locations of the flaw is applied to a Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) during a LOCA scenario. Four steps can be identified starting from the thermal hydraulic analysis of the Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) behaviour with Relap 5 - 3 D© in order to calculate the cooling loads of the Emergency Core Coolant Systems (ECCS). The second step is the analysis by mean a CFD code (CFX) of the mixing phenomena occurring in the <b>Down-Comer</b> (DC) and the calculation of the thermal load on the RPV internal surface. The third step is represented by the evaluation of the stresses inside the RPV wall by mean a Finite Element (FE) code (Ansys) under the thermal and pressure loads calculate in the previous steps. The last step is represented by the calculation of the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) KI by mean the Weight Function method and the comparison with the critical SIF KIc of the material, once the stresses inside the undamaged RPV wall are known. The goal of this work is the evaluation of the safety margin for the operation of the RPV, adopting a BE approach in all the steps of the analysis. This result will be compared with the one obtained with the application of the ASME XI criteria for the KI evaluation with the aim to show that the BE approach leads to a larger safety margin...|$|E
40|$|U-pipe Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHE) {{are widely}} used today in ground source heating and cooling systems {{in spite of their}} less than optimal performance. This thesis {{provides}} a better understanding on the function of U-pipe BHEs and Investigates alternative methods to reduce the temperature difference between the circulating fluid and the borehole wall, including one thermosyphon and three different types of coaxial BHEs. Field tests are performed using distributed temperature measurements along U-pipe and coaxial heat exchangers installed in groundwater filled boreholes. The measurements are carried out during heat injection thermal response tests and during short heat extraction periods using heat pumps. Temperatures are measured inside the secondary fluid path, in the groundwater, and at the borehole wall. These type of temperature measurements were until now missing. A new method for testing borehole heat exchangers, Distributed Thermal Response Test (DTRT), has been proposed and demonstrated in U-pipe, pipe-in-pipe, and multi-pipe BHE designs. The method allows the quantification of the BHE performance at a local level. The operation of a U-pipe thermosyphon BHE consisting of an insulated <b>down-comer</b> and a larger riser pipe using CO 2 as a secondary fluid has been demonstrated in a groundwater filled borehole, 70 m deep. It was found that the CO 2 may be sub-cooled at the bottom and that it flows upwards through the riser in liquid state until about 30 m depth, where it starts to evaporate. Various power levels and different volumetric flow rates have been imposed to the tested BHEs and used to calculate local ground thermal conductivities and thermal resistances. The local ground thermal conductivities, preferably evaluated at thermal recovery conditions during DTRTs, were found to vary with depth. Local and effective borehole thermal resistances in most heat exchangers have been calculated, and their differences have been discussed in an effort to suggest better methods for interpretation of data from field tests. Large thermal shunt flow between down- and up-going flow channels was identified in all heat exchanger types, particularly at low volumetric flow rates, except in a multi-pipe BHE having an insulated central pipe where the thermal contact between down- and up-coming fluid was almost eliminated. At relatively high volumetric flow rates, U-pipe BHEs show a nearly even distribution of the heat transfer between the ground and the secondary fluid along the depth. The same applies to all coaxial BHEs as long as the flow travels downwards through the central pipe. In the opposite flow direction, an uneven power distribution was measured in multi-chamber and multi-pipe BHEs. Pipe-in-pipe and multi-pipe coaxial heat exchangers show significantly lower local borehole resistances than U-pipes, ranging in average between 0. 015 and 0. 040 Km/W. These heat exchangers can significantly decrease the temperature difference between the secondary fluid and the ground and may allow the use of plain water as secondary fluid, an alternative to typical antifreeze aqueous solutions. The latter was demonstrated in a pipe-in-pipe BHE having an effective resistance of about 0. 030 Km/W. Forced convection in the groundwater achieved by injecting nitrogen bubbles was found to reduce the local thermal resistance in U-pipe BHEs by about 30 % during heat injection conditions. The temperatures inside the groundwater are homogenized while injecting the N 2, and no radial temperature gradients are then identified. The fluid to groundwater thermal resistance during forced convection was measured to be 0. 036 Km/W. This resistance varied between this value and 0. 072 Km/W during natural convection conditions in the groundwater, being highest during heat pump operation at temperatures close to the water density maximum.
