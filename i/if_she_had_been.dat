5|$|On October 4, 2013, Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler {{approved}} a second petition to recall Colorado State Senator Evie Hudak, also {{an advocate of}} gun control; the signature gatherers had 60 days to collect 18,300 or more signatures to force a recall election in Colorado Senate District 19 which encompasses Arvada, Colorado and Westminster, Colorado. Hudak later resigned rather than face recall. Because she resigned, the Democrats were able to appoint a replacement; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> recalled, the Republicans could have gained {{a majority in the}} state senate.|$|E
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she likely would have avoided these had she been underway, and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hit, damage control teams would have kept the ship afloat.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} wildling Osha, now {{a servant}} of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy, who warns her that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.|$|E

60|$|XXIV. It {{is better}} not to take a wife than to take one {{belonging}} to some other man: for <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a good wife to him, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> adapted her nature to his, and will therefore be unsuited to yours. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> a good wife to him {{she will not be}} to you.|$|R

5|$|In 1940 Ye Qianyu met {{the dancer}} Dai Ailian in Hong Kong. An {{overseas}} Chinese born in Trinidad, Dai {{had come to}} Hong Kong to support the war effort. Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, {{they fell in love}} and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated her as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> her own child.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the policy, when Hulteen retired in 1994 from AT, AT {{calculated}} her pension benefits by excluding 210 days that it would have credited <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> granted leave because of any disability other than pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|These rules made it {{practically}} {{impossible to}} convict any woman of adultery; {{in nearly every}} case, women were acquitted. However, due {{to the belief that}} a priest should be untainted, a Kohen was compelled to divorce his wife <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raped.|$|E

50|$|When Catherine arrives home {{later than}} usual, David asks her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> unfaithful. Catherine tells him <b>she</b> thinks he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> unfaithful as well, {{and the two}} argue, {{stopping}} after being interrupted by their son, Michael.|$|R

25|$|In parliament, Hirsi Ali had {{supported}} the way Verdonk handled the Pasic case, although privately {{she felt that}} Pasic should {{have been allowed to}} stay. On the night before the debate, she phoned Verdonk to tell her that she had lied when she applied for asylum in the Netherlands, just as Pasic had. She said that Verdonk responded that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> minister at that time, she would have had Hirsi Ali deported.|$|E
25|$|In {{the special}} bonus chapter, Lyra {{has a new}} dream. She was in the Town of Wish, her family was calling for her, but Lyra couldn't hear them over the sound of rushing water. Her body became light as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> floating. Lyra held her breath and fell deeper into that strange dream. Once again, she finds herself alone in another unrecognizable place, a small office in the Barge City, and looks for a magic map.|$|E
25|$|In late November 2014 militants {{on social}} media started {{claiming}} that Rosenberg has been captured, along with several other female fighters by ISIL perhaps during the Siege of Kobanî. This was denied by Kurdish officials {{who said she was}} nowhere near Kobanî. On December 1, Rosenberg updated her Facebook page, saying that she was safe. If captured, she would have been the second Israeli dual citizen, after American-Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff, and the first Canadian, to be held hostage by ISIL. There was also speculation that, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> captured, Canada might have mounted a rescue operation to retrieve her.|$|E

60|$|Then there ensues a {{dialogue}} to this effect: Sir John asks Lady Cicely <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> out. He might almost have guessed {{it from her}} coming in in a hat and cloak, but Sir John is an English baronet.|$|R

25|$|The {{position}} of women under Welsh law differed significantly {{to that of}} their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man {{without the consent of}} her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given by her kin.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Booth {{could not}} have {{accomplished}} so much <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hampered, as many women are, by conditions demanding exertion in other than her chosen path, and without the comfort about her of a perfect home. She {{lived in the city}} of New York, in the neighborhood of Central Park, in a house which she owned, with her sister by adoption, Mrs. Anno W. Wright, between whom and herself there exists one of those lifelong and tender affections which are too intimate and delicate for public mention, but which are among the friendships of history, — a friendship that was begun in childhood and that cannot cease in death.|$|E
25|$|Carolyn Nadine Davis, 14 years old, {{ran away}} from her home outside Anderson in Shasta County on February 6, 1973 but {{disappeared}} July 15 after being dropped off by her grandmother at the Garberville Post Office. She was last seen hitchhiking that afternoon near the Highway 101 ramp, southbound, in Garberville. Her body was discovered on July 31 just three feet from where the remains of Sterling and Weber had been recovered seven months prior. Cause of death was strychnine poisoning 10–14 days before discovery. It could not be determined <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raped. Investigators postulated that her body had been thrown from the road as the hillside brush appeared undisturbed.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{after the}} fifth dish of the dinner, the groom and bride and their {{families}} will approach each table to toast the guests. Very often, the bride will change into a traditional Chinese red wedding dress (鳳褂, or qípáo) at that time, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> wearing a different style of clothing before.|$|R
50|$|In chapter 3.4, {{the text}} gives {{the right to}} a woman that she may remarry anyone <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wants to, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{abandoned}} by the man she was betrothed to, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> does not hear back from him for three menstrual periods, or <b>if</b> <b>she</b> does hear back and has waited for seven menses.|$|R

25|$|King Charles was {{executed}} by Parliament in 1649; his death left Henrietta Maria almost destitute and in shock, a situation not {{helped by the}} French civil war of the Fronde, which left Henrietta Maria's nephew King Louis XIV short of money himself. Henrietta Maria also {{was no longer the}} Queen but the Queen Mother to the young King Charles II. During the ensuing, and final, Third English Civil War the whole of the Royalist circle now based itself from St-Germain, with the Queen Mother's followers being joined by the old Royalist circle who had been with Charles II at the Hague, including Ormonde and Inchiquin and Clarendon, whom she particularly disliked. She also quarrelled with Ormonde: when she said that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> trusted the King would be in England, Ormonde, with his usual bluntness, retorted that if she had never been trusted the King need never have left England. Co-location began to bring the factions together, but Henrietta Maria's influence was waning. In 1654, Charles II moved his court on to Cologne, eliminating the remaining influence of the Queen Mother in St-Germain.|$|E
500|$|In February 1553 Princess Mary visited London and {{was welcomed}} in the {{outskirts}} by the Earl of Warwick {{at the head}} of numerous gentlemen. It was a splendid occasion, Mary being received by the Lords of the Council [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Queen of England". Still without a proper income of his own, in the next month, Warwick received the wardship of his fourteen-year-old brother-in-law, Edward Seymour.|$|E

5000|$|As a child, Treechada {{knew she}} was a girl, but {{in front of her}} parents, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to pretend and live as a male. She felt disgusted by her [...] "male" [...] genitals, so at the age of 17, she {{underwent}} sex reassignment surgery and since then, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> said that <b>she</b> feels as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reborn.|$|R

500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, when asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, [...] "We {{all have our}} standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean {{as any of the}} people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{with many}} Simpsons characters, Marge's age and {{birthday}} changes {{to serve the}} story.

In [...] "Homer's Paternity Coot" [...] (season 17, 2006), Marge states that Emerald would have been her birthstone <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born three months later, placing her birthday sometime in February. [...] In [...] "Regarding Margie" [...] (season 17, 2006), Homer mentioned that Marge was his age, meaning she could have been anywhere between 36 and 40.

500|$|Throughout {{his trial}} and bankruptcy, Van Meegeren {{maintained}} that {{his second wife}} Jo {{had nothing to do}} with the creation and sale of his forgeries. A large part of his considerable wealth had been transferred to her when they were divorced during the war and the money would have been confiscated <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> ruled to be an accomplice. Van Meegeren told the same story to all authors, journalists, and biographers: [...] "Jo didn’t know", and apparently most believed him. Some biographers believe, however, that Jo must have known the truth. Her involvement was never proven and she was able to keep her substantial capital. Jo outlived her husband by many years, always in great luxury, until her death at the age of 91.|$|E
