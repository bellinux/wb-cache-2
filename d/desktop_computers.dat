5|$|Although most {{computer}} {{languages are}} not designed with commands or libraries for matrices, {{as early as}} the 1970s, some engineering <b>desktop</b> <b>computers</b> such as the HP 9830 had ROM cartridges to add BASIC commands for matrices. Some computer languages such as APL were designed to manipulate matrices, and various mathematical programs can be used to aid computing with matrices.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro is {{a series}} of {{workstation}} and server computers manufactured by Apple Inc. The Mac Pro, in most configurations and in terms of speed and performance, is the most powerful computer that Apple offers.

Students begin learning basic keyboard and mouse skills in kindergarten and progress to multimedia presentations, data management, and software coding in the eighth group.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987. <b>Desktop</b> <b>computers</b> from Apple and IBM had been steadily gaining speed and power and in 1987 they became more powerful than the more expensive Lisp machines made by Symbolics and others. There was no longer a good reason to buy them. An entire industry worth half a billion dollars was demolished overnight.|$|E
5|$|The Paul A. M. Dirac Science Library is {{the main}} science library for Florida State University and houses over 500,000 books. Located on FSU's Legacy Walk farther west on campus, Dirac Library is smaller than Strozier at three stories. Dirac offers nearly 800 seats and {{provides}} 80 <b>desktop</b> <b>computers</b> (PC and Mac) and 80 laptop computers(PC and Mac) for use by students. Dirac also offers 8 wireless Air Media Displays and 2 innovative MondoPad displays. There are over 35 individual and group study rooms that can be reserved online. The library building {{is also home to}} the FSU School of Computational Science and Information Technology. The library also houses a collection of materials principally related to Dirac's times at FSU and Cambridge University. Dirac has been renovated in 2015 with new and improved amenities, technology, and seating.|$|E

25|$|The Mac Mini is an {{entry-level}} computer intended for budget-minded customers. Until the 2011 release, the Mac Mini had much less processing power {{than the other}} computers of the Macintosh lineup. Unlike regular <b>desktop</b> <b>computers,</b> which use standard-sized components such as 3.5-inch hard drives and full-size DIMM's, Apple uses lower-power laptop components in the Mac Mini to fit all the necessary components into the small case and to prevent overheating. Previously, with the choice of components on the older models, the machine was considered somewhat slower than standard <b>desktop</b> <b>computers.</b> It also had less storage and memory than comparable desktops. However, the 2011 upgrade addressed many of these previous complaints.|$|E
