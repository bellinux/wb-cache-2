40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a single intravenous treatment with glucocorticoids (GC) encapsulated in long-circulating PEG-liposomes on both joint inflammation and cartilage destruction and to {{investigate the}} phenomenon of selective homing of these liposomes in the inflamed synovium. METHODS: Mice with collagen type II-induced arthritis (CIA) were intravenously treated with liposomal and free prednisolone phosphate (PLP) {{a few days after the}} first signs of the disease. Joint inflammation was scored during 1 week after treatment, after which sections of the knee joints were prepared for assessment of cartilage damage. In addition, arthritic mice were treated with liposomes containing colloidal gold. 24 hours after injection, knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> were prepared in which the location of liposomes was visualised. RESULTS: Treatment of CIA with 10 mg/kg liposomal PLP resulted in a strong and lasting resolution of joint inflammation. 10 mg/kg free PLP only became slightly effective after repeated daily injections. Although joint inflammation recurred 1 week after treatment with liposomal PLP, knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> prepared at this time indicated that the cartilage damage was still reduced. Localisation of gold labelled liposomes in the inflamed joints was seen in the proximity of blood vessels, in the cellular infiltrate, but mainly in the synovial lining. Unaffected joints did not take up liposomes. CONCLUSIONS: By using the property of long-circulating liposomes to target the synovial lining selectively in inflamed joints, the anti-inflammatory activity of GC can be greatly increased, showing also the beneficial effect of reduced cartilage destruction...|$|R

40|$|Wim B. van den Berg* Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory joint disease, leading to cartilage and bone destruction. In this study, we investigated {{the effects of}} local IL- 4 application, introduced by a recombinant human type 5 adenovirus vector, in the knee joint of mice with collagen-induced arthritis. One intraarticular injection with an IL- 4 -expressing virus caused overexpression of IL- 4 in the mouse knee joint. Enhanced onset and aggravation of the synovial inflammation {{were found in the}} IL- 4 group. However, despite ongoing inflammation, histologic analysis showed impressive prevention of chondrocyte death and cartilage erosion. In line with this, chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis was enhanced in the articular cartilage. This was quantified with ex vivo 35 S-sulfate incorporation in patellar cartilage and confirmed by autoradiography on whole knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections.</b> Reduction of cartilage erosion was further substantiated by lack of expression of the stromelysin-dependent cartilage proteoglycan breakdown neoepitope VDIPEN in the Ad 5 E 1 mIL- 4 -treated knee joint. Reduced metalloproteinase activity was also supported by markedly diminished mRNA expression of stromelysin- 3 in the synovial tissue. Histologic analysis revealed marked reduction of polymorphonuclear cells in the synovial joint space in the IL- 4 -treated joints. This was confirmed by immunolocalization studies on knee <b>joint</b> <b>sections</b> using NIMP-R 14 staining and diminished mRNA expression of macrophage-inflammatory protein- 2 in the synovium tissue. mRNA levels of TNF- � and IL- 1 � were suppressed as well, and IL- 1 � and nitric oxide production by arthritic synovial tissue were strongly reduced.

50|$|The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire {{line was}} {{originally}} proposed (in 1891) {{to run through}} Dumbarton to Aber Bay, near Ross Priory on the east shore of Loch Lomond. This would have closely followed the North British line {{in the confines of}} the valley of the River Leven. The duplication aroused considerable opposition from residents and shareholders, and the compromise had been reached that the section of the existing line from Dumbarton to Balloch would be made joint. This arrangement was confirmed by Act of Parliament of 27 July 1892, and incidentally included transfer to joint control of steamers on Loch Lomond. From Dumbarton Junction the NBR line to Balloch was to be transferred to joint control, between the NBR, the L&DR and the Caledonian Railway, on the day that the L&DR opened its line for passengers to that point.

50|$|On {{the north}} side of Fort Wayne at the Dupont Road {{interchange}} of Interstate 69 (I-69), the northern section of SR 1 begins and heads east. The road heads away from I-69 as a six-lane divided highway, along the south edge of the Parkview Regional Medical Center complex, passing through numerous commercial properties. The highway narrows to a four-lane divided highway at Diebold Road and then enters an area of mixed commercial and residential properties. At Tonkel Road, SR 1 begins to curve northeast toward Leo and narrows to a two-lane highway. The route then leaves Fort Wayne, passing through rural farm land with scattered houses. Curving due north to enter Leo on Main Street, SR 1 then passes through residential areas of that town. North of downtown Leo the highway curves northeast and passes through a mix of commercial and residential properties. As the road enters DeKalb County it curves to run due north. The highway then enters Spencerville, passing through the center of town. After Spencerville, the road curves northeast, before again turning back north. The highway enters St. Joe and takes a sharp curve to head due east. The route crosses the CSX Railroad tracks and makes another sharp curve heading due north. The road continues north until it meets SR 8. The two routes head east-southeast for a 1.04 mi concurrency, until SR 1 departs the <b>joint</b> <b>section</b> heading due north. The road then passes through rural farmland, with a few houses, as a two-lane highway. Upon entering Butler it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks, before encountering a signalized intersection with US 6 in downtown Butler. SR 1 then leaves Butler heading due north until it intersects DeKalb County Road 46, at which point the highway turns northwest. The route enter Hamilton and begins a concurrency with SR 427, heading northeast and passing Hamilton Lake. After 0.84 mi, SR 1 leaves the concurrency heading due north. The highway then continues in that direction until reaching its northern terminus at US 20.|$|E
