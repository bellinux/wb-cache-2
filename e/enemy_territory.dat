5|$|The East German {{government}} {{sought to}} define {{the country as a}} legitimate state in its own right and portrayed West Germany as <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> (feindliches Ausland)– a capitalist, semi-fascist state that exploited its citizens, sought to regain the lost territories of the Third Reich, and stood opposed to the peaceful socialism of the GDR.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} on Hill 303 led UN commander, General Douglas MacArthur, to broadcast to the North Korean Army on August 20, denouncing the atrocities. The U.S. Air Force dropped many leaflets over <b>enemy</b> <b>territory,</b> addressed to North Korean commanders. MacArthur warned {{that he would}} hold North Korea's senior military leaders responsible for the event and any other war crimes.|$|E
5|$|Under Napoleon, a new {{emphasis}} towards the destruction, not just outmanoeuvring, of enemy armies emerged. Invasions of <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant {{more than the}} loss of isolated enclaves. Near-Carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts, intensifying the Revolutionary phenomenon of total war.|$|E

50|$|When {{the player}} captures the <b>enemy's</b> <b>territory,</b> the battle's wrap-up begins. First, the <b>enemy's</b> <b>territory</b> {{is added to}} your own; if you have {{captured}} the enemy's capital, all {{of his or her}} unconquered territory will be added to your own at once. After this occurs, the enemy general will be brought to you {{as long as you have}} not killed them in battle, and you will have the opportunity to attempt to recruit them.|$|R

5|$|In 1885, the Tecks {{returned}} to London, {{and took up}} residence at White Lodge, in Richmond Park. May was close to her mother, and acted as an unofficial secretary, helping to organise parties and social events. She was also close to her aunt, the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and wrote to her every week. During the First World War, the Crown Princess of Sweden helped pass letters from May to her aunt, who lived in <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> in Germany until her death in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The second {{operation}} {{takes them}} to Russia in order to rescue one of their allies, a Russian informant named Nikolai working within the Ultranationalist party. Assisted by Russian Loyalist forces, Price's team succeeds in rescuing Nikolai. However, their helicopter is later brought down, forcing the group {{to make their way}} through <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> with support from an AC-130 gunship before they can be extracted. Intelligence gathered from these two missions indicates that Al-Asad may be in possession of a Russian nuclear device.|$|E
5|$|While {{sound in}} theory, it proved much more {{difficult}} in practice. Inexperience told and by December 1940 NGJ 2 had lost 32 aircrew killed in action and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF aircraft claimed shot down. Despite the claims made by German crews, evidence showed {{a considerable amount of}} over claiming, and the difficulty in substantiating claims at night and over <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> became evident.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding these anecdotes, and the {{necessary}} hardship they {{would seem to}} imply, I do not believe there was much unwarrantable pillaging considering {{that we were in}} the <b>enemy's</b> <b>territory</b> and without any supplies except such as the country afforded.|$|R
5000|$|Shinobi-monomi {{were people}} used in secret ways, and their duties {{were to go}} into the {{mountains}} and disguise themselves as firewood gatherers to discover and acquire the news about an <b>enemy's</b> <b>territory...</b> they were particularly expert at travelling in disguise.|$|R
5000|$|The tyrant of Syracuse Agathocles {{escapes from}} {{the siege of}} the city by the Carthaginians with a fleet and carries the war with the Carthaginians back into his <b>enemy's</b> <b>territory.</b> He defeats the Carthaginians in the Battle of White Tunis.|$|R
5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the <b>enemy</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Castles {{served a}} range of purposes, the most {{important}} of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which {{could be used as a}} base of operations in <b>enemy</b> <b>territory.</b> Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.|$|E
25|$|Movement and Development of Troops (Chinese: 行軍) {{describes}} the different {{situations in which}} an army finds itself as it moves through new <b>enemy</b> <b>territories,</b> and {{how to respond to}} these situations.

5000|$|During the Cold War, espionage {{balloons}} {{launched by}} the [...] "Free world" [...] had a secondary psychological warfare capability, carrying propaganda pamphlets and consumer goods (which were supposedly not freely available inside Communist states) that would be released or otherwise delivered onto <b>enemy</b> <b>territories.</b>|$|R
5|$|Joachim Roth's {{low-level}} navigation {{had been}} extremely accurate. He had navigated his unit to within two minutes flying {{time from the}} target without interception, over unfamiliar <b>enemy</b> <b>territory,</b> on time and exactly on the planned route. But as the Dorniers neared the airfield they noticed {{that there was no}} smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over the airfield the air was suddenly filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{forced the}} rebellious Serbs, and their leader, Uroš II, to vassalage (1150–1152). He then made {{repeated}} attacks upon the Hungarians {{with a view}} to annexing their territory along the Sava. In the wars of 1151–1153 and 1163–1168 Manuel led his troops into Hungary and a spectacular raid deep into <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> yielded substantial war booty. In 1167, Manuel sent 15,000 men under the command of Andronikos Kontostephanos against the Hungarians, scoring a decisive victory at the Battle of Sirmium and enabling the Empire to conclude a very advantageous peace with the Hungarian Kingdom by which Syrmia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia were ceded. By 1168 nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel's hands.|$|E
5|$|Popular myth {{has it that}} a US Army {{airplane}} {{had flown}} over Villalba {{on the day of}} the invasion and dropped a yellow silk foulard marked with a black L (indicating Luciano). Two days later, three American tanks rolled into Villalba after driving thirty miles through <b>enemy</b> <b>territory.</b> Don Calogero climbed aboard and spent the next six days traveling through western Sicily organizing support for the advancing American troops. As General Patton's Third Division moved onward the signs of its dependence on Mafia support were obvious to the local population. The Mafia protected the roads from snipers, arranged enthusiastic welcomes for the advancing troops, and provided guides through the confusing mountain terrain.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to Clausewitz, Antoine-Henri Jomini dealt mainly with operational strategy, planning and intelligence, {{the conduct of}} the campaign, and [...] "generalship" [...] rather than [...] "statesmanship". He proposed that victory could be achieved by occupying the <b>enemy's</b> <b>territory</b> rather than destroying his army.|$|R

50|$|The {{feeding of}} the soldier {{was and still is}} a unit commander's responsibility. Historically, unit feeding was {{dependent}} upon foraging in the <b>enemy's</b> <b>territory,</b> the baggage train being as small as possible. If a commander failed in his task, his company merely melted away. Cause and effect were apparent.|$|R
5|$|Ranked wing {{commander}} at {{the outbreak of}} World WarII, by September 1941 Bladin had been raised to temporary air commodore. He became Air Officer Commanding North-Western Area in March 1942, following the first Japanese air raids on Darwin, Northern Territory. Personally leading sorties against <b>enemy</b> <b>territory,</b> he earned the United States Silver Star for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to No.38 Group RAF in Europe, where he was mentioned in despatches. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the same year.|$|E
5|$|Tack's {{column was}} {{reinforced}} by the garrison of Semarang and marched southward to the Pajang district, where it fought the followers of Trunajaya's ally Raden Kajoran. Hurdt and Amangkurat's column re-assembled in Godong on the Serang River and stayed there for six days. Their artillery and supplies were brought there by river, but now had to join the southward march overland through <b>enemy</b> <b>territory.</b> This column then joined Tack's column in the Solo River valley (the river was then called the Semanggi River). Meanwhile, van Renesse and Mulder's column passed Pati, was joined by the VOC troops there, and marched through a different route towards Kediri.|$|E
5|$|The Special Air Service (SAS) is a {{regiment}} of the British Army {{and part}} of the United Kingdom's special forces. The regiment was formed by Colonel David Stirling in Africa in 1941, {{at the height of the}} Second World War. Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in <b>enemy</b> <b>territory,</b> first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe. Stirling established the principle of using small teams, usually of just four men, to carry out raids, having realised that a four-man team could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The War of the Ring mode {{carried over}} from the first game in the series {{combines}} turn-based strategy elements with real-time skirmishes. Middle-earth is divided into territories; players can construct buildings to produce troops only in a claimed territory. During each turn, the player can move their armies into neutral and <b>enemy</b> <b>territories</b> {{to take control of}} them. While neutral territories are conquered by simply entering them, <b>enemy</b> <b>territories</b> must be wrested from the other player by defeating them in a skirmish. Troops can be garrisoned in conquered territories to defend against enemy attacks. When the player chooses to attack another territory, or one of their territories is being invaded by an enemy, they can either simulate the match and let the computer determine the outcome, or play the match by commanding the units in real time. The winner of the skirmish gains the territory, and all surviving units gain experience points. To win the game, players must either control the <b>enemy's</b> capital <b>territory,</b> or take over a given number of territories in Middle-earth.|$|R
5|$|The Spitfire {{continued}} to play increasingly diverse roles throughout the Second World War and beyond, often in air forces other than the RAF. For example, the Spitfire became the first high-speed photo-reconnaissance aircraft to be operated by the RAF. Sometimes unarmed, they flew at high, medium and low altitudes, often ranging far into <b>enemy</b> <b>territory</b> to closely observe the Axis powers and provide an almost continual flow of valuable intelligence information throughout the war. In 1941 and 1942, PRU Spitfires provided the first photographs of the Freya and Würzburg radar systems and, in 1943, helped confirm that the Germans were building the V1 and V2 Vergeltungswaffe ("vengeance weapons") by photographing Peenemünde, on the Baltic Sea coast of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The plane's {{landing gear}} {{mired in the}} water and mud, causing the plane to flip upside down and skid to a stop. Although the {{aircraft}} survived the landing nearly intact, Petty Officer Koga died instantly on impact, probably from a broken neck or a blunt-force blow to his head. Koga's wingmen, circling above, had orders to destroy any Zeros that crash-landed in <b>enemy</b> <b>territory,</b> but as they did not know if Koga was still alive, they could not bring themselves to strafe his plane. They decided to leave without firing on it. The Japanese submarine stationed off Akutan Island to pick up pilots searched for Koga in vain before being driven off by the destroyer USS Williamson.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} {{stage of the}} Normandy invasion, {{the decision was made}} to land the 6th Airborne Division (Major-General Richard Gale) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives. Their primary objective was to capture the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German flanking attack on the landing area. Failure to capture the bridges would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in <b>enemy</b> <b>territory,</b> so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend the bridges against counter-attacks. Gale decided that the only way to capture the bridges intact was by a glider coup de main assault. He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation.|$|E
