25|$|According {{to later}} analysis, the {{earliness}} with which a country left {{the gold standard}} reliably predicted its economic recovery. For example, Great Britain and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer.
