5|$|Bubbles {{was born}} in early 1983 in an Austin, Texas {{research}} facility that bred primates for animal testing. There are conflicting reports as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> into Jackson's possession. Multiple reports state that Jackson had Bubbles bought for him when the chimpanzee was eight months old. The acquisition {{was said to have}} been supervised by Bob Dunn, then one of Hollywood's most famous suppliers and trainers of animals for films, photoshoots and advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Two of the book's major {{topics are}} the strains in Blair's {{relationship}} with Brown after Blair allegedly reneged on the pair's 1994 agreement {{to step down}} as Prime Minister much earlier, and his controversial decision {{to participate in the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair discusses Labour's future after the 2010 general election, his relations with the Royal Family, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to respect President George W. Bush. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler at the zoo, recounts <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E
25|$|Gûlavhar, the Terror of Arnor – Gulavhar is a {{being from}} an earlier time that should have perished long ago - a winged demon with a hunger for blood. <b>How</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to survive the terrible wars against Morgoth will never be known, yet survive he did, {{sleeping}} through countless centuries.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it was a}} {{considerable}} success and saved a difficult – almost a desperate – situation. Another criticism of the play is that {{the form of the}} Sherlock Holmes short stories is missing. Holmes appears late in the narrative, while the ending is missing Holmes' explanations of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to his deductions – considered de rigueur among Holmes aficionados.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Donatello," [...] {{said the}} sculptor. [...] "The man {{is no more}} a phantom than yourself. The only marvel is, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to be hiding himself in the catacomb. Possibly our guide might solve the riddle." ...|$|R

25|$|The 1998 edition, {{published}} {{to anticipate}} the movie's release, used cover art from the film, with an afterword by producer Stephen Simon (a.k.a. Stephen Deutsch) explaining <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> across the book, {{what it meant to}} him, and how it has changed many people's lives. The book had been out of print for years prior to the movie's release, but the 1998 edition, by Tor Books, reached the New York Times Best Seller list. Tor also published The Path, a nonfiction book in which Matheson expressed his own spiritual beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Hephaestus grows uglier {{and more}} violent with age. Thetis and Eurynome {{give him a}} hammer, anvil and forge to vent his fury and {{discover}} he is a gifted smith. Hephaestus' most beautiful creation is a brooch depicting a sea nymph and her lover; he threatens to destroy the brooch unless Thetis tells him {{who he is and}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to live in the grotto. The goddesses resume their tales: Rhea and Zeus conspire to overthrow Cronus. The avenging children of Cronus defeat and imprison the Titans, sparing Rhea, Prometheus and Epimetheus.|$|E
25|$|Semenov was a Transbaikalian Cossack – {{dark and}} thickset, {{and of the}} rather alert Mongolian type. His {{intelligence}} was of a specifically Cossack calibre, {{and he was an}} exemplary soldier, especially courageous when under the eye of his superior. He knew how to make himself popular with Cossacks and officers alike, but he had his weaknesses in a love of intrigue and indifference to the means by which he achieved his ends. Though capable and ingenious, he had received no education, and his outlook was narrow. I {{have never been able to}} understand <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to play a leading role.|$|E
60|$|CANDIDA (looking at him). Yes: it {{will depend}} on what happens to him. (He look vacantly at her.) Don't you see? It {{will depend on}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to learn what love really is. I mean on the sort of woman who will teach it to him.|$|R
50|$|The film follows Hiccup and {{his young}} fellows {{accompanying}} their mentor, Gobber, on a quest to kill the legendary Boneknapper Dragon. About half the film is done in traditional animation, showing Gobber's history and his encounters with the Boneknapper, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> to look like he does now.|$|R

25|$|In {{all three}} accounts, after Jesus {{got into the}} ship, the wind ceased and they reached the shore. Only John's account has their ship {{immediately}} reach the shore. Matthew's and Mark's accounts end at this point, but John mentions that the next day some people {{from the other side}} of the sea that looked for Jesus, noted that the disciples left without him, but they didn't know where he went. When they came to Capernaum and asked Jesus <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> there, instead of answering the question, he told the crowd that they followed him, not because they had seen signs, but because of the free loaves they had eaten the day before, and he advised them not to seek earthly gains, but aim for a life based on higher spiritual values.|$|E
25|$|His {{start in}} show business, like his early life, is also {{shrouded}} in myth. Most sources cite his first female role originally having {{been at the}} age of ten with the Boston Cadets Review at the Tremont Theater in Boston. He is reported to have played the role so well that the next year the revue was written around him which led to minor roles elsewhere. But as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to perform as a female a decade later with the Boston Cadets, sources differ. In some versions he was taking cakewalk lessons from a Mrs. Wyman's dance studio when he impressed upon his teacher an incredible ability to emulate females. It is said to be Mrs. Wyman who encouraged young William to study the art of female impersonation. Boys often play female roles in all male theater groups.|$|E
25|$|The emperor is astounded at {{the noble}} bearing of this merchant's son and asks the boy if Clement is his real father. Florent replies equivocally. Clement {{explains}} truthfully <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{by the child}} and the Emperor realises that Florent is his long-lost son. The next morning, Florent rides out to the pavilion of the Saracen king, provoking, by his confident boasts, a military engagement the very next day. He rides back to Paris to warn everybody of the impending battle. The next day the forces engage and the fighting is long and hard. Sir Florent performs magnificently, wearing Marsabelle's sleeve on his lance, and saves the Christian forces from defeat. As night falls and the armies fall back, Florent rides to where Marsabelle is staying, where she vows to marry him and become a Christian, and warns him about her father's invincible horse.|$|E

Well, we soon find out. Come on, Major." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I Just Make Them Up, See!" [...] is a comic poem by Isaac Asimov {{written in}} 1957. The poem is a {{monologue}} from a fan, asking Asimov <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> {{up with his}} ideas. The question is not answered in the poem, but rather the title itself: I Just Make Them Up, See! ...|$|R
50|$|Wichiwichi Wichiwi: He is {{a little}} bird, Plim Plim's boon {{companion}} and messenger. His language sounds exactly like his name, but whistled. He carries messages from Plim Plim and belongs in the same magical world. Nobody knows <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> or <b>how</b> <b>he</b> goes. He is the link between Plim Plim and the children and is always interacting with them. Sometimes he is a bit clumsy.|$|R
25|$|In 629, Emperor Gaozu's son and successor, Emperor Taizong, {{ordered his}} {{officials}} to submit suggestions for him. As Chang was unacquainted with historical writings, Ma drafted some 20 suggestions for him. When Emperor Taizong read the suggestions that Chang submitted, he was impressed, {{but he knew}} that Chang was not well-studied, he summoned Chang to ask him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> up with the suggestions. Chang told Emperor Taizong that he did not write the suggestions and that Ma did. He also told Emperor Taizong that whenever he conversed with Ma, Ma was always concerned about faithfulness and filial piety. Emperor Taizong sent messengers to summon Ma into his presence, and once they conversed, he was impressed by Ma and, while initially not giving him an official position, had him serve at the examination bureau of the government (門下省, Menxia Sheng). In 632, he officially made Ma a governmental auditor. He awarded Chang silk for having discovered Ma.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} the Athenians would not believe their loss, in a great degree because {{of the person who}} first brought them news of it. For a certain stranger, it seems, coming to Piraeus, and there sitting in a barber's shop, began to talk of what had happened, as if the Athenians already knew all that had passed; which the barber hearing, before he acquainted anybody else, ran {{as fast as he could}} up into the city, {{addressed}} himself to the Archons, and presently spread it about in the public Place. On which, there being everywhere, as may be imagined, terror and consternation, the Archons summoned a general assembly, and there brought in the man and questioned him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to know. And he, giving no satisfactory account, was taken for a spreader of false intelligence and a disturber of the city, and was, therefore, fastened to the wheel and racked a long time, till other messengers arrived that related the whole disaster particularly. So hardly was Nicias believed to have suffered the calamity which he had often predicted.|$|E
25|$|The script {{laid out}} quite {{specifically}} how characters were {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose how to bring these directions to life. For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to guess what technical adjustments had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E
