500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked what he likes about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You <b>know</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 1994 {{article in}} the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine {{followed}} 39 patients treated with Hoxsey Therapy in Tijuana. Patient interviews were used to confirm the existence and stage of cancer; some of the patients were unaware of the stage of their tumor {{and in some cases}} medical records were not available. Most patients were lost to follow-up; of the patients successfully followed who claimed to use the formula, 9 died and 6 were alive. The 6 survivors all claimed by mailed responses to questionnaires to be disease-free after five years of follow-up. Review of this study pointed out its [...] "obvious flaws", including [...] "the majority of patients lost to follow-up, lack of access to detailed medical records, and reliance upon patients for disease stage information"; the authors themselves regarded the results as unclear. These same authors interviewed patients at other alternative cancer clinics in Mexico. Not one patient at these other clinics claimed that they personally knew anyone who had attended those clinics and had been cured of cancer (or anything else). As a curious anecdote, every one of the 39 patients attending the Hoxsey clinic (the [...] "Bio-medical Center") claimed to personally <b>know</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was diagnosed with cancer in North America, came to the Hoxsey clinic, and claimed to be cured of their cancer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{experience with the}} criminal justice system contextualizes the relationship between people’s attitudes toward informal and formal social con-trols. In a survey of residents of Leon County, Florida, we asked respondents whether or not they <b>knew</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had been incarcerated. We also asked about their assessment of informal controls in their neighborhoods and about public control with questions about police, judges, and {{the criminal justice system}} as a whole. We find that knowing <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has been incarcerated makes people with a low assess-ment of formal control also have a low opinion of informal control. Blacks are more likely than nonblacks to have a low opinion of informal social control only if they have not been exposed to incarceration. <b>Knowing</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has been incarcerated makes blacks and nonblacks just as likely to hold a negative assessment of informal social control...|$|R

6000|$|Charlotte had for {{a moment}} a pause; it had {{continued}} {{to come to her}} that really to have her case [...] "out," [...] as they said, with the person in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred themselves, would help her, on the whole, more than hinder; and under that feeling all her opportunity, with nothing kept back; with a thing or two perhaps even thrust forward, seemed temptingly to open. Besides, didn't Fanny at bottom half expect, absolutely at the bottom half WANT, things?-- so that she would be disappointed if, after what must just have occurred for her, she didn't get something to put between the teeth of her so restless rumination, that cultivation of the fear, of which our young woman had already had glimpses, that she might have [...] "gone too far" [...] in her irrepressible interest in other lives. What had just happened--it pieced itself together for Charlotte--was that the Assingham pair, drifting like everyone else, had had somewhere in the gallery, in the rooms, an accidental concussion; had it after the Colonel, over his balustrade, had observed, in the favouring high light, her public junction with the Prince. His very dryness, in this encounter, had, as always, struck a spark from his wife's curiosity, and, familiar, on his side, with all that she saw in things, he had thrown her, as a fine little bone to pick, some report of the way one of her young friends was [...] "going on" [...] with another. He knew perfectly--such at least was Charlotte's liberal assumption--that she wasn't going on with anyone, but she also knew that, given the circumstances, she was inevitably to be sacrificed, in some form or another, to the humorous intercourse of the inimitable couple. The Prince meanwhile had also, under coercion, sacrificed her; the Ambassador had come up to him with a message from Royalty, to whom he was led away; after which she had talked for five minutes with Sir John Brinder, who had been of the Ambassador's company and who had rather artlessly remained with her. Fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same moment as someone else she didn't <b>know,</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> knew Mrs. Assingham and also knew Sir John. Charlotte had left it to her friend's competence to throw the two others immediately together and to find a way for entertaining her in closer quarters. This was the little history of the vision, in her, that was now rapidly helping her to recognise a precious chance, the chance that mightn't again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point. Her point was before her; it was sharp, bright, true; above all it was her own. She had reached it quite by herself; no one, not even Amerigo--Amerigo least of all, who would {{have nothing to do with}} it--had given her aid. To make it now with force for Fanny Assingham's benefit would see her further, in the direction in which the light had dawned, than any other spring she should, yet awhile, doubtless, be able to press. The direction was that of her greater freedom--which was all in the world she had in mind. Her opportunity had accordingly, after a few minutes of Mrs. Assingham's almost imprudently interested expression of face, positively acquired such a price for her that she may, for ourselves, while the intensity lasted, rather resemble a person holding out a small mirror at arm's length and consulting it with a special turn of the head. It was, in a word, with this value of her chance that she was intelligently playing when she said in answer to Fanny's last question: [...] "Don't you remember what you told me, on the occasion of something or other, the other day? That you believe there's nothing I'm afraid of? So, my dear, don't ask me!" ...|$|E

40|$|Cyberbullying is a {{relatively}} new and serious form of bullying with negative social and emotional effects on both victims and perpetrators. Like traditional bullying, cyberbullying is a social phenomenon and often unfolds {{in the context of a}} large network of bystanders. This study examined gender and age of cyberbullying bystanders out of 2109 upper primary and secondary school students in Australia. The actions the bystanders took when a peer was cybervictimised were analysed. The results of the study suggested bystanders to cyberbullying were most likely not to do anything or help the person cyberbullied at the time. Girls were more prosocial in helping students who were cyberbullied than boys. In addition, those students <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was bullied in both ways were more likely to tell their parents and friends about it than those <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was cyberbullied only. Implications for prevention and intervention in cyberbullying are discussed...|$|R
