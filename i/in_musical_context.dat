2500|$|Swans' {{music has}} {{transformed}} greatly over the decades, but is typically dark and [...] "apocalyptic", often focusing on themes of power, religion, sex and death, {{and has been}} most generally associated with experimental rock. According to Spin, the band demonstrates [...] "unparalleled ability to translate the absurd violence {{of the human condition}} into music that’s as intoxicating as it is intense." [...] Swans' early work, rooted in the New York City-based no wave movement which was fading out by the time their formation in 1982, is extremely aggressive, characterized by Michael Gira as [...] "stripping down the essential elements of what we consider to be rock music". The Guardian described it as [...] "a cacophonous rhythmic throb which drew on post punk, industrial, doom metal, NYC avant minimalism and the blues; a sound which was matched by Gira's often nihilistic, anti-natalist and existential lyrical concerns ... delivered in a stentorian and messianic manner." [...] It was an important contribution to both industrial music and noise rock and influenced the emergence of grindcore (inspiring also the use of [...] "grind" [...] <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context)</b> and sludge metal. Later in the 1980s, Swans' music began to incorporate more melodic and intricate elements, especially since Jarboe's debut as a songwriter on 1987's Children of God. While generally maintaining much dissonance, the band's subsequent work further ventured into genres such as post-punk, gothic rock, neofolk, psychedelic rock and art rock. Their final album before breaking up, 1996's Soundtracks for the Blind, is a double album which emphasizes atmosphere, a contribution to the post-rock, drone and dark ambient genres. Since re-forming in 2010, Swans have continued to be associated with post-rock and drone music as well as noise rock. Their last three double albums, which have brought them widespread critical acclaim, often feature long songs that develop complex soundscapes.|$|E

40|$|Rhythm is an {{essential}} part of the structure, behaviour, and aesthetics of music. However, the cognitive processing that underlies the perception of musical rhythm is not fully understood. In this study, we tested whether rhythm perception is influenced by three factors: musical training, the presence of expressive performance cues in human-performed music, and the broader musical context. We compared musicians and nonmusicians’ similarity ratings for pairs of rhythms taken from Steve Reich’s Clapping Music. The rhythms were heard both in isolation and <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context</b> and both with and without expressive performance cues. The results revealed that rhythm perception is influenced by the experimental conditions: rhythms heard <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context</b> were rated as less similar than those heard in isolation; musicians’ ratings were unaffected by expressive performance, but nonmusicians rated expressively performed rhythms as less similar than those with exact timing; and expressively-performed rhythms were rated as less similar compared to rhythms with exact timing when heard in isolation but not when heard <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context.</b> The results also showed asymmetrical perception: the order in which two rhythms were heard influenced their perceived similarity. Analyses suggest that this asymmetry was driven by the internal coherence of rhythms, as measured by normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI). As predicted, rhythms were perceived as less similar when the first rhythm in a pair had greater coherence (lower nPVI) than the second rhythm, compared to when the rhythms were heard in the opposite order...|$|E

40|$|This PhD study investigates how our {{perception}} of musical chords, both in isolation and <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context,</b> is influenced and shaped by {{our knowledge of the}} tonal hierarchy and tonal syntax in terms of consonance/dissonance, pleasantness/unpleasantness, stability/instability, and relaxation/tension. Six experiments were conducted to gather behavioural data on the perception of chords from listeners with varying levels of musical training and experience. The first study is principally concerned with the influence of frequency of occurrence on the perception of twelve types of chord in isolation, including both triads and tetrads. It also examines to what extent factors besides frequency of occurrence, namely listener familiarity with the timbre in which chords are played and the acoustic features of chords, predict listener perception. The second and third studies concern the perception of chords <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context.</b> The second study focuses on musical contexts in which diminished and augmented chords appear, and on the harmonic functions of chords in short sequences of IV-V-I. Using sequences containing an augmented chord, the third study investigates the ways in which a non-diatonic tone can be anchored by its succeeding tone, and considers how the perception of these sequences is influenced by the harmonic function of its succeeding chord. These studies all reveal that the way in which chords and chord sequences are perceived is not completely predetermined by their acoustic, physical dimension. In addition, we impute on them a fluidity and elasticity {{as a result of our}} knowledge of the tonal hierarchy and tonal syntax in our musical schemata...|$|E

40|$|Throughout their studies, cellists use short {{technical}} exercises such as {{scales and}} études which, {{under the supervision}} of a teacher, provide the skills necessary to play the repertoire. Etudes in particular – this body of formal, pedagogical works that developed in tandem with the rise of the virtuoso – are designed to strengthen specific technical notions <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context,</b> providing access to more demanding repertoire. Surprisingly, however, the last significant collection of études for the cellist is Popper’s High School of Cello Playing (1905). The rich palette of extended techniques for cello, achieved through a century of innovation and experimentation, has no equivalent representation. The cellist who desires, or is required, to meet this new rise in virtuosity must essentially decipher new idioms alone, unless fortunate enough to work with a specialist who will pass on the fruits of personal experience. I suggest that many of the problems which modern music faces today are connected to the performer’s dearth of proficiency concerning certain musical and instrumental techniques. As a survey of pedagogical material will show, few steps have been taken to enable cellists to gain the technical fluency needed for providing engaging performances of 20 th- and 21 st-century repertoire. Through discussions with contemporary music specialists, the study of existing publications, and my own performing experience, I present the cello’s extended techniques as a linear progression of traditional technique. Three future projects guide the content and structure of this thesis: curriculum development, the creation of an online database, and the commissioning of concert études modelled on Paganini’s 24 Caprices for Solo Violin. The 24 sections of this thesis guide the reader through a technique’s origin and development, basic acoustical information, and performance advice, creating a pedagogical framework. Only with a clear methodological approach can contemporary music be expected to become more than a specialism...|$|E
40|$|In 1962 the Argentine-German {{composer}} Mauricio Kagel (1931 - 2008) {{completed an}} innovative multimedia/interdisciplinary piece, Antithese für einen Darsteller mit elektronischen und öffentlichen Klängen. The unique compositional style and formal structure consisting of heterogeneous compositional components reflected his profound insights into issues inherent in postwar avant-garde music. Kagel remarked strikingly that “anarchy {{in the piece}} was omnipresent. ” Indeed, {{his use of the}} term ‘anarchy’ is a keystone not only of the structural features of Antithese, but also of Kagel’s aesthetic of music in the piece. The present study seeks to reveal Kagel’s idea of anarchy <b>in</b> <b>musical</b> <b>context</b> and how he attempts to epitomize this particular thought in the complex and transliterate formal structure of Antithese. This study first reviews Kagel’s Buenos Aires period in terms of the cultivation and development of his musical composition and notion of anarchy. The review also incorporates problematic aspects of postwar new music in Europe which emerged in the period chronologically parallel to Kagel’s Argentinian era. The next stage deals with Kagel’s engagement in electroacoustic composition in Germany and the development of his own compositional method and style in its realm, where he consciously distanced himself from controversy between Parisian musique concrète and Cologne elektronische Musik. Because Antithese is a unique form of Instrumental Theater – a compositional approach Kagel invented – and a piece he dedicated to John Cage, this study examines distinctive features of Kagel’s theatricalization in the piece in contrast to his other theatrical pieces, as well as to Cage’s musical theater work. This examination clarifies the aesthetic distinction between Kagel and Cage which underlies their theatrical-theoretical differences. Intriguing in terms of compositional aesthetic content is that Antithese encompasses Kagel’s serial thought and an approach of Grenzüberschreitung of art genres which may seem antithetical in compositional-characteristic terms. This feature suggests that a latent part of his aesthetic intention was to create tension as a concealed component derived from the coexistence of heterogeneous ideas and elements on various levels of Antithese’s complex structure. Indeed, tension, as an indispensable element of the piece, is a key to deciphering Kagel’s notion of anarchy in music...|$|E
