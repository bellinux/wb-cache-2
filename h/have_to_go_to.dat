The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> an airline representative at the counters.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, {{he would have to}} write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E

They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> separate women's temples. As with practices of niddah in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the menstrual cycle lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Dot holds a {{birthday}} party for Dotty, inviting Tiffany (Maisie Smith) and Liam Butcher (James Forde), {{but they do not}} want to attend. The next day, Tiffany tells Dotty she is not invited to her birthday party. Dotty tells Dot that Tiffany is not having a party and asks if they can invite her round. When they ask Tiffany's mother Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Bianca invites them to Tiffany's party. The next day, Tiffany and Dotty lie so they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school. Dotty takes Tiffany's bridesmaid's dress and MP3 player, after Tiffany does not allow her to try the dress on, and runs away with them, throwing the MP3 player into a bin. Dotty pushes Tiffany into the bin as she tries to retrieve it. Dotty then runs away to avoid getting in trouble, and when Tiffany is found, Bianca visits Dot, who is unsure about Bianca's claims. Dotty tells Dot she knows nothing about the dress but Dot then finds it in Dotty's school bag. Dot returns the dress to Bianca without Dotty's knowledge. The next day, Dotty is left alone with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) who is recovering from a stroke. She pours water on him to make it seem he has wet himself, but Dot catches her. Dotty says she hates them both and wishes that Nick had killed Dot. Dot smacks Dotty across the legs and Dotty manipulates her into letting her stay off school. After Dotty calls the police, Dot is arrested for assault but is released without charge and Dotty apologises.|$|E

Achilles' mother disguised him as a woman so that he would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war, but, according to one story, they blew a horn, and Achilles revealed himself by seizing a spear to fight intruders, rather than fleeing. According to another story, they disguised themselves as merchants bearing trinkets and weaponry, and Achilles was marked out from the other women for admiring weaponry instead of clothes and jewelry.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of Dreamscape players are given a diary, in {{which most of the}} pages are empty except for titles at the top of each page.

As the story processes the pages of the diary slowly fill up, giving extra information about the locations found in the game. It also provides back story to not only the main character, Wilson, but to the other characters as well. The diary also contains a map, which is designed to help players navigate the thirty acre world.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Tafari was {{diagnosed}} with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical treatment under the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> court to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.|$|E

25|$|The {{new school}} had {{challenged}} the medical establishment. Jordan's {{aim was to}} reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> London {{if they wanted to}} obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the Society of Apothecaries. As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.|$|E
25|$|In 1763 Steuben {{had been}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} future French Minister of War, Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain in Hamburg. They met again in Paris in 1777. The Count, fully realizing the potential of an officer with Prussian general staff training, introduced him to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin, however, was unable to offer Steuben a rank or pay in the American army. The Continental Congress had grown tired of foreign mercenaries coming to America and demanding a high rank and pay. Promoting these men over qualified American officers caused discontent in the ranks. Von Steuben would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> America strictly as a volunteer, and present himself to Congress. Steuben left these first meetings in disgust and returned to Prussia. Steuben found waiting for him allegations that he engaged in homosexual relationships with young men while {{in the service of}} Prince Josef Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. The allegations were never proven, but Steuben knew they would stymie his chances at an officer's position in Europe. Threatened with prosecution for his alleged homosexuality, Steuben returned to Paris. Rumors followed him from Prussia to America that he was homosexual, but there never was an investigation of von Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war.|$|E
25|$|Water boards (waterschap and hoogheemraadschap, pl. waterschappen and hoogheemraadschappen) {{are among}} the oldest {{government}} authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form {{the foundation of the}} whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what {{led to the creation of}} water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (college van dijkgraaf en heemraden) consisting of a chairperson (dijkgraaf) and other members ((hoog)heemraad, pl. (hoog)heemraden). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, voters do not usually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a polling station but can vote by mail.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, the {{bankrupt}} Volare Group (Volareweb, Air Europe) {{was put up}} for sale. Alitalia bid to buy the group (other bidders were Air One and Meridiana/Eurofly). Air One went to court claiming that Alitalia could not buy Volare Group as it had received state aid in the past. The TAR (Regional Administrative Tribunal) of Lazio tried to block Alitalia's acquisition of Volare Group but abandoned the attempt, claiming that Alitalia had repaid its €400 million loan and {{so there would be}} nothing stopping it from buying Volare Group. Air One also went to court, unsuccessfully. Alitalia created Volare SpA to buy the Volare Group. The airlines were becoming closer and Volare Group had started providing soft maintenance services for some Alitalia aircraft in Milan Malpensa airport. However, the Italian Consiglio di Stato (State Council) on 23 May 2006 has once again blocked the acquisition of the airline. It is not clear {{what is going to happen}} as Volare is in serious financial difficulties. On 2 November 2006 TAR court decided that the administrative procedure used by the Italian government to sell Volare to Alitalia was invalid but the selling contract is still valid because the administrative court was declared incompetent about this topic. If Air One wants to obtain Volare it will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the local civil court and ask it to declare that the selling contract is invalid. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 2009, Rodríguez {{confirmed}} {{that he had}} signed a three-year contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), stating {{that he would not}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, but directly to the main roster. Furthermore, he would retain the rights to his name, mask and image, but allow the WWE to use it for promotional purposes while he is under contract with them. He agreed to the contract since it addressed the main reasons why he turned down the WWE's offer in January 2009. Despite his claims, he had a match with Kris Logan at FCW under the name Dos. He later also went on to wrestle under the ring names Dorado and El Dorado. During a segment on the Abraham Washington show at the August 6 taping, Rodríguez revealed a new, unmasked wrestling character named Alberto Banderas. When he revealed his face, he was criticized by some Mexicans for revealing, to which he responded that only a few people know why he lost the mask in that way. During WWE's WrestleMania Revenge tour of Europe in April 2010, he made numerous appearances in untelevised matches for the Raw brand. One night he wrestled as Dos Caras, but he did not wear his mask. He was presented as a villain in a losing effort against Christian. The following month Caras put his mask back on for WWE's tour of Mexico and worked as a hometown hero, prior to returning unmasked during untelevised matches for subsequent Raw and SmackDown shows. Later, Rodríguez said that he hated his time in FCW, but that he learned a lot.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start {{at the rear of}} the field due to unapproved body modifications, but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an {{untimely}} caution while Harvick was on pit road, because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. He never got back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick's third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to go. Next week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken trackbar and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the garage but he was already locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings, and would be in a must win situation to make the round of 8, but that was no problem for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth, until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick would get back the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami.|$|E
