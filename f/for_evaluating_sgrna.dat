40|$|AbstractIn the {{literature}} survey, {{there is evidence}} “why an interpretive paradigm is more suitable <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> e-government systems”. However, more than one method can be used when applying interpretive paradigm <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> information systems (as we do not consider e-government systems as exception) such as Action Research (AR) and Grounded Theory (GT). In this regard, two problems will arise: First, there is no explicit method that clarifies how AR and GT methods can be used <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> information systems. The second problem is to determine which method {{of them will be}} more appropriate <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> information systems. Accordingly, two frameworks <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> e-government systems have been proposed, namely ‘Grounded Evaluation Framework’ (GEF) and ‘Action Research Evaluation Framework’ (AREF), which are based on Grounded Theory (GT) and Action Research (AR) methods respectively, to give an example how GT and AR methods can be used in evaluating information systems. The suggested GEF and AREF have been applied to the “University Enrolment Service” in Egyptian e-government, and the findings have been analyzed to conclude that GEF is more appropriate <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> e-government systems...|$|R

A method <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> the photolysis behavior of photoacid generator in solvent and high polymer film {{has been established}} through spectrophotometry and fluorospectrophotometry by using the acid-sensitive Rhodamine B as tracer. Results showed that this method is feasible and practicable <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> the {{acid generating}} efficiency of photoacid generator in organic solvents or polymer film, yielding quantitatively precise data of the photochemical reaction and acid generating behavior, thus is very useful <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> the quality {{of different types of}} photacid generators e. g. triazines, sulfonium salts etc...|$|R
