50|$|Far {{from being}} an attempt at humour or funk, Scanga's choice of the white (sometimes called Irish) potato {{is in fact a}} perfect {{conflation}} of symbols for the peasant life he <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke.</b> The dusty tubers, extracted from the ground, retain much of their earthy character. Beneath their dry brown exterior is a moist, crisp flesh—a humble organic metaphor for the meager existence of the rural working class.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Nintendo and Hypnotic, a film {{entertainment}} company, {{established a}} filmmaking contest in which contestants submitted ideas {{that would be}} later funded into short films if selected. Hypnotic also purchased the rights to produce a film or TV series based on the IP. The contest looked for ideas that evoke {{the same kind of}} psychological horror that the game <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke,</b> but the films were not directly based on the Eternal Darkness characters or storyline.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to whether}} the four concertos were written to {{accompany}} four sonnets or vice versa. [...] Though it is not known who wrote these sonnets, there is a theory that Vivaldi wrote them himself, given that each sonnet is broken down into three sections, neatly corresponding to a movement in the concerto. Whoever wrote the sonnets, The Four Seasons may be classified as program music, instrumental music that <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> something extra-musical [...] and an art form which Vivaldi was determined to prove sophisticated enough to be taken seriously.|$|E
50|$|When {{television}} {{entered the}} home, {{it was seen}} as a massive hit to the cinema industry and many saw it as the decline in cinema popularity. This in turn resulted in films having to stay ahead of television by incorporating superior quality than that of a television. This was done by adding color but importantly it implemented the use of widescreen. This would allow a massive increase amount of space useable by the director, thus allowing an even wider shot for the viewer to witness more of whatever the director <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> with any given shot.|$|E
5000|$|... "Song for the Lonely" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

[...] " [...] Rolling Stone also agreed by writing that it [...] "clearly <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> September 11th." [...] Slant Magazine noted that it [...] "wisely abandons such (otherwise welcomed) electronic shenanigans for a pure and impassioned performance." ...|$|E

50|$|In Between. Many tools {{require more}} user {{intervention}} than program analyses, {{in that they}} expect the user to input assertions such as pre/post specs for functions or loop invariants, but after this input is given they attempt to be fully or almost fully automatic; this mode of verification goes back to classic works in the 1970s such as J King's verifier, and the Stanford Pascal Verifier. This style of verifier has recently been called auto active verification, a term which <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> the way of interacting with a verifier via an assert-check loop, analogous to the interaction between a programmer and a type-checker.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{transfer}} from divine to heroic to human ages is, for Vico, marked by {{shifts in the}} tropological nature of language, the inventional aspect of the poetic principle remains constant. When referring to “poets”, Vico <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> the original Greek sense of “creators”. In the Scienza Nuova, then, the verum factum principle first put forth in De Italorum Sapientia remains central. As such, the notion of topics as the loci or places of invention (put forth by Aristotle and developed throughout classical rhetoric) serves {{as the foundation for}} [...] "the true", and thus, as the underlying principle of sensus communis and civic discourse. The development of laws that shape the social and political character of each age is informed as much by master tropes as by those topics deemed acceptable in each era. Thus, for the rudimentary civilization of the divine age, sensory topics are employed to develop laws applicable on an individual basis. These laws expand as metonymy and synecdoche enable notions of sovereign rule in the heroic age; accordingly, acceptable topics expand to include notions of class and division. In the final, human age, the reflection that enables popular democracy requires appeals to any and all topics to achieve a common, rational law that is universally applicable. The development of civilization in Vico’s storia ideale eterna, then, is rooted in the first canon of rhetoric, as invention via loci shapes both the creation of and discourse about civil life.|$|E
50|$|Boss Tau Zanto (1-51): The {{leader of}} the Jakanja is a centipede-like demon with various faces on his {{segments}} who learned of the Evil Force 500 years ago and <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> it to destroy the universe and become a god of the new universe that would be created as a result. From the very start he attempted {{to bring about the}} Evil Force's coming by having the Gouraigers kill each other and Fangerus. Though both attempts failed Tau Zanto found an alternate means after probing Manmaruba's mind to learn of the Raging Arrow and the Grieving Bow. Once he ingested both weapons Tau Zanto used Satarakura to gather enough energy to assume a suitable form, the gigantic Tau Zanto Ultimate Form (50-51). Though he was able to open the wormhole Sandaaru wounded Tau Zanto forcing him to make his way in and become one with the Evil Force. As it began to destroy everything the Hurricanegers managed to reverse the process. Tau Zanto, with the Evil Force inside him, emerged and fought Senpuujin. Tau Zanto, mortally wounded, grabbed Senpuujin as he exploded but Tau Zanto assumes the forms of all seven Lancers until the two Ranger teams defeated them. Tau Zanto proceeded to overpower the Rangers without mercy but their refusal to give up enabled them to destroy Tau Zanto with the Victory Gadget. However, though it returned to the ocean depths upon his death, the Evil Force evolved into the Great Force that resurfaced a decade later.|$|E

5000|$|Metronome is an {{investigation}} into the nature of time. The work references the multiple measures of time that simultaneously inform and confound our consciousness of the moment. The composite work <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> contemplation on the dynamic flux of the city. The elements suggest the instant and infinity, astronomical sequence, geological epoch and ephemerality. Metronome is meant to be integral to the very history, architectural fabric, spirit and vitality of the city.The elements that compose Metronome refer to and are {{very much a part of}} the place where the work exists: Union Square in the City of New York.The central element is a brick wall built in concentric circles, creating a wave pattern like ripples on still water after a stone is cast into it, making the wall seem to undulate. Gold leaf accentuates the center of the work, a dark aperture that emanates a constant halo of steam. At noon and midnight the hole erupts with a huge plume of steam that is accompanied by an explosion of sound composed to mark the exact instant and its passage, like a noonday whistle or a public clock that marks the time.Counterpoised below on the wall is a massive piece of bedrock, displaying the millennia of geological history. A long thin bronze cone is poised at a diagonal on the rippling brick façade: a time indicator that suggests perspective.A large bronze hand poised high on the wall is an accurate enlargement taken from the historical statue of George Washington in Union Square Park directly below. Left of the vertical brick center, on the glass façade of the building is a horizontal clock with pairs of digits that accurately display the hours, minutes and seconds that have passed since midnight, as well as the time remaining in a 24-hour period. Like an hourglass that contains a specific measure of sand, the digital time piece counts up on the left and down on the right, measuring both the sum and the balance of the day. The center three digits are a frenzy of intangible fractions of seconds, which reveal the pace of life in the city.On the right metallic façade is a sphere, half black and half gold, which turns daily in synchrony with the phases of the moon. When the moon reaches fullness, the entire golden face of the orb is revealed.Metronome contemplates time: geological, solar, lunar, daily, hourly, and momentarily, revealing the fractions of seconds in the life of a city - and of a human being....New York City pulses with enormous energy. There is an ever-present sense that an underlying source makes the city a hot spot, active with desire, intellect, pathos. Certain places on earth are geothermally active; Manhattan's streets release vaporous plumes from a plethora of fumaroles. The ephemerality of this steam in the streets suggests the volatility of the place. Metronome poses as a vent for this energy - an oracular center for the public to gauge their momentary presence, their mortality, from which the city can be examined as a vital infrastructure.Viewers are confronted and reassured, confused, enlightened and asked to question the moment of their existence in relation to their natural and built environment.Ultimately, the work is an ode to mortality and the impossibility of knowing time.|$|E
40|$|This thesis articulates {{the design}} of a Natatorium through both the use of {{computational}} methods of visualization and through traditional methods of representing architectural space and form. Computer visualization is used exploratory method for relationships of light, structure of a roof, to experience. The design as a primary understanding the movement and the defining a spatial for the facility serves as an exploration o f spacial experience analogous to nature; and it <b>intends</b> <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> the visual sensation of being underwater on a bright sunny day. Within the context of a Natatorium, this thesis explores the relationships of: branched construction to light and shadow; water to an undulating roof form; and swimming and diving to movement.
