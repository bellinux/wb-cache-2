5|$|An American dancer, Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) {{comes to}} London {{to star in}} a show {{produced}} by the bumbling Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton). While practicing a tap dance routine in his hotel bedroom, he awakens Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) on the <b>floor</b> <b>below.</b> She storms upstairs to complain, whereupon Jerry falls hopelessly {{in love with her}} and proceeds to pursue her all over London.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{was plagued}} by {{structural}} problems and leaks throughout its history. It underwent a partial structural failure on June 23, 2012, when a 12m x 24m (39'-by-79') segment of the rooftop parking deck collapsed into the building, crashing through the upper level lottery kiosk adjacent to the food court and escalators to the ground <b>floor</b> <b>below.</b> More than 20 people received non-life-threatening injuries and two {{people died in the}} collapse. An investigation and class action lawsuits into the collapse are ongoing and the mall has been demolished.|$|E

25|$|The {{windows of}} the top floor are far shorter {{than those of the}} <b>floors</b> <b>below</b> and the rhythm of the {{fenestration}} is faster, being two windows to each of those on the <b>floors</b> <b>below.</b> Originally the central recess on this floor formed an open loggia, this would have continued the Venetian palazzo theme of the balcony above a massive portal below; this loggia has now been closed and glazed to match the flanking windows.|$|R

5|$|The {{second floor}} of the monastery on the west called the Zelre Lhakhang {{provided}} an overview of the main Hayagriva image in the <b>floor</b> <b>below,</b> and also a small image of Nine-headed Hayagriva along with images of Padmasambhava, the 5th Dalai Lama and the protector deities. One floor above this was the Namgyel Lhakhang and the last floor above this was the living quarters of the Dalai Lamas and teachers of Sera Je.|$|E
5|$|Michael sneaks {{back into}} the office, {{crawling}} on the <b>floor</b> <b>below</b> the desks so Charles, who {{is sitting in the}} conference room, will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E
5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of the}} ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean <b>floor</b> <b>below.</b> This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone <b>floor</b> <b>below,</b> fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} has a {{matching}} , with windows of equal value {{to those on}} the first <b>floor</b> <b>below.</b> The very latest innovation, sash windows, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and attic storey used the more old-fashioned mullioned and transomed windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt {{in the design of}} Coleshill House in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day Roger North lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), {{as one of the most}} important inventions of his day.|$|E
5|$|Town Hall (set number 10224) was {{released}} in March 2012 and is the seventh set in the Modular Building line. The set contains 2766 pieces and is recommended for builders 14 and over. It was the largest modular set, taking the title from the Green Grocer. It contains many interior details, such as a working elevator, along with board tables and balconies {{to look to the}} <b>floor</b> <b>below.</b> Along with the interior details the set also has many exterior details, such as four pillars on the front step and windows {{at the back of the}} building, and also a clock tower at the top of the building. The date on the building, 1891 represents the birth year of the founder of LEGO and when reversed, it's the birth year of the designer, Astrid (1981). The set was priced at £149.99, $199.99 or €179.99 as released by LEGO on February 16, 2012. There are eight minifigures in the set with a wedding couple. The set had a global discontinuation date of 31 December 2014 and had a much shorter lifespan than its predecessors.|$|E

5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first <b>floor</b> <b>below</b> and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the <b>floor</b> <b>below.</b> The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit <b>floor</b> <b>below</b> the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Energy Tower {{was planned}} {{to stand at}} 870 feet tall with 59 <b>floors</b> (6 <b>floors</b> <b>below</b> ground). Had it been built, the {{building}} {{would have been the}} sixth-tallest building in Texas.|$|R

25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the Fit and the Insight platform is the position of the fuel tank. While the Fit locates the fuel tank under the front seats, the Insight positions the fuel tank under the rear seats. This allows the Insight’s hybrid battery pack to be located in the cargo <b>floor</b> <b>below</b> the spare tire, to accommodate folding rear seats, lower roofline, and a more aerodynamic body shape.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other 18th-century {{houses of}} Gunston Hall's stature, {{the layout of}} the second floor is entirely {{dissimilar}} to the <b>floor</b> <b>below.</b> A narrow passage runs sideways through the upper level, leading to seven bedchambers and a storage room. At the top of the main stairway is a tri-part arch with fluted pillars, separating the passageway from a small gallery overlooking the staircase.
