50|$|Delbo greatly {{influenced}} {{the work of}} Cynthia Haft who is originally from Brooklyn, New York, but currently lives in Jerusalem. Haft met Delbo in New York while Haft was in her teens and their <b>friendship,</b> <b>first</b> one of mentor and student, grew and lasted throughout Delbo's life. In addition to translating some of Delbo's works, Haft introduced Lamont to Delbo while Haft was writing her Ph.D. dissertation at the City University of New York and Lamont was one of Haft's readers. Delbo's work has been very influential already {{for a number of}} other scholars in addition to Haft and Lamot, such as Lawrence L.

Second, we incorporated information about geographic locations that users visited into three selected community detection al-gorithms (Clique Percolation Method, Inference Algorithm, and GANXiS) to detect friendship communities where members are on average separated by one friendship link and also likely to be close to each other geographically. Third, we proposed a tech-nique to generate covers of fixed sizes by using a combination of social and geographic information for the purpose of comparing them to communities detected by the selected algorithms. Finally, we used community quality measurements based on friendship link connectivity and geographic locations visited by users to examine detected communities. I...|$|E

30|$|Following {{previous}} studies (see for instance Huxthold et al. 2013), other explanatory variables {{were included in}} the model to allow for consideration of the net association between life satisfaction and the two aspects of <b>friendship.</b> <b>First,</b> variables measuring potential social relations {{were included in the}} model. Results were controlled for the social integration and active lifestyle. Social integration was inserted into the models because of its importance for subjective well-being (as discussed in the “Social relations, friendship, and life satisfaction” section) and was measured considering the participation in meetings organized by political parties, trade union organizations, or by other (e.g., voluntary or cultural) associations in the year prior to the interview. Individuals who participated in {{at least one of these}} activities were distinguished from those with no participation. An active lifestyle was considered for its benefits on physical and psychological health (see, for example, Hassmén et al. 2000). It was measured using a covariate that described physical activities and distinguished individuals as follows: playing sports regularly, those engaged in physical activity at least once a week, and those who were physically active less often or who were sedentary. Attendance at religious services was also included in the model, both for the social networks that people find in religious organization and for the private and subjective aspects of religion (Lim and Putnam 2010). This control variable is defined by three categories of attendance: at least once a week, sometimes in a month or in a year, and never.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} Asian American adolescents' cross-ethnic friendship choices and their intergroup attitudes {{with a sample}} of 762 sixth grade Asian students in 19 middle schools varying in ethnic composition. Multiple measures of friendship (quantity and quality) and intergroup attitudes (affective, behavioral, and cognitive attitudes) were included. The results showed that Asian American students had distinctive relations with peers from different ethnic groups. They had a strong in-group preference when choosing friends, and when {{there was a lack of}} own-group peers at school, they over-selected White students as friends. However, they never over-selected other ethnic minority peers as their friends when school availability was accounted for. Similarity in academic achievement was important for Asian students to form friendships with Latinos and Blacks. Asian students also reported worse attitudes toward Latinos and Blacks than their attitudes toward Whites. Significant within-group differences in cross-ethnic peer relations were also found: South Asian students nominated more cross-ethnic friends than East and Southeast Asians, and South Asian students also reported better intergroup attitudes than students from other regions of Asia. Cross-ethnic friendships were related to better intergroup attitudes, especially the behavioral dimension of attitudes. A doing-feeling-thinking mediation model suggested that a cross-ethnic <b>friendship</b> <b>first</b> promotes behavioral closeness toward the whole out-group, and behavioral closeness leads to more positive feelings, which in turn generates better cognitive evaluations of the out-group. Implications for future research, educational practice, and attitude intervention programs were discussed...|$|E

40|$|It {{is a great}} {{pleasure}} to thank the many people who have contributed to the completion of this thesis, through their knowledge, guidance, support and <b>friendship.</b> <b>First</b> of all, I would like to thank my thesis supervisor, Jiro Kodaira, for many discussions, his assistances and enlightening comments on my works over years. My understanding of physics have been improved by his enthusiasm and practical viewpoints. Moreover he gave me many chances to meet impressive physicists and opportunities to discuss with them. First, thanks to his supports, I could take part in the 24 th SLAC Summer Institute (SSI) on Particle Physics, August 19 - 30, 1996, where I studied new aspects of physics and felt the passion of many physicists. After SSI, I had a nice meet with Stephen Parke and got a chance to collaborate with him. Second, the International Symposium on “QCD Corrections and New Physics”, he held at Hiroshima in 1997, led me to deep understanding of physics which became a base of this thesis. Again I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Jiro Kodaira. Stephen Parke constantly stimulated my interest, not only in top quark physics, but in many other branches of physics, and kindly provided me with modern calculations of the polarized t¯t cross-sections. His supports are greatly acknowledged from my heart. I wish to express my gratitude to Haruo Ui, Taizo Muta and Michihiro Hirata for many valuable instructions. Their supports encouraged me and made me possible to complete this thesis. I also benefited from discussions with Tetsuya Onogi, Takuya Morozumi, Yuichiro Kiyo and Michihiro Hori. Tetsuya Onogi and Takuya Morozumi helped me understand the implications of top quark physics. And I would like to thank Yuichiro Kiyo and Michihiro Hori for their friendship and the countless discussions till far into the night. They were good collaborators for me to get a new understanding of physics. I also thank Hideko Masuda and Mami Kohno for their assistances. Without their help, I probably would not spend a good time in Hiroshima University. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Tsuneo Uemats...|$|E
