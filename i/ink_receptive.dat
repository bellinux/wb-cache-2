50|$|Most lithographic plates {{function}} on {{the principle}} of water and <b>ink</b> <b>receptive</b> areas. In order for ink to adhere only to the image areas on the plate, a layer of moisture must be placed over the nonimage areas. The dampening system accomplishes this by moistening the plate consistently throughout the press run.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{additions}} {{can be made}} to the waterless plate by scratching or scribing the silicone {{surface to}} expose the <b>ink</b> <b>receptive</b> layers beneath. Deletions are made with the application of a liquid silicone solution which is used to replace silicone in any area where it has been removed (either by photo-imaging or by scribing).|$|E
50|$|After exposure, {{the plate}} {{is ready for}} processing. Processing {{equipment}} for the waterless plate is unique to this system, using specialized chemical and mechanical treatment of the plate. The finished plate now has a non-image area composed of ink repellent silicone. In the image area, the silicone has been removed to expose the <b>ink</b> <b>receptive</b> photopolymer material. This design allows the plate to selectively attract and resist ink {{without the use of}} any water, etches or alcohol.|$|E
40|$|Non-impact {{printing}} {{is gaining}} wider acceptance in the printing world, {{with one of}} the rapid growing applications being fine art color printing technology. With the right amount of artist’s imagination and combination of the right substrate and ink, it is possible to create a piece of art work that will last for a long time. This study includes a comprehensive look into ink/substrate combinations. The choice of proper substrate and coating, ink jet inks, together with some form of protection for ink jet printouts, is discussed here. Substrates with special <b>ink</b> jet <b>receptive</b> layers, with and without optical brightening agents (OBAs), were chosen for this work. The correlation between substrate’s characteristics and final print performance was established. Ink stability of prints with time was observed and lightfastness tests were performed in order to evaluate the stability of printed color patches on specific substrates. A special UV coating was applied to study its protection level. Results of accelerated lightfastness tests for the different substrates are interpreted in terms of change of color gamut volumes and ∆E...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous {{calcined}} Mg–Al layered double hydroxides {{with different}} Mg/Al molar ratios were investigated {{for their ability}} to adsorb the commercial dye, C. I. Acid Blue 9, with a view to exploring their suitability as inorganic pigments in <b>Ink</b> <b>Receptive</b> Layer formulation. Uptake capacity was characterized using the Langmuir model and the resulting L- 2 /H- 2 type plots indicated that the acid dye anions were adsorbed onto the surface by strong interactions. Optimum dye adsorption was achieved for a Mg/Al molar ratio ≈ 5. 6. A surface adsorption mechanism is proposed to account for the adsorption of the dye onto the calcined Mg–Al layered double hydroxides. X-ray powder diffraction analysis indicated that given sufficient time it is possible to intercalate the dye within the layered double hydroxides' interlayer via a reconstruction mechanism. Scanning electron microscopy, N 2 adsorption–desorption analysis and helium pycnometry were employed to examine the textural properties of the materials, which were correlated with their adsorption properties...|$|E
40|$|There have {{in recent}} years been {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} print achieved using large format inkjet printers with stable pigmented ink sets on fine art inkjet papers coated with an <b>ink</b> <b>receptive</b> layer. Increasingly professional photographers, graphic artists, printmakers and artists from all disciplines are using inkjet technology to produce prints. Existing uncoated fine art papers can also offer a rich variety of substrates for inkjet printing. An identified problem is the colour variation between prints produced on coated and uncoated papers. This however can be remedied through correct linearisation and profiling. Colour management using ICC profiles is a very useful method {{to improve the quality of}} digital inkjet printing. The Centre for Fine Print Research, UWE and John Purcell Paper have undertaken research into digital printing on coated and fine art papers. The aim of the research was to develop a series of standard and bespoke ICC profile for a range of specialist coated and uncoated fine art papers, inks and printers. This paper focused on methods for the creation of profiles and an evaluation of both coated and uncoated fine art paper. A number of fine art papers with various weights and surfaces including 42 gsm Japanese paper, 300 gsm Somerset, 100...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research into}} three different but interrelated technologies that can add value to commodity printing substrates by {{taking advantage of}} developments in synthetic chemistry, materials science and plasma physics. These investigations have been conducted in a Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) in Australia, called CRC Smartprint. Research into <b>ink</b> <b>receptive</b> coatings based on pigments possessing a positive surface charge has led to coatings that display improved resolution and colour saturation compared with silica based formulations. Although silica exhibits a high level of liquid absorption, it has relatively poor affinity for dye molecules contained in ink-jet ink. The second development involves the use of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition at atmospheric pressure to change surface functionality with particular emphasis on absorptive and printing properties. Thirdly, the development of a prototype labelling system based on the application of electrochromic conductive polymer to a flexible substrate that responds to electrical stimuli is discussed. Taken together, these three developments illustrate how both impact and non-impact printing technologies can be judiciously used to apply not only improved visual imagery to paper and paperboard, but also have the potential to enable printing of micro-electronic circuitry directly onto packaging materials, or onto labels that will enable a wide range of improved tracking, security and marketing functions to be incorporated cost-effectively into packaged goods in future...|$|E
