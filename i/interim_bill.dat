5000|$|However, {{while the}} <b>interim</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights {{did not apply}} {{directly}} to horizontal cases, it did have indirect application. The Bill of Rights applied to “all law in force,” including all pre- and post-1994 legislation and the uncodified common law (provisions of the common law which had not been incorporated into legislation). Even if individuals were not directly bound by the Bill of Rights, the courts had to interpret legislation, and develop the common law, so that the ordinary law recognised and protected the rights in the Bill of Rights. In Du Plessis v Klerk, the Constitutional Court held that the Bill of Rights in the Interim Constitution “may and should have an influence {{on the development of}} the common law as it governs relations between individuals.” This was provided for in section 35(3) of the interim Constitution: “In the interpretation of any law and the application and development of the common law and customary law, a court shall have due regard to the spirit, purport and objects of” the Bill of Rights. “In private litigation,” held the court, “any litigant may nonetheless contend that a statute (or executive act) relied on by the other party is invalid as being inconsistent with the limitations placed on legislature and executive under Chapter 3.” Accordingly, “as Chapter 3 applies to common law, governmental acts or omissions in reliance on the common law may be attacked by a private litigant as being inconsistent with Chapter 3 in any dispute with an organ of government.” ...|$|E

40|$|Construction Cost Management {{encompasses}} and embraces estimating, scheduling, cost control, resource costing, and <b>interim</b> <b>billing,</b> {{which are}} highly interconnected to each other, and share data. Also produces very large quantity of information thus necessitates an {{integrated information system}} for effective management. Additionally, data related to progress control exhibits imprecision, vagueness and subjectivity, that demands some sophisticated approach to be introduced in the system for predictions and corrective acting in progress control. Advanced systems using current state-of-the-art could be developed to address the problems. But, construction organizations cannot afford to procure such system due to high cost involvement, therefore expects a cost effective solution. Through an extensive literature review Schedule activity as the denominator, relational DBMS, and Fuzzy logic were identified as suitable method and tools for data integration and vagueness handling. MS AccessTM', MS projectTM, and MATLABTMalso identified as cost effective software for physical design. Then, an integrated Decision Support System (DSS) complementing a common database, a scheduler, and a knowledge base was supposed to solve the problem. Interviews, documentary surveys, and questionnaire surveys were adopted as research techniques. By analyzing the survey data and information, terms and references of the proposed DSS, system architecture, process models, data models and logical models of common database, knowledge representation model for knowledgebase, and dynamic data exchange model for data transfer and conversation were designed. Then MS AccessTM, MS projectTM, and MATLABTM were used to develop the proposed DSS. Finally the developed system was tested for its feasibility in terms of technique and function, and accuracy. Data transfer between database, scheduler, and knowledgebase was very successful. The output produced by the DBMS, and Scheduler had an accuracy of 100 % while Knowledge Based System (KBS) had 80 %. It is proved that general software like-MS AccessTM and MS projectTM have potential for advanced integrated system development with higher technical, functional, and cost feasibilities using relational database concept. They can also be integrated with KBS for heuristic decision making. Key Words: Cost Management,Integration, Relational DBMS, Fuzzy Logic, Information Syste...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the death}} of Vince Lombardi 17 days {{prior to the start}} of the 1970 season, Washington {{finished}} 6-8 under <b>interim</b> coach <b>Bill</b> Austin. Shortly after the conclusion of the 1970 season, the Redskins hired George Allen as their head coach, hoping he could turn the team's fortunes around. Allen's philosophy was that veteran players win games, so immediately after taking over the team, he traded away most of the younger team members and draft choices for older, more established players. His motto was [...] "The future is now." [...] Washington quickly became the oldest team in the NFL and earned the nickname [...] "The Over the Hill Gang." [...] The average age of starters was 31 years old.
