In a separate statement, he commented, “Everything <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> accomplish in 2005, I think I have accomplished. The World Series of Poker is bigger than ever before. The brand is in a strong position and the player experience is better than it's ever been.” Pollock did not elaborate on any subsequent career opportunities, but said, [...] "I'm {{going to take a}} moment to pause and reflect, then will think things through and make some decisions," ...|$|E
500|$|Aaron Wells Peirsol (born July 23, 1983) is an American former {{competition}} swimmer and backstroke {{specialist who}} is a former world champion and world record-holder. [...] He is a three-time Olympian and seven-time Olympic medalist (five gold, two silver). [...] As {{a member of the}} U.S. national team, he holds the world record in the men's 4×100-meter medley relay (long course). [...] Individually, he currently holds the world record in the 200-meter backstroke event (long course). [...] In February 2011, Peirsol announced his retirement, saying, [...] "I ended up doing everything <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Mosley {{announced}} that he would step down from his position in October of that year, one year early, saying [...] "I no longer find it either satisfying or interesting to sit in long meetings [...] I have achieved in this job everything <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> [...] ". One month later, he rescinded his decision after the FIA Senate called for him to stay on. [...] According to a BBC Sport profile, many insiders considered that the announcement, and Mosley's public disagreements with Ecclestone, were [...] "just part of a well crafted plan to strengthen their control over the sport"; Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, suggested that it arose because Mosley's proposals for Formula One met opposition. In 2004, Mosley said he felt Ferrari's then team principal Jean Todt should succeed him as president of the FIA when he stepped down.|$|E

500|$|If we {{stick to}} the Faust story – if I had been in that story – and I had sold my soul [...] for fame and fortune, and had the arrogance of [...] to not want {{to pay back the}} deal, it's taken a few years for me to {{acknowledge}} to myself that I was hearing: 'Manson , the hell hounds are on your trail.' And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E
500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do this I knew I wanted to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever! ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{his method}} of playwriting, Eliot explained, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> write a play, I start by {{an act of}} choice. I settle upon a {{particular}} emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{announcing his}} {{retirement}} from swimming on 10 February 2015, Cowdrey stated: [...] "I have been {{fortunate to have}} achieved more than I could ever have dreamed of, and more than <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> achieve, and more importantly I have enjoyed every minute of my time on the Australian swim team." [...] Glenn Tasker, President of the Australian Paralympic Committee said that: [...] "It has been an absolute privilege to watch Matthew develop from the quiet 15-year-old kid who competed at his first Paralympics in 2004, {{into one of the}} greats of Australian Paralympic sport. He has become an outstanding ambassador for the Paralympic movement, a leader of the Paralympic swim team and our most successful athlete ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marjorie Barnard's writing career spanned four decades, {{from the}} 1920s to the 1960s, with the {{majority}} of her works being written in the 1930s-1940s, a period in Australia noted for its flowering of women writers. Despite this, in an interview in 1986, she stated that {{there was no such thing}} as a [...] "woman writer", that [...] "there are writers good and bad. Only the work counts". In the same interview, she also said, [...] "I never achieved what <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do; I never achieved the goals I set myself for each book. I suppose the only exception to that would be The Persimmon Tree". She wrote little in the last twenty years of her life.|$|E
2500|$|There Buechner {{realized}} {{the challenge of}} writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: [...] "...the labor of writing which was so painful that I find it hard, even now, to see beyond {{the memory of the}} pain to whatever merit it may have." [...] However, in 1968, Buechner received a letter from Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write [...] "something in the area of [...] "religion and letters."" [...] Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life [...] "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> do was to try to describe a single representative day of my life in a way to suggest what there was of God to hear in it." [...] This process showed Buechner {{a way out of the}} frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.|$|E
