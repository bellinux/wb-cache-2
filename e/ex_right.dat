A 59 -year-old man who had bilateral renal tumors underwent radical left nephrectomy, <b>ex</b> vivo <b>right</b> partial nephrectomy and auto-transplantation at the right ileal fossa in our hospital 11 years ago. Histopathological examination showed clear cell renal cell carcinoma in bilateral kidneys (pT 1 bN 0 M 0). He had been followed at another hospital without tumor recurrence for 11 years. In 2014, an enhanced CT scan revealed a renal tumor with a diameter of two centimeters in the autografted kidney, which {{was thought to be}} a recurrence of the initial renal cancer. He was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. He underwent percutaneous renal tumor biopsy, which confirmed renal cancer recurrence, followed by percutaneous cryoablation. Three months after cryoablation, an enhanced CT showed that the enhancement lesion in the autografted kidney had disappeared, and these findings were confirmed pathologically by absence of malignancy by a subsequent needle biopsy. The level of serum creatinine (sCr) was 1. 16 md/dl immediately before cryoablation and 1. 46 mg/dl at three months after cryoablation.

40|$|Persistent {{cardiovascular}} pathology {{has been}} described in hyperthyroid patients even with effective antithyroid treatment. Here, we studied {{the effect of a}} well-known antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil (PTU; 20 [*]mg/kg/day), on thyroxine (T 4; 500 [*]µg/kg/day) -induced increase in blood pressure (BP), cardiac hypertrophy, and altered responses of the contractile myocardium both in vivo and ex vivo after 2 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, the potential recovery through 2 weeks of T 4 treatment discontinuation was also investigated. PTU and T 4 recovery partially reduced the T 4 -prompted increase in BP. Alternatively, PTU significantly improved the in vivo left ventricular (LV) function with no considerable effects on cardiac hypertrophy or <b>ex</b> vivo <b>right</b> ventricular (RV) contractile alterations subsequent to T 4 treatment. Conversely, T 4 recovery considerably enhanced the T 4 -provoked cardiac changes both in vivo and ex vivo. Altogether, our data is in agreement with the proposal that hyperthyroidism-induced cardiovascular pathology could persevere even with antithyroid treatments, such as PTU. However, this cannot be generalized and further investigation with different antithyroid treatments should be executed. Moreover, we reveal that recovery following experimental hyperthyroidism could potentially ameliorate cardiac function and decrease the risk for additional cardiac complications, yet, this appears to be model-dependent and should be cautiously construed...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} design and renegotiation of {{covenants}} in debt contracts as a specific example of the contractual assignment of property rights under asymmetric information. Specifically, we consider a setting where managers are better informed than lenders regarding potential transfers from debt to equity associated with future investments. This simple adverse-selection problem leads to the allocation of greater <b>ex</b> ante decision <b>rights</b> to the creditor (the uninformed party), i. e., tighter covenants, than would follow under symmetric information. This corresponds well to empirical evidence indicating that covenants are very tight upon inception and are frequently waived (and never tightened) upon renegotiation. The Author 2008.

40|$|This paper studies ex post {{individually}} rational, efficient partnership dissolution in {{a setting}} with interdependent valuations. We derive a sufficient condition that ensures {{the existence of an}} efficient dissolution mechanism that satisfies Bayesian incentive compatibility, ex post budget balancedness, and ex post individual rationality. For equal-share partnerships, we show that our sufficient condition is satisfied for any symmetric type distribution whenever the interdependence in valuations is non-positive. This result improves former existence results, demonstrating that the stronger requirement of ex post individual rationality does not always rule out efficiency. We also show that if we allow for two-stage revelation mechanisms, in which agents report their realized payoffs from the allocation, as well as imposing penalties off the equilibrium path, efficient dissolution is always possible even when the interdependence is positive. We further discuss the possibility of efficient dissolution with <b>ex</b> post quitting <b>rights...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an economic {{analysis of the}} relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) Law and Competition Law. Contrary to some of the recent debate, our analysis emphasises the separation of IP Law and Competition Law: IP law should concern itself with assigning and defending intellectual property rights, while Competition Law should concern itself with the use of those rights. This separation extends to the enforcement of the law as well, where we argue that once property rights have been assigned, no further distinction based on intellectual or nonintellectual property should be made. While the IP/Competition Law interface has some specificity due to the types of behaviours that tend to arise more frequently where IP is concerned, we argue for a set of principles for Competition Policy that include restraint, a commitment not to revisit <b>ex</b> post the <b>rights</b> granted by IP law, and a commitment to make large changes in property right regimes only when very large changes in ex post regulation occur. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an incomplete contracting model of bilateral trade in intellectual property (IP) with sequential investments in its quality and with financial constraints. A financially-constrained inventor invests in an idea which she then sells to a buyer. The buyer in turn invests in developing this idea into a marketable product. We propose a novel formulation of <b>ex</b> ante control <b>rights</b> of an IP buyer, over the financially-constrained IP seller. We do not assume alienability of the inventor’s ideas; the control right {{is defined as}} ex ante prescribed prohibition of ex interim financial contracting with third parties. We show that such an agreement strengthens the seller’s ex ante incentives {{to invest in the}} quality of her product which is to be traded at the interim stage. The enforcement of this control right is credible, or renegotiation-proof, only for the controlling buyer (a downstream user of the IP), and not for other potential partners of the seller, such as independent venture capitalists. We thereby obtain a rationale for a key role of Corporate Venturing in promoting innovative activities...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} determinants affecting the controlling shareholders choice between going public {{and looking for a}} venture capital partner when they are in need of external equity financiers. In the model the two choices are strictly connected as controlling shareholders profits under the going public choice represent their outside options in case of failure of reaching an agreement in the bargaining process with the venture capital partner. We show that the relative profitability of the going public choice is inversely related to monitoring costs of new stock exchange shareholders, investment size and directly related to the presence of informational asymmetries between manager and controlling shareholders. In addition, we find that for high values of their <b>ex</b> ante property <b>right</b> share, controlling shareholders prefer the venture capital to the going public financing solution even if the first is socially inefficient. The paper also shows how stock market volatility, competition in the real and financial sector and a more efficient market for corporate control affect the going-public-venture capital choice. Our results are consistent with empirical findings on firm revealed preferences between the two financing choices...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of centralising regulatory competencies in the European telecommunications sector. As we demonstrate, political economy suggests that an over- rather than an under-regulation of telecommunications markets has to be expected. This tendency has been strengthened by the allocation of competencies under the new regulatory framework which endows the European Commission with far reaching veto rights under the so-called article 7 procedure. In order to delimit the risk of over-regulation through institutional safeguards, it should be easier for regulators to deregulate than to regulate a market. Current suggestions and ambitions by the Commission to extend its veto right or to even establish a European regulator for telecommunications should be dismissed. Instead, we suggest limiting the Commission’s veto rights to (a) markets, in which regulation creates significant international externalities and (b) cases, where national regulators do not move into the direction of deregulation. If, however, a national regulator decides to deregulate a market, the Commission’s <b>ex</b> ante veto <b>right</b> should be abandoned (but ex post intervention by the Commission still be possible) in order not to hamper deregulation which tends to be the desired result, in principle...|$|R

Overall, all trainees achieved significant improvement in suturing time (p < 0. 005) as measured before and after completion of the training. Similar significantly improved suturing time differences (p < 0. 005) were noted among the groups of trainees with different laparoscopic experience. In conclusion a short well-guided training course, using the SUTT model, improves significantly surgeon’s laparoscopic suturing ability, independently of the level of experience in laparoscopic surgery...|$|R
50|$|Many {{publicly}} traded companies, and some privately held ones, provide a dividend feature to their stock. Stock shares trade fluidly on public markets, {{such that the}} state of share ownership differs {{at the end of each}} trading day, and any given share may have a series of various owners over time. When declaring a dividend, a company will designate a record date for the dividend. The practical rules of the financial system determine precisely one of the owners to receive the dividend payment, namely the owner of record who owned the share(s) at the end of the trading day on the record date. The company thus resolves payment to the share owner identified on the company's share register as of the record date. Since the process of settlement involves some days of delay, stock exchanges set an earlier date, known as the ex-dividend date (typically two business days prior to the record date) to synchronize the time for this processing. Thus the key date for a stock purchase is the ex-dividend date: a purchase on that date (or after) will be <b>ex</b> (outside, without <b>right</b> to) the dividend.|$|R
