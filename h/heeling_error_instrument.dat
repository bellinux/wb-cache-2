40|$|Background The {{basis for}} {{this study is the}} fact that <b>instrument</b> <b>error</b> {{increases}} the variance of the distribution of body mass index (BMI). Combined with a defined cut-off value this may impact upon the estimated proportion of overweight and obesity. It is important to ensure high quality surveillance data in order to follow trends of estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity. The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess the impact of <b>instrument</b> <b>error,</b> due to uncalibrated scales and stadiometers, on prevalence estimates of overweight and obesity. Methods Anthropometric measurements from a nationally representative sample were used; the Norwegian Child Growth study (NCG) of 3474 children. Each of the 127 participating schools received a reference weight and a reference length to determine the correction value. Correction value corresponds to <b>instrument</b> <b>error</b> and is the difference between the true value and the measured, uncorrected weight and height at local scales and stadiometers. Simulations were used to determine the expected implications of <b>instrument</b> <b>errors.</b> To systematically investigate this, the coefficient of variation (CV) of <b>instrument</b> <b>error</b> was used in the simulations and was increased successively. Results Simulations showed that the estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity increased systematically with the size of <b>instrument</b> <b>error</b> when the mean <b>instrument</b> <b>error</b> was zero. The estimated prevalence was 16. 4 % with no <b>instrument</b> <b>error</b> and was, on average, overestimated by 0. 5 percentage points based on observed variance of <b>instrument</b> <b>error</b> from the NCG-study. Further, the estimated prevalence was 16. 7 % with 1 % CV of <b>instrument</b> <b>error,</b> and increased to 17. 8 %, 19. 5 % and 21. 6 % with 2 %, 3 % and 4 % CV of <b>instrument</b> <b>error,</b> respectively. Conclusions Failure to calibrate measuring instruments is likely to lead to overestimation of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in population-based surveys...|$|R

This design {{is based on}} the S 3 C 2440 core board as the control core, and the software is based on Windows CE(WINCE) embedded operating system.

The main control system communicate with the <b>error</b> <b>instrument</b> and PC through Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, and the largest number of <b>error</b> <b>instruments</b> can connect to CAN bus is 100. The main control system communicates through RS 232 bus with three-phase signal source and standard electric energy meter, through RS 485 bus with programmable power amplifier. In this device, calibration of energy meters can not only through the PC software, but also use the main control system. Compared to the traditional design of the electric energy meter calibration device, the designâ€™s the man-machine interface is more optimized, the number of electric energy meters can be test in the same time is more, faster communication, stronger anti-interference ability, and calibration is more efficiency...|$|R

Such error sources include biases, scale factor <b>errors,</b> <b>instrument</b> position <b>errors,</b> misalignments, and <b>instrument</b> dynamics. Two techniques (ensemble analysis and simulated data analysis) are formulated to determine the quantitative variations to the identified parameters resulting from the unmodeled instrumentation errors. The parameter accuracy that would result from flight tests of the F- 4 C aircraft with typical quality instrumentation is determined using these techniques. It is shown that unmodeled <b>instrument</b> <b>errors</b> can greatly increase the uncertainty {{in the value of the}} identified parameters.

40|$|Measurement of {{electrical}} conductivity by {{time domain reflectometry}} (TDR) requires knowledge of the source step voltage, which is often implicitly accounted for in the measured reflection coefficient.

The accuracy of these measurements can be affected by various phenomena. Some of them are time-dependent (e. g., time-varying temperatures of components), while others are relatively static and repeatable (e. g., diffraction and polarization effects due to controlled translations and rotations of components). In this work we are concerned with the <b>instrument</b> <b>errors</b> of the latter type and in their compensation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Soil {{moisture}} in a crop's root zone must be regularly monitored to accurately predict crop water requirements. Most irrigation scheduling services currently use the neutron probe to monitor soil moisture. Unfortunately, {{there is a}} degree of variability associated with use of the neutron probe creating uncertainty in measurements of soil moisture. A {{review of the literature}} reveals there are three major types of error in estimates of average field moisture by the probe: <b>instrument</b> <b>error,</b> calibration error, and location <b>error.</b> <b>Instrument</b> <b>error</b> accounts for random neutron emission by the radioactive probe source. Calibration error is introduced by inaccuracies in the calibration curve. Location error is a result of estimating average soil moisture throughout a field using only point estimates. This study attempts to provide the neutron probe user with a quick and easy means to evaluate estimates of soil moisture by the probe and to identify sources of error. A computer program is developed that quickly and easily analyzes field calibration data to evaluate the error in neutron probe measurements. Field data from Colorado are analyzed as a numerical example of applying the mechanics of the computer model. Similar data from several California soils are analyzed using the model to show how the range of moisture content over which the probe is calibrated restricts accurate neutron probe measurements to the range of calibration data. The Colorado data are further analyzed to determine to what extent measurement errors occuring in the calibration process will contribute to calibration error in general. In most cases, neutron probe access tubes are placed at biased locations within a field and not randomly as is assumed in the model. A method is developed to correct estimates of average field moisture by taking this discrepancy into account. Given the variability of field moisture content, the number of access tubes that must be sampled to achieve a desired level of accuracy may be calculated using the definition of the student's "t" parameter and referring to specific confidence intervals...|$|R
