40|$|The reagent {{delivery}} mechanism in a point-of-care, HIV diagnostic, microfluidic device is studied. Reagents held in an aluminum pack are released {{on the opening}} of a fluidic seal. Fluidic seals, controlling the flow of reagents, are characterized to reduce anomalies in the desired flow pattern. The nature of the current seal was investigated. Four seal patterns - line hemisphere, line flat, chevron hemisphere and chevron flat were created and tested for reagent delivery using a flow sensor and a force gauge. Preliminary experiments suggested that one of the patterns - "line-flat" - resulted in fewer flow anomalies. A parameter scoping exercise involving sealing process parameters (temperature, time, gap and distance) was performed for the line flat seal. The findings of this research can be divided into three categories - 1) bonding phenomenon in current seals, 2) influence of seal pattern on flow and rupture mechanics and 3) process parameters which result in the least flow anomalies. The current seal is found to be a bond between the exposed aluminum on the lid film and the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> on the dome film. The two chevron patterns result in large amounts of flow anomalies, the line hemisphere pattern also resulted in some instances of flow anomalies. The line-flat pattern creates a seal with the least flow anomalies. A specific set of temperature, time, gap and distance which minimizes flow anomalies was found. The flow performance of the reservoir improved and delamination decreased as the distance of the seal from the reservoir was reduced. The thesis also develops a model to better understand the deformation of the reagent carrying dome and flow dynamics prior to and following the opening of the seal. The dome deformation model provides a framework for relating volume, delamination and flow rate to the geometry and material properties of the reservoir pack. by Tejas Satish Inamdar. Thesis (M.

40|$|The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) spends over $ 250 {{million per}} year to {{maintain}} almost 200, 000 miles of roadway with more than 450 million vehicle miles per day. <b>Seal</b> <b>coats</b> are {{very important for the}} Department’s preventive maintenance program. <b>Seal</b> <b>coats</b> {{are one of the most}} important elements of pavement maintenance because they slow down pavement deterioration.

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> materials and design method. The primary objectives of this research are 1) to evaluate <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance from various combinations of aggregates and emulsions in terms of aggregate loss; 2) to evaluate how the properties of aggregates and emulsions affect <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance; 3) to evaluate current <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design methods based on INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice; and 4) to develop <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design software incorporating Indiana practice. To evaluate the effects of aggregate and emulsion types on aggregate loss performance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat,</b> three emulsions and eight aggregates including CRS- 2 P, RS- 2 P, and AE- 90 S for emulsions and Trap Rock, Sandstone, Blast Furnace Slag, Steel Slag, Limestone, Dolomite, Crushed Gravel (one face), and Crushed Gravel (two faces) were tested utilizing the sweep test and Vialit test. In addition, to explore influential factors (i. e., electrical surface charge interaction, water evaporation change in emulsion, water affinity of aggregate, etc.), the Zeta potential, water content, and X-ray deflection (XRD) tests were also conducted. According to the Zeta potential test results, the electrical surface charge of an aggregate in emulsions varies {{with the type of}} emulsion (i. e., with the pH of the emulsifier). From the water content test, among the emulsions, CRS- 2 P was the earliest emulsion to have enough bond strength to retain aggregates in open traffic. In addition, aggregate can retard the water evaporation process of emulsions. Based on the XRD test results, Sandstone and Dolomite have the highest and smallest content of SiO 2, respectively among the eight aggregates. This means that Sandstone and Limestone have the highest and lowest water affinity (hydrophilic and hydrophobic), respectively. In the sweep test with Limestone with various curing time, CRS- 2 P showed superior aggregate loss performance among the emulsions. Comparing the sweep test results to the water contents of emulsions, faster water evaporation presented better aggregate loss performance. This finding indicates that the bond strength of emulsion to retain aggregate can be mainly a function of water evaporation in emulsion. Based on the sweep test at 77 ˚F after 24 hours of curing, CRS- 2 P performed the best regardless of aggregate type. The Vialit test at a temperature range of 35 °F to - 22 F° after 24 hours of curing shows the most aggregate loss at lower testing temperatures. AE- 90 S had the strongest resistance in losing aggregate among the three emulsions at lower temperatures, which is an opposite trend comparing to the sweep test results. Also, Crushed Gravel with two faces outperformed Crushed Gravbel with one face. According to statistical analysis results, it was concluded that AE- 90 S and Crushed Gravel with two faces showed the best performance among the emulsions and aggregates, respectively. In addition the best-performing aggregate-emulsion combinations were AE- 90 S with most of the aggregates, except for Steel Slag. Thus, the aggregate type in terms of mineral/chemical composition is not a major factor affecting the aggregate loss performance. To develop a <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design, <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance was evaluated for various emulsion (EAR) and aggregate application rates (AAR) by using three different evaluation methods: the IRI, friction, and visual inspection. Based on these performance tests, immediate failure occurring locally during construction due to incorrect application rate (e. g., insufficient aggregate rate) can cause total failure of the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> road resulting from a chain reaction. Employing a factor to compensate for AAR discrepancies between target and actual is critical for <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> survival during construction. This study confirms the irrelevance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> application to IRI values due to the thin coat and the limitation of the IRI measurement (e. g., 250 mm moving average). The friction test results show an adequate skid resistance performance on all <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> test sections. In addition, friction improvements due to <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> applications were confirmed within a range of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> rates applied in this study. Overall, IRI, friction, and visual inspection did not show distinct differences in <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance in terms of application rates. A methodology in selecting an equipment factor for correcting any difference between a target rate and a measured rate was developed considering reliability and a designed rate using the McLeod equation. Design software, “INDOT <b>SEAL</b> <b>COAT</b> DESIGN (iSeal) ”, was developed as part of the study to aid the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design process and incorporates INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice. The software was largely based on the McLeod design method which includes factors that the INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> specification lacks. Furthermore, an additional factor, an equipment factor, was implemented into the design process to resolve issues due to discrepancies between designed rate and applied rate...|$|R

Theory part introduces flexible paper-polymer films packages that are opened by peeling. Also the <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> process and the method to measure seal strength have been presented.

Correlation between seal strength and fibre amount index was found not to be straight forward.
