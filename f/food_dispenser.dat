40|$|Patients {{and health}} staff {{frequently}} {{need to stay}} in health care facilities {{for quite a long}} time. Therefore, it's necessary to create the conditions that allow the ingestion of food during those periods, namely through the existence of automatic <b>food</b> <b>dispensers.</b> However, the available food and beverages might not always be compatible with a healthy diet. The aim of this work was to evaluate if the food and beverages available in automatic <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> in public Ambulatory Care Facilities (ACF) and Hospitals of the Portugal North Health Region were contributing to a healthy diet, during the year of 2007. A questionnaire was elaborated and sent to the Coordinators of the Health Sub-Regions and to the Hospital Administrators. The questionnaire requested information about the existence of automatic <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> in the several departments of each health care facility, as well as which food and beverages were available and most sold. Afterwards, the pre-processing of the results involved the classification of the food and beverages in three categories: recommended, sometimes recommended and not recommended. The questionnaire reply ratio was 71 % in ACF and 83 % in Hospitals. Automatic <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> were available in all the Hospitals and 86. 5 % of ACF. It wasn't possible to acquire food in 37 % of the health facility departments. These departments were all located in ACF. The more frequently available beverages in departments with automatic <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> were coffee, still water, tea, juices and nectars and soft drinks. Still water, coffee, yogurt, juices and nectars and soft drinks were reported as the most sold. The more frequently avaliable food items were chocolate, recommended cookies, not recommended cakes, recommended sandwiches and sometimes recommended croissants. The food items reported as being the most sold were recommended sandwiches, chocolate, recommended cookies, sometimes recommended croissants and not recommended cookies. The beverages in the recommended and sometimes recommended groups were the most frequently available and sold. The not recommended food items were reported as being the most available, while both the recommended and not recommended food items were equally reported as being the most sold.

50|$|Animal {{training}} can take time. If doing the VCT using food, animals must {{be trained to}} be able to pull the lever for the <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> and accept the pellet. If using water, animals must be trained {{to be able to}} push the button and drink water. Because of this etiological tests which observe spontaneous fears are usually preferred by researchers. Lab personnel must be trained to avoid injury or disease to the animals.|$|E
50|$|In the {{assessment}} of animal welfare, displacement activities are sometimes used as evidence that an animal is highly motivated to perform a behaviour that the environment prevents. One example is that when hungry hens are trained to eat from a particular <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> and then ﬁnd the dispenser blocked, they often begin to pace and preen themselves vigorously. These actions have been interpreted as displacement activities, and similar pacing and preening {{can be used as}} evidence of frustration in other situations.|$|E

50|$|Ticket halls are {{typically}} found directly beneath the street. In {{the early years}} they contained {{little more than a}} kiosk for buying tickets, amid spartan decoration. From the 1930s, network maps appeared, including the popular plan indicateur lumineux d'itinéraires, a version with lights to indicate the fastest route to a given destination. From 1946 local street plans were installed, and later <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> and telephones. In the 1970s, shops appeared in certain stations where space permitted (for instance, Franklin D Roosevelt).|$|R
50|$|In cage culture, several {{different}} methods {{are used for}} feeding farmed fish - from simple hand feeding to sophisticated computer-controlled systems with automated <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> coupled with in situ uptake sensors that detect consumption rates. In coastal fish farms, overfeeding primarily leads to increased disposition of detritus on the seafloor (potentially smothering seafloor dwelling invertebrates and altering the physical environment), while in hatcheries and land-based farms, excess food goes to waste and can potentially impact the surrounding catchment and local coastal environment. This impact is usually highly local, and depends significantly on the settling velocity of waste feed and the current velocity (which varies both spatially and temporally) and depth.|$|R

Plato accompanies Floyd and the player, although his personality slowly changes from mild to sullen to aggressive. It is slowly revealed that every machine still functioning {{on the space}} station is hostile towards humans: besides the actively homicidal tendencies of the hull welders, the <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> manufacture poisonous <b>food</b> and drinks, and even seemingly harmless devices will explode unless powered down. Before long, Plato attempts to kill the player; Floyd is conflicted between the two friendships but reluctantly destroys the other robot.

50|$|The {{term was}} coined 1963 by animal {{psychologist}} Glen Jensen. In his original study around 200 rats {{were given a}} choice between food {{in a bowl and}} a <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> which required that the rat step on the pedal a set number of times. In this experiment, Jensen found that the rats opted for the foot pedal option {{as a function of the}} number of foot presses required to receive the food reward. Similar studies by Jensen and other researchers have since replicated his findings with gerbils and other animals including mice, rats, birds, fish, monkeys and chimpanzees. The only animal that didn't display similar behavior was domesticated cats, which prefer to be served.|$|E

Fifteen of the mice died when the <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> in their experimental compartment stopped working. The gerbil compartment suffered a temporary loss of power, ventilation, lighting, and food supply that likely accounts for their demise. Ultimately, all of the remaining animals will be euthanized for study.

40|$|Operant {{temporal}} discrimination {{learning was}} investigated in goldfish. In the first experiment, there was a fixed daily change in illumination. Eight subjects were trained to operate a lever that reinforced each press with food. The period during which responses were reinforced was then progressively reduced until it was 1 hr in every 24. The final 1 -hr feeding schedule was maintained over 4 weeks. The feeding period commenced {{at the same time}} each day throughout. The <b>food</b> <b>dispensers</b> were then made inactive, and a period of extinction ensued for 6 days. The pattern of responding suggested that the fish were able to exhibit temporal discrimination in anticipation of feeding time.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} 5 -HT 2 / 1 C receptor antagonist ritanserin on d-fenfluramine (d-FF) induced changes in food intake, prolactin (PRL) secretion and oral temperature in 12 healthy male volunteers. The study was double blind and placebo controlled. Food intake was measured using an automated <b>food</b> <b>dispenser.</b> d-FF (30 mg) significantly reduced fat intake. While ritanserin (5 mg) had no effect when given alone it abolished the d-FF induced reduction in fat intake. In addition, ritanserin abolished the d-FF induced rise in PRL and oral temperature. The results suggest that 5 -HT 2 or 5 -HT 1 C receptors mediate the effects of d-fenfluramine on appetite, prolactin secretion and temperature in humans...|$|E
40|$|Owls are {{efficent}} predators with a {{well developed}} auditory system adapted to localize the exact {{position of the}} prey. In captivity owls rarely {{get the chance to}} perform their hunting behaviour. Very few studies has been made on owls in captivity and none about environmental or behavioural enrichment. In BIAZA’s Owl Management Guidelines there is a small chapter about behavioral enrichment describing the lack of knowledge on the subject and emphasizing the importance of more research and the introduction of enrichment into the keeping routine. This study was performed on two Great grey owls (Strix nebulosa lapponica) at Nordens Ark in Bohuslän, Sweden for twelve days. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether enrichment of a recorded sound of a prey animal could stimulate the owls’ hunting behavior. The aim was also to consider the possibility of feeding in the night using an automatic <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> to promote natural foraging behavior. Three different treatments were presented to the owls combined with four control days without enrichmet. A <b>food</b> <b>dispenser,</b> PetPod for cats, was used and placed in two different locations, combined with the recorded sound of a house mouse. The various treatments were (1.) LJ, sound enrichment - only sound was presented to the owls; (2.) VM, audio- and feed enrichment - presented the sound in combination with feed from PetPod hung on a pillar inside the aviary; (3.) MP, audio- and feed enrichment - presented the same things as VM but from the ground inside the aviary. The results showed that the owls activity increased by all treatments compared to the control. It also showed that the owls hunting behavior increased considerably and they also attacked the food from PetPod in a natural way. MP was the presentation that triggered the strongest responses and there is potential to feed the owls at night automatically in that way. Futher studies are required to refine the methods and learn how the responses to the sound enrichment develop over time...|$|E

40|$|Individual {{differences}} in impulsivity occur at a cognitive and/or behavioural level and {{are associated with}} differing life outcomes. However, {{there is a lack}} of empirical evidence to support the long-term stability of these characteristics in non-human animals. This study reports on the stability of convergent measures of impulsivity in domestic dogs assessed more than 6 years apart. Measures were (1) owner assessment by means of a questionnaire, the validated 'Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale' (DIAS) and (2) dogs' performance in a delayed reward choice test. Dogs had 15 -min free access to two <b>food</b> <b>dispensers,</b> one dispensing a piece of food immediately, the other dispensing three pieces after a delay, which increased by 1 s every other time the dogs sampled it. Maximum delay reached in this task reflects decision-making, or cognitive impulsivity, whereas the rate of extra presses on the delayed reward device during the delay can be considered as a measure of motor or behavioural impulsivity. DIAS scores were strongly and significantly correlated across years. The maximum delay reached in the behaviour test was also highly stable, whereas paw-pressing rate was uncorrelated between the years. These results demonstrate that cognitive but not motor impulsivity is highly consistent over time in dog...|$|R
40|$|Most studies {{carried out}} with seabass under {{self-feeding}} conditions report an intriguing social structure that is built around the device and the <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> with three coexisting triggering categories: high-triggering (HT), low-triggering (LT) and zero-triggering (ZT) fish. However, neither sex nor feeding motivation or hierarchy can explain the establishment of this specialization. We characterised the personality of seabass with the commonly used restraint and open field tests and assessed the link between personality traits and individual triggering activity towards the self-feeder apparatus. We found no differences between triggering categories during the restraint test but high triggering fish were characterised as shyer than low- and zero-triggering fish during the open field test. Triggering activity was negatively correlated with exploratory capacities and boldness. This experiment provides for the first time evidence that high triggering status in seabass is correlated with personality traits, which could partly explain the social structure that builds around a self-feeder device...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{new method}} for the direct {{measurement}} of solid food intake in man is described. The apparatus {{consists of a}} refrigerated <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> connected to an electronic recording system whereby a continuous record of food intake can be obtained over an extended period. In standardization procedures the method {{was found to be}} reliable; subsequent studies have shown it {{to be sensitive to the}} effects of anorectic drugs, and applicable to the long-term study of patients with eating disorders. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 33 : 1852 - 1855, 1980. The techniques currently available for the measurement of food intake and feeding be-havior in man all appear to have definite limitations (1). For example, one of the most commonly used methods, that of measuring consumption of a liquid nutrient from a hid-den reservoir (2 - 5), probably reflects drink-ing behavior rather than eating behavior (6). Those techniques in which the intake of soli...|$|E
40|$|Head and eye {{movements}} were simultaneously recorded during locomotory and pecking behavior of 4 pigeons (CoLumba Livia), which {{were trained to}} traverse a conditioning chamber, with a pecking key and a <b>food</b> <b>dispenser</b> at each end. Each trial involved key pecking, walking, and feeding. Head {{movements were}} registered with a skull-mounted miniature accelerometer, and eye movements were recorded with implanted electrooculographic electrodes. An almost perfect tem-poral coordination between head and eye movements was observed during both walking and feeding bouts. During walking, head movements primarily provide retinal image stability, and eye movements support visual scanning. During feeding, head movements mainly subserve the grasp-ing of food items, and eye movements maintain visual fixation on them. Because the eyes are reflexively closed during the middle phase of pecks, the head and eye movements are then under ballistic control. The peculiar saltatory head motions that many birds ex-hibit while they walk have repeatedly attracted interest in the past. As early as 1930, Dunlap and Mowrer reported that although the body of locomoting chickens, pigeons, and star...|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used tool in animal behavioral research is the operant conditioning chamber—also known as a Skinner Box. The chamber is an enclosure designed to hold a test animal (often a rodent, pigeon, or primate). The interior of the chamber contains some type of device that serves the role of discriminative stimuli, at least one mechanism to measure the subject's behavior as a rate of response—such as a lever or key-peck switch—and a mechanism for the delivery of consequences—such as a <b>food</b> pellet <b>dispenser</b> or a token reinforcer such as an LED light.|$|R
40|$|The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus L.) {{is listed}} as extinct in Finland, {{endangered}} in Sweden and critically endangered in Norway. Around 2000 there were only 40 – 60 adult individuals left, prompting the implementation of conservation actions, including a captive breeding programme founded from wild-caught pups. The initial breeding trials failed, probably because of stress among captive animals, and the programme was radically changed in 2005. Eight large enclosures within the species’ historical natural habitat were established, which had {{the positive effect of}} all pairs breeding in 2007. As of 2015, 385 pups (yearly average 37) were produced. In this ongoing programme, pups are released the winter (January–February) following their birth and have had an average first-year survival of 0. 44. The release sites are prepared with artificial dens and a network of supplementary <b>food</b> <b>dispensers,</b> designed to work exclusively for the Arctic fox. After just four to seven years of releases, populations have been effectively re-established in three mountain areas where the species had been locally extinct. One of the newly re-established populations has become the largest population in Norway. Several other populations, including Swedish ones, have benefited considerably from successful immigration of released foxes. The number of wild-born pups that are descendants of released foxes has likely exceeded 600, and in 2014 50 % of all free-living breeding pairs in mainland Norway included released foxes or their descendants. The Norwegian Arctic fox captive breeding programme has proven to be an important conservation action for the recovery of the Scandinavian Arctic fox population...|$|R

40|$|Auto-shaping the pigeon's key-peck {{response}} was examined as a respondent conditioning procedure {{with the use}} of Rescorla's truly-random control procedure. In the first experiment, pigeons received presentations of brief light on the response key and brief presentations of food where the light and the food were independently presented. All birds failed to key peck after many light and food presentations, but explicit pairing of the light and food rapidly conditioned pecking to the light. Experiment 2 showed that even when an independent light/food presentation schedule was reduced to variable-time 30 sec, additional naive birds would not key peck and only one bird pecked when the schedules were variable-time 15 sec. A third experiment examined an explicit-unpairing control procedure, where the light and food were not only presented on independent schedules but were also separated by a minimum time, and found that auto-shaping did not occur. A fourth experiment investigated a number of control procedures and found them ineffective. A fifth experiment investigated the effects of a physical separation of the locus of the response key and the <b>food</b> <b>dispenser,</b> and a sixth experiment investigated using a tone in place of the light. It was concluded that pecking is generated by auto-shaping procedures only when an intermittently presented keylight is regularly paired with food...|$|E
40|$|In rats (Rattus norvegicus) {{anticipation}} to {{an oncoming}} food reward in an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning procedure is expressed as {{an increase of}} behavioural transitions, i. e. hyperactivity. This behaviour {{might be related to}} the spontaneous appetitive behaviour of animals in relation to oncoming food rewards. To deepen our insight into anticipatory behaviour we decided to study anticipation in rats and cats (Felis silvestris catus) using the same paradigm, as they show different types of spontaneous appetitive behaviour in relation to oncoming food rewards: 'search behaviour' and 'sit-and-wait behaviour' respectively. Using exactly the same Pavlovian conditioning paradigm in rats and cats it turned out that individuals of both species learned the association between conditioned stimulus (CS) (a tone) and unconditioned stimulus (US) (a food reward) as judged by their conditioned approach to the <b>food</b> <b>dispenser.</b> However, rats showed an increase in behavioural transitions whereas as cats a decrease during the 3 min interval between the offset of the CS and the onset of the US. Under extinction conditions the number of transitions of the rats decreased towards that of controls, whereas that of cats increased towards that of controls. This suggests that the same internal psychological process-anticipation to a coming reward-leads to different anticipatory behaviour in different species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.
