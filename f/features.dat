5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure <b>features</b> that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the <b>features</b> they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their <b>features</b> are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because the <b>features</b> in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} detecting <b>feature</b> points from an image and locating their matching correspondence points across images. The proposed method leverages a novel rapid LBP <b>feature</b> point detection to filter out texture-less SURF <b>feature</b> points. The detected <b>feature</b> points, also known as Non-Uniform SURF <b>feature</b> points, are used to match corresponding <b>feature</b> points from other frame images to reliably locate positions of moving objects. The proposed method consists of two processing modules: <b>Feature</b> Point Extraction (FPE) and <b>Feature</b> Point Mapping (FPM). First, FPE extracts salient <b>feature</b> points with <b>Feature</b> Transform and <b>Feature</b> Point Detection. FPM is then applied to generate motion vectors of each <b>feature</b> point with <b>Feature</b> Descriptor and <b>Feature</b> Point Matching. Experiments are conducted on both artificial template patterns and real scenes captured from moving camera at different speed settings. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method outperforms the commonly-used SURF <b>feature</b> point detection and matching approach...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for fast speaker adaptation in large vocabulary recognition systems. As in most HMM-based recognizers, the observation densities are modeled as a weighted sum of Gaussian densities. Instead of adapting {{the means of}} the Gaussian densities, which is typically done, the weights for the Gaussian densities in the states are adapted. By applying non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in the proposed method, very fast adaptation was achieved. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal benchmark recognition task show relative improvements between 5 % and 15 %, while the adaptation converges within 0. 2 seconds. Analysis of the latent speakers found by NMF learns that these latent speakers reflect the gender of the speaker most prominently, even when vocal tract length normalization is used, and that they reflect the speaker’s age more clearly than the speaker’s regional influences or dialect.
