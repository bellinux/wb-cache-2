5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Another {{question}} is whether, {{if there was}} a perceptible beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> far from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} why several nations with few female workers {{have such a}} high {{percentage}} of salaried women. One possible explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages.

25|$|Members of the American Reform {{movement}} began {{a program}} to convert to Judaism the non-Jewish spouses of its intermarried members and non-Jews who {{have an interest in}} Judaism. Their rationale <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many Jews were lost during the Holocaust that newcomers must be sought out and welcomed. This approach has been repudiated by Orthodox and Conservative Jews as unrealistic and posing a danger. They say that these efforts make Judaism seem an easy religion to join and observe when in reality being Jewish involves many difficulties and sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two forms}} of society in the red {{imported}} fire ant: polygynous colonies and monogynous colonies. Polygynous colonies differ substantially from monogynous colonies in social insects. The former experience reductions in queen fecundity, dispersal, longevity, and nestmate relatedness. Polygynous queens are also less physogastric than monogynous queens and workers are smaller. Understanding the mechanisms behind queen recruitment is integral to understanding how these differences in fitness are formed. It is unusual {{that the number of}} older queens in a colony does not influence new queen recruitment. Levels of queen pheromone, which appears to be related to queen number, play important roles in the regulation of reproduction. It would follow that workers would reject new queens when exposed to large quantities of this queen pheromone. Moreover, evidence supports the claim that queens in both populations enter nests at random, without any regard for the number of older queens present. There is no correlation between the number of older queens and the number of newly recruited queens. Three hypotheses have been posited to explain the acceptance of multiple queens into established colonies: mutualism, kin selection, and parasitism. The mutualism hypothesis states that cooperation leads to an increase in the personal fitness of older queens. However, this hypothesis is not consistent with the fact that increasing queen number decreases both queen production and queen longevity. Kin selection also seems unlikely given that queens have been observed to cooperate under circumstances where they are statistically unrelated. Therefore, queens experience no gain in personal fitness by allowing new queens into the colony. Parasitism of preexisting nests appears to be the best explanation of polygyny. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many queens attempt to enter the colony that the workers get confused and inadvertently allow several queens to join it.|$|E

2500|$|... "We want to {{add value}} through skills acquisition. But in doing this, we have {{found out that the}} main problem is getting finance at {{affordable}} interest rates. The Federal Government talks about this and the banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, the banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>So,</b> the banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E

[...] He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, [...] "tragically" [...] stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: [...] "Dancing does attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players...but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies." [...] In his view, [...] "one of our problems <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine." [...] He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as Dancing: A Man's Game (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years.|$|E

[...] The journalist John Gunther wrote that [...] "There are plenty of vain and ambitious and uncharming politicians. This would not be enough to cause Dewey's lack of popularity.

She however added that [...] "he was brilliant and thoroughly honest." [...] Leo O'Brien, a reporter for the United Press International (UPI), recalled Dewey in an interview by saying that [...] "I hated his guts when he first came to Albany, and I loved him by the time he left. It was almost tragic – how he put on a pose that alienated people. Behind a pretty thin veneer he was a wonderful guy." [...] John Gunther wrote in 1947 that some [...] "people may not [...] "like" [...] Dewey, but (a) an inner core of advisers and friends, including some extremely distinguished people, have a loyalty to him little short of idolatrous, and (b) {{he is one of the}} greatest vote-getters in the history of the nation." ...|$|E
