50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, {{the protein}} domain SWAP {{is derived from}} the term Suppressor-of-White-APricot, a splicing regulator from the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The protein domain is found in regulators that control splicing. It is found in splicing regulatory proteins.When a gene is expressed the DNA must be transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). However, it sometimes contains intervening or <b>interrupting</b> <b>sequences</b> named introns. mRNA splicing helps to remove these sequences, leaving a more favourable sequence. mRNA splicing is an essential event in the post-transcriptional modification process of gene expression. SWAP helps to control this process in all cells except gametes.|$|R

Various elements, concerning plot, characters, themes, imagery and factual references are fragmented and dispersed throughout the entire work.

In Z213: Exit, a fictional diary by Greek writer Dimitris Lyacos, {{one of the major}} exponents of fragmentation in postmodern literature, an almost telegraphic style is adopted, devoid, in most part, of articles and conjunctions. The text is interspersed with lacunae and everyday language combines with poetry and biblical references leading up to syntax disruption and distortion of grammar.

40|$|MUC- 2, {{the first}} {{described}} intestinal mucin gene, has become {{important as a}} prototype for secreted mucins in several organ systems. However, {{little is known about}} its protein backbone structure and hence its role in diseases such as colon cancer, ulcerative colitis, and cystic fibrosis, which are known to have mucin abnormalities. Studies in this manuscript show that MUC- 2 contains two distinct regions {{with a high degree of}} internal homology, but the two regions bear no significant homology to each other. Region 1 consists mostly of 48 -bp repeats which are interrupted in places by 21 - 24 -bp segments. Several of these <b>interrupting</b> <b>sequences</b> show similarity to each other, creating larger composite repeat units. Region 1 has no length polymorphisms. Region 2 is composed of 69 -bp tandem repeats arranged in an uninterrupted array of up to 115 individual units.

40|$|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA 10), an {{autosomal}} dominant cerebellar ataxia disorder, {{is caused by}} a non-coding ATTCT microsatellite repeat expansion in the ataxin 10 gene. In a subset of SCA 10 families, the 5 '-end of the repeat expansion contains a complex sequence of penta- and heptanucleotide interruption motifs which is followed by a pure tract of tandem ATCCT repeats of unknown length at its 3 '-end. Intriguingly, expansions that carry these interruption motifs correlate with an epileptic seizure phenotype and are unstable despite the theory that interruptions are expected to stabilize expanded repeats. To examine the apparent contradiction of unstable, interruption-positive SCA 10 expansion alleles and to determine whether the instability originates outside of the <b>interrupted</b> region, we <b>sequenced</b> approximately 1 kb of the 5 '-end of SCA 10 expansions using the ATCCT-PCR product in individuals across multiple generations from four SCA 10 families. We found that the greatest instability within this region occurred in paternal transmissions of the allele in stretches of pure ATTCT motifs while the intervening <b>interrupted</b> <b>sequences</b> were stable. Overall, the ATCCT interruption changes by only one to three repeat units and therefore cannot account for the instability across the length of the disease allele. We conclude that the AT-rich interruptions locally stabilize the SCA 10 expansion at the 5 '-end but do not completely abolish instability across the entire span of the expansion. In addition, analysis of the interruption alleles across these families support a parsimonious single origin of the mutation with a shared distant ancestor...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{scattering}} is {{a process}} in which a particle is repeatedly deflected by other particles. In an overwhelming majority of cases, the ensuing random walk can successfully be described through Gaussian, or normal, statistics. However, like a (growing) number of other apparently inofensive systems, diffusion of light in dilute atomic vapours eludes this familiar interpretation, exhibiting a superdiffusive behavior. As opposed to normal diffusion, whereby the particle executes steps in random directions but with lengths slightly varying around an average value (like a drunkard whose next move is unpredictable but certain to within a few tens of centimeters), superdiffusion is characterized by sudden abnormally long steps (Lévy flights) <b>interrupting</b> <b>sequences</b> of apparently regular jumps which, although very rare, determine the whole dynamics of the system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genetic {{characterisation}} of polioviruses remains highly important even {{in countries}} where wild poliovirus circulation has been <b>interrupted.</b> <b>Sequence</b> data on representative wild strains from all geographical regions is required for surveillance purposes and surveillance for vaccine-related isolates with increased potential for transmissibility in humans should continue. OBJECTIVE: To report the genetic characteristics of wild and vaccine-related polioviruses isolated in Tunisia from 1991 to 2006. STUDY DESIGN: Wild isolates were sequenced in the VP 1 genomic region and compared to each other. Vaccine-related isolates were assessed for genetic recombination by PCR/RFLP and sequence analysis of the 3 D region. Recombinant viruses were assessed for genetic drift in the VP 1 region. RESULTS: The VP 1 sequences of the last wild isolates, all from serotype 3, showed 97. 7 - 98. 7 % nucleotide homology. Nineteen percent of vaccine-related isolates were vaccine/vaccine intertypic recombinants. No recombinant with non-poliovirus enteroviruses was identified. Mutational differences in the VP 1 sequences of recombinant viruses ranged from 0. 0 % to 0. 7 % indicating a limited replication period. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides sequence data on wild polioviruses from Tunisia/North Africa and shows that in countries with continuous high vaccine coverage transmission of vaccine-related polioviruses is time-limited...|$|R

There are two polypeptides in the homogeneous preparation of Bpl I with molecular masses of approximately 74 and 37 kDa. The sizes of the Bpl I subunits are close to those of Bcg I, but the proportion 1 : 1 in the final preparation is different from that of 2 : 1 in Bcg I.

40|$|Canvas was {{commissioned}} by the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Consortium in fall 1999 for the CBDNA Biennium National Conference {{to be held at}} the University of North Texas in February 2001. This substantial and profound three-movement work is Pulitzer Prize winning composer George Walker's first work for wind ensemble and is a milestone in wind composition {{at the turn of the}} millennium. This analysis considers Walker's sophisticated use of octatonic collections and their subsets. Walker uses the three transpositions of the octatonic scale as a harmonic framework for the work. Within this framework, specific subsets of the collection are used in traditional harmonic ways. A hierarchy of pitch sets is created, lending a "tonic" function characteristic to prevalent and specifically placed sonorities. Onto this "canvas" of octatonic harmonies, Walker "paints" specific motivic gestures. These motivic gesture monopolize specific intervallic relationships that are initially presented in the beginning of the work. Certain motivic techniques are then employed in the ongoing development of the motivic content. These motivic techniques include melodic suspension, interval alternation, double stroke articulation, irregularly recurring patterns, chordal punctuations, <b>interrupted</b> <b>sequences,</b> and dramatic uses of silence. Formally, Walker uses short "cells" of similar motivic and harmonic content as a tool of organization...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there is an effect of mobile phone electromagnetic field emissions on the human electroencephalograph (EEG). EEG recordings from ten awake subjects were taken during exposure to radiofrequency (RF) emissions from a mobile phone positioned behind the head. Two experimental trials were conducted. In the first trial, RF exposures were generated by a GSM mobile phone with the speaker disabled and configured to transmit at full-radiated power. During the second trial, exposures were generated by a non-modified GSM mobile phone in active standby mode. For each trial, subjects were exposed in five minute intervals to a randomized, <b>interrupted</b> <b>sequence</b> of five active and five sham exposures. The experiment was conducted under single-blind conditions. The average EEG band power in active exposure recordings was compared to corresponding sham recordings. Statistical tests indicated significant difference in the full-power mode trial within the EEG alpha (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (13 - 32 Hz) bands. A subsequent statistical analysis of median spectral power in discrete EEG rhythms revealed significant differences in 7 of the 32 distinct frequencies overall.

Current methods for FMR 1 molecular testing rely on Southern blot analysis to detect expanded alleles too large to be PCR-amplified and to identify female homozygous alleles that often confound interpretations of PCR data. A novel, single-tube CGG repeat primed FMR 1 PCR technology was designed with two gene-specific primers that flank the triplet repeat region, {{as well as a}} third primer that is complementary to the (CGG) n repeat. This PCR was evaluated with 171 unique DNA samples, including a blinded set of 146 clinical specimens. The method detected all alleles reported by Southern blot analysis, including full mutations in 66 clinical samples and comprised up to 1300 CGG.

Crippa (Nucleic Acids Research 9, 5311 - 5330). Comparison with data from other species of Xenopus leads to the inference that the transcription initiation site in X. borealis is in the newly sequenced region and not, as was previously thought, in the region sequenced earlier. The X. borealis external transcribed spacer thus defined is some 612 nucleotides long, about 100 nucleotides shorter than in X. laevis. The X. borealis and X. laevis external transcribed spacers show a pattern of extensive but <b>interrupted</b> <b>sequence</b> divergence, with a large conserved tract starting about 100 nucleotides downstream from the transcription initiation site and shorter conserved tracts elsewhere. The regions in between the conserved tracts differ in length between the respective external transcribed spacers indicating that insertions and deletions have contributed to their divergence, as previously inferred for the internal transcribed spacers. Much of the overall length difference is in the region flanking the 18 S gene, where there are also length microheterogeneities in X. laevis rDNA. As in X. laevis, the transcribed spacer sequences flanking the 18 S gene in X. borealis contain no major tracts of mutual complementarity.
