40|$|To {{appropriate}} additional {{sources of}} fiscal revenue, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) started <b>direct</b> <b>underwriting</b> of new deficit-financing government bond, (GBs) (BOJ underwriting) on November 25, 1932. This paper examines the BOJ's underwriting policymaking process {{through the use}} of newly available archived documents from the BOJ and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Evidence from these documents contradicts conventional arguments that the BOJ was forced to underwrite GBs due to Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi's firm request and that it regarded the policy measure as temporary. Instead, the BOJ was confident it could exert monetary control through the market operation of selling underwritten GBs (selling operations). In addition, the BOJ willingly accepted the underwriting, expecting it to reinforce its influence over financial institutions. BOJ policymakers partly forecasted the course of events. First, the BOJ started underwriting during the Takahashi economic policy period (1931 - 36). Once it started, it was difficult for the BOJ to stop underwriting bonds. The BOJ was forced to continue underwriting deficit-financing bonds because of expanding financial demand. Second the MOF used very complex and irregular budgeting methods beginning with the budget process of fiscal 1936. This created a large deferred fiscal burden that concealed the realities of fiscal deficits. ...|$|R
40|$|There seem to {{be little}} discussions on the {{influences}} of different underwriting mechanisms on offering prices. Under different underwriting mechanisms, the issuer, the investment bank and the investor will consider the offering prices based on his own benefit. As a result, the offering price is affected by different underwriting mechanisms. In China, most of the stock IPO {{takes the form of}} stand-by underwriting. Because of the huge demand on the new share issue from Chinese investors, the investment bank almost has not unsold stocks to underwrite. Therefore, there is no big difference in the risk that the investment bank faces between the firm <b>commitment</b> <b>underwriting</b> and best-effort underwriting. As a result, when the Chinese investment bank is allowed to participate in the procedure of pricing offering price, the pricing behavior of the investment bank has no big difference in the two risk- similar mechanisms. Considering different advantage and suitability of different mechanisms, China needs to change the single underwriting mechanism situation and encourage the practice of the firm <b>commitment</b> <b>underwriting</b> mechanism...|$|R

Specifically, we analyze the determinants of underwriting spreads on corporate bond issues, secondary equity offerings and initial public offerings over the period 1970 - 2000. We explain the time-varying cross-sectional behavior of these spreads by analyzing three sets of variables or factors: macro (systematic) factors, investment banking market structure factors and issuer specific characteristics. We also analyze the relationship between the <b>direct</b> costs (<b>underwriting</b> spreads) and indirect costs (underpricing) of new issues. Among our many results we find an apparent decline in spreads over time, an increased clustering in spreads for both IPOs and SEOs, the dominance of issuer- specific characteristics in explaining spreads, and a relatively weak linkage between the direct and indirect costs of issuance. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the total direct costs of raising external equity capital for US real estate investment trust (REIT) initial public offerings (IPOs). Design/methodology/approach – The study provides recent evidence on total direct costs for a comprehensive dataset of 125 US REIT IPOs from 1996 until June 2010. A multivariate OLS regression is performed to determine significant factors influencing the level of total direct costs and also underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Findings – The study finds economies of scale in total <b>direct</b> costs, <b>underwriting</b> fees and non-underwriting expenses. The equally (value) weighted average total direct costs are 8. 33 percent (7. 52 percent), consisting of 6. 49 percent (6. 30 percent) underwriting fees and 1. 87 percent (1. 22 percent) non-underwriting direct expenses. The study finds a declining trend of total direct costs for post 2000 IPOs which is attributed to the declining trend in both underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Offer size is a critical determinant for both total direct costs and their individual components and inversely affects these costs. The total direct costs are found significantly higher for equity REITs than for mortgage REITs and are also significantly higher for offers listed in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Underwriting fees appear to be negatively influenced by the offer price, the number of representative underwriters involved in the issue, industry return volatility and the number of potential specific risk factors but positively influenced by prior quarter industry dividend yield and ownership limit identified in the prospectus. After controlling for time trend, the paper finds REIT IPOs incur higher non-underwriting direct expenses in response to higher industry return volatility prior to the offer. Originality/value – This paper adds to the international REIT IPO literature by exploring a number of new influencing factors behind total <b>direct</b> costs, <b>underwriting</b> fees and non-underwriting direct expenses.

5000|$|An {{initial public}} {{offering}} is when a company issues public stock newly to investors, called an [...] "IPO" [...] for short. A company can later issue more new shares, or issue shares that have been previously registered in a shelf registration. These later new issues are also sold in the primary market, {{but they are not}} considered to be an IPO but are often called a [...] "secondary offering". Issuers usually retain investment banks to assist them in administering the IPO, obtaining SEC (or other regulatory body) approval of the offering filing, and selling the new issue. When the investment bank buys the entire new issue from the issuer at a discount to resell it at a markup, it is called a firm <b>commitment</b> <b>underwriting.</b> However, if the investment bank considers the risk too great for an underwriting, it may only assent to a best effort agreement, where the investment bank will simply do its best to sell the new issue.|$|R

40|$|In 2000, Congress {{decided to}} move away from a fixed-dollar-per-acre premium subsidy to a subsidy {{percentage}} that applies to any crop insurance product offered. This change reduced the cost to farmers of moving from yield insurance to revenue insurance by more than 50 %. In addition, Congress decided to pay {{a large proportion of the}} additional premium for higher coverage levels, paying for more than half the cost of moving from the 65 % to the 75 % coverage level and about 25 % of the additional cost of moving from 75 % to 80 % coverage. Not surprisingly, farmers responded to these lower costs by moving to more expensive revenue insurance policies and higher coverage levels. This response is part of the reason why the Congressional Budget Office projects that the cost of the crop insurance program exceeds $ 7 billion per year. The changes to the premium subsidy structure were made in an era of projected budget surpluses. Does this change still make sense now that federal deficits and overall debt levels are so high? How much could spending be reduced if the premium subsidy structure were changed back? This policy briefing paper provides insights into these questions. Congress has demonstrated repeatedly that it wants a large proportion of acres to be enrolled in the crop insurance program. The proven way to expand insured acreage is to subsidize farmers’ crop insurance premiums with either a “lump sum” subsidy that gives farmers a set amount to participate in the program or a proportional subsidy that pays a set fraction of a farmer’s premium. The added benefit to the crop insurance industry of a proportional subsidy is that it incentivizes farmers to buy higher coverage levels and more expensive revenue insurance. If Congress had decided in 2010 {{to move away from}} the current system of proportional subsidies to the amount of premium subsidy available for yield insurance, then the 2011 projected cost of the crop insurance program would have declined by about $ 1. 4 billion from the direct savings in premium subsidies, and by another $ 300 million in lower underwriting gains as farmers moved away from expensive revenue insurance. Further savings would accrue if premium subsidies were fixed at a set dollar amount because this would remove the incentive for farmers to buy more crop insurance than they would buy if they were spending their own money rather than taxpayer dollars. Total savings approaching $ 2 billion would likely accrue by simply returning to the premium structure that we had before the Agricultural Risk Protection Act. Farmers would respond to this policy change by buying less revenue insurance and lower coverage levels. This would also reduce their out-of-pocket expenditures. Farm groups would undoubtedly oppose this change, but such opposition would be tempered if the choice were between this change and a reduction in a more valued program, such as <b>direct</b> payments. <b>Underwriting</b> gains to crop insurance companies would decline significantly. Both companies and agents would have the most to lose from this policy change so they would be expected to oppose it strongly. But in an era of tight budgets, the tax dollars spent on subsidies that incentivize farmers to buy more and different types of crop insurance than they would buy with their own dollars could fall under intense scrutiny...|$|R
