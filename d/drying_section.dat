40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a grey-box {{model of the}} temperature and moisture content for each layer of the multi-ply paperboard inside the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> of a paper mill. The distribution of the moisture inside the board is an important variable for the board quality, but is unfortunately not measured on-line. The main goal of this work is a model that predicts the moisture evolution during the drying, {{to be used by}} operators and process engineers as an estimation of the unmeasurable variables inside the <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> Drying of carton board is a complex and nonlinear process. The physical phenomena are not entirely understood and the drying depends on a number of unknown parameters and unmodelled or unmeasurable features. The grey-box modelling approach, which consists in using the available measurements to estimate the unknown disturbances, is therefore a suitable approach for modelling the <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> A major problem encountered with the modelling of the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> is the lack of measurements to validate the model. Consequently, the correctness and uniqueness of the estimated variables and parameters are not guaranteed. We therefore carry out observability and identifiability analyses and the results suggest that the selected model structure is observable and identifiable under the assumption that specific measurements are available. Based on this analysis, static measurements in the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> are carried out to identify the parameters of the model. The parameters are identified using one data set and the results are validated with other data sets. We finally simulate the model dynamics to investigate if predicting the final board properties on-line is feasible. Since only the final board temperature and moisture content are measured on-line, the variables and parameters are neither observable nor identifiable. We therefore regard the predictions as an approximation of the estimated variables. The semiphysical model is complemented with a nonlinear Kalman filter to estimate the unmeasured inputs and the unmodelled disturbances. Data simulations show a good prediction of the final board temperature and moisture content {{at the end of the}} <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> The model could therefore possibly be used by operators and process engineers as an indicator of the board temperature and moisture inside the <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> QC 2010111...|$|E

40|$|Papermaking {{is known}} as an energy-intensive, but not always {{efficient}} industry. This is at least {{partly due to the}} fact that the majority of papermaking technologies and procedures were established at a time when energy was both cheap and plentiful. A considerable fraction of the energy required for papermaking is consumed in removing water by the use of steam in the paper machine’s <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> It is also known that even a small reduction in steam use can result in a significant reduction in production costs and environmental effects. To date, a great deal of research has been undertaken, aimed at improving the performance of the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> by making more efficient use of dryer steam. This paper investigates a new approach to reducing thermal energy use in paper making by seeking to enhance the amount of water removed in sections of the machine prior to the <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> The proposed method is focused on sequential modelling of the effect of vacuums used in the forming section on the thermal energy consumption in the <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> The primary models explain how different vacuum pressures can affect the flow of water from the sheet in the forming section whilst the secondary models describe the effect of increased drainage on the steam requirements in the dryer. Operational data from a UK paper mill are used to illustrate the proposed method. The models developed can have subsequent application to optimising the use of thermal energy in paper making...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{modeling}} {{and control of}} {{the last part of the}} paper machine - the <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> Paper is dried by letting it pass through a series of steam heated cylinders and the evaporation is thus powered by the latent heat of vaporization of the steam. The moisture in the paper is controlled by adjusting the set point of the steam pressure controllers. There exist several commercial incentives to focus on the performance of the moisture control. The time to perform a grade change is often limited by the moisture and shorter grade change time is directly correlated to economic profit. Studies have shown that the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> uses 2 / 3 of the total energy requirement in paper making. Reduced variations in moisture gives opportunity for target shifts (changed set point) which reduces the amount of raw material and steam requirement. It also creates opportunity for increased production rate. The thesis is divided in two parts. The first part deals with the control of the steam pressure inside the cylinders. Both a black-box model and a physical model are given for the steam pressure process. A tuning rule for both PI and PID control is derived and various other controller structures are investigated. Many of the results are verified by experiments on paper machines at different paper mills. The second part of the thesis treats the moisture controller. The physical model from the first part is expanded with a model for the paper. This gives a complete simulation model for the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> that is implemented in the object-oriented modeling language Modelica. Two new approaches to control the moisture by feedback are evaluated. The first utilizes the air around the paper in combination with the drying cylinders to improve the controller performance. The second uses only the last part of the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> to control the moisture, while the first part is put at an appropriate level. Finally, feedforward of a surface temperature signal is examined...|$|E
40|$|Papermaking is {{a process}} where {{cellulose}} fibers suspended in water are dewatered step by step. In the final step, the remaining water is dewatered by evaporation when the paper web is in contact with steam-heated cylinders in the <b>drying</b> <b>section.</b> Even though the <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> only removes approximately 1 % of all the water, it uses as much as 2 / 3 of all the energy, in form of steam. The <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> of the paper machine PM 5 at Stora Enso Mölndal {{is divided into three}} parts, where the first part, the pre-dryer is responsible for {{the main part of the}} drying and thus also the main part of the energy consumption. Also being the bottleneck in the production the pre-dryer was the object of the investigation in this project. The aim of this project was to map out the energy flows within and around the pre- <b>drying</b> <b>section</b> and develop a computer model of it. This was done with the purpose of giving propositions of how the machine should be rebuilt to enable increased production and to give lower specific energy consumption. For the development of the computer model the simulation software WinGEMS 4. 0 was used, while this program is suitable for simulation of the pulp and paper industries. At first model parameters of the current machine were adjusted, on the basis of measurements done on the machine. This model was then modified to predict the results of different rebuilds. In parallel, pinch analysis was used to investigate the possibilities for heat recovery. The result of the study was that good heat recovery would decrease the specific steam consumption since heat exchange could, to some extent, replace steam for preheating incoming air. The heat exchange is facilitated by a well-designed air system, where air leakage is restricted. Investing in a better air system pays off, as it gives propitious drying conditions and hence somewhat higher production. A more efficient way to increase the production is to expand the pre-dryer with some extra cylinders. Finally, when combining expansion, better air system and better heat exchange the result will be a pre-dryer with increased production and low specific energy consumption...|$|E
