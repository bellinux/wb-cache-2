5000|$|The {{usage of}} the new type of tenor voice, which {{includes}} John Sinclair, the Scottish tenor that first performed Semiramide’s Idreno, passed then {{into the hands of}} the other contemporary composers, finding firstly and mainly in Giovanni Battista Rubini, and then also in Gilbert-Louis Duprez and Napoleone Moriani, David’s valid successors. With Rossini, though, a whole era had ended and the new realistic singing ideals of the Romanticism were becoming more widespread. Male coloratura sank into oblivion; Bellini who in La sonnambula still confronted Rubini with virtuosity on a par with the soprano, in I puritani, less than four years later, but would call upon him to sing no more than a scanty number of melismas and Donizetti, who would always keep employing coloratura in the parts written for Rubini, would interrupt this usage with Duprez when the latter ceased posing as the former’s emulator. On the other hand, the falsettone register began, as well, to go out of fashion quite rapidly, as a simple recollection of Baroque antirealism times of yore: Rubini would raise up to high B flat the uttering of force (or forceful), improperly called [...] "from the chest"; Duprez, in his turn, would have Lucca’s audience hear the first high [...] "C from the chest" [...] and would then give up elegiac singing of his former model Rubini, beginning to utter forcefully the whole high note range and also taking on many manners of baritenors, who were then still haunting the operatic scenes (dark timbre, firm accent, <b>great</b> <b>phrasing</b> nobility, quivering and passionate acting). The great Adolphe Nourrit, having proved himself unable to conform to the new singing and taste trend, having been overcome by Duprez at the Opéra through a forceful performance of Arnold’s role in William Tell, which he himself had created, according to Rossini’s expectations, by hautes-contre’s ancient graceful singing, ended his days in despair in Naples where he had resumed his studies with Donizetti, falling headlong from the window of a hotel’s room. The brief season of the tenore contraltino was over and there had begun the new era of the Romantic tenor, whether it was called lyric or dramatic, elegiac or spinto, robusto or di grazia, which is still enduring till present times.|$|E

We doubt the feeling of the old-fashioned orator, because his periods are so rounded and pointed as to convey his feeling. Now before any criticism of the eighteenth-century worthies must be put the proviso of their perfect artistic sincerity. Their oratory was unrhymed poetry, and it had the humanity of poetry.

This study reveals several musical terms in which there are similarities and differences between the rhythm and bars of music. The similarities and differences in the analysis are based on the history of Western music from Gregorian music. Gregorian was monophonic music that still existed in Europe until the 19 th century. There were only two phrases in Gregorian music; when the melody moved up and when it moved down. In this case, there were two main elements in Gregorian music; they were different in rhythmic and they were in one rhythm of music. Arsis is a hard melody while thesis is a soft melody. It could be said that arsis and thesis are also parts of the dynamics form of music work. Keywords: arsis; Thesis; music rhythm; non-traditional music...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{following}} research questions: (1) Does Korean have a metrical structure? (2) If so, what are its acoustic correlates {{and how do they}} compare to English? (3) How does it interact with phrasal prosody? In addressing these issues, I first re-examine the identity of the so-called “long” vowel in Korean, and argue that it is a phonetic duration derived from an underlying accent on surface. The phonological argument is based on a reanalysis of what has been traditionally called “vowel shortening” in verb stems and compounds as “accent shift”. I describe phonetic experiments to verify the proposed phonological analysis, comparing the acoustic properties of the so-called “long” and “short” (i. e. stressed and unstressed) vowels of Korean. To compare the results with a well-known stress system, I describe a parallel experiment on English. I employ the following two experimental methods: (1) The location of the target word is varied in three different prosodic positions. (2) The data are analyzed with two complementary methods: Direct Comparison Method (e. g. ‘per’ of ‘perMIT’ vs. ‘PER’ of ‘PERmit’) and Relative Comparison Method (e. g. ‘per’ of ‘perMIT’ vs. ‘MIT’ of ‘perMIT’). The overall results suggest that both Korean and English adopt longer duration, higher fundamental frequency, and greater intensity for the stressed vowels. However, they differ in the details: (1) Korean has a <b>greater</b> <b>phrase</b> final lengthening effect than English. (2) In Korean, the phrase initial rising tone dominates the effects of stress. (3) Pitch plays a more important role in English than in Korean. Finally, I investigate the phrasal prosody and argue the following: (1) Intensification and focus use different phonetic cues (duration and pitch movement, respectively), but both of them respect metrical structure. (2) Vocative chant reflects the special status of the stressed syllable in duration and pitch. In the conclusion, implications of the proposed theory are discussed on deriving the prosodic hierarchy of Korean and the prosodic typology. ...|$|R
