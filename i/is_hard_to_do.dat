25|$|A {{shoulder}} separation occurs {{where the}} collarbone (clavicle) meets the shoulder blade (scapula). When ligaments {{that hold the}} AC (acromioclavicular) joint together are partially or completely torn, the outer end of the clavicle may slip out of place, preventing it from properly meeting the scapula. Most often the injury {{is caused by a}} blow to the shoulder or by falling on an outstretched hand. After injury it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a 180 degrees rotation.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{took place}} at Guerilla Beach and Larrabee West in Los Angeles, and at Sarm West and Olympic Studios in London. According to Blatt, their {{collaboration}} with Orbit allowed All Saints to explore more experimental genres than those of their previous releases, while Nichols viewed Orbit's production in the new arrangement completely different, and better than that of his own on the original. The [...] "Black Coffee" [...] sessions were more frustrating for group member Natalie Appleton who saw the song {{as an opportunity for}} fellow member Nicole Appleton and herself to sing lead vocals for a change because it was not written by Lewis. In the Appletons' 2002 autobiography Together, Natalie wrote that Lewis was [...] "staking her claim" [...] by arriving early for the first session because Blatt sang lead vocals on [...] "Pure Shores" [...] and not her. Per Natalie's suggestion, management eventually let her cut a lead vocal, but she was nervous during the recording and believed they were placating her. [...] "Without support, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> your best," [...] Natalie recalled in Together, adding that she felt [...] "used and slacked off".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the western}} world, {{distinct}} forms of paganism {{have been developed}} by and {{for members of the}} LGBT community. Margot Adler noted how there were many pagan groups whose practices revolved around the inclusion and celebration of male homosexuality, such as the Minoan Brotherhood, a Wiccan group that combines the iconography from ancient Minoan religion with a Wiccan theology and an emphasis on men-loving-men, and the eclectic pagan group known as the Radical Faeries. Similarly, there are also groups for lesbians, like certain forms of Dianic Wicca and the Minoan Sisterhood. When Adler asked one gay pagan what the pagan community offered members of the LGBT community, the reply was [...] "A place to belong. Community. Acceptance. And a way to connect with all kinds of people, gay, bi, straight, celibate, transgender, in a way that <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the greater society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Waking Up <b>Is</b> <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> was Sedaka's next release with Razor and Tie, {{hitting the}} albums chart in May 2009. The CD was a children's album that used the melodies {{of many of}} Sedaka's best-known songs but changed the lyrics to fit, and {{hopefully}} have fun with, the everyday lives of babies and toddlers, along with their parents, grandparents, babysitters, and other caregivers. [...] The CD title is an example. Lastly, The Music of My Life entered the albums chart in February 2010 and comprised almost all new material. [...] The first track, [...] "Do You Remember?," [...] is Sedaka's first foray into spicy salsa and was produced by music producer, composer, and pianist David Foster. [...] "Right or Wrong," [...] co-written with original music partner Howard Greenfield, was done in traditional street-corner, layered doo-wop vocal harmonies with Sedaka overlaying his own voice to achieve the effect {{for which he was}} well known in his [...] "early" [...] heyday of the late 1950s and early 1960s. The final track, [...] "You", has been previously released, but was remastered for this project and is one of several titles dedicated to his wife and career guide of over 50 years, Leba. [...] Neil Sedaka Music continues to be listed as co-producer along with Razor and Tie.|$|E

6000|$|He was not remiss {{in telling}} himself all this.

We are told to love others as ourselves, and it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. But I think that we never hate others, never despise others, as we are sometimes compelled by our own convictions and self-judgment to hate and to despise ourselves. Harry, as he walked home on this evening, was lost in disgust at his own conduct. He could almost have hit his head against the walls, or thrown himself beneath the wagons as he passed them, so thoroughly was he ashamed of his own life. Even now, on this evening, he had escaped from Onslow Crescent--basely escaped--without having declared any purpose. Twice on this day he had escaped, almost by subterfuges; once from Burton's office, and now again from Cecilia's presence. How long was this to go on, or how could life be endurable to him under such circumstances? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} chapter I have {{attempted}} to suggest a background of the battlemented walls with the low gates and narrow windows which seem to relieve the liveliest of the coloured groups against the neutral tints of the North, and how this was intensified when the neutral tints were touched with the positive hue of snow. In the same merely impressionist spirit I would here attempt to sketch some of the externals of the actors in such a scene, though it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to such a picture even in the superficial matter of the picturesque. Indeed {{it is hard to}} be sufficiently superficial; for in the East nearly every external is a symbol. The greater part of it is the gorgeous rag-heap of Arabian humanity, and even about that one could lecture on almost every coloured rag. We hear much of the gaudy colours of the East; but the most striking thing about them is that they are delicate colours. It is rare to see a red that is merely like a pillar-box, or a blue that is Reckitt's blue; the red is sure to have the enrichment of tawny wine or blood oranges, and the blue of peacocks or the sea. In short these people are artistic in the sense that used to be called aesthetic; and it is a nameless instinct that preserves these nameless tints. Like all such instincts, it can be blunted by a bullying rationalism; like all such children, these people do not know why they prefer the better, and can therefore be persuaded by sophists that they prefer the worst. But there are other elements emerging from the coloured crowd, which are more significant, and therefore more stubborn. A stranger entirely ignorant of that world would feel something like a chill to the blood when he first saw the black figures of the veiled Moslem women, sinister figures without faces. It is as if in that world every woman were a widow. When he realised that these were not the masked mutes at a very grisly funeral, but merely ladies literally obeying a convention of wearing veils in public, he would probably have a reaction of laughter. He would be disposed to say flippantly that it must be, a dull life, not only for the women but the men; and that a man might well want five wives if he had to marry them before he could even look at them. But he will be wise not to be satisfied with such flippancy, for the complete veiling of the Moslem women of Jerusalem, though not a finer thing than the freedom of the Christian woman of Bethlehem, is almost certainly a finer thing than the more coquettish compromise of the other Moslem women of Cairo. It simply means that the Moslem religion is here more sincerely observed; and this in turn is part of something that a sympathetic person will soon feel in Jerusalem, if he has come from these more commercial cities of the East; a spiritual tone decidedly more delicate and dignified, like the clear air about the mountain city. Whatever the human vices involved, it is not altogether for nothing that this is the holy town of three great religions. When all is said, he will feel that there are some tricks that could not be played, some trades that could not be plied, some shops that could not be opened, within a stone's throw of the Sepulchre. This indefinable seriousness has its own fantasies of fanaticism or formalism; but if these are vices they are not vulgarities. There is no stronger example of this than the real Jews of Jerusalem, especially those from the ghettoes of eastern Europe. They can be immediately picked out by the peculiar wisps of hair worn {{on each side of the}} face, like something between curls and whiskers. Sometimes they look strangely effeminate, like some rococo burlesque of the ringlets of an Early Victorian woman. Sometimes they look considerably more like the horns of a devil; and one need not be an Anti-Semite to say that the face is often made to match. But though they may be ugly, or even horrible, they are not vulgar like the Jews at Brighton; they trail behind them too many primeval traditions and laborious loyalties, along with their grand though often greasy robes of bronze or purple velvet. They often wear on their heads that odd turban of fur worn by the Rabbis in the pictures of Rembrandt. And indeed that great name is not irrelevant; for the whole truth at the back of Zionism is in the difference between the picture of a Jew by Rembrandt and a picture of a Jew by Sargent. For Rembrandt the Rabbi was, in a special and double sense, a distinguished figure. He was something distinct from the world of the artist, who drew a Rabbi as he would a Brahmin. But Sargent had to treat his sitters as solid citizens of England or America; and consequently his pictures are direct provocations to a pogrom. But the light that Rembrandt loved falls not irreverently on the strange hairy haloes that can still be seen on the shaven heads of the Jews of Jerusalem. And I should be sorry for any pogrom that brought down any of their grey wisps or whiskers in sorrow to the grave.|$|E
