5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.|$|E

He is missing his right eye, his left hand, and his ring finger on his right hand, and he {{actually}} never served war time. He despises Francis because he fought against him. In the end, he loses <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> and later is fired from Marlin Academy. After arriving in Alaska, Francis gets Spangler {{a job at a}} retirement home, which gives him free rein to bully the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} many people {{that he was getting}} better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because his hands were gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> held the lectern.|$|E

25|$|The fire {{became so}} intense that Rose was forced to crawl from {{position}} to position in order to treat the wounded, giving words of encouragement and directing the fire of the inexperienced and terrified Vietnamese and Montagnard troops. Over the next few days, the company marched west and deeper into Laos, fending off incessant attacks from elements ranging from squad-sized to company-sized, covered by Air Force gunships. On 12 September, during an assault by a NVA company-sized element, one of the Montagnards was wounded 40 to 50 meters outside the perimeter. Dodging enemy fire, Rose ran and crawled {{his way to the}} wounded man, shielding him with his own body while he treated him. He dragged the Montagnard back to the company with one hand while firing at the enemy with his gun in <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shepherd {{was convicted}} of the crime on October 9, 2008, after jurors deliberated for four hours. He was given the maximum {{sentence}} of 99 {{years in prison and}} a $10,000 fine. During the punishment phase of the trial, Shepherd revealed how he murdered Stewart. He pressured her to reveal her new relationship at college, but she refused to answer and grabbed a knife from a table and approached him with it in her hand. She swung at him with the knife and nicked his fingers. Afraid she was going to stab him again, he grabbed her around the neck with one arm and tried to reach the knife with <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> He ended up choking her to death out of anger. He later went to the hardware store to purchase a jigsaw. He undressed the body and dismembered it in his bathtub using the jigsaw and other tools. He barbecued the remains on his grills in his patio.|$|E
25|$|In 211, {{during the}} Battle of Tong Pass against a {{coalition}} of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, Cao Cao led his troops north across the Ji River (濟河) {{in an attempt to}} circle {{to the rear of the}} enemy. The bulk of Cao Cao's troops had already crossed the river, leaving Cao and his Tiger Warriors to bring up the rear. Just then, Ma Chao and his 10,000 horsemen caught up with them. As the enemies were approaching fast, Cao Cao's soldiers rushed to get on board the ferry, which was on the verge of sinking under the weight. Xu Chu held up a saddle with his left hand to shield Cao Cao from arrows and carried a sword in his right hand, using it to slash enemy soldiers trying to clamber onto the vessel. By then, the boatman had been killed by arrows, so Xu Chu, still holding up the saddle with his left hand, used <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> to grab a bargepole and push the ferry away from the ford to safety.|$|E

500|$|In {{the lower}} {{center of the}} painting, Matejko shows a scene {{that took place in}} the Royal Castle. Jan Suchorzewski (8), deputy from Kalisz and an {{opponent}} of the Constitution, has fallen to the ground, holding his young son with one arm; <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> holding a knife, is held by Stanisław Kublicki (9), standing to his right. Kublicki was a deputy from Inflanty, a supporter of the townsfolk and peasant causes, and of the Constitution. The artist here alludes to Suchorzewski's unsuccessful attempt to prevent the king from signing the Constitution, during which he threatening to kill his own son to save him from the [...] "slavery of the Constitution". A deck of cards has fallen out of Suchorzewski's pocket, a reference to the manner in which he was bribed by the anti-Constitution Russian ambassador Otto Magnus von Stackelberg and hetman Branicki; Suchorzewski suddenly started winning large sums of money in games, despite his poor skills as a gambler. Branicki (10) can be seen standing between the king and Suchorzewski, dressed in a Russian uniform, foreshadowing the rank of general he received several years later in the Russian Army. In reality Suchorzewski, like most of those opposed to the Constitution, refused to participate in the procession.|$|E
500|$|Alcatraz gained notoriety {{from its}} {{inception}} as the toughest prison in America and {{considered by many to}} be the world's most fearsome prison of the time, and former prisoners would frequently report acts of brutality and inhumane conditions which severely tested their sanity. Ed Wutke was the first prisoner to commit suicide in Alcatraz. Rufe Persful chopped off his fingers after grabbing an axe from the firetruck, begging another inmate to do the same to <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> One writer described Alcatraz as [...] "the great garbage can of San Francisco Bay, into which every federal prison dumped its most rotten apples." [...] In 1939 the new U.S. Attorney General Frank Murphy attacked the penitentiary, saying [...] "The whole institution is conductive to psychology that builds up a sinister ambitious attitude among prisoners." [...] The reputation of the prison was not helped by the arrival of more of America's most dangerous crooks including Robert Stroud, the [...] "Birdman of Alcatraz", in 1942, who spent 17 years at Alcatraz. He entered the prison system at age 19, and never left. Stroud killed a guard, tangled with other inmates and spent 42 of his 54 years in prison in solitary confinement. However, somewhat contradicting its reputation and the fact that many former inmates named it [...] "Hellcatraz" [...] based on its horrors, some prisoners reported that the living conditions in Alcatraz were much better than most other prisons in the country, especially the food, and many volunteered to come to Alcatraz.|$|E

To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper with <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> and soon he was tangled up gloriously. Before I could come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse.

The two brothers had already been at war, but their hostility now elevated into a long and bitter war that was continued by the descendants of both.|$|R
2500|$|The crotch chop and {{the words}} [...] "suck it" [...] {{actually}} originated with the nWo, while Syxx/X-Pac was still {{a member of the}} faction, Later on DX would use a cross armed x-chop. The signature DX slogan originated on the October 6, 1997 episode of Raw Is War, with Shawn Michaels stating, [...] "I've got two words for 'The Hitman' Bret Hart: suck it!", before doing a one-armed crotch-chop (while holding the microphone with <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand).</b> Later in the episode, both Michaels and Triple H (separately) proceeded to the ring for the Bret Hart-Triple H match, each of them directing the slogan and crotch-chops at fans seated along the entry ramp.|$|E

[...] In June 1905, umpire Hank O'Day ejected Taylor for hand gestures that he interpreted to be an accusation that [...] "I had wheels in my head." [...] A press account described the scene:He strode angrily toward O'Day, and the grandstand observed a lightning movement of the hands. [...] Mystic symbol followed mystic symbol, and the crowd kept guessing, what it meant. [...] Suddenly O'Day, too, strode forward and majestically waved Mr. Taylor from the field.

2500|$|Tom first appears when Merry and Pippin {{are trapped}} by Old Man Willow, and Frodo and Sam cry for help. Tom {{commands}} Old Man Willow to release them, singing him to sleep, and shelters the hobbits {{in his house}} for two nights. Here it is seen that the One Ring has no power over Bombadil; he can see Frodo when the Ring makes him invisible to others, and can wear it himself with no effect. He even tosses the Ring {{in the air and}} makes it disappear, but then produces it from <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> and returns it to Frodo. While this seems to demonstrate that he has unique and mysterious power over the Ring, the idea of giving him the Ring for safekeeping is rejected in Book Two's second chapter, [...] "The Council of Elrond". Gandalf says, rather, that [...] "the Ring has no power over him..." [...] and believes that Tom would not find the Ring to be very important and so might simply misplace it.|$|E

Behind her one of Dionysus's satyrs (shown with a normal human form) stands on one foot {{as he prepares to}} hurl a large rock at Lycurgus. [...] In <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> he holds a pedum or shepherd's crook. [...] To the right of Lycurgus comes first a figure of Pan, then at his feet a rather canine-looking panther, the traditional companion of Dionysus, whose face is missing but was presumably snapping at the king, and then the god himself, taunting him with his right arm extended in an angry gesture. [...] Dionysus carries a thyrsus, the special staff of the god and his followers, and his dress has an Eastern, perhaps Indian, flavour, reflecting what the Ancient Greeks generally believed (perhaps wrongly) about the origins of his cult. [...] The calf section of one leg has been lost. [...] A streamer hanging behind him from his thyrsus overlaps the raised foot of the satyr with the rock, completing the circle of the cup.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1912, Cobb {{assaulted}} a heckler, Claude Lucker (often misspelled as Lueker), in {{the stands}} in New York's Hilltop Park where his Tigers were playing the Highlanders (now the Yankees). Lucker and Cobb had traded insults with {{each other through the}} first couple of innings. Cobb at one point went to the Highlander dugout to look for the Highlander's owner to try to have Lucker ejected from the game, but his search was in vain. The situation finally climaxed when Lucker allegedly called Cobb a [...] "half-nigger." [...] Cobb, in his discussion of the incident in the Holmes biography, avoided such explicit words but alluded to Lucker's epithet by saying he was [...] "reflecting on my mother's color and morals." [...] He went on to state that he warned Highlander manager Harry Wolverton that if something wasn't done about that man, there would be trouble. No action was taken. At the end of the sixth inning, after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lucker, who it turned out was handicapped (he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> in an industrial accident). When onlookers shouted at him to stop because the man had no hands, he reportedly retorted, [...] "I don't care if he got no feet!" [...] Though such an incident seems outrageous in the 21st century, attacking fans was not so unusual an activity {{in the early years of}} baseball. Other notable baseball stars who assaulted heckling fans include Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Rube Waddell, Kid Gleason, Sherry Magee, and Fred Clarke.|$|E

2500|$|Forrest Vosler enlisted as {{a private}} in the Army at Rochester, New York, on October, 8, 1942. [...] He took basic {{training}} at Atlantic City, New Jersey; the Radio Operator and Mechanics School at Scott Field, Illinois; and Flexible Gunnery School at Harlingen, Texas. [...] By May 22, 1943, he had successfully completed his training and three days later was promoted to sergeant. [...] He was promoted to staff sergeant in August at Pyote, Texas, while awaiting overseas movement. [...] In October 1943, he deployed to Europe as a radio operator and aerial gunner on B-17s assigned to the 8th Air Force's 358th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 303rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) based at RAF Molesworth, England. [...] At approximately 8:30 a.m. on December 20, 1943, Staff Sergeant Vosler took off on his fourth combat mission. [...] His aircraft, on its 28th combat mission, was a B-17F named the [...] "Jersey Bounce Jr.," [...] S/N 42-29664. [...] The plane and crew reached the target area of Bremen, Germany, just before noon. [...] The bombers encountered concentrated, accurate and intense flak over Axis territory. [...] In addition to the anti-aircraft fire, about 125 German fighters repeatedly attacked the formation. [...] This was a costly mission for the 8th Air Force as a total of 27 bombers were lost including the Jersey Bounce Jr. after it ditched in the North Sea. [...] Staff Sergeant Vosler was seriously wounded in action. [...] Hit initially in the legs and thighs and then again in the face when 20-mm. cannon shells exploded in his aircraft, his B-17 was forced out of formation. [...] During the ditching, Vosler also saved the tail gunner's life. [...] The badly wounded gunner (Sgt. George Buske) {{was removed from the}} still-floating ditched Fortress and put on one of the wings while the other crewmen prepared the life raft. [...] Buske, unconscious, started to slide down the trailing edge of wing into the water. [...] Vosler grabbed him around his waist while using <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> to hold an antenna wire to avoid falling into the cold water. [...] Vosler accomplished this while coping with a badly wounded eye that resulted from an earlier exploding 20mm cannon shell that hit his gun position. Staff Sergeant Vosler was recommended for the Medal of Honor based on his heroism and was promoted to technical sergeant two weeks after this mission. [...] He was confined to Air Force hospitals in England until his return to the United States in March 1944.|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with his eyes closed, and Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and <b>his</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had placed his hand inside the front of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E
