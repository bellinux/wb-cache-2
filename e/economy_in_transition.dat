The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} {{of using the}} gravity approach for modeling <b>transition</b> processes <b>in</b> foreign trade are the ability of gravity models to explain international trade patterns under the conditions of comparatively little data and for validity of theoretical background of the model to the <b>economies</b> <b>in</b> <b>transition.</b> Both advantages are important when modeling transition processes.

In addition, as a central training institution, NAPA provides training curricula and materials to 61 provincial School of Politics that organize training and retraining for more junior-level civil servants. The training demands are enormous because the current civil service of Vietnam, consisting of approximately 1.4 million, requires improved capacity to manage an <b>economy</b> <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> from a centrally planned mechanism to market economy. In addition, NAPA has recently been designated with pre-service training to prepare labour force for the civil service which will hold training for approximately 140.000 potential civil servants.|$|E

This paper develops a general framework for analysing trade-offs between policies for cleaning banks' balance sheets of bad debt. The framework - a two-tier hierarchy consisting of regulators, banks, and firms - {{is applied to}} analyse three types of policies that have been advocated or employed <b>in</b> the <b>economies</b> <b>in</b> <b>transition.</b> Hidden information and moral hazard are present at each tier of the hierarchy. The analysis identifies two types of effects of policy choice: a direct effect of the policy on bank behaviour and an indirect effect on firm behaviour {{as a reaction to}} the bank response. Both effects are important determinants of policy trade-offs. The analysis demonstrates that differing policies applied to financially distressed banks have differing real effects on firms' and banks' asset values, even when all firms and banks are state-owned. bad debts; banking crises; creditor passivity; <b>economies</b> <b>in</b> <b>transition...</b>|$|R
