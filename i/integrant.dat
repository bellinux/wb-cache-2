25|$|The {{most notable}} person of 7th century Galicia was Saint Fructuosus of Braga. Fructuosus {{was the son}} of a provincial Visigoth dux (military provincial governor), and was known for the many {{foundations}} he established throughout the west of the Iberian peninsula, generally in places with difficult access, such as mountain valleys or islands. He also wrote two monastic rulebooks, characterized by their pact-like nature, with the monastic communities ruled by an abbot, under the remote authority of a bishop (episcopus sub regula), and each <b>integrant</b> of the congregation having signed a written pact with him. Fructuosus was later consecrated as abbot-bishop of Dumio, the most important monastery of Gallaecia—founded by Martin of Braga in the 6th century—under Suebi rule. In 656 he was appointed bishop of Braga and metropolitan of Galicia, ostensibly against his own will.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three great}} results of {{psychological}} observation are Sensibility, Activity or Liberty, and Reason. [...] These three facts {{are different in}} character, but are not found apart in consciousness. Sensations, or {{the facts of the}} sensibility, are necessary. The facts of reason are also necessary, and reason is no less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone have the characters of imputability and personality. The will alone is the person or Me. The me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is impossible. We find ourselves in a strange world, between two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us, which we apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a light which does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason, and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility which envelops it, and the will which it obliges but does not constrain. Consciousness, then, is composed of these three <b>integrant</b> and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself.|$|E

40|$|We have reconstituted {{integration}} {{reactions in}} vitro with specially designed donor DNAs, a supercoiled plasmid acceptor, purified bacterium-derived Rous sarcoma virus integrase (IN), {{and a host}} cell DNA-bending protein, HMG 1. The duplex donor DNAs are approximately 300 deoxynucleotides in length and contain only 15 bp of the RSV U 3 and U 5 termini at the respective ends. The donor has blunt U 3 and U 5 termini which end with the sequence 5 'CATT. Joining of the donor DNA to the acceptor DNA is detected by using a simple biochemical assay. Integration {{was found to be}} dependent on both U 3 and U 5 termini; mutations in either result in a significant decrease in the level of integration in vitro. Restriction digestion of the products is consistent with most <b>integrants</b> representing a concerted integration in which both long terminal repeat termini come from the same donor molecule. The U 5 and U 3 sequences in the substrate flank a supF tRNA gene, permitting biological selection of <b>integrants.</b> Many <b>integrants</b> have been sequenced, and have all of the hallmarks of authentic viral integration, including the removal of a terminal TT dinucleotide from each donor DNA end, and duplication of acceptor sequences at the integration site without introducing deletions into the acceptor. Target site selection in the acceptor plasmid was random except that the orientation of <b>integrants</b> selected was apparently influenced by supF transcription. Mutations which substituted the conserved CA dinucleotide with a GA pair led to a decreased rate of integration. In 2 of 14 mutant <b>integrants</b> sequenced, deoxynucleotides were deleted from either the U 5 or U 3 terminus. In one instance, an internal CA dinucleotide was used, which resulted in a 10 -bp U 5 donor deletion. In the other, an internal GA dinucleotide was used, which produced a 5 -bp U 3 donor deletion. Both of these <b>integrants</b> provide further evidence that concerted integration in this reconstituted system requires interactions between IN and the U 3 and U 5 termini from the same donor molecule...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in human genome research is to identify the promoter sequences which {{play a key role}} in the regulation of gene expression. We report here a new promoter, trapping system for use with mammalian cells comprised of the following three steps: 1) Cloning of DNA fragments into a promoter-trapping vector, 2) integration of the trapping vector into a designated target in the mammalian genome using the Cre site-specific recombinase, and 3) screening of <b>integrants</b> for trapped promoter sequences by activation of the luciferase gene. To assess the efficiency of this system, lox trapping vectors containing sense tk promoter, antisense tk promoter, or a non-promoter sequence of the neo gene were employed. The resulting levels of luciferase activity of the site-specific <b>integrants</b> were measured directly. Luciferase activity of the <b>integrants</b> can be assayed under conventional culture conditions by simply replacing the culture medium with potassium phosphate buffer containing luciferin. Only those G 418 r colonies carrying the tk promoter in the normal orientation exhibited a 21 - to 35 -fold increase in luciferase activity over that of the other <b>integrants.</b> These results indicate that this system is an effective means of trapping promoter sequences from random mammalian genomic DNA fragments.

60|$|In all {{considerations}} which turn {{upon the}} question of vesting or continuing the state solely and exclusively in some one description of citizens, prudent legislators will consider how far the general form and principles of their commonwealth render it fit to be cast into an oligarchical shape, or to remain always in it. We know {{that the government of}} Ireland (the same as the British) is not in its constitution wholly aristocratical; and as it is not such in its form, so neither is it in its spirit. If it had been inveterately aristocratical, exclusions might be more patiently submitted to. The lot of one plebeian would be the lot of all; and an habitual reverence and admiration of certain families might make the people content to see government wholly in hands to whom it seemed naturally to belong. But our Constitution has a plebeian member, which forms an essential <b>integrant</b> part of it. A plebeian oligarchy is a monster; and no people, not absolutely domestic or predial slaves, will long endure it. The Protestants of Ireland are not alone sufficiently the people to form a democracy; and they are too numerous to answer the ends and purposes of an aristocracy. Admiration, that first source of obedience, can be only the claim or the imposture of the few. I hold it to be absolutely impossible for two millions of plebeians, composing certainly a very clear and decided majority in that class, to become so far in love with six or seven hundred thousand of their fellow-citizens (to all outward appearance plebeians like themselves, and many of them tradesmen, servants, and otherwise inferior to some of them) as to see with satisfaction, or even with patience, an exclusive power vested in them, by which constitutionally they become the absolute masters, and, by the manners derived from their circumstances, must be capable of exercising upon them, daily and hourly, an insulting and vexatious superiority. Neither are the majority of the Irish indemnified (as in some aristocracies) for this state of humiliating vassalage (often inverting the nature of things and relations) by having the lower walks of industry wholly abandoned to them. They are rivalled, to say the least of the matter, in every laborious and lucrative course of life; while every franchise, every honor, every trust, every place, down to the very lowest and least confidential, (besides whole professions,) is reserved for the master caste.|$|E
60|$|Amb.--You, {{like all}} other sceptics, make your own interpretations of the Scriptures {{and set up a}} {{standard}} for divine power in human reason. The infinite and eternal mind, as I said before, fits the doctrines of religion to the minds by which they are to be embraced. I see no improbability in the idea that an <b>integrant</b> part of His essence may have animated a human form; {{there can be no doubt}} that this belief has existed in the human mind, and the belief constitutes the vital part of the religion. We know nothing of the generation of the human being in the ordinary course of nature; how absurd then to attempt to reason upon the acts of the Divine Mind! nor is there more difficulty in imagining the event of a divine conception than of a divine creation. To God the infinite, little and great, as measured by human powers, are equal; a creature of this earth, however humble and insignificant, may have the same weight with millions of superior beings inhabiting higher systems. But I consider all the miraculous parts of our religion as effected by changes in the sensations or ideas of the human mind, and not by physical changes in the order of nature; a man who has to repair a piece of machinery, as a clock, must take it to pieces, and, in fact, re-make it, but to infinite wisdom and power a change in the intellectual state of the human being may be the result of a momentary will, and the mere act of faith may produce the change. How great the powers of imagination are, even in ordinary life, is shown by many striking facts, and nothing seems impossible to this imagination when acted upon by divine influence. To attempt to answer all the objections which may be derived from the want of conformity in the doctrines of Christianity to the usual order of events would be an interminable labour. My first principle is, that religion has nothing to do with the common order of events; it is a pure and divine instinct intended to give results to man which he cannot obtain by the common use of his reason, and which at first view often appear contradictory to it, but which when examined by the most refined tests, and considered in the most extensive and profound relations, are, in fact, in conformity with the most exalted intellectual knowledge, so that, indeed, the results of pure reason ultimately become the same with those of faith--the tree of knowledge is grafted upon the tree of life, and that fruit which brought the fear of death into the world, budding on an immortal stock, becomes the fruit of the promise of immortality.|$|E

40|$|Two {{fundamentally}} different pathways for homologous recombination {{have been identified}} in mammalian cells. For most chromosomal recombination events, two copies of a homologous sequence recombine to yield two copies in the products; such events are said to be conservative because the number of copies is preserved. By contrast, virtually all extrachromosomal recombination events are nonconservative; two copies recombine to give a product containing a single intact copy (the other copy is destroyed in the mechanism). Since gene targeting involves an introduced (extrachromosomal) plasmid and a chromosomal target, it was not clear which pathway would apply. We used a marked vector to determine whether targeted <b>integrants</b> were products of recombination events that involved two copies (the conservative pathway) or three copies (the nonconservative pathway) of the homologous sequence.

Integration {{in this system}} is dependent upon the mini-donor DNA having IN recognition sequences at both ends and upon {{both ends of the}} same donor integrating into the acceptor DNA. The integrated DNA product exhibits all of the features associated with integration of viral DNA in vivo (P. Hindmarsh et al., J. Virol., 73 : 2994 – 3003, 1999). Individual <b>integrants</b> are isolated from bacteria containing drug-resistant markers with amber mutations. This system was used to evaluate the importance of sequences in the terminal U 5 and U 3 long terminal repeats at positions 5 and/or 6, adjacent to the conserved CA dinucleotide.
