25|$|Menard {{returned}} to the 27 for 2014, with the car running schemes more oriented towards the associate sponsors of MENARDS featured on the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Six races prior to the Chase for the Sprint Cup at Indy in July, Menard was involved in an incident with part-time driver Juan Pablo Montoya, sending Menard into the turn 3 wall and relegating him to a 34th-place finish. The incident upset both driver and crew, who felt Montoya had cost them {{a spot in the}} Chase (Menard was dropped to 16th in points). After the fall Richmond race, Menard remained winless and ranked 20th in points, losing out on a spot in the new chase format.|$|E
50|$|The 40-lap {{race was}} stopped four times due to caution, {{including}} a 10-car incident halfway through lap 1 in which, among other things, <b>the</b> <b>hoods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> driven by David Gilliland and Juan Pablo Montoya collided into each other.|$|R

5000|$|On May 14, 2nd Lt. George S. Patton {{raided the}} San Miguelito Ranch, near Rubio, Chihuahua. Patton, a Pershing aide and a future World War II general, was out {{looking to buy}} some corn from the Mexicans when he came across <b>the</b> ranch <b>of</b> Julio Cárdenas, an {{important}} leader in the Villista military organization. With fifteen men and three Dodge touring cars, Patton led America's first motorised military action, in which Cárdenas and two other men were shot dead. The young lieutenant then had the three Mexicans strapped to <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and driven back to General Pershing's headquarters. Patton {{is said to have}} carved three notches into the twin Colt Peacemakers he carried, representing the men he killed that day. General Pershing nicknamed him the [...] "Bandito".|$|R
500|$|Before the [...] "Phantom-attacks", which {{occurred}} about {{eight months after}} World War II, Texarkana was pleasant and citizens were preparing for a good future. On the night of Sunday, March 3, 1946, Sammy Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins park on a lovers' lane. Soon, the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> opens and closes and {{a man with a}} bag over his head with holes cut out for his eyes is seen holding wires he had yanked from the engine. While Sammy tries starting the car, the man breaks his window and pulls him out, cutting him on the broken glass. The man then gets inside the car with Linda.|$|E
2500|$|On November 24, 2000, Madonna {{performed}} the latter songs live on French television program Nulle Part Ailleurs. Madonna then played another concert on November 29, 2000, at Brixton Academy in London. It was shown {{via the internet}} to an estimated record-breaking 9 million viewers across the world. The setlist was the same from the Roseland Ballroom's concert, with the song [...] "Holiday" [...] being added to the setlist. The singer Richard Ashcroft and the Scottish band Texas opened the concert. Madonna then performed [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] on Carràmba! Che fortuna in Italy, on December 2, 2000. On February 21, 2001, she performed [...] "Music" [...] at the 43rd Grammy Awards. For the performance, the stage had five giant video screens, which showed images from her career. Madonna entered onto the stage in a classic Cadillac driven by rapper Bow Wow. The singer emerged {{from the back seat}} of the car in a full-length fur coat and a hat, quickly removing the clothes to reveal a tight leather jacket and jeans. She removed her jacket to reveal a black tank top with the words [...] "Material Girl" [...] printed on it. Host Jon Stewart commented right after, talking about how he was getting older and commenting, [...] "As I was watching Madonna writhing around on the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> all I could think was — that’s really gonna drive up her insurance premiums".|$|E
60|$|They slept {{the chilly}} night through under the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> {{a night of}} {{unbroken}} sleep. It was already high day when he awoke. They {{looked at each other}} and laughed, then looked away, filled with darkness and secrecy. Then they kissed and remembered the magnificence of the night. It was so magnificent, such an inheritance of a universe of dark reality, that they were afraid to seem to remember. They hid away the remembrance and the knowledge.|$|E
50|$|The police {{officers}} who were still on scene, then pulled McGee over. McGee then became combative with the officers, asking “What {{are you going to}} do about it, arrest me?” McGee's statement says he was then pulled from <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> handcuffed, struck with a closed fist on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> his head and then had his head slammed against <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squad <b>car.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built {{so that the}} trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DeLorean. These <b>cars</b> typically had a locking gas cap to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> (although <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with locking gas caps). The final styling for the <b>hood</b> included <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a DeLorean name badge and <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination <b>of</b> gas flap <b>hoods</b> has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|R
50|$|The bank's manager {{walks over}} and, {{thinking}} the note signals an attempted robbery, pushes the alarm button.

5000|$|Meanwhile, the R4 GTL had {{received}} the 1108cc version; the basic model retained its ancient [...] "Billancourt" [...] 845cc engine, but in 1986 the R4 was entirely C-engine powered, the base model receiving the 956cc unit. The new R18, which succeeded the R12, received <b>the</b> 1397cc version <b>of</b> this engine, with a standard cylinder head, and several options for power specifications. It is in this capacity, but now in a transverse position, this unit found its way under <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R9, (<b>car</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year 1982) and its sister R11, then under the Super 5 in 1985.|$|R

50|$|On May 30, 2014, {{only one}} officer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{thirteen}} who fired at <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Michael Brelo, was indicted on {{two counts of}} voluntary manslaughter {{in connection with the}} shooting. He was the only officer who continued to shoot even after the others stopped firing, and was said to have actually moved forward and jumped onto <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims' <b>car,</b> after which he reportedly shot approximately fifteen rounds. <b>The</b> two counts <b>of</b> voluntary manslaughter carried a maximum penalty of 22 years of prison if convicted.

Prosecutors said that the actions were unreasonable and went past his duties as a police officer.|$|R
50|$|A power bulge is {{a raised}} part (a bulge) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> a <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> {{reason for a}} power bulge is to fit, for instance, a large engine or air filters that {{otherwise}} would not fit. Sometimes a power bulge is {{used to be able}} to fit a larger engine into a car that originally was not designed for it or it may be a design choice to be able to get a lower profile. As a power bulge is associated with performance cars, it may also be used as a design element to give <b>the</b> impression <b>of</b> a fast car.|$|R

50|$|For filming, {{the series}} used two {{full-scale}} metal replicas of first generation (1912-16) Stutz Bearcats made by Hollywood car customizer and film car builder George Barris. While externally {{very close to}} <b>the</b> original <b>cars,</b> in fact they were built on custom chassis powered by Ford drivetrains and had modern four wheel brake systems for safety. The two replicas were very similar to one another, however the first built (and the one used for most filming) had a manual 4-speed transmission while the second had an automatic. Additionally, {{there was a slight}} variation in <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horn bulb and the pinstripes on <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>car,</b> so <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> can be differentiated while closely viewing the episodes. In addition to <b>the</b> two <b>cars</b> used in <b>the</b> series, Barris built and retained a third car for use at car shows which differed in many details and color from <b>the</b> TV <b>cars.</b> All three cars survive today, though Barris' display car has been extensively modified. The original Stutz Bearcat automobiles had been manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana; the Stutz factory building still exists but is currently used as an arts and office complex.|$|R
