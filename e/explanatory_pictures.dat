Blegvad wrote [...] "surreal" [...] lyrics that {{were filled with}} [...] "anagrams, palindromes and other verbal games", and {{illustrated}} them with <b>explanatory</b> <b>pictures</b> and diagrams that later appeared on the album's record sleeve, [...] "to be {{used in conjunction with}} the words". Some of the songs on the album are not fully comprehensible without reference to these pictures. At the time Blegvad had begun experimenting with cartooning, an activity that later led to him doing a weekly comic strip for The Independent on Sunday called Leviathan, and he was fascinated with the relationship between text and image.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate how participants self-regulate their access to <b>explanatory</b> <b>pictures</b> that were designed to facilitate learning. Participants learned from two multimedia presentations, one in audio, {{and the other in}} video format. Participants were given the opportunity to ask for an explanatory picture when they felt they needed more information to better understand the text. Recording the requests for pictures assessed self-regulation of strategies that promote picture use. Before completing comprehension questions, participants explained why they asked for pictures and were asked to express their level of awareness of the cognitive processes involved in learning from pictures. Two questionnaires were administered to measure the right/left thinking styles and the spontaneous tendency to use mental images. Results showed that participants, without full awareness, self-regulated their cognitive strategies according to presentation complexity. Judgments of picture utility were internally coherent. Finally, cognitive styles played a minor role in self-regulating learning, but tended to influence the metacognitive awareness of the strategies applied...|$|E
40|$|This thesis project uses various Industrial design {{methods to}} create a concept that will evolve a sandbox into a more {{versatile}} and interesting playing area. By using parts that can {{be attached to the}} frame of the sandbox many different versions can be built to suit different demands and needs. The concept also uses lights and decorated panels to make the sandbox more interesting and visible in today's colorful playgrounds. The project is based on the meaning different stakeholders could have in the product. Research has shown that products made with the help of stakeholders has a better chance to be realized. The findings from research by interviews, fieldtrips and library studies were used as reference when sketching and building sketch-models. Sketching is used both for ideation and for <b>explanatory</b> <b>pictures</b> and has been {{a big part of the}} project. Many of the sketches and photos can be seen in the report and in the attachments...|$|E
40|$|Belief has {{a special}} {{connection}} to truth, a connection not shared by mental states like imagination. One way of capturing this connection is by the claim that belief aims at truth. Normativists argue that we should understand this claim as a normative claim about belief – beliefs ought to be true. A second important connection between belief and truth is revealed by the transparency of belief, i. e. the fact that, when I deliberate about what to believe, I can settle this deliberation only by appeal to considerations I take to show p to be true. It is natural {{to think that there}} is a connection between these two features of belief, that the fact that believing for non-evidential considerations would be irrational can help to explain why it is impossible, and Shah and Velleman make exactly this argument. However, as I shall argue, we cannot explain transparency on the basis of a normative requirement on belief. For this explanation to work non-evidential considerations would have to fail to be reasons for belief, and we would have to be able to explain why we are unable to form beliefs on the basis of non-evidential considerations by appealing to the fact that they fail to be reasons for belief. However, while it is plausible that non-evidential considerations are not in fact reasons for belief, the <b>explanatory</b> <b>picture</b> is the other way around. Such considerations only fail to be reasons for belief because we are unable to form beliefs on their basis...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to further develop and explore the use of an analogical {{teaching}} model I call The Pre-Analogy Step (PAS) —A teaching method to improve learners’ familiarity of the important analogical features in a source analog prior to introducing an analogy for understanding a target domain. This study explores a sample of 24 students (13 boys, and 11 girls) and one teacher’s use of the PAS in a combined third- and fourth-grade class as they participate in an instructional unit on plate tectonics. Interactional analysis using video and statistical analysis of a pre- and post-test were used to answer the following research questions: (1) do students' demonstrate an understanding of the source analog's relational structures during the PAS phases of instruction, (2) do students use relational structures of the source analog to reason about target concepts in plate tectonics, and (3) how do students' ideas about plate tectonics change throughout the unit? Students’ understanding of the source analog’s relational structure at a level of simple relations was indicated by their use of both verbal and gestural modes of representation in their expressed models of the behavior of the source analog. The use of higher order relational structure was evident in addition to one case in which a student developed and used an analogical abstraction in order to reason between target models. Overall student performance between pre- and post-test results improved significantly with a 10 % gain in mean difference (n = 23, p < 0. 05). Improvements on plate tectonic specific items, in which students showed a 15 % significant gain in mean difference (n = 23, p < 0. 005) suggests that the educational unit had a positive influence on students’ ideas about plate tectonics. Taken together as a whole, these findings suggest PAS may be a viable way to help students become more familiar with the relational structure needed to make inferences about the target models presented in this educational unit. Future research on PAS should take into account classroom variables, such as time and pressure, to allow researchers to gain a more <b>explanatory</b> <b>picture</b> of students expressed models...|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the book consists of <b>pictures</b> with accompanying <b>explanatory</b> texts. Each <b>picture</b> displays a hypothetical adaptation that an extinct animal could have possessed, such as a plesiosaur disguised on the seafloor like a decorator crab or something that dinosaurs aren't usually shown doing, such as a sleeping Tyrannosaurus. The texts describe the adaptations or habits and explain why they are plausible. Some of the entries are deliberately made to break a paleoartistic cliché, such as a Tenontosaurus walking alone without a predatory Deinonychus in sight (Tenontosaurus is almost exclusively depicted in dinosaur art as the prey of Deinonychus).|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{production}} {{of all sorts}} of multimedia instructions, educational research has yielded surprisingly few general design principles for instructions in which verbal and visual information are combined. Instructional designers seem to base their design choices more on intuitive ideas than on sound research results. There are however some interesting theories that give guidelines for instructional designers. Mayer (1997) describes in his Generative Theory of Multimedia Learning how the learner builds mental representations of multimedia material. One important step in this process is the integration of both visual and verbal information. Multimedia instruction in its most elementary form consists of a <b>picture</b> with an <b>explanatory</b> text. Because <b>picture</b> and text cannot be perceived simultaneously, the learner is forced to switch {{back and forth between the}} two and integrate them mentally. According to Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988; Sweller, van Merriënboer & Paas, 1998) this integration process is cognitively demanding and at the expense of mental resources that could otherwise be allocated to the learning process. Sweller et al. call th...|$|R
6000|$|I try {{at least}} to recover here, however, some closer {{notation}} of W. J.'s aspects--yet only with the odd effect of my either quite losing him or but apprehending him again at seated play with his pencil under the lamp. When I see him he is intently, though summarily, rapidly drawing, his head critically balanced and his eyebrows working, and when I don't see him it is because I have resignedly relinquished him. I can't have been often for him a deprecated, still less an actively rebuffed suitor, because, as I say again, such aggressions were so little in order for me; but I remember that on my once offering him my company in conditions, those of some planned excursion, in which it wasn't desired, his putting the question of our difference at rest, with the minimum of explanation, by the responsible remark: [...] "I play with boys who curse and swear!" [...] I had sadly to recognise that I didn't, that I couldn't pretend to have come to that yet--and truly, as I look back, either the unadvisedness and inexpertness of my young contemporaries on all that ground must have been complete (an interesting note on our general manners after all,) or my personal failure to grasp must have been. Besides which I wonder scarce less now than I wondered then in just what company my brother's privilege was exercised; though if he had but richly wished to be discouraging he quite succeeded. It wasn't that I mightn't have been drawn to the boys in question, but that I simply wasn't qualified. All boys, I rather found, were difficult to play with--unless it was that they rather found me; but {{who would have been}} so difficult as these? They account but little, moreover, I make out, for W. J.'s eclipses; so that I take refuge easily enough in the memory of my own pursuits, absorbing enough at times to have excluded other views. I also plied the pencil, or to be more exact the pen--even if neither implement critically, rapidly or summarily. I was so often engaged at that period, it strikes me, in literary--or, to be more precise in dramatic, accompanied by pictorial composition--that I must again and again have delightfully lost myself. I had not on any occasion personally succeeded, amid our theatric strife, in reaching the footlights; but how could I have doubted, nevertheless, with our large theatrical experience, of the nature, and of my understanding, of the dramatic form? I sacrificed to it with devotion--by the aid of certain quarto sheets of ruled paper bought in Sixth Avenue for the purpose (my father's store, though I held him a great fancier of the article in general, supplied but the unruled;) grateful in particular for the happy provision by which each fourth page of the folded sheet was left blank. When the drama itself had covered three pages the last one, over which I most laboured, served for the illustration of what I had verbally presented. Every scene had thus its <b>explanatory</b> <b>picture,</b> and as each act--though I am not positively certain I arrived at acts--would have had its vivid climax. Addicted in that degree to fictive evocation, I yet recall, on my part, no practice whatever of narrative prose or any sort of verse. I cherished the [...] "scene"--as I had so vibrated to the idea of it that evening at Linwood; I thought, I lisped, at any rate I composed, in scenes; though how much, or how far, the scenes [...] "came" [...] is another affair. Entrances, exits, the indication of [...] "business," [...] the animation of dialogue, the multiplication of designated characters, were things delightful in themselves--while I panted toward the canvas on which I should fling my figures; which it took me longer to fill than it had taken me to write what went with it, but which had on the other hand something of the interest of the dramatist's casting of his personæ, and must have helped me to believe in the validity of my subject.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the authors}} {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} outstanding science picturebooks as selected by the Japan School Library Association [J-SLA] since 1977. The characteristics of these picturebooks are analysed in terms of four points—subject, aim, content, and scheme—based on an inspection of the picturebooks themselves and of the J-SLA reviewers’ comments on them. The J-SLA selected 235 picturebooks as outstanding picturebooks from the years up to 2012. Among them, 31 were nominated {{in the category of}} ‘knowledge and science picturebooks’. The results are indicated as follows. The most popular subject in the science picturebooks was biology/ecology; accordingly, many books also had content related to living things and the issue of natural environment. This fact suggests that the picturebooks can be expected to foster tender feeling and positive attitudes in children as well as to promote an objective scientific attitude. There are also some science picturebooks that include interesting topics like the history of the Japanese nation, the Japanese Constitution, and issues related to the wars. Thus, the books contained a wide range of historical and political knowledge as well as knowledge of natural environment. Furthermore, many books adopted photographs. This means that photographs may be thought as a direct form to convey the real facts. As well as these, a considerable number of the books contained character-based dialogue, while others adopted narration or report in an <b>explanatory</b> tone. The <b>pictures</b> and the texts tend to exist enhancing each other. These techniques should make the books to become far more approachable by children and lead them to relate to scientific enquiry...|$|R
40|$|New {{learning}} interaction methods through 3 d printing, {{virtual reality}} and augmented reality (collectively {{referred to as}} mixed reality) are becoming possible, with many educators looking to implement these in their classroom. Traditionally, these methods have been prohibitively expensive to educators and complex to implement, leading to more conventional forms of 2 d images and videos to become the educational norm. This is changing through advancements in hardware technology, free game engines and software plugins. Meta analytic studies {{in the use of}} 3 d visualizations show positive improvements in learning outcomes among low and high spatial learners. But often these studies focus only on <b>explanatory</b> words and <b>pictures</b> with less attention to complex learning environments such as interactive visualisations, games 2 ̆ 6 simulations. This workshop builds upon the research experience of The Mixed Reality Research Lab (www. mixedrealityresearch. com), exploring the applied use of mixed reality visualisation pedagogy across three (3) disciplines in Paramedic Science, Anatomical Science and ICT Networking. Demonstrated are several of the applications produced by the lab as case studies, that provide participants with knowledge of how mixed reality is used, how learning analytics can be recorded through mixed reality simulations and how pedagogy and technology can be weaved together to implement a mixed reality and mobile device solution into a classroom for a specific discipline. Participants will explore the use of Unity 3 d game engine technology to visualize virtual and augmented reality simulations and how this can be integrated with databases to record and retrieve data. Participants will leave the workshop with a set of tools/skills for starting their journey into this innovative pedagogical approach to learning...|$|R
