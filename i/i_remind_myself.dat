2500|$|The Riksdag of the Estates {{was well}} aware that queen Louisa Ulrika was {{responsible}} for the attempted coup d'état, and there were discussions as {{how to deal with the}} queens guilt. In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possible with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Arch Bishop and Bishop Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that [...] "she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she {{was responsible for the}} blood of the recently executed". She officially replied the note from the Riksdag with gratitude for the reprimands on the behalf of the good of the nation and herself, and assured [...] "that she had wished no evil upon the Kingdom": Troilius reported that [...] "only God knows if it was said by heart, though one should hope for the best". The Arch Bishop reported, that he observed [...] "tears of rage and sorrow" [...] in her eyes. In private, Louisa Ulrika regarded the reprimand as a humiliating insult, and wrote to her brother Frederick the great, that during the interview she attempted to display [...] "all the coldness, all the contempt possible to make in a demonstration [...] In my hardest moments <b>i</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that I am the sister of Frederick the great", and that she regretted nothing but that her revolution had failed. The king was, in the same time, also had a statement read for him by a delegation from the Riksdag, stating that he would be deposed if such an incident was ever to occur again.|$|E

I have {{climbed to the top}} of a tree by the edge of the playing field, and am looking at my school-fellows and am as proud of myself as a March cock when it crows to its first sunrise. I am saying to myself, [...] "if when I grow up I am as clever among grown-up men as I am among these boys, I shall be a famous man." [...] <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> how they think all the same things and cover the school walls at election times with the opinions their fathers find in the newspapers. <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that I am an artist's son and must take some work as the whole end of life and not think as the others do of becoming well off and living pleasantly. The other picture is of a hotel sitting-room in the Strand, where a man is hunched up over the fire. He is a cousin who has speculated with another cousin's money and has fled from Ireland in danger of arrest. My father has brought us to spend the evening with him, to distract him from the remorse my father knows that he must be suffering.|$|E

60|$|The abeyance, {{not to say}} the desuetude, {{that the}} novella fell into for several centuries is very curious, and fully as {{remarkable}} as the modern rise of the short story. It began to prevail in the dramatic form, for a play is a short story put on the stage; it may have satisfied in that form the early love of it, and it has continued to please in that form; but in its original shape it quite vanished, unless we consider the little studies and sketches and allegories of the Spectator and Tatler and Idler and Rambler and their imitations on the Continent as guises of the novella. The germ of the modern short story may have survived in these, or in the metrical form of the novella which appeared in Chaucer and never wholly disappeared. With Crabbe the novella became as distinctly the short story as it has become in the hands of Miss Wilkins. But it was not till our time that its great merit as a form was felt, for until our time so great work was never done with it. <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> of Boccaccio, and of the Arabian Nights, without the wish to hedge from my bold stand. They are all elemental; compared with some finer modern work which deepens inward immeasurably, they are all of their superficial limits. They amuse, but they do not hold, the mind and stamp it with large and profound impressions.|$|E
6000|$|These {{fears of}} the brave, then, were not {{unfamiliar}} to Scott; but he audaciously disregarded {{all of them in}} the composition of [...] "Guy Mannering." [...] He had just spun his web, like the spider of his simile, he had just taken off his intellectual fields the [...] "scourging crop" [...] of [...] "The Lord of the Isles," [...] he had just received the discouraging news of its comparative failure, when he [...] "buckled to," [...] achieved [...] "Guy Mannering" [...] in six weeks, and published it. Moliere tells us that he wrote [...] "Les Facheux" [...] in a fortnight; and a French critic adds that it reads indeed {{as if it had been}} written in, a fortnight. Perhaps a self-confident censor might venture a similar opinion about [...] "Guy Mannering." [...] It assuredly shows traces of haste; the plot wanders at its own will; and we may believe that the Author often--did not see his own way out of the wood. But there is little harm in that. [...] "If I do not know what is coming next," [...] a modern novelist has remarked, [...] "how can the public know?" [...] Curiosity, at least, is likely to be excited by this happy-go-lucky manner of Scott's. [...] "The worst of it is;" [...] as he wrote to Lady Abercorn about his poems (June 9,1808), [...] "that I am not very good or patient in slow and careful composition; and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> of the drunken man, who could run long after he could not walk." [...] Scott could certainly run very well, though averse to a plodding motion.|$|E
6000|$|I {{reasoned}} with <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>myself</b> of my few former ventures. But the craving to put, if not my shirt, at {{all events}} half a sovereign on [...] "Mrs. Waller" [...] only grew {{the stronger the}} more strongly I battled against it. I felt that if [...] "Mrs. Waller" [...] won and I had nothing on her, I should reproach myself to my dying day.|$|R
60|$|Well, I mean, {{it looked}} as though there was no more to be said.

5000|$|I {{therefore}} {{read the}} draft of my Testament as it was recorded last year, also written during the spiritual exercises - I compared it with the Testament of my great Predecessor and Father, Paul VI, with his sublime testimony {{on the death of}} a Christian and a Pope - and <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>myself</b> of the matters mentioned in {{the draft of}} 6 March 1979, prepared by me (in a somewhat makeshift manner).|$|R
6000|$|... ...Any [...] "news," [...] of the {{from day}} to day kind, would be stale and flat by the time this reaches you--and you know in New York at the moment of my writing, very much what we know of our grounds of anxiety and of hope, grounds of {{proceeding}} and production, moral and material, in every sort and shape. If we only had at this moment the extra million of men that the now so more or less incredible optimism and amiability of our spirit toward Germany, during these last abysmal years, kept knocking the bottom out of our having or preparing, the benefit and the effect would be heavenly to think of. And yet on the other hand I partly console myself for the comparatively awkward and clumsy fact that we are only growing and gathering in that amount of reinforcement now, by the shining light it throws on England's moral position and attitude, her predominantly incurable good-nature, the sublimity or the egregious folly, one scarcely knows which to call it, of her innocence in face of the most prodigiously massed and worked-out intentions of aggression of which [...] "history furnishes an example." [...] So it is that, though the country has become at a bound the hugest workshop of every sort of preparation conceivable, the men have, in the matter of numbers, to be wrought into armies after instead of before--which has always been England's sweet old way, and has in the past managed to suffice. The stuff and the material fortunately, however, are admirable--having had already time to show to what tune they are; and, as I think I wrote your Mother the other day, one feels the resources, alike of character and of material, in the way of men and of every other sort of substance, immense; and so, not consenting to be heaved to and fro by the short view or the news of the moment, one rests one's mind on one or two big general convictions--primarily perhaps that of the certainty that Germany's last apprehension was that of a prolonged war, that it never entered for a moment into the arrogance of her programme, that she has every reason to find such a case ultra-grinding and such a prospect ultra-dismal: whereas nothing else was taken for granted here, as an absolute grim necessity, from the first. But I am writing you remarks quite as I didn't mean to; you have had plenty of these--at least Irving Street has had--before; and what I would a thousand times rather have, is some remarks from there, be they only of an ardent sympathy and participation--as of course whatever else in the world could they be? I am so utterly and passionately enlisted, up to my eyes and over my aged head, in the greatness of our cause, that it fairly sickens me not to find every imagination rise to it: the case--the case of the failure to rise--then seems to me so base and abject an exhibition! And yet <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself,</b> even as I say [it], that the case has never really once happened to me--I have personally not encountered any low likeness of it; and therefore should rather have said that it would so horrifically affect me if it were supposable. England seems to me, at the present time, in so magnificent a position before the world, in respect to the history and logic of her action, that I don't see a grain in the scale of her rightness that doesn't count for attestation of it; and in short it really [...] "makes up" [...] almost for some of the huge horrors that constantly assault our vision, to find one can be on a [...] "side," [...] with all one's weight, that one never supposed likely to be offered one in such perfection, and that has only to be exposed to more and more light, to make one more glory, so to speak, for one's attachment, for one's association.|$|E

[...] "It's hard to tell you how I managed it. [...] When I saw the shaft had me by the coat, [...] I didn't try too long to pull away, [...] Or fumble for my knife to cut away, [...] I just embraced the shaft and rode it out-- [...] Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit. [...] That's how I think I didn't lose my head. [...] But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling." [...] "Awful. Why didn't they throw off the belt [...] Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?"

[...] That must be it. Some days he won't stay on. [...] That day a woman couldn't coax him off. [...] He's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth [...] Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys. [...] Everything goes the same without me there. [...] You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw [...] Caterwaul to the hills around the village [...] As they both bite the wood. It's all our music. [...] One ought as a good villager to like it. [...] No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound, [...] And it's our life." [...] "Yes, when it's not our death." [...] "You make that sound as if it wasn't so [...] With everything. What we live by we die by. [...] I wonder where my lawyer is. His train's in. [...] I want this over with; I'm hot and tired." [...] "You're getting ready to do something foolish." [...] "Watch for him, will you, Will? You let him in. [...] I'd rather Mrs. Corbin didn't know; [...] I've boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me. [...] You're bad enough to manage without her." [...] "And I'm going to be worse instead of better.

[...] "I don't believe you." [...] "I told you, Willis, when you first came in. [...] Don't you be hard on me. I have to take [...] What I can get. You see they have the feet, [...] Which gives them the advantage in the trade. [...] I can't get back the feet in any case." [...] "But your flowers, man, you're selling out your flowers." [...] "Yes, that's one way to put it--all the flowers [...] Of every kind everywhere in this region [...] For the next forty summers--call it forty. [...] But I'm not selling those, I'm giving them, [...] They never earned me so much as one cent: [...] Money can't pay me for the loss of them. [...] No, the five hundred was the sum they named [...] To pay the doctor's bill and tide me over. [...] It's that or fight, and I don't want to fight-- [...] I just want to get settled in my life, [...] Such as it's going to be, and know the worst, [...] Or best--it may not be so bad. The firm [...] Promise me all the shooks I want to nail." [...] "But what about your flora of the valley?" [...] "You have me there. But that--you didn't think [...] That was worth money to me? Still I own [...] It goes against me not to finish it [...] For the friends it might bring me. By the way, [...] I had a letter from Burroughs--did I tell you?-- [...] About my Cyprepedium reginæ; [...] He says it's not reported so far north. [...] There! there's the bell. He's rung. But you go down [...] And bring him up, and don't let Mrs. Corbin.-- [...] Oh, well, we'll soon be through with it. I'm tired." [...] Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer [...] A little barefoot girl who in the noise [...] Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house, [...] And baritone importance of the lawyer, [...] Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands [...] Shyly behind her. [...] "Well, and how is Mister----" [...] The lawyer was already in his satchel [...] As if for papers that might bear the name [...] He hadn't at command. [...] "You must excuse me, [...] I dropped in at the mill and was detained." [...] "Looking round, I suppose," [...] said Willis. [...] "Yes, [...] Well, yes." [...] "Hear anything that might prove useful?" [...] The Broken One saw Anne. [...] "Why, here is Anne. [...] What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed; [...] Tell me what is it?" [...] Anne just wagged her dress [...] With both hands held behind her. [...] "Guess," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, guess which hand? My my! Once on a time [...] I knew a lovely way to tell for certain [...] By looking in the ears. But I forget it. [...] Er, let me see. I think I'll take the right. [...] That's sure to be right even if it's wrong. [...] Come, hold it out. Don't change.--A Ram's Horn orchid! [...] A Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder, [...] If I had chosen left. Hold out the left. [...] Another Ram's Horn! Where did you find those, [...] Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?" [...] Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side, [...] And thought she wouldn't venture on so much. [...] "Were there no others?" [...] "There were four or five. [...] I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all." [...] "I wouldn't--so I wouldn't. You're the girl! [...] You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart." [...] "I wanted there should be some there next year." [...] "Of course you did. You left the rest for seed, [...] And for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl! [...] A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck [...] Sounds something like. Better than farmer's beans [...] To a discriminating appetite, [...] Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had [...] In bushel lots--doesn't come on the market. [...] But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all? [...] You're hiding something. That's as bad as lying. [...] You ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe [...] With a lawyer at hand to find you out. [...] Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne. [...] You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn [...] You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper. [...] What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would. [...] Don't you defend yourself. If it was there, [...] Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?" [...] "Well, wait--it's common--it's too common." [...] "Common? [...] The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner." [...] "I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper [...] To You--to you I mean--they're both too common." [...] The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers [...] As if with some idea that she had scored. [...] "I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets. [...] It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped though: [...] Pressed into service means pressed out of shape. [...] Somehow I'll make it right with her--she'll see. [...] She's going to do my scouting in the field, [...] Over stone walls and all along a wood [...] And by a river bank for water flowers, [...] The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, [...] And at the sinus under water a fist [...] Of little fingers all kept down but one, [...] And that thrust up to blossom in the sun [...] As if to say, 'You! You're the Heart's desire.' [...] Anne has a way with flowers to take the place [...] Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee [...] And lifts their faces by the chin to hers [...] And says their names, and leaves them where they are." [...] The lawyer wore a watch the case of which [...] Was cunningly devised to make a noise [...] Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut [...] At such a time as this. He snapped it now. [...] "Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait. [...] The lawyer man is thinking of his train. [...] He wants to give me lots and lots of money [...] Before he goes, because I hurt myself, [...] And it may take him I don't know how long. [...] But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her: [...] The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup? [...] Just hook them {{on the inside of the}} pitcher. [...] Now run.--Get out your documents! You see [...] I have to keep on the good side of Anne. [...] I'm a great boy to think of number one. [...] And you can't blame me in the place I'm in. [...] Who will take care of my necessities [...] Unless I do?" [...] "A pretty interlude," [...] The lawyer said. [...] "I'm sorry, but my train-- [...] Luckily terms are all agreed upon. [...] You only have to sign your name. Right--there." [...] "You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here [...] Where you can't make them. What is it you want? [...] I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go." [...] "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?" [...] "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. [...] Isn't it something I have seen before?" [...] "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it." [...] "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much [...] In haste to get it over with as you. [...] But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain: [...] Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.-- [...] What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool, [...] You! crumpling folkses legal documents. [...] Out with it if you've any real objection." [...] "Five hundred dollars!" [...] "What would you think right?" [...] "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; [...] You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is [...] Accepting anything before he knows [...] Whether he's ever going to walk again. [...] It smells to me like a dishonest trick." [...] "I think--I think--from what I heard to-day-- [...] And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----" [...] "What did you hear, for instance?" [...] Willis said. [...] "Now the place where the accident occurred----" [...] The Broken One was twisted in his bed. [...] "This is between you two apparently. [...] Where I come in is what I want to know. [...] You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. [...] Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. [...] When you come back, I'll have the papers signed. [...] Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. [...] One of you hold my head up from the pillow." [...] Willis flung off the bed. [...] "I wash my hands-- [...] I'm no match--no, and don't pretend to be----" [...] The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. [...] "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it. [...] We're very sorry for you." [...] Willis sneered: [...] "Who's we?--some stockholders in Boston? [...] I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back." [...] "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. [...] Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage. [...] He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers. [...] You don't know what I mean about the flowers. [...] Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train. [...] Good-bye." [...] He flung his arms around his face.|$|E

In the end, however, no action was taken against her, possible with consideration to foreign powers. On 4 August 1756, a delegation from the Riksdag, led by the Arch Bishop and Bishop Samuel Troilius, presented Louisa Ulrika with an note, which she was made to reply with a letter of regret. The declaration stated that [...] "she had forgotten her duty to God, her consort and the Kingdom of Sweden and that she {{was responsible for the}} blood of the recently executed". She officially replied the note from the Riksdag with gratitude for the reprimands on the behalf of the good of the nation and herself, and assured [...] "that she had wished no evil upon the Kingdom": Troilius reported that [...] "only God knows if it was said by heart, though one should hope for the best".

Albert Einstein A We designed and developed a Collaborative Annotation System for Proteins called DAS Writeback, which extends the Distributed Annotation System (DAS) to provide the func-tionalities of adding, editing and deleting annotations. A great deal of effort has gone into gathering information about proteins over the last few years. By June 2009, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, a curated database, contained over four hundred thousand sequence entries and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, a database with automated annotation, contained over eight million sequence entries. Every protein is annotated with relevant information, which needs to be efficiently captured and made available to other research groups. These include annotations about the structure, the function or the bio...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} constructivist learner roles in acquisitions {{in the secondary}} education chemistry curriculum of the province of Québec / Canada. This research used document analysis as a qualitative research method. According to our findings; the “learner roles” in curriculum correspond with the “student roles” emphasized by the program. We found that these overlaps mostly cohere with “constructive learner roles”. These cohering constructive learner roles are i) the individual takes {{the control of the}} learning process, ii) the individual is selective, constructive and active in the learning process, iii) the individual carries out his/her responsibilities in constructive learning environments,iv) the individual, constructs a meaning in his/her mind for knowledge acquired in the construction process and appropriates that knowledge, v) the individual communicates and discusses issues with other learners and teachers. Moreover, a clue indicating that a History-Technology-Society perspective was used as a background framework for generating the special approaches and goals for science learning has been encountered in the assumption of the constructivist learner roles. This clue is a quote from Albert Einstein: “Every day <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving” This clue can be generalized to  contribution of education programs to teaching programs / the contribution of chemistry program to the educational program...|$|E

However, a quick check in my readings’ memoris made me remember a very significant fact: <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>myself</b> that once the architect Francesco da Giorgio had to submit a project of his to the opinion of a court formed by three people. One {{of them was a}} humanist, a man of letters: Fortunio Spira. The other two members of the court where a remarkable architect named Serlio, and an extremely renowned painter of the same Italian Renaissance: Titian. I thought that if in another time it was considered appropriate to use a man of letters to collaborate on an assessment of architecture, this could be considered a precedent to allow the men of letters of the twentieth century to participate in the debate about the art of drawing and building.
