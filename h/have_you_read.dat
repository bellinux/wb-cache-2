Have you heard about that show? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> or heard about recent newspaper articles to the effect that the local drug problem is bad? Would you try this case {{solely on the basis of}} the evidence presented in this courtroom? Would you be influenced by the circumstances that the prosecutionâ€™s witness, a police officer, has publicly spoken on TV about drugs? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> Meredith's Love in the Valley? It got me, I wept; I {{remembered that}} poetry existed.|$|E
60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> HUCKLEBERRY FINN? It {{contains}} many excellent things; above all, {{the whole story}} of a healthy boy's dealings with his conscience, incredibly well done.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will make}} my excuses to Mademoiselle Lange," [...] she said, trying to smile. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>read,</b> <b>you</b> will {{wish to see}} her alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My son! I <b>have</b> pursued <b>you</b> from {{my grave}} with a {{confession}} which my love might <b>have</b> spared <b>you.</b> <b>Read</b> on, and <b>you</b> will know why.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>read</b> such {{an awful}} lot, Mr. Wrenn! My! Oh, tell me, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>read</b> {{anything}} by Harold Bell Wright or Myrtle Reed, Mr. Wrenn? They write such sweet stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it. And {{to think}} that man got it all out of the poorest little love-story for a respectable titled lady! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Run up and sit awhile with Sister Peace, my dear. She {{likes to}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> while she rests, {{and we are}} going to be busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Well, what of it, madam? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> a very {{interesting}} book by the librarian of the Biological Society suggesting {{that the future of}} the world lies with the Mulatto? ...|$|E
6000|$|... <b>'As</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the [...] "Grace Abounding," [...] you {{are ready}} to say at every step, here is the future author of the [...] "Pilgrim's Progress." [...] It is as if you stood beside some great sculptor, and watched every {{movement}} of his chisel, having seen his design; so that at every blow some new trait of beauty in the future statue comes clearly into view.'[1] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{those that}} get into popular {{circulation}} do deserve {{some of your}} terms for them. Illogical replies break down and carry off some who have pinned their faith to them; but {{are you sure that}} though <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> much, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> deep?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{cultivating}} your Inspiration, {{by getting}} into {{touch with your}} Subconscious. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>read</b> my little book, 'Pipe-Lines to the Infinite'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|TANNER. I have {{no doubt}} that I can trust her to you. What worries me is the idea of trusting you to her. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> Maeterlinck's book about the bee? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{they have}} left us a {{delightful}} store! What's this? Smollett's Don Quixote. I {{always wanted to know}} about that. Is it not something about giants and windmills? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pooh! nonsense, sir! I {{know what}} you are going to say; but we have got beyond all that. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> this, sir? This article on the {{aristocracy}} in [...] "The Screw and Lever Review?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|Lagune {{began to}} look uncomfortable. [...] "Surely," [...] he said, [...] "he <b>has</b> not--Will <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it out--the cheque, the {{counterfoil}} I mean, that I am unable to see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The old gentleman's voice fell, and {{she could}} no longer suspect him of joking. So she began, [...] "Why, what <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been <b>reading</b> last?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No man does. It is {{the crying}} evil of the day, men's selfish {{absorption}} in the present, their utter {{lack of a}} sense of duty with regard to the future. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> my 'Dawn of Better Things'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} you famous, my friend," [...] he declared. [...] "You may quote these words in after life as {{representing}} the full sublimity of my conceit, {{but it is}} true. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> my 'Appreciation' in the Oracle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That she is! Why, {{with her}} I really do like reading and drawing all the morning! I almost {{believe that some}} day I shall wake up and find myself an {{accomplished}} young lady! And, Louis, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the last Western Magazine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a {{question}} to ask you," [...] said Mr. Brock, breaking the silence between them, on his side. [...] "Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> just <b>read</b> that passage in your father's letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What solitary icebergs we are, Miss Vinrace! How {{little we}} can communicate! There {{are lots of}} things I should like to tell you about--to hear your opinion of. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>read</b> Burke?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, I think, there's {{something}} in what Shaw teaches about no moral principles being quite fixed. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>read</b> The Quintessence of Ibsenism? Of course he went very wrong over the war." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> Victor Hugo's 'Contemplations'? We {{are doing}} so at last. As for me, my eyes and my heart melted over them--some of the {{personal}} poems are overcoming in their pathos; and nothing more exquisite in poetry can express deeper pain....|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly, I will; and I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> and write, {{especially}} in Latin, {{when you have}} the chance--good gifts should not be buried. Bethink you, too, that you will not have the same excuse for sin as the rude ignorant men you will meet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In my judgment, the figure," [...] {{said the}} Critic, [...] "is tolerably good, though rather Etrurian, but the {{expression}} of the face is decidedly Tuscan, and therefore false to nature. By the way, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> my work on 'The Fallaciousness of the Aspectual in Art'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{grandfather}} {{will bear}} out my words,' said Sir Gervas. 'But {{to return to}} your reading, I'll warrant {{that there is not}} a page of Scudery and her [...] "Grand Cyrus" [...] which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>read.</b> <b>You</b> are familiar, doubtless, with every sentiment in Cowley, or Waller, or Dryden?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lost! It {{is rather}} {{wonderful}} that, after the lapse of {{two thousand years}} and more, so much should remain. Whichever way I look, signs of these people's origin beset me. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> your Bible, Margery--which I am sorry to say all on this frontier <b>have</b> not--but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> your Bible, and one can make an allusion to you with some satisfaction. Now, {{let me ask you}} if you remember such a thing as the scape-goat of the ancient Jews. It {{is to be found in}} Leviticus, and is one of those mysterious customs with which that extraordinary book is full." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{are three}} infallible ways of {{pleasing}} an author, and [...] the three form a rising scale of compliment: 1--to tell him [...] <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> {{one of his}} books; 2--to tell him <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> [...] all of his books; 3--to ask him to let <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the [...] manuscript of his forthcoming book. No. 1 admits you to his [...] respect; No. 2 admits you to his admiration; No. 3 carries [...] you clear into his heart. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> 'The Phantom Bride'? It 's {{perfectly}} thrilling! There 's {{a regular}} rush {{for it at}} the library; but some prefer 'Breaking a Butterfly.' Which do you like best?" [...] asked a pale girl of Polly, {{in one of the}} momentary lulls which occurred.|$|E
6000|$|We can answer: Whether or not {{it suits}} our {{conception}} of a God of love, it suits Scripture's conception of Him. For nothing is more clear--nay, is it not urged again and again, as a blot on Scripture?--that it reveals a God not merely of love, but of sternness--a God in whose eyes physical pain is not the worst of evils, nor animal life (too often miscalled human life) the most precious of objects--a God who destroys, when it seems fit to Him, and that wholesale, and seemingly without either pity or discrimination, man, woman and child, visiting {{the sins of the}} fathers on the children, making the land empty and bare, and destroying from off it man and beast! This is the God of the Old Testament. And if any say (as is often too rashly said): This is not the God of the New: I answer, but <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> your New Testament? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the latter chapters of St. Matthew? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the opening of the Epistle to the Romans? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the Book of Revelations? If so, will you say that the God of the New Testament is, compared with the God of the Old, less awful, less destructive, and therefore less like the Being--granting always {{that there is such a}} Being--who presides over nature and her destructive powers? It is an awful problem. But the writers of the Bible have faced it valiantly. Physical science is facing it valiantly now. Therefore natural theology may face it likewise. Remember Carlyle's great words about poor Francesca in the Inferno: [...] "Infinite pity, yet also infinite rigour of law. It is so Nature is made. It is so Dante discerned that she was made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "St. George! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> his letter? Is that {{a proper}} letter {{to come from}} a clergyman of the Church of England to--to--to--" [...] the Marquis longed to say to the Marquis of Trowbridge; but he did not dare so to express himself before his son,--"to the {{landlord}} of his parish?" ...|$|E
60|$|I say, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>read</b> the HIGHLAND WIDOW? I {{never had}} till yesterday: I am half inclined, bar a trip or two, {{to think it}} Scott's masterpiece; {{and it has the}} name of a failure! Strange things are readers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] {{said the}} dying {{man with a}} bitter smile,--"because--when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>read</b> them--you--will--go back--to capture--and death!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Once--only once--the {{presence}} of the alien Carol was recognized. Chet Dashaway leaned over and said asthmatically, [...] "Say, uh, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been <b>reading</b> this serial 'Two Out' in Tingling Tales? Corking yarn! Gosh, the fellow that wrote it certainly can sling baseball slang!" ...|$|R
