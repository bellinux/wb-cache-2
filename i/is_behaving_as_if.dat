Cathryn's husband comes home, finding her in complete disarray. Hugh attempts to comfort her, but then he is gone, and she sees a different man who <b>is</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were her husband.

Lamancha had mentioned the name of one of Hannay's old friends, Lombard whom Hannay had long forgotten about. By pure coincidence, Hannay's train carriage mate turned out to be Lombard himself. Following promises to meet later, Lombard disembarks. Afterwards Hannay's son, Peter John receives a vile tempered she hawk from Archie Roylance whom he christens Morag. Hannay takes Peter John shooting on the Hanham Flats in East Anglia. There they meet a strange man who <b>is</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is on the run from something or someone. He says his name is Smith, but Hannay thinks he is Northern European. Hannay then meets Clanroyden who reveals a Chinese jade tablet and tells Hannay about old Haraldsen. Hannay responds with his own tale about Haraldsen also involving Lombard and Peter Pienaar in Rhodesia which involved some villains including Erick Albinus, a Danish American and a City of London bigshot called Aylmer Troth which ended with the gang's arrest and Troth's death. Clanroyden brings old Haraldsen's son to Hannay. Hannay recognized him as [...] "Smith" [...] from the Hanham shooting holiday. Haraldsen is being hounded by villains including Albinus and Aylmer Troth's son, Lancelot and someone called Barralty. Hannay meets Lombard again as well as Macgillivray who does not know much about this gang. Clanroyden suggests Hannay and Haraldsen move up to Laverlaw.|$|E
5000|$|When Manny briefly is {{separated}} from them, Diego and Sid encounter two cheeky opossums named Crash and Eddie who drive them nuts by playing Whac-A-Mole with them. Manny is still worried about being the last mammoth alive and his family, {{who had been killed}} by humans, but is surprised when he encounters Ellie, a female mammoth who believes she is an opossum and Crash and Eddie's adoptive sister. Sid invites her to tag along with the group to escape the flood, and she brings her brothers. After a dangerous encounter with Cretaceous and Maelstrom while crossing a pond, Sid prompts Diego to encourage him to admit and face his fears - Diego insists that [...] "fear is for prey", so Sid points out that Diego <b>is</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is the water's prey. They discover an area which Ellie recalls as the place where she was adopted. She finally realizes she is a mammoth and also expresses her suspicions about how different she was from other opossums. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests [...] "saving their species". Ellie and Manny ultimately make up when they must co-operate to save the group when the ground cracks under their feet. Sid is kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths who believe Sid to be a god. Sid lights a fire for them, and believes that he has finally found respect, but they plan to sacrifice him by tossing him into a volcano. Sid narrowly escapes. The next morning, Sid tells the others his experience but none are convinced. They find a field of hot geysers, which separate Manny, Sid, and Diego from Ellie and her brothers when they argue about which way to go through it.|$|E

30|$|Shared {{cultural}} knowledge: {{the information}} in the relative clauses can also be “hearer-old” (Prince 1992 : 301) or “copresent” (Clark and Marshall 1981 : 38), which means that the information is considered old with respect to the text producer’s assumptions about what the hearer already knows (Prince 1992 : 301). To put this into context, it is necessary to consider the kind of texts being analysed here, as well as the assumed readership. The texts are opinion pieces from the British broadsheet newspaper, The Guardian. They are about a specific, well-known, entity in a particular field of discourse. We can assume that readers of such articles have an interest in the particular entity being discussed and are familiar with the field of discourse, and therefore have some previous, culturally-shared knowledge about the thing (or at the very least, the writer <b>is</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they do). Thus, the connection is outside the text, in the broader field of discourse, but nevertheless helps add to the overall cohesion which ties the attributes in the RRCs to the specific participant in the text (c.f. co-reference and co-classification, which are not considered cohesive if they occur outside the text (Halliday and Hasan 1976)).|$|E
40|$|As Egypt {{approaches}} {{the fifth anniversary}} of its 2011 uprising, one would be forgiven for assuming that a major challenge to the regime of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was gathering coherence and force, based upon its panicked and paranoid current actions. But such a conclusion would be misplaced. The regime's overblown fears of a largely neutered opposition raise a pertinent question: What is driving the Egyptian security establishment's overbroad and suffocating repression? The run-up to January 25 has seen a major crackdown that has included arrests, disappearances, random searches (including random surveillance of social media accounts), the shuttering of nonpolitical cultural fora, such as art galleries, and a heightening of visa monitoring for foreigners. For this upcoming symbolic date, the regime will not be caught unaware and flat-footed [...] it believes that the mistakes of 2011 will not be repeated any time soon. Speaking to Reuters, an official at Egypt's Homeland Security Agency explained the state's motivations for the crackdown quite bluntly, stating that "We have taken several measures to ensure activists don't have breathing space and are unable to gather, and several cafes and other meeting places have been closed, while some have been arrested in order to scare the rest. " Whereas late 2010 was marked by creeping dissatisfaction, increasing boldness, and stepped-up organizational efforts among opposition actors, there are no corollaries in today's Egypt. While the government continues to fare poorly in terms of overall performance, political life is stunted by fear and fragmentation, and there are few avenues that allow for the amplification of dissatisfaction into a broad-based challenge to the regime. Opposition forces are fragmented and intimidated, while the regime, the state, and social elites retain a baseline of cohesion, and domestic and regional instability have produced quiescence in some sectors of society. It is clear that 2016 will not be the year of the next Egyptian uprising, let alone revolution. Yet, despite indications that, for the time being, the regime is safe from any popular threat, it <b>is</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it faces an imminent challenge. Its actions reveal a deeply ingrained worldview in which even minor forms of dissent and nonconformity are no longer permissible...|$|E

40|$|Research {{assistance}} {{was provided by}} Jennifer Holleran. I am greateful for suggestions provided by Ray Fair. The extraordinary performance in the U. S. stock market {{in the latter half}} of the 1990 ’s has produced record gains in university endowments. In 1998, for example, the five hundred colleges and universities followed by the Chronicle of Higher Education earned average returns of 18 %; in 1999, the figure was down slightly at 11 %, but still substantial relative to historical norms. (Chronicle, 8 / 24 / 2000). These gains have stimulated considerable discussion on university finances, including debates on spending rates, tuition levels, faculty compensation and the like. Hansmann (1998), for example, argues that, in the face of these extraordinary returns, university spending rates are far too low and, indeed, that universities <b>are</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> their central object is to run investment funds, while operating academic programs on the side. Similarly, Altshuler (2000) argues for using endowment gains for increased spending on academic programs and faculty salaries as a way to turn financial capital into intellectual capital for the university. At some universities, these endowment gains have created pressures for moderation in tuition increases; Williams in 2000 held tuition constant in response to thei...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} {{usability}} engineering for virtual environments (VEs) {{is complicated by the}} fact that the worlds and tasks are often quite open ended and that the experience is real-time. In particular, with immersive virtual environments (IVEs), the simulation is designed and engineered so that the participant experiences presence in a place other than where they are physically related. In such environments there is often not a single task and the simulations have to be built to encompass a wide range of possible participant behaviours. Informally, our observations of participants in such simulation show that sometimes they <b>are</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the simulation <b>was</b> real, and at other times they are responding to some aspect of the technology. Slater & Steed (2000) introduced the Breaks in Presence (BIP) model which was used as a way of identifying changes (breaks) from the virtual to the real. They constructed a model that could be used to measure presence from the number of BIPs. In this paper we propose studying the BIPs themselves and treating them as events for usability analysis. In a pilot trial we show that by recording the participants experience and then replaying it with a visualization of the occurrence of BIPs experimenters can start to identify aspects of the VE that might need attention and refinement. ...|$|R

40|$|This article studies {{a market}} game under {{uncertainty}} in which agents may submit multiple limit and market orders. When agents know their preferences at all states, the competitive equilibrium can be supported as a Nash equilibrium {{of the market}} game, that <b>is,</b> agents <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they <b>were</b> price takers. Therefore, if the associated competitive economy has a fully revealing rational expectations equilibrium, then so does the market game. This resolves the puzzle that agents <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> prices <b>were</b> given, even though prices aggregate private information, at least for this “private values” case. Necessary conditions for Nash equilibrium show that the resulting allocation cannot deviate too far from a competitive equilibrium. When agents do not know their preferences at some states, though, a characterization result shows that the Nash equilibria of the market game tend to be far from competitive.

40|$|The {{accepted}} {{approach to}} capital budgeting leaves decision makers without appropriate guidance because it ignores the cognitive, organizational, and institutional dimensions of their decision-making process. This approach {{is based upon}} the unrealistic assumptions of neoclassical finance, where investors are assumed to <b>be</b> (or <b>behave</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they <b>were)</b> fully rational and informed. This chapter explores the opportunity to analyze capital budgeting decisions within a more realistic context. To reach such an objective, it summarizes alternative perspectives addressing these specific dimensions: the cognitive, the organizational, and the institutional. All together, such dimensions suggest generalizing the current approach based on discounted cash flow analysis to provide decision makers with alternative ways to assess investment opportunities under more realistic approaches driven by behavioral and institutional finance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Since Spallanzini first {{described}} salamander limb regeneration in 1769, {{there has been}} slow prog-ress in understanding this process. Potential treatment benefits from regeneration are worth the effort. A hypothesis that topical iodine would regenerate human scar tissue is tested by applying Lugol’s solution to four scars of various sizes, degree of damage, and location for variable lengths of time. Regeneration starts {{a few days after}} applying iodine and stops and forms adult scar if applications are discontinued. One face scar has completely regenerated. The wrist scar’s terminal stages are being studied. The remaining two scars on the abdomen <b>are</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they <b>are</b> one and could take considerably longer to complete. Waiting for completion delays availability of this information for scientists, physicians, and patients. For the past three years, Nikon Cool Pix cameras recorded regeneration changes. Regenate material found under plastic wraps on the scars comes in two forms, snow-like and globular. Their function is unknown. Two black dots both 5 mm apart seen on the wrist and abdominal scar store iodine and appear to coordinate regen-eration. Hair is the regeneration workhorse and does an amazing number of things. Amongst the hair activities are free movement to any cell within its range in any direction and self-amputation possibly to strengthen re-generating tissue. Hair delivers regenate material and may be sending cell signals by touch, regenate material, and electrical impulses. The hypothesis that topical iodine in the form of Lugol’s solution regenerates human scar tissue back to normal is supported by these preliminary findings...|$|R
