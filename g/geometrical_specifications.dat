The verb to blazon means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag traditionally has considerable latitude in design, while a blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements; thus {{it can be said}} that a coat of arms or flag is primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though often flags are in modern usage additionally and more precisely defined using <b>geometrical</b> <b>specifications).</b> Blazon also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax, or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms.|$|E

Geometric specification usage, in particular, has many manufacturing and durability implications, the feasibility of their measurement and verification, however, is often neglected {{and the influence of}} measurement uncertainty in their evaluation underestimated. Often <b>geometrical</b> <b>specifications</b> are defined without considering measurement uncertainties, or measurability at all: {{it is not uncommon to}} find approved specifications prescribing unverifiable geometry, or dimension tolerances that exceed state-of-art measurements. This article explores the case study of orthogonality between a circular hole and the plane on which it is drilled, evaluated using a Coordinate Measuring Machine. Such specification is defined, according to ISO 14253, as the angle between the plane normal and cylinder axis. Uncertainty of points coordinates obtained can, however small, play a key role in the final evaluation of orthogonality: if the specified tolerance is thigh enough it is also possible to have misalignment uncertainty higher than the tolerance itself. The authors propose the results of a mathematical and numerical model, meant to help the designer to define specification to assess the relationship between cylinder-plane misalignment measurability, CMM uncertainty and features dimensions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCylindricity {{specification}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important <b>geometrical</b> <b>specifications</b> in geometrical product development. This specification can be referenced from the rules and examples in tolerance standards and technical handbooks in practice. These rules and examples are described in the form of natural language, which may cause ambiguities since different designers may have different understandings on a rule or an example. To address the ambiguous problem, a categorical data model of cylindricity specification in the next-generation Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) was proposed at the University of Huddersfield. The modeling language used in the categorical data model is category language. Even though category language can develop a syntactically correct data model, it is difficult to interpret the semantics of the cylindricity specification explicitly. This paper proposes an ontology-based approach to interpret the semantics of cylindricity specification on the basis of the categorical data model. A scheme for translating the category language to the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) is presented in this approach. Through such a scheme, the categorical data model is translated into a semantically enriched model, i. e. an OWL 2 ontology for cylindricity specification. This ontology can interpret the semantics of cylindricity specification explicitly. As the benefits of such semantic interpretation, consistency checking, inference procedures and semantic queries can be performed on the OWL 2 ontology. The proposed approach could be easily extended to support the semantic interpretations of other kinds of <b>geometrical</b> <b>specifications...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{presents}} a new method for digitalization of parts with non-contact sensor remains nevertheless complex. It is not completely solved today, in particular from a metrological point of view. In this article, we consider {{the determination of the}} trajectory planning {{within the framework of the}} control of dimensional and <b>geometrical</b> <b>specifications.</b> The sensor used in this application is a laser planner scanner with CCD camera oriented and moved by a CMM. Thus, we seek to determine which are the best possible orientations of the sensor with respect to the <b>geometrical</b> <b>specifications</b> of the measured part, giving the admissible measurement uncertainties. The developed method is based on the concept of visibility. It is declined in successive steps. The first defines the concept of local laser visibility: potential whole of the directions of emission of the laser beam, which reach a particular facet of the part. The directions are constrained by measurement uncertainties depending to the incidence angle between the laser plane (, ) and the measured surface. The second guarantees that a visible facet in certain directions is not hidden by another portion of the part. So this step constitutes the global laser visibility. Lastly, this same facet lit by the laser must also be visible by the camera. The third step thus deals with this problem of screening and determines the chart of real visibility associated to the facet concerned. So, we can generate a 3 D map with a set of viewpoints obtained with an optimal distance d in respect to the admissible uncertainties, which permits to cover all the part. This set of viewpoints will be used to propose finally the best scanning path for three-dimensional parts inspection. Some examples illustrate the developed approach...|$|E
40|$|Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) is a {{technical}} language which covers the standardization for micro/macro- geometry specifications. In today’s environment of globalization, out-sourcing and sub-contracting is increasing. <b>Geometrical</b> <b>specifications</b> {{of a product}} need to be detailed to a degree where nothing is left open to interpretation. To fulfil this, and {{to meet the requirements}} of digital manufacturing, it is necessary to integrate the design and inspection process of a geometrical specification. At the technical level, many functional operator/operations are employed in a geometrical specification. These functional operators/operations are based on rigorous mathematics, and they are intricately related and inconvenient to be used directly. Consequently, it is of practical utility to build an integrated information system to encapsulate and manage the information involved in GPS. This thesis focuses on geometrical tolerancing, including form/orientation/ location tolerancing, and its integrated geometry information system. The main contributions are: Firstly, a global data expression for modelling the integration between the design and inspection process of a geometrical tolerance is presented based on category theory. The categorical data model represents, stores and manipulates all the elements and their relationships involved in design and inspection process of a geometrical tolerance, by categories, objects and morphisms, flexibly; the relationships between objects were refined by pull back structures; and the manipulations of the model such as query and closure of query are realized successfully by functor structures in category theory. Secondly, different categories of knowledge rules have been established to enhance the rationality and the intellectuality of the integrated geometry information system, such as the rules for the application of geometrical requirement, tolerance type, datum and datum reference framework and, for the refinement among <b>geometrical</b> <b>specifications.</b> Finally, the host system for drawing indication of geometrical tolerances in the framework of GPS was established based on AutoCAD 2007 using ObjectARX.
