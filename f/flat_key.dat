The “eighth sharp” {{is placed on the}} F, to make it F. The key of D, with nine sharps, has another sharp placed on the C, making it C. The same is true for key signatures with flats; The key of E (four sharps) is equivalent to the key of F (again, one fifth below the key of C, following the pattern of <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> signatures). The last flat is placed on the B, making it B.|$|E
25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E

50|$|The numbers {{inside the}} circle show {{the number of}} sharps or <b>flats</b> in the <b>key</b> signature, with the sharp keys going clockwise, and the <b>flat</b> <b>keys</b> {{counterclockwise}} from C major (which has no sharps or flats.) The circular arrangement depends on enharmonic relationships in the circle, usually reckoned at six sharps or flats for the major keys of F = G and D = E for minor keys. Seven sharps or <b>flats</b> make major <b>keys</b> (C major or C major) {{that may be more}} conveniently spelled with five flats or sharps (as D major or B major).|$|R

50|$|One {{potential}} pitfall {{in discussing}} these works is labeling them as atonal {{on the basis}} of hearing strange sonorities at the surface of the music. The Csárdás macabre, for instance, is solidly based on compositional procedures consistent with Liszt's earlier style. The music focuses on variant forms of the mediant with concomitant contrast of sharp and <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> areas—in this case F major, F-sharp minor and G-flat major.|$|E
50|$|The Full Boehm system {{clarinet}} is {{the only}} extensively accepted modification of Klosé and Buffet's 1843 design, though its added complexity, weight, and cost have kept it from supplanting the latter altogether. It features four improvements creating an even more streamlined fingering system. The first improvement was to include a seventh ring on the instrument; adding a cross-fingered E flat’/B flat’’ to the range, much {{like that of the}} modern saxophone. Next, an articulated C sharp’/G sharp’’ key was added; permitting a B/C sharp’ and F sharp’’/G sharp’’ trill to be made in nearly perfect pitch with a much simpler fingering pattern. A low E <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> was also added because it is a note that did not exist on previous clarinets and it is required by some composers. The addition of the E <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> is also convenient when A clarinet parts must be transposed at sight on the B flat instrument, so that the former's lowest note, (written) E (often called for because it is part of any clarinet system's practical range) may be played on the latter as (written) E flat. Finally, an alternate A flat/E flat’’ key for the left hand fourth finger was added, allowing more efficient fingering of certain passages.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the wafer tumbler lock in the United States is the patent in 1868 by Philo Felter. Manufactured in Cazenovia, New York, it used a <b>flat</b> double-bitted <b>key.</b> Felter's lock was patented only three years after Linus Yale, Jr. received a patent for his revolutionary pin tumbler mortise lock, {{considered to be the}} first pin tumbler lock of the modern era. That lock featured a <b>flat</b> steel <b>key,</b> referred to as a [...] "feather key" [...] because of the marked contrast with the heavy bit keys of the day. Just two years later, Hiram S. Shepardson produced a different type of wafer tumbler lock, which used a single-bitted <b>flat</b> steel <b>key,</b> similar to Yale's feather key.|$|R

5000|$|Liszt's {{original}} {{idea was to}} write 24 études, one {{in each of the}} 24 major and minor keys. He completed only half of this project, using the neutral and <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> signatures. In 1897-1905 the Russian composer Sergei Lyapunov wrote his own set of Douze études d'exécution transcendante, Op. 11, choosing only those keys that Liszt had omitted, namely the sharp keys, to [...] "complete" [...] the full set of 24. Lyapunov's set of études was dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and the final étude was titled Élégie en mémoire de Franz Liszt.|$|E
5000|$|Key cutting (after cutting, the {{metalworking}} {{term for}} [...] "shaping by removing material") {{is the primary}} method of key duplication: a <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> is fitted into a vise in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise, and the original key is moved along a guide, while the blank is moved against a wheel, which cuts it. After cutting, the new key is deburred: scrubbed with a metal brush to remove burrs, small pieces of metal remaining on the key, which, were they not removed, would be dangerously sharp and, further, foul locks.|$|E
50|$|After C {{comes the}} key of G (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically {{equivalent}} to {{the key of}} A). The “eighth sharp” {{is placed on the}} F, to make it F. The key of D, with nine sharps, has another sharp placed on the C, making it C. The same is true for key signatures with flats; The key of E (four sharps) is equivalent to the key of F (again, one fifth below the key of C, following the pattern of <b>flat</b> <b>key</b> signatures). The last flat is placed on the B, making it B.|$|E
50|$|In {{the above}} progression, key C (with seven sharps) {{may be more}} {{conveniently}} written as the harmonically equivalent key D (with five flats), and likewise C (with seven flats) written as B (with five sharps). Nonetheless, {{it is possible to}} extend the order of sharp keys yet further, through C→G→D→A→E→B→F→C, adding the double-sharped notes F, C, G, D, A, E and finally B, and similarly for the <b>flat</b> <b>keys,</b> but with progressively decreasing convenience and usage.|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of certain keys with specific moods {{continues to be}} widespread despite technical evidence that all equally tempered keys are identical. This paper provides experimental results which shed light on this phenomenon. First, approximately three-quarters of participants questioned claimed to have key-mood associations. Second, the key-mood associations held by participants showed a very strong correlation to late eighteenth century associations which attributed brightness to keys with sharps in their key signature and mellowness to those with flats. Third, key-mood associations were proven to be invalid for the modern, equal temperament keyboard; the participants showed no ability {{to be able to}} identify mood from key or key from mood and, overall, there was no change in perceived mood of a piece if it was performed in a different key. One reason why the key-mood association myth persists to the present day is the tradition of associating sharp keys With bright and positive moods and <b>flat</b> <b>keys</b> with dark and negative moods, which has been perpetuated by some musical commentators over the past two hundred ·years. In addition, {{there are a number of}} aspects of early musical training which encourage these associations for the sharp and <b>flat</b> <b>keys...</b>|$|R
50|$|Once his bravura style on the {{modified}} flute had become accepted in London, he licensed several London flute makers such as Clementi & Co., Astor, Rudall and Rose, and Potter {{to produce the}} 'Nicholson's Improved'.

The song implies that the newborn will meet the same fate, continuing {{the cycle of poverty}} and violence.

5000|$|The key {{signatures}} {{with seven}} flats (...) and seven sharps (...) are rarely used {{because they have}} simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of C major (seven sharps) is more simply represented as D major (five flats).
