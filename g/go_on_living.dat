25|$|This passage {{has been}} {{translated}} by some fans {{to mean that}} one ceases to live if one's body is damaged {{to the extent that}} it cannot be repaired. However, in Tik-Tok of Oz Baum suggested that Oz people could <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> after being eaten and digested, and also that Nomes would continue to live after being cut into tiny pieces, which disproves the destruction theory.|$|E
25|$|Heather died in 1943, and in 1944 Willis {{gave up the}} {{ownership}} of the school, which was transferred to a public body. She retired as headmistress in 1946, but intended to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> at Hill House, which had been built {{for her in the}} school's grounds. This led to her chosen successor moving to another school, and Willis decided to divide her time between Hill House and a second home at 38, Tedworth Square, Chelsea, London SW3. She kept up with old pupils and continued her interests in the Bermondsey Time and Talents Settlement and in the Girl Guides movement.|$|E

25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E
25|$|They {{find that}} a large party has {{assembled}} at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyschenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large red-sealed envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay {{is a series of}} verbose psychological observations on the subject of his own approaching death, written in a defiant, self-conscious style, and culminating in the announcement that, rather than <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> for a few more weeks, he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end, the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, is bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out, to the great amusement of some, that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually, he falls asleep and the party disperses.|$|E
500|$|According to Amy Lee, [...] "Going Under" [...] {{is about}} a {{previous}} emotionally [...] and physically damaging relationship: [...] "And when you're {{at the end of}} your rope, when you're at the point where you realize something has to change, that you can't <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> in the situation that you're in. It's cool. It's a very strong song." [...] "Going Under" [...] was Fallen second single. [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] is a nu metal-rap rock song written in common time and performed at a moderate tempo (96 beats per minute). Written by Lee, Ben Moody, and David Hodges, the song was conceived when an acquaintance asked Lee in a restaurant if she was happy in her current relationship. When Lee realized that she was not, the lyrics [...] "wake me up inside" [...] were inspired. The singer confirmed that the song was about longtime friend Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly decent! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see her... She must marry—She & I can't possibly <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her! ...|$|E
500|$|Many of Potter's tales {{appealed to}} girls, but Mr. Tod {{had a strong}} {{following}} among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight {{at the end of}} the book accompanied by [...] "dreadful bad language". Six-year-old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:I am sorry to tell you they are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight [...] Mr. Tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of his brush [...] and five bad bites, especially one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock [...] he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet bundled up in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock ate them. He is a nasty person. He will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> in Mr. Tod's comfortable house till springtime [...] then he will move off into the woods & live out doors [...] and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously [...] & there will need to be a big spring cleaning!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The ban {{on private}} {{holdings}} ruined peasant life {{at its most}} basic level, according to Mirsky.

I can't <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living.</b> I have lost all trust in God. All my life I've tried to strive for the truth, and must admit today at the end of the road that there is nothing but disappointment.

2500|$|In All in the Family, Rob Reiner {{often did}} imitations of Groucho, and Sally Struthers dressed as Harpo in one episode {{in which she}} (as Gloria Stivic) and Rob (as Mike Stivic) were going to a Marx Brothers film festival, with Reiner {{dressing}} as Groucho. Gabe Kaplan did many Groucho imitations on his sit-com Welcome Back, Kotter and Robert Hegyes sometimes imitated both Chico and Harpo on the show. In Woody Allen's film Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Woody's character, after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, is inspired to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>living</b> after seeing a revival showing of Duck Soup.

He also recalls the maturation and dignity of Concetta—who, he realizes, is the true heir of what was noble and enduring of the Salina family.
