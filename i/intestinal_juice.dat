Microencapsulated B. longum with E. americana and oligosaccharide extract prepared by the extrusion technique survived better than that by the emulsion technique under adverse conditions. Survival of microencapsulated cells after exposure to the juices and refrigeration storage was higher than free cells at Weeks 2 and 4.

40|$|Abstract: Four pet chew treats {{from four}} {{different}} manufacturers were tested for digestibility using in vitro tests in artificial gastric (stomach) and <b>intestinal</b> <b>juices.</b> In vitro tests {{were selected to}} determine the digestibility of dog chews for humane reasons and were conducted under conditions that were designed to simulate the digestive system of dogs. The purpose of the tests was to rapidly and inexpensively determines the rate of degradation of a dog chew in the canine digestive tract to assess product safety for dogs. Dog chew pet treats that are swallowed whole, or in part, should degrade rapidly in the canine digestive system to prevent potentially dangerous blockage. Tests were conducted on one cm and one-half cm cubes of dog chew products. Results of the tests clearly indicated that one product outperformed all others in short-term (under 4 hrs) digestive tests. The Bone-A-Mint Wheat Free formula degraded more rapidly than all other products in tests simulating canine gastric and <b>intestinal</b> <b>juices.</b> Tests conducted in this study will {{form the basis of}} an in vitro procedure that can be used as an industry standard to asses the safety of pet chew treats...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been carried out to {{elucidate}} the causes of the low oral bioavailability of amoxicillin in rats. The hepatic first-pass effect of the antibiotic was estimated by comparing the area under the plasma drug concentration-versus-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0 -infinity) obtained after injecting the drug into a mesenteric vein with the AUC 0 -infinity value obtained after injecting the drug into the jugular vein of conscious rats. No hepatic first-pass effect was detected. The bioavailability of amoxicillin after intraduodenal administration was only 51 %, and the fraction of the dose remaining in the intestine {{at the end of the}} experiment was 4. 5 %. This was far less than the fraction that did not reach systemic circulation, which indicates a presystemic loss of drug, probably at the intestine. In vitro studies corroborated the fact that amoxicillin is subjected to presystemic degradation by <b>intestinal</b> <b>juices</b> and <b>intestinal</b> tissues. The greatest loss of drug occurred in the complete intestine (45 % of the initial amount), and it was mainly due to the action of intestinal tissues (28 % of the initial amount) but was also due to the action of <b>intestinal</b> <b>juices</b> (15 % of the initial amount). The absorption of amoxicillin in three parts of the intestine (upper, middle, and lower) was also evaluated. The largest AUC 0 -infinity value and the highest plasma drug levels were obtained when amoxicillin absorption took place in the middle intestine. The smallest AUC 0 -infinity value and the lowest plasma drug levels corresponded to absorption from the upper intestine...|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{degradation}} of cefetamet pivoxil (CAT), cefuroxime axetil (CAE), and cefpodoxime proxetil (CPD) in 0. 6 M phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) and human <b>intestinal</b> <b>juice</b> (pH 7. 4) at 37 °C over 24 h were compared. Significant {{differences in the}} time courses of degradation and in the patterns of degradation products were observed. (i) The relative proportions of the Δ 2 - and Δ 3 -cephalosporins were roughly reversed in the two incubation media. In phosphate buffer, the major degradation product was the Δ 2 -cephalosporin (CAT = 61 %; CAE = 74 %; CPD = 85 %), while in <b>intestinal</b> <b>juice</b> it was the Δ 3 -cephalosporin (CAT = 86 %; CAE = 75 %; CPD = 87 %). (ii) Generally, the degradation of the prodrug esters progressed faster in <b>intestinal</b> <b>juice</b> than in phosphate buffer (e. g., for CAT the half-lives [t 1 / 2 s] were 0. 78 and 4. 3 h, respectively). (iii) The two diastereoisomers of CAE and CPD were degraded at different rates in <b>intestinal</b> <b>juice</b> (for the CAE diasteroisomers, t 1 / 2 s = 0. 37 and 0. 93 h; for the CPD diastereoisomers, t 1 / 2 s = 0. 18 and 0. 98 h) but were degraded at similar rates in phosphate buffer (for the CAE diastereoisomers, t 1 / 2 = 1. 6 h; for the CPD t 1 / 2 diastereoisomers, = 2. 2 h). It is concluded that (i) the Δ 2 isomerization does not significantly affect the bioavailability of prodrug esters since enzymatic hydrolysis in the intestinal fluid proceeds mainly to the active Δ 3 -cephalosporin and (ii) {{the high degree of}} stereoselectivity of the enzymatic ester hydrolysis should make it possible to increase the bioavailabilities of certain prodrug esters (CAE, CPD) by using the more stable diasterioisomer...|$|E

The oral toxicity may depend mostly on the stability of toxin molecules in the stomach and, to a less extent, in the intestine.

40|$|Clostridium botulinum type C {{progenitor}} toxins {{of different}} molecule sizes, C-L (16 S) and C-M (12 S), were purified from cultures of strains 573, Stockholm, and CB- 19. C-L toxin showed some hemaggglutinin activity, whereas C-M toxin did not. Neither C-L nor C-M toxin was activated upon trypsinization. Molecular dissociation of purified type C-L and C-M toxins into toxic and nontoxic components was demonstrated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex chromatography at pH 8. 0. The molecular construction of type C progenitor toxin {{appears to be}} analogous to that reported for botulinum toxins of other types. C-L and D-L toxins showed higher oral toxicities to mice than did C-M or D-M toxin.

Here we evaluated the stability, bioavailability, and hypersensitivity of D 12 -PGJ 3. The stability of D 12 -PGJ 3 was evaluated under simulated conditions using artificial gastric and <b>intestinal</b> <b>juice.</b> The bioavailability of D 12 -PGJ 3 in systemic circulation was demonstrated upon intraperitoneal injection into mice by LC-MS/MS. D 12 -PGJ 3 being a downstream metabolite of PGD 3 was tested in vitro using primary mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and in vivo mouse models for airway hypersensitivity. ZK 118182, a synthetic PG analog with potent PGD 2 receptor (DP) -agonist activity and a drug candidate in current clinical trials, was used for toxicological comparison. D 12 -PGJ 3 was relatively more stable in simulated gastric juice than in simulated <b>intestinal</b> <b>juice</b> that followed first-order kinetics of degradation. Intraperitoneal injection into mice revealed that D 12 -PGJ 3 was bioavailable and well absorbed into systemic circulation with a Cmax of 263 mg/L at 12 h. Treatment of BMMCs with ZK 118182 for 12 h resulted in increased production of histamine, while D 12 -PGJ 3 did not induce degranulation in BMMCs nor increase histamine.
