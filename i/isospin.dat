5|$|The {{following}} table {{summarizes the}} key {{properties of the}} six quarks. Flavor quantum numbers (<b>isospin</b> (I3), charm (C), strangeness (S, {{not to be confused}} with spin), topness (T), and bottomness (B′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The baryon number (B) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (Q) and all flavor quantum numbers (B, I3, C, S, T, and B′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (J; equal to spin for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to promote <b>isospin</b> from a global to a local symmetry. In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills {{suggested}} that the notion of protons and neutrons, which are continuously rotated into each other by <b>isospin,</b> should be allowed to vary from point to point. To describe this, the proton and neutron direction in <b>isospin</b> space must be defined at every point, giving local basis for <b>isospin.</b> A gauge connection would then describe how to transform <b>isospin</b> along a path between two points.|$|E
40|$|We perform full {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) numerical relaxations of <b>isospinning</b> soliton {{solutions in}} the baby Skyrme model in which the global O(3) symmetry is broken by the 2 D analogue of the pion mass term in the Skyrme model. In our calculations we explicitely allow the <b>isospinning</b> solitons to deform and to break the symmetries of the static configurations. We find that stable <b>isospinning</b> baby Skyrme solutions can be constructed numerically for all angular frequencies ω<min(μ, 1), where μ is the mass parameter of the model. Stable, rotationally-symmetric baby Skyrmion solutions for higher angular velocities are simply an artefact of the hedgehog approximation. <b>Isospinning</b> multisoliton solutions of topological charge B {{turn out to be}} unstable to break up into their B charge- 1 constituents at some critical breakup frequency value. Furthermore, we find that for μ sufficiently large the rotational symmetry of charge- 2 baby Skyrmions becomes broken at a critical angular frequency ω.

25|$|<b>Isospin</b> {{is similar}} to, but {{should not be}} {{confused}} with weak <b>isospin.</b> Briefly, weak <b>isospin</b> is the gauge symmetry of the weak interaction which connects quark and lepton doublets of left-handed particles in all generations; for example, up and down quarks, top and bottom quarks, electrons and electron neutrinos. By contrast (strong) <b>isospin</b> connects only up and down quarks, acts on both chiralities (left and right) and is a global (not a gauge) symmetry.|$|E

25|$|This {{term was}} derived from isotopic spin, a {{confusing}} term to which nuclear physicists prefer isobaric spin, which is more precise in meaning. <b>Isospin</b> symmetry is {{a subset of the}} flavour symmetry seen more broadly in the interactions of baryons and mesons. <b>Isospin</b> symmetry remains an important concept in particle physics. A close examination of this symmetry, historically, led directly to the discovery and understanding of quarks and of the development of Yang–Mills theory.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>isospin</b> {{symmetry}} is very slightly broken, SU(3) symmetry is more badly broken, due to {{the much}} higher mass of the strange quark compared to the up and down. The discovery of charm, bottomness and topness could lead to further expansions up to SU(6) flavour symmetry, but the very large masses of these quarks make such symmetries almost useless. In modern applications, such as lattice QCD, <b>isospin</b> symmetry is often treated as exact while the heavier quarks must be treated separately.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{calculation}} of N-body (N> 2) nucleon interactions at short distances in holographic QCD. In the Sakai-Sugimoto model of large N_c massless QCD, N baryons are described by N Yang-Mills instantons in 5 spacetime dimensions. We compute a classical short distance interaction hamiltonian for N 'tHooft instantons. This corresponds to N baryons sharing identical classical spins and <b>isospins.</b> We find that genuine N-body nuclear forces {{turn out to}} vanish for N> 2, at the leading order.

25|$|The {{power of}} <b>isospin</b> {{symmetry}} and related {{methods such as}} the Eightfold Way come from the observation that families of particles with similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra 𝖘𝖚(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under {{the action of the}} Lie algebra 𝖘𝖚(2), which generates rotations in <b>isospin</b> space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can never leave the space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of <b>isospin,</b> this machinery is used to reflect the fact that the strong force behaves the same under the exchange of the up and down quark (and by extension the exchange of the proton and the neutron).|$|E
25|$|When Yang and Mills {{proposed}} the theory, {{there was no}} candidate vector boson. J. J. Sakurai in 1960 predicted {{that there should be}} a massive vector boson which is coupled to <b>isospin,</b> and predicted that it would show universal couplings. The rho mesons were discovered a short time later, and were quickly identified as Sakurai's vector bosons. The couplings of the rho to the nucleons and to each other were verified to be universal, as best as experiment could measure. The fact that the diagonal <b>isospin</b> current contains part of the electromagnetic current led to the prediction of rho-photon mixing and the concept of vector meson dominance, ideas which led to successful theoretical pictures of GeV-scale photon-nucleus scattering.|$|E
