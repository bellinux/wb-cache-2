White business leaders met with protest organizers to try and arrange an economic solution but said they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> politics.

5|$|Władysław {{used the}} title of the King of Sweden, {{although}} he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> Sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country. However, he continued his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with similar lack of results as his father. He might have been willing to trade his claim away, but the offer was never put down in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success for the Chinese military in Korea, and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its lowest point during the war. Ridgway was also extremely displeased {{with the performance of}} Eighth Army, which he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> due to the sudden death of Walker. Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the morale and fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> {{the events of the}} past that determined our present state and <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the laws of nature. Since we can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> these matters, we also can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|R

5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of eating disorders, Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{military}} was chiefly organized {{to ensure that}} the army could not threaten Imperial control, often at the expense of effectiveness in war. Northern Song's Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the imperial army. The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command. The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong).|$|E

5|$|The {{motivations for}} self-harm vary, {{as it may}} be used to fulfill a number of {{different}} functions. These functions include self-harm being used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness and a sense of failure or self-loathing. There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse. Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person's life of which they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> (e.g., through abuse).|$|E
5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's legal {{representation}} of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her {{work on behalf of}} Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an associate at her law firm, she had <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E

5|$|However, Osborn <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> his Super-Adaptoid abilities; {{he would}} {{automatically}} absorb {{the powers of}} any superhuman he touched, {{even if he did}} not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was then {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeal and argued on 23 and 24 April. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court's decision. The court decided that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had been implicitly repealed when the Irish Free State, an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> what happened to them. It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of habeas corpus against the Home Secretary because, {{even though he did}} not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him. The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the arrests the solicitors for one of the {{deported}} men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with Sir Patrick Hastings KC, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and a noted barrister. On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of habeas corpus for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in Mountjoy Prison), which was required for a writ of habeas corpus to be considered, {{but by the time the}} hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed. In addition the Home Secretary had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> what happened to them there.|$|E

5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship of the Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} defended in medieval times by Bristol Castle, a Norman {{fortification}} {{built on the}} site of a wooden predecessor. The castle {{played a key role in}} the civil wars that followed the death of Henry I. Stephen of Blois reconnoitred Bristol in 1138 and claimed that the town was impregnable. After Stephen's capture, in 1141, he was imprisoned in the castle. The castle was later taken into royal hands, and Henry III spent lavishly on it, adding a barbican before the main west gate, a gate tower, and a magnificent hall. By the 16th century, the castle had fallen into disuse, but the city authorities <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> royal property, and so the castle became a refuge for lawbreakers. In 1630, the city purchased the castle; Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction in 1656. An area outside the castle, known as Old Market, was used as a mustering point for troops. It later became a market for the country people to set up stalls and sell their wares. Old Market was also the site of an autumn fair. The market may have existed as early as the 12th century, and was the site of the first suburb outside the city walls. It had side roads which could accommodate the traffic on market days.|$|E

25|$|In March 1942 Hitler re-appointed Rundstedt OB West, in {{succession}} to Witzleben, who was ill. He returned to the comfortable headquarters in the Hotel Pavillon Henri IV in Saint-Germain, which he had occupied in 1940–41. Rundstedt's command of French and his good relationship {{with the head of}} the collaborationist Vichy regime, Marshal Philippe Pétain, were considerable assets. But his position was to grow increasingly difficult. Hitler did not intend giving him real authority, seeing him as a dignified figurehead. Although he was commander of the German Army in the west, charged with defending the coasts of France and Belgium against attack by the western Allies, the military governors in Paris and Brussels (Rundstedt's former subordinate Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel and Alexander von Falkenhausen respectively) were not under his direct command, and he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the Navy or Air Force. He also <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the SS and Gestapo operations in France: the HSSPF in Paris, Carl Oberg, answered only to Himmler.|$|E
