5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that, if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, it follows {{that there is a}} being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does not, <b>he</b> <b>argued,</b> demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy {{responded that}} {{what people do}} is irrelevant. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that what is really needed are {{machines}} that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that the {{redefinition}} {{of the connection between}} work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling). The rational roots of this doctrine, <b>he</b> <b>argued,</b> soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5000|$|The {{encyclical}} {{posits that}} faith and reason {{are not only}} compatible, but essential together. Faith without reason, <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> leads to superstition. Reason without faith, <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> leads to nihilism and relativism. He writes: ...|$|R
50|$|He {{says this}} because <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that our moral sense is {{composed}} of the narratives from which we draw conclusions, and by which we locate ourselves {{in relation to other}} people. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that because narrative is morality, the normative universe must rest on narrative. Since we also construct our view of the universe physically from narrative, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that the normative universe {{is as much a part}} of our existence as the physical universe.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>argues</b> as follows.|$|R
5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Mulligan letters scandal, Blaine {{had succeeded}} remarkably in his 1880 campaign, {{attracting}} nationwide {{support for his}} candidacy. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> for the gold standard, support for big business, a tariff to protect American jobholders, civil rights for freed blacks and Irish independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, the English {{economist}} William Stanley Jevons {{observed that}} technological improvements that increased {{the efficiency of}} coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal {{in a wide range}} of industries. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.|$|E
50|$|Malcolm was {{the major}} African American thinker that {{influenced}} me in terms of nationalism and Pan-Africanism. As you know, towards the end, when Malcolm is expanding his concept of Islam, and of nationalism, he stresses Pan-Africanism in a particular way. And <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that, {{and this is where}} we have the whole idea that cultural revolution and the need for revolution, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that we need a cultural revolution, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that we must return to Africa culturally and spiritually, even if we can’t go physically. And so that’s a tremendous impact on US.|$|R
50|$|Lippmann {{examines}} how, {{especially in}} an increasingly complex world, fear prevents society from addressing problems rationally. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> that removing everyday concerns and fears will lead to greater rationality and boldness {{on the part of}} citizens. Invoking Freud, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that constructed fears unconsciously hold people and society back from achievement.|$|R
50|$|Francione {{claims that}} the {{methodology}} of new welfarists in pursuing welfare reform cannot result in the abolition of their legal property status, which <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> is what matters most. Further, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that the {{short and long term}} goals of new welfarism are in direct conflict. <b>He</b> also <b>argues</b> that it is wrong to surrender the rights of animals today in the hopes of achieving rights for animals sometime in the future.|$|R
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{promotes}} the Internet {{as a means}} of communication between leadership and ordinary people. In addition to his personal website, which contains a personal blog, he has accounts on Flickr, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. In 2011, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> with British journalist Ian Birrell on Twitter following a tweet by Birrell about media freedom in Rwanda.|$|E
5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote in his report that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of the mission and apparently feared that it had uncovered information they would have preferred to conceal. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that there were Slovene populations in Styria who would have preferred the maintenance of Austrian rule.|$|E
500|$|Kant {{questions}} the intelligibility {{of the concept}} of a necessary being. He considers examples of necessary propositions, such as [...] "a triangle has three angles", and rejects the transfer of this logic to the existence of God. First, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that such necessary propositions are necessarily true only if such a being exists: If a triangle exists, it must have three angles. The necessary proposition, <b>he</b> <b>argues,</b> does not make the existence of a triangle necessary. Thus <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that, if the proposition [...] "X exists" [...] is posited, it would follow that, if X exists, it exists necessarily; {{this does not mean that}} X exists in reality. Second, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that contradictions arise only when the subject and predicate are maintained and, therefore, a judgement of non-existence cannot be a contradiction, as it denies the predicate.|$|R
40|$|Have just {{finished}} Dani Rodrik's book on The Globalization Paradox. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> {{that the world}} faces a trilemma in terms of nation states, democracy and (deep) globalization. In short, you can only pick two of the three. As Rodrik rules out global government and believes in democracy, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that deep globalization will have to go...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{argument}} for maternal nursing to reduce infant mortality. Dr. Levy does not place much responsibility on poverty {{as a cause of}} loss of infants, but emphasizes the effect of women in industries. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> for education of the midwife because she is the family adviser of many foreign-born groups. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> from results in Newark...|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, wherein <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity, eventually forming stars and planets.|$|E
5|$|A limited {{operation}} {{was supported by}} Egyptian armed forces Chief of Staff Saad El Shazly. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that Israel has two fatal weaknesses. The first of which is inability to sustain high human casualties due to limited available manpower. The second is inability to sustain a prolonged war for it mobilizes around 18% of the Jewish population. A prolonged limited defensive war can best capitalize both weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|Although Taft was {{successful}} as Solicitor General, winning 15 of the 18 cases <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> before the Supreme Court, {{he was glad}} when in March 1891, the United States Congress created a new judgeship {{for each of the}} United States Courts of Appeal and Harrison appointed him to the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati. In March 1892, Taft resigned as Solicitor General to resume his judicial career.|$|E
50|$|This {{section is}} again a broadly {{conventional}} overview of current {{understanding of the}} development of life on earth. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> from game-theory that increasing complexity is inevitably going to result from the operation of evolution by natural selection. More controversially, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that intelligence, social co-operation and cultural development are also bound to emerge sooner or later.|$|R
5000|$|Because of this <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> {{that private}} law cannot explain factors like punitive damages and other {{remedies}} used for behavior modification. Private law <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> is an ends to itself {{and not a}} means to some other particularly political, economic or social change. The only purpose, he says, for [...] "private law, is to be private law".|$|R

5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, <b>he</b> <b>argued,</b> are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> that the non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. <b>He</b> <b>argued,</b> I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E

50|$|Minds, Machines and Gödel is J. R. Lucas's 1959 {{philosophical}} {{paper in}} which <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> {{that a human}} mathematician cannot be accurately represented by an algorithmic automaton. Appealing to Gödel's incompleteness theorem, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> that for any such automaton, {{there would be some}} mathematical formula which it could not prove, but which the human mathematician could both see, and show, to be true.|$|R
