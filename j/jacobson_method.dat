40|$|Clinically {{significant}} change refers to meaningful change in individual patient functioning dur-ing psychotherapy. Following the operational definition of clinically {{significant change}} offered by Jacobson, Follette, and Revenstorf (1984), several alternatives {{have been proposed}} because they {{were thought to be}} either more accurate or more sensitive to detecting meaningful change. In this study, we compared five methods using a sample of 386 outpatients who underwent treatment in routine clinical practice. Differences were found between methods, suggesting that the statistical method used to calculate clinical significance has an effect on estimates of meaningful change. The <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method</b> (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) provided a moderate esti-mate of treatment effects and was recommended for use in outcome studies and research on clinically significant change, but future research is needed to validate this statistical method. Clinically significant change refers to changes in patient functioning that are meaningful for individuals who undergo psychosocial or medical interventions. This concept has con-siderable value in research aimed at classifying each individ-ual patient’s status with regard to normative functioning. I...|$|E
40|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) is {{a substantial}} healthcare concern. Conventionally conducted meta-analyses support the efficacy of both psychological and pharmacological interventions for MDD, but methodological limitations of meta-analyses may obfuscate rather than clarify the clinical efficacy of available interventions. The thesis begins with a systematic review of meta-analyses of high quality psychological treatment studies for MDD. The results of the systematic review indicated that 48 % of patients achieved remission after a course of psychological treatment. However, approximately 70 % of remitted patients relapsed within 3 years after the discontinuation of psychological therapy. Consistent methodological limitations were identified in the primary outcome studies contributing to the meta-analyses. The primary studies typically published insufficient evidence on treatment fidelity. There was considerable variability in the overall treatment duration, the mean severity of samples and the definition of clinical significance. These factors pose a risk to the validity of meta-analytic results of psychological interventions for MDD. The next component of the thesis investigated the impact of idiosyncratic clinical significance definitions on the published conclusions of studies that used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) to assess outcome. The availability of individual patient data (IPD) for 7 published studies enabled the empirically-based <b>Jacobson</b> <b>Method</b> of clinical significance {{to be used as}} a standard definition of recovery across IPD studies. Comparisons of published and <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method</b> clinical significance rates for each IPD study showed that idiosyncratic outcome definitions typically overestimated treatment efficacy. Moreover, treatment efficacy was confounded with the definition of clinical significance employed. This indicates that to reduce the risk of bias in meta-analysis, a standard and empirically-based definition of clinical significance should be used across primary MDD treatment studies. Subsequently, the moderating role of pre-treatment severity on clinical significance rates was investigated via individual patient data meta-analysis. It was found that being male and having higher pre-treatment severity both predicted a significantly reduced likelihood of achieving clinical recovery. It is evident that between-study methodological differences means that even high quality conventional meta-analyses of psychological treatments for MDD remain at risk of bias. The novel finding that gender significantly moderated treatment outcome indicates that IPD meta-analyses are both more powerful and flexible than conventional meta-analyses based on summary data. Ideally, future meta-analyses of primary MDD treatment studies should be based on individual patient data...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Breast milk is a God-given {{gift that}} conveys a mother's love and {{compassion}} {{and that is}} made according {{to the needs and}} age of the child. Mothers who are interested in the welfare of their newborns tend to breastfeed their children. Training programs have been shown to improve breastfeeding self-efficacy in terms of both duration and amount. PURPOSE The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of using the progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technique on the self-efficacy of breastfeeding in mothers with preterm infants. METHODS A clinical trial approach was used. Sixty mothers with preterm infants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The clinical trial ran for a period of 2 months for both groups. At 24 - 72 hours postpartum, the researcher used the <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method</b> to provide 30 - 45 minutes of individual training to the intervention group participants on PMR. Under the <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method,</b> mothers contract the 16 groups of muscles until they experience the feeling of pressure and then relax these muscles. The tools used in this study were the standard questionnaire of Dennis breastfeeding self-efficacy, which was completed by the participants at baseline, at the end of the fourth week, and during the eighth week. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS No significant difference was observed between the intervention and control groups in terms of demographic variables (p >. 05). Independent t tests found no significant difference between the two groups (p =. 45) in terms of mean score of maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy at pretest and significantly higher scores for the intervention group than the control group at both 4 (p =. 001) and 8 (p <. 001) weeks posttest. Furthermore, the analysis of variance test showed significant differences in the mean score of breastfeeding self-efficacy for the intervention group between pretest and the first posttest and between the first posttest and the second posttest, respectively (p <. 001). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Considering the effect of relaxation training on the breastfeeding self-efficacy of mothers with preterm infants, training and performing these exercises as an effective and low-cost method to improve the health of mothers, particularly mothers of preterm infants, are recommended. The PMR technique facilitates the self-efficacy of breastfeeding in mothers with preterm infants and should be considered as an effective strategy to improve nursing care and the provision of better support services for mothers who breastfeed their infants...|$|E
40|$|Interactions {{between humans}} and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have become common, often {{resulting}} in management actions to mitigate negative impacts. Changes in population size are generally used to judge management actions. We examined deer population estimation techniques during 2 mark-resighting experiments in a woodland-grassland habitat in central New York State and in a suburban area. We compared program NOREMARK, Lincoln-Peterson estimates, and Jacobson’s (1997) buck:doe ratios (BDR) for estimating deer abundance. In the first field trial, we sought to validate the camera survey methods and computer applications. We used infrared-triggered cameras (IRCs) to survey a white-tailed deer population of known size that inhabited a fenced, woodland-grassland area (11 -day survey, 1 camera/ 33 ha, fall 1999). We estimated deer abundance with program NOREMARK (Bowden estimator). Analysis of the photographic data with this technique produced an accurate and precise population estimate in the fi rst experiment. In the second experiment, we used program NOREMARK and 2 similar estimators in a previously untested suburban landscape. We surveyed a suburban white-tailed deer population with IRCs during spring and fall 2000 (10 -day surveys, 1 camera/ 38 ha), using program NOREMARK (Bowden estimator), the <b>Jacobson</b> BDR <b>method,</b> and the Lincoln-Peterson estimator. All 3 methods produced similar estimates of deer abundance. We concluded that IRCs, in conjunction with either program NOREMARK or the <b>Jacobson</b> BDR <b>method</b> will provide reliable estimates of deer abundance in suburban areas...|$|R
40|$|Clinically {{significant}} change {{is an important}} aspect of the therapeutic process. Computing {{significant change}} allows for measurement of client progress beyond clinical judgment. In this study, four methods of reliable change and clinical significance were compared using a sample of 395 individuals who attended psychotherapy in a clinical setting. Differences in classification were found between methods; this suggests that the method chosen to determine reliable change and clinical significance plays a factor on estimates of meaningful change. Consistent with prior outcome studies, the <b>Jacobson</b> and Truax <b>method</b> (<b>Jacobson</b> 2 ̆ 6 Truax, 1991) provided a moderate estimate of reliable change and clinical significance and therefore is recommended for use in future outcome studies. Future research is necessary to combine client satisfaction with treatment outcome using a standardized measure in order to consider more factors when considering treatment outcomes...|$|R
40|$|A commercially {{available}} fibrinogen standard calibrated by a World Health Organization (WHO) reference material {{is widely used}} in Japan, and most clinical laboratories use the Clauss method for plasma fibrinogen measurement. However, a current issue in fibrinogen measurement is poor laboratory-to-laboratory variability. To improve the reliability of fibrinogen values and thereby solve the poor precision and accuracy of plasma fibrinogen testing, the present paper develops a simple and large preparation procedure for a suitable fibrinogen standard and quality control material and evaluates their basic performance. With a new procedure getting high purified fibrinogen by glycine precipitation, the calibrator determined by both the Clauss and <b>Jacobson</b> <b>methods</b> produced a fibrinogen concentration of 2. 20 g l− 1. The total precision of the calibrator was excellent (coefficient of variation 1. 4 - 2. 1 %) in comparison with current plasma fibrinogen materials from the WHO (# 98 / 612) and with a commercial standard (CV 1. 9 - 3. 9 %). The within-run precision of the calibrator on the coagulation analysers was 1. 7 - 2. 8 %. Within-analyser variability among the five instruments had good consistency (mean 2. 20 ± 0. 022 g l− 1; CV 1. 0 %). The degradation study of the calibrator suggested that storage at 9 °C for two years was as predicted. In conclusion, {{the results show that}} the calibrator prepared herein can be useful as a candidate Japanese fibrinogen standard and is applicable to automated and semi-automated coagulation analysers. Additionally, it is expected that it will be widely used in Japan by diagnostic manufacturers and clinical laboratories as a recommended secondary standard to estimate a fibrinogen value according to the WHO primary standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} heads-down, non-conformal {{synthetic}} vision displays for landings below minimums has inherent problems during the flare due to minification effects. Literature showed that pilots can use four visual cues {{to perform a}} manual flare maneuver. Amongst their strategies, the Jacobson flare method seemed the most suitable to provide flare initiation and flare control cues. Offline, linear simulation {{results indicated that the}} <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method</b> was robust and its performance was comparable to an automatic landing system. An enhanced synthetic vision display was designed offering support cues to aid pilots with this landing method. An experiment was conducted in a fixed-based simulator with eight professional pilots and eight novice pilots. The enhanced display was tested against a basic version and conventional primary flight display with outside visuals. Each pilot group was split into two groups with different display orders to check for possible learning effects. The experiment showed that touchdown position was not affected by display type. The enhanced display did achieve softer touchdown sink rates compared to the basic version. The softest landings were done on outside visuals. A strong learning curve was also observed for the group of pilots that first flew with the enhanced display: this translated into better achieved performances with subsequent displays. Therefore, it could be a valuable tool for basic flight training and reduce the number of flight hours required in mastering the landing flare. Control & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
30|$|In an {{endeavour}} {{to establish}} whether {{the change in}} EQ- 5 D™ scores represented a robust change at the individual level, the Reliable Change Index for the EQ- 5 D was calculated using the <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method</b> (Jacobson and Truax 1991). This formula {{takes into account the}} reliability of the measure and variance in measurement to generate a change score in excess of which we can essentially be 95  % certain that the change in score is a real (hence, reliable) change over time. Ideally, in order to exclude sources of systematic error in this calculation, an estimate of test-retest reliability derived from a clinical sample whose clinical characteristics have not changed {{over a period of time}} would be preferred. Since clinical samples are, by definition, in treatment and therefore on a change trajectory and the EQ- 5 D™ is not yet used widely in mental health settings, such estimates are hard to obtain. Hurst et al. (1997, Table IX), using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) rather than Pearson correlation because of concerns about over-estimating reliability, reported a reliability coefficient for the EQ- 5 D™ of 0.78 (0.6 – 0.96) over 2  weeks in a clinical sample of 31 rheumatoid arthritis sufferers where there was no change in rheumatoid arthritis. More recently Sonntag et al. (2013, Table  4) have tabulated ICCs for n =  106 social phobics at an interval of 6  months and n =  60 at 12  months, anchored by no change on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale which are all also 0.78. In view of the replication of this estimate and albeit limited clinical similarities in the study populations, this value was used in the calculation of the Reliable Change Index in the DBT programmes in this study.|$|E
40|$|Bowman, JacobCamera {{surveys are}} an {{accepted}} tool for estimating wildlife abundance and occupancy {{and have been}} used throughout the world. Camera surveys {{tend to be less}} invasive, less costly, and more accurate than other means in certain situations. I sought to expand and test the effectiveness of camera surveys during July and August of 2008 and 2009 for sika deer at Tudor Farm, LLC in Dorchester County, Maryland. In 2008, I setup surveys with a 7 -day pre-bait period followed by a 7 -day active camera survey with 15 cameras. In 2009, I changed the camera survey setup to account for any bias that may have occurred due to using the same camera sites for consecutive surveys. I also set camera surveys to run for the entire 14 -day survey period to determine optimum survey length. Camera density for both years was 1 camera per 65 -ha. The estimates generated by the <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method</b> and Bowden’s estimator were similar between years. In 2009, increasing photo intervals from 1 - minute to 5 and 10 -minute intervals reduced the number of pictures by 66 % and 81 % while providing similar population estimates. I calculated the daily detection probabilities for all identifiable deer and I used radio-collared males that occurred within 2 -km of the survey grid to assist in determining the optimum survey length. Detection probability did not vary between surveys in the same year, but varied between 2008 and 2009, most likely as a result of greater amounts of bait being available in 2008. Camera surveys have proven to be an accurate and effective means of estimating sika deer abundance and could be expanded to the entire population of Maryland.

40|$|Since {{there seems}} to be a {{relative}} consensus in medical literature about the superiority of alarm treatment for nocturnal enuresis, recent studies have focused on other associated subjects. One of these research lines relates enuresis and behavior problems. The <b>Jacobson</b> and Truax <b>method,</b> that evaluates changes in a treated population using the clinical significance and reliable change index (RCI) concepts seems to fit in this research area. In this work, we used the JT method to evaluate the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scores of 61 children and adolescents that received treatment for enuresis. The reliable change index showed that participants, generally, had their scores reduced after the treatment. We also concluded that the JT method is a promising way of data assessment in this area, since it allows more detailed and significant clinical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Self-report {{questionnaires}} are economical {{instruments for}} routine outcome assessment. In this study, {{the performance of}} the German version of the Outcome Questionnaire- 45 (OQ- 45) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was evaluated when applied in analysis of the outcome quality of psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interventions. Pre-post data from two inpatient samples (N= 5711) and one outpatient sample (N= 239) were analyzed. Critical differences (reliable change index) and cut-off points between functional and dysfunctional populations were calculated using the <b>Jacobson</b> and Truax <b>method</b> of calculating clinical significance. Overall, the results indicated that the BSI was more accurate than the OQ- 45 in correctly classifying patients as clinical subjects. Nonetheless, even with the BSI, about 25 % of inpatients with schizophrenia attained a score at admission below the clinical cut-off. Both questionnaires exhibited the highest sensitivity to psychopathology with patients with personality disorders. When considering the differences in the prescores, both questionnaires showed the same sensitivity to change. The advantage of using these self-report measures is observed primarily in assessing outpatient psychotherapy outcome. In an inpatient setting two main problems—namely, the low response rate and the scarce sensitivity to psychopathology with severely ill patients—limit the usability of self-report questionnaires...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} whether an attempt to reduce the trait of high tension-anxiety by means of {{systematic}} neuro-musculature relaxation training {{will result in a}} decrease of the communication variable of closed-mindedness. A general review of the literature showed that the problem of tension-anxiety is complex, pervasive, and detrimental to effective communication. First, an attempt is made to bring relevant information to the field of general speech by citing a few findings from the research of other disciplines concerning the nature and effects of tension-anxiety. Currently-used methods of anxiety reduction are mentioned, and one, neuro-musculature relaxation training, discussed as to its effectiveness and adaptability to the college environment. This method was chosen for investigation in the present study because it can be administered to groups by trained personnel, who need not be professional psychotherapists, at no risk to the students. The major hypothesis {{is that there will be}} a significant difference between the dogmatism scores of the experimental group who receive relaxation training and the dogmatism scores of the control group who did not receive such training. The minor hypothesis is that there will be a significantly greater difference between the pre- and post-anxiety scores of the experimental group than between the pre-and post-anxiety scores of the control group, and the post-scores will show a downward trend. The design of the study consisted first of selecting a group of high-anxious subjects by administering the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale to all students who enrolled in the beginning fundamental speech course, which totaled 427, and sending invitations to the fifty-six students who scored twenty-four and above to participate in the research study. Those who accepted were arbitrarily placed in either the control group or the experimental group depending on whether their time schedules permitted them to attend the previously-scheduled training meetings. The experimental group was given a series of six weekly training sessions of forty-five minutes each using a modified version of the <b>Jacobson</b> <b>method</b> of progressive neuro-musculature relaxation. There was no more contact with the control group until after the six-week period when both groups were administered the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale and a repeat of the Manifest Anxiety Scale. Statistical procedures were employed at this time, and since no significant differences were found both hypotheses were rejected. The findings of this study show that the method of systematic neuro-musculature relaxation training employed did not cause significant differences in either the dogmatism or the chronic tension-anxiety level of the experimental subjects according to the measuring devices used. That the method could be used with the equipment and conditions of a normal college environment and with trained non-professionals as therapists was evident. Whether it would be useful for the reduction of chronic high tension-anxiety remains in doubt due to the uncertain motivation of the experimental subjects and the questionable sensitivity of the Manifest Anxiety Scale as a measurement of tension-anxiety change. Further study using a combination of measuring devices, including the electromyograph, is recommended...|$|E
30|$|The Object {{oriented}} analysis (OOA) applies object modelling {{techniques to}} analyse {{the requirements for}} a system. OOA views the world as objects with data structures and behaviours. The idea that a system {{can be viewed as}} a population of interacting objects, each of which is an atomic bundle of data and functionality, is the foundation of object technology and provides an attractive alternative for the development of complex systems. This is a radical departure from prior methods of requirement specification, such as functional decomposition and structured analysis and design [38]. As opposed to the traditional data or functional views of systems, OOA can yield the following benefits: maintainability through simplified mapping to the real world, which provides for less analysis effort, less complexity in system design, and easier verification by the user; reusability of the analysis artefacts which saves time and costs; and, depending on the analysis method and programming language, productivity gains through direct mapping to features of Object-Oriented Programming Languages [1]. Numerous OOA methods have been described since 1988. They include: Shlaer-Mellor [30], Jacobson [14], Coad-Yourdon [6], Booch [5] and Rumbaugh [28]. In 1997, Rumbaugh, Booch and <b>Jacobson</b> gathered their <b>methods</b> to produce the Unified Modelling Language (UML) which has became the standard modelling language used in object-oriented analysis and design.|$|R
40|$|This is Part 2 of {{a two-part}} special series on {{contemporary}} behav-ioral contributions to helping people with autism {{and their families}} (see Behavior Modification, October 2001). As the approach to autism with the most comprehensive and extensive research (Matson, Benavidez, Compton, Paclwaskyj, & Baglio, 1996), applied behavior analysis (ABA) has branched beyond the now classic longitudinal study by Ivar Lovaas {{and his colleagues at}} the University of California, Los Angeles (Lovaas, 1987). The researchers demonstrated that early, intensive, and language-focused behavioral education led to profound differences in IQ and degree of inclusion in mainstream educational settings as compared with two control groups. Subsequent investiga-tion has focused on specific strategies for improving language and social skill acquisition, successfully mainstreaming children with autism, working with teens and adults, and vocational preparation, as well as curriculum sequencing, staff training, cost-effectiveness, and the dimensions of service delivery such as frequency and duration. As a whole, ABA has the best documented outcome data supporting their approach as compared with other <b>methods</b> (<b>Jacobson,</b> 2000). In addition, ABA has emerged with widespread recognition beyond the limited community of academic and behavioral psychologists and special educators.
