40|$|The {{propagation}} of internal electromagnetic waves in an inviscid chiral fluid {{in the presence}} of the external constraint of transverse magnetic field is investigated. These waves are shown to be generated due to the stabilizing nature of the distribution of charge density. It is shown that the effect of the external constraint of magnetic field in a chiral fluid is analogous to the effect of viscosity in ordinary fluids. The wave equation, derived from the conservation of mass and momentum together with Maxwell's equations and suitable auxiliary equations for chiral materials, reveals the existence of a critical level (i. e., resonance level) at which the <b>Doppler</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>frequency</b> Omega(d) = 0, i. e., at the point where the basic fluid velocity matches with the phase velocity of the wave.

The stabilizing effects of velocity shear and large ion orbits on the n = 1 internal tilt mode in the prolate FRCs have been studied. Sheared rotation is found to reduce the growth rate, however a large rotation rate with Mach number of M greater than or approximately equal to 1 is required in order for significant reduction in the instability growth rate to occur. Kinetic effects associated with large thermal ion orbits have been studied for different kinetic equilibria. These simulations {{show that there is}} a reduction in the tilt mode growth rate due to finite ion Larmor radius (FLR) effects, but complete linear stability has not been found, even when the thermal ion gyroradius is comparable to the distance between the field null and the separatrix.

To capture the three components, three such measurement heads have been used viewing from different angles. In the technique presented here the three views are ported from the collection optics to a single imaging plane using flexible fibre imaging bundles.

By using the wavevector at the maximum power in P (ωsc, k) at each sampling frequency ωsc and the <b>Doppler</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>frequency</b> ωpla {{in the solar}} wind frame, the dispersion plot ωpla = ωpla(k) is found. Previous studies have been limited to very few intervals and have been hampered by large errors, which motivates a statistical study of 52 intervals of solar wind. We find that the turbulence is predominantly highly oblique to the magnetic field k ⊥ k‖, and propagates slowly in the plasma frame with most points having frequencies smaller than the proton gyrofrequency ωpla < Ωp. Weak agreement is found that turbulence at the ion kinetic scales consists of kinetic Alfvén waves and coherent structures advected with plasma bulk velocity plus some minor more compressible components. The results suggest that anti-sunward and sunward propagating magnetic fluctuations are of similar nature in both the fast and slow solar wind at ion kinetic scales.

These lie {{on both sides of}} the corotation radius. Waves propagate outside the Lindblad resonances, and also in a restricted region around the magnetic resonances. The magnetic resonances contribute to a significant global torque which, like the Lindblad torque, is negative (positive) inside (outside) the planet's orbit. Since these resonances are closer to the planet than the Lindblad resonances, the torque they contribute dominates over the Lindblad torque if the magnetic field is large enough. In addition, if beta=c^ 2 /v_A^ 2 increases fast enough with radius, the outer magnetic resonance becomes less important and the total torque is then negative, dominated by the inner magnetic resonance. This leads to outward migration of the planet. Even for beta= 100 at corotation, a negative torque may be obtained. A planet migrating inward through a nonmagnetized region of a disc would then stall when reaching a magnetized region. It would then be able to grow to become a terrestrial planet or the core of a giant planet. In a turbulent magnetized disc in which the large scale field structure changes sufficiently slowly, a planet may alternate between inward and outward migration, depending on the gradients of the field encountered.

40|$|A linear {{analysis}} of the zombie vortex instability is performed in a stratified shearing sheet setting for three model barotropic shear flows. The linear analysis is done by utilizing a Green's function formulation to resolve the critical layers of the associated normal-mode problem. The instability {{is the result of}} a resonant interaction between a Rossby wave and a gravity wave which we refer to as Z-modes. The associated critical layer is the location where the <b>Doppler</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>frequency</b> of a distant Rossby wave equals the local Brunt-Vaisala frequency. The minimum required Rossby number for instability, Ro= 0. 2, is confirmed for parameter values reported in the literature. It is also found that the shear layer supports the instability in the limit where stratification vanishes. The zombie vortex instability is examined in a jet model, finding that the instability can occur for Ro= 0. 05. Nonlinear vorticity forcing due to unstable Z-modes is shown to result in the creation of a jet flow at the critical layer emerging as the result of the competition between the vertical lifting of perturbation radial vorticity and the radial transport of perturbation vertical vorticity. We find that the picture of this instability leading to a form of nonlinearly driven self-replicating pattern of creation and destruction is warranted: a parent jet spawns a growing child jet at associated critical layers. A mature child jet creates a next generation of child jets at associated critical layers while simultaneously destroying its parent jet via the Rossby wave instability.
