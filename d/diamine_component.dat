40|$|Experimental data {{pertinent}} to flexible resilient foams, low density wall panels, high strength floor panels and thermal acoustical insulation are presented. An {{evaluation of the}} effect of the heterocyclic <b>diamine</b> <b>component</b> on the compression set of the foams was carried out. Processes and compositions for fabricating wall panels were evaluated. Thermal acoustical polyimide materials were developed to replace conventional glass batting insulation. To reduce the thermal stresses and improve the burn through resistance, cross linked polyimide foams were developed but not evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{studies have}} been made of three types of {{treatments}} which utilize diisocy-anates for stabilization of wool yarns and fabrics, {{and it has been}} shown that the procedures which utilize the technique of interfacial polymerization as developed by Whitfield et al. is most effective. The procedures of interfacial formation of polyurea upon fiber surface were studied in detail, and it was found that the employment of ethylene diamine, which had not hitherto been used as a <b>diamine</b> <b>component,</b> resulted in the best shrinkproof effect. The electron microscopic study revealed that the fibers treated by this procedure were masked uniformly by the polyurea resin. The conditions of treatment were varied, and the influence of these conditions upon the uptake and shrinkproof effect was studied. The uptake of from 2 to 5 % was sufficient to make the yarns and fabrics practically unshrinkable. The mechanical properties and the moisture regain of the fibers were not significantly affected by the treatment. The anti-scale coefficient of friction decreased by the treatment, and therefore the directional frictional effect decreased. This would be the main factor of producing the shrinkproof effect...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel [60]fullerene pearl-necklace polymer, poly(4, 49 -carbonylbisphe-nylene trans- 2 -[60]fullerenobisacetamide), was {{synthesized}} by {{a direct}} polycondensa-tion of trans- 2 -[60]fullerenobisacetic acid with 4, 49 -diaminobenzophenone in the pres-ence of large excesses of triphenyl phosphite and pyridine. In the present polymer, [60]fullerene pearls and diamine linkers {{were attached to}} each other by methano-carbonyl connectors. The molecular weight Mw of the polymer {{was determined to be}} 4. 5 3 104 {{on the basis of the}} TOF-MS, and a GPC analysis of the polymer using polystyrene standards showed a weight-average molecular weight of 5. 3 3 104. The UV-vis spec-trum of the resultant polymer in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) exhibited a broad absorption (lmax 310 nm, « 2. 1 3 10 4 L z mol 21 z cm 21), tailing to longer wavelengths, and a fluorenscence peak centered at 550 nm was observed in DMAc. There was observed a large downfield-shift of the cyclopropane methyne proton in the 1 H-NMR spectra from 4. 57 ppm of the ethyl ester to 5. 78 ppm of the polyamide. These observa-tions indicate that the present polyamide is a high-molecular-weight [60]fullerene pearl-necklace polymer and that the cyclopropane rings are efficient to make the [60]fullerene cages and the <b>diamine</b> <b>components</b> conjugatable. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons...|$|R
40|$|Polyhydroxypolyamides (PHPAs) {{represent}} {{a class of}} synthetic polyamides derived from aldaric acid and diamine monomer units. This paper describes the synthesis of some poly(galactaramides), a class of polyhydroxypolyamides, that employs alkylene and substituted alkylenediammonium galactarate salts, with 1 : 1 molar equivalency of the diacid and <b>diamine</b> monomer <b>components,</b> as precursors for the polyamides. The salts were treated with acid/alcohol and then base in order to initiate the polymerization in methanol. The polyamides, labeled as prepolyamides, precipitated from solution and were then subjected to a second polymerization (postpolymerization) in a different solvent to produce a generally larger polyamide, labeled as a postpolyamide...|$|R

Polycondensation procedures have been used as based on: 1) Michael-type addition of a alpha,omega-bis hydrogenactive <b>component</b> (<b>diamines</b> and dithiols) to a component containing two alpha,omega-activated double bonds (bisacrylates); 2) reaction of a selectively protected polyol with a diacid chloride; 3) self-condensation of a selectively protected (polyhydroxy) acid; 4) addition of an epoxide containing protected hydroxyl group to cyclic anhydrides, including also carbon dioxide...|$|R
40|$|The {{crystallization}} kinetics of copoly(ester imide) s {{based on}} poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), trimellitic anhydride, and diaminobutane (PEI- 4), resp. diaminohexane (PEI- 6) or diaminoethane (PEI- 2) are investigated {{by means of}} time-resolved x-ray scattering employing synchrotron radiation. The PEI- 4 and PEI- 6 copolymers exhibit a remarkably high degree of crystallinity, which {{can be attributed to}} the formation of mixed crystals in the co-PEI- 4 and to blockiness in the case of co-PEI- 6. Whereas the pure PEI- 4 forms large negatively birefringent spherulites, the co-PEI- 4 and the PEI- 6 homo- and copolymers form much smaller superstructures like axialites or ellipsoids. In the co-PEI- 4 and co-PEI- 6, the rate of crystallization is slower compared to the homopolymers due to the incorporation of the respective comonomer unit. The PEI- 4 forms a second crystal modification upon drawing and subsequent crystallization, probably with a monoclinic unit cell. The PEI- 6 crystallizes faster than PEI- 4 due to the improved flexibility of the longer <b>diamine</b> <b>component.</b> In contrast, the crystallization of PEI- 2 and its copolymers takes several hours and the equimolar co-PEI- 2 remains completely amorphous.

40|$|High-Mr mucin glycopeptides {{prepared}} from sputum of {{an individual}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) were studied by ion-exchange h. p. l. c. The glycopeptides were heterogeneous {{and a number of}} partially resolved populations were identified. Whole mucins from the gel phase were separated into four fractions by isopycnic density-gradient centrifugation in CsCl, and high-Mr glycopeptides from these fractions were examined by ion-exchange h. p. l. c. The acidic nature of the high-Mr glycopeptides increased with increasing buoyant density of the intact mucins, and a periodate-Schiff (PAS) -rich and an extremely high-iron <b>diamine</b> (HID) -reactive <b>component</b> were present in the lowest and highest density fractions respectively. The various glycopeptide populations were identified in different proportions in mucins from four other individuals with CF. CF sputum thus seems to contain distinct mucin populations containing different oligosaccharide clusters corresponding to these high-Mr glycopeptides...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop new optical methods, a UV {{reflection}} technique was investigated to characterize cure in epoxies, polyimides and their composites. The UV reflection technique in an aromatic diamine-cured epoxy system resulted in the spectral shift of 22 nm which was correlated with the extent of epoxide reaction. Based on this result, fiber optic reflection method was implemented for in-situ characterization of epoxy composites at cure temperatures. During imidization, spectra were blue shifted. Deconvolution of the reflection spectra based on the spectra of the starting polyamic acid and final polyimide provided quantitative extent of imidization. ^ Charge transfer (CT) fluorescence of several aromatic group containing polyimides was studied by changing <b>diamine</b> and dianhydride <b>components.</b> The fluorescence spectra showed red shifts and their intensities decreased as the imidization proceeded. UV absorption showed the identical amount of spectral shift as CT fluorescence excitation spectra. Finally, these spectral changes were correlated with the extent of imidization for several aromatic polyimide systems. ^ The fluorescence technique {{was used for the}} study of interphase of epoxy/glass or carbon composites. For the interphase region, the cure reaction was faster at the early stage of cure even though the final cure state was similar as that of the bulk system. The effect of surface treatment was studied by a model system and an actual interphase. Amino-silane treatment on a glass interphase showed about 17 % increase in crosslinking density, while water aging and air oxidation showed almost no effect. Air oxidation showed a faster reaction at the early stage of cure for the case of a simulated carbon interphase. In the case of epoxy/carbon composite, both air oxidation and water aging treatment showed a faster cure reaction at the early stage of cure. The air oxidation treatment for the epoxy/carbon composite showed a 10 % improvement of the crosslinking density. ...|$|R
