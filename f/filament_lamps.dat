5|$|Case No. 1 {{contained}} {{a selection of}} lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved {{in the early stages}} of the electric light bulb development. The case displayed actual physical light bulbs made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

25|$|On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman {{were granted}} a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a {{tungsten}} filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament. Tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>lamps</b> were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type {{is often called}} Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life.|$|E
2500|$|There {{followed}} {{a series of}} electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics, Olivetti, SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang. The early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors, which were cheaper than silicon transistors, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were CRT, cold-cathode Nixie tubes, and <b>filament</b> <b>lamps.</b> Memory technology was usually based on the delay line memory or the magnetic core memory, though the Toshiba [...] "Toscal" [...] BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of dynamic RAM built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.|$|E
2500|$|Switching high-intensity {{incandescent}} (<b>filament)</b> <b>lamps</b> to {{full power}} from cold can shorten their life dramatically, {{owing to the}} large inrush current that occurs. [...] To reduce stress on the lamp filaments, dimmers may have a preheat function. [...] This sets a minimum level, usually between 5% and 10%, which appears turned-off, but stops the lamp from cooling down too much. [...] This also speeds up the lamp's reaction to sudden bursts of power that operators of rock'n'roll-style shows appreciate. [...] The opposite of this function is sometimes called top-set. [...] This limits the maximum power supplied to a lamp, which can also extend its life.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{constant}} illumination level {{control of a}} reading lamp is considered, with the microcontroller PIC, by continuously adjusting the illumination level on a desk from the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp.</b> The illumination, from the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> is transformed into the voltage by the phototransistor on the desk. From the voltage thus transformed, we can know the illumination level on the desk indirectly. For the purpose of constant illumination level control, the phase control of the AC voltage, {{in terms of the}} triac, is adopted. Since the transformed voltage through the phototransistor is small, the voltage is amplified by the operational amplifier. The amplified voltage is applied to the microcomputer PIC and A/D converted in the PIC with a resolution of 10 bits. The microcontroller program is implemented as follows. If the A/ D converted value is larger than the reference input value, the phase delay of the AC voltage, applied to the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp,</b> is set to increase. Then the brightness of the <b>filament</b> <b>lamp</b> decreases, and vice versa. According to these adjustments of the illumination level on the desk, the feedback control of the constant illumination level from the reading lamp, is carried out...|$|R
