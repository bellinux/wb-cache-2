40|$|CONTEXT: Chronic {{exposure}} to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation {{can result in}} pneumoconiosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present {{a case of a}} young carpet installer who was diagnosed with silicatosis of the lung. Review of occupational history revealed that the patient had been working as a carpet installer for approximately 15 years, since he was 15 years of age. The patient was exposed to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> his work. DISCUSSION: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation has not been reported as a possible cause of pneumoconiosis. In this article we review different causes of silicatosis and discuss chronic exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation and development of pneumoconiosis. In addition, we also review the relevance of mycobacterial infection in cases of silicosis and silicatosis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation should be added to conditions that can cause pneumoconioses, specifically silicatosis of the lung...|$|R
