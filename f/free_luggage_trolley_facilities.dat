50|$|Passenger comfort {{sometimes}} {{suffers from}} (homeless) beggars or pickpockets, especially in large cities.

Also, a valid train ticket is required to access platforms. Passengers with large luggage should note that no <b>luggage</b> <b>trolleys</b> are provided (except at the station of Schiphol airport), although platforms are accessible by elevator.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} Board of Trade {{accident investigation}} {{showed that the}} down platform sloped unnecessarily steeply (1 in 24) towards the track, and that whilst the passageway was not so fiercely graded it still sloped at about 1 in 80 to the track.

500|$|Within King's Cross, a {{cast-iron}} [...] "Platform 9¾" [...] plaque was erected in 1999, initially in a passageway connecting the main station {{to the platform}} 911 annexe.

50|$|In 1990, plant IV {{is opened}} in Leipheim, {{close to the}} A8 motorway. Today, this plant {{is home to the}} company's headquarters. In 1991, Wanzl founds the Shop Solutions {{business}} division. From now on, the fittings for entire supermarkets may be planned and shelving systems manufactured. With the fall of the Iron Curtain, the concept of self-service shopping also spreads to Eastern Europe, opening up new markets. In 1995, a production plant is opened in the Czech Republic, not far from Rudolf Wanzl's former home town. In 1998, after ten years as Managing Director, Gottfried Wanzl assumes overall management of the business from his father.

50|$|On 2 September 1898 at Wellingborough {{railway station}} a postman brought a mailcart {{to the station}} with mail which he was to see onto a train due at 20:22.

The postman went into the station collected a <b>luggage</b> <b>trolley</b> and took it along the platform to the platform side of the gate. Whilst the platform itself sloped towards the railway tracks quite noticeably, the passageway did not. The postman put down the handle by which he was drawing the trolley and unlocked the gate. He then reached round for the trolley handle only to see the trolley running {{off the edge of the}} platform and onto the down main line.|$|R
