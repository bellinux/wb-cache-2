For this purpose, the microstructural changes of <b>diffusion</b> <b>coated</b> new and aged blades have been evaluated for the characteristic features and kinetics of degradation. After comparing alternative approaches, two indicators appear to be particularly useful: a) the extent of gamma prime coarsening and degradation in the blade interior and b) the combined layer thickness of the intermediate diffusion zone (IDZ) and the zone with topologically close-packed (TCP) precipitates below the coating. The applicability of the indicators was demonstrated for selected ex-service blades. With both indicators the relevant service temperatures can be inferred, although not to {{the same level of}} uncertainty.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Typically, colonic {{absorption}} {{of a drug}} is mandatory for a sustained release formulation to hold the drug’s plasma level for more than 12 or 24 h above the minimum therapeutic plasma concentra-tion (efficacy). According to Drugs@FDA, only 7. 4 % of the oral drugs are extended release forms probably showing colonic absorption. Therefore an early determination of a drug’s colonic absorption using the IntelliCap ® in animals or humans will provide the mandatory information to initiate or stop a SR form development. Diltiazem (60 mg) {{is used in the}} oral swallowable IntelliCap ® and the marketed SR form from Mylan (coated beads). A human study with 14 healthy volunteers compared the Mylan formulation with the IntelliCap ® device that releases the drug identical to the in-vitro dissolution of the Mylan product. The plasma profiles of IntelliCap ® and Mylan formulation are highly similar. The mean AUC (bioequivalence fulfilled) and mean Cmax of IntelliCap ® shows only a difference of + 15 % and − 12 %, respectively. But the PK profile of the Mylan formulation shows a broader peak around Cmax. About 81. 8 % diltiazem was absorbed in the colon (IntelliCap®) comparable to former publications. The Mylan is a SR <b>diffusion</b> <b>coated</b> beads form whereas the IntelliCap ® is a monolithic capsule.

To solve this problem, the wear resistance level toward friction for piston ring during its interaction with the cylinder liner was enhanced using <b>diffusion</b> <b>coating</b> technique. The piston ring is made of ASSAB DF- 3 steel and several substances such as 0. 9 % carbon (C), 0. 85 % chromium (Cr), 96. 6 % ferric (Fe), 1. 2 % manganese (Mn) and 0. 55 % titanium. The chemical substance which is used for the diffusion process are the mixture of three substances i. e., chromium, ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) and aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). The piston ring together with the chromium mixtures were heated at different periods of time. In order to improve friction and wear, the piston ring which is coated with 99. 5 % chromium dust using a <b>diffusion</b> <b>coating</b> technique yields higher hardness compared to the original piston ring due to its resistance toward wear.
