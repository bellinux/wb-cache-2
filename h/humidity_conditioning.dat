Granule growth has been monitored using on-line impeller torque and evaluated as changes in granule particle size distribution with respect to the dry formulation. It is shown how the onset of granule growth is denoted by an abrupt increase in the torque value requires the amount of binder liquid added to be greater than a certain threshold that is identified here as ‘minimum liquid volume’. This minimum liquid volume is determined as a function of dry binder type, amount, hygroscopicity and particle size distribu- tion of diluent.

In recent years, for effective utilization method of Japanese cedar, the functions of air purification [1] and <b>humidity</b> <b>conditioning</b> [2 – 4] of Japanese cedar have been noted. These features {{have been reported to}} be excellent in end grain surface. However, Japanese cedar materials generally are often used by exposing the edge grain or flat grain surface in room. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} take advantage of their functions in end grain surface. Accordingly, to increase the exposed area of the end grain surface, the Japanese cedar material carved some slits in the fiber orthogonal direction in the flat grain surface which has already been put to practical use. So, the slit material of Japanese cedar is utilized in various products such as furniture and interior materials.|$|E

30|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{technology}} development to control the <b>humidity</b> <b>conditioning</b> performance of slit material made from Japanese cedar, {{the effects of the}} groove shape of slit samples, air convection, and heat treatment on moisture adsorption and desorption properties were studied.

However, the moisture adsorption and desorption rates were not increased with increase of depth of concave, although the end grain area was increased. On the other hand, reduced rates of the slit samples with deep concave were increased by air convection. The increase ratios of moisture adsorption and desorption rates were larger in samples with deep concave. Equilibrium moisture content was decreased with increase of heat treatment temperature. Pore volume of micropores smaller than 0.6  nm was decreased with increases of heat treatment temperature.

The weight of each sample in the adsorption process was measured after 30  min, 1  h, 1  h 30  min, 3  h, 6  h, 12  h, and 24  h. The specimen was quickly taken out from the desiccator and then the weight was measured using the electronic balance. After the measurements, specimen was returned to the desiccator quickly. Then the weight of each sample in desorption process was measured at constant temperature and room humidity (20  °C, 65  % R.H.) using the electronic balance. These measurements were carried out under windless or air convection.

40|$|International audienceThe {{fatigue design}} of short fiber {{reinforced}} thermoplastics components for structural {{applications in the}} automotive industry requires an accurate knowledge of the numerous factors affecting the fatigue lifetime (process, loading type, environment, etc).

In this study, {{a simple way to}} get the cyclic dissipated energy from thermal measurements is suggested, usable for homogeneous and heterogeneous dissipation fields. A so-called heat buildup protocol is used to relate the cyclic stress amplitude to the cyclic dissipated energy. The parameters of an energy based criterion can be obtained within one day and using only one specimen, which is of course of huge interest to investigate quickly the influence of numerous factors on the fatigue behavior.

50|$|Low <b>humidity</b> {{from air}} <b>conditioning</b> {{was found to}} be {{the most common cause of}} PICD. To the lay person a {{definition}} of low humidity being a physical irritant can be confusing because low humidity is a deficit (or absence) of an elemental substance, whereas all other irritants implicated in contact dermatitis are in concentrations of relative abundance. So the irritant is actually a lack of water vapour. This confusion is further compounded with the use of the term contact implying 'touching' (as is the case with all other forms of PICD) whereas in the case of low humidity PICD there is an absence of contact with water vapour.|$|R

The working principle of the THIC device is to adjust the chilled water flow rate in a cooling coil (CC) to maintain constant temperature and to adjust the apparatus dew point temperature of the CC to maintain constant humidity. A split-range control strategy is developed to control the cooling coil with the THIC device, the heater and the humidifier to achieve reliable control of indoor temperature and humidity while minimizing energy use.

Local humidity can be raised by locating the bonsai containers over a tray of water, or by placing them in a bed of dampened sand.

In this study, penetration of LMWP resin into finger-jointed lamina was examined.

In addition, the bonding quality and nail-withdrawal resistance of 3 -ply assembly specimen made from LMWP-resin-treated and untreated lamina bonded using resorcinol–phenol formaldehyde resin adhesive were also investigated. The main results were as follows: LMWP resin was found to have penetrated sufficiently into finger-jointed lamina. The physical properties of LMWP-resin-treated lamina were found to have improved significantly in comparison with untreated lamina. However, no significant difference was found between LMWP-resin-treated and untreated lamina in terms of their mechanical properties.

40|$|Providing {{sufficient}} {{amounts of}} outdoor air to occupants {{is a critical}} building function for sup-porting occupant health, well-being and productivity. In tropical climates, high ventilation rates require substantial amounts of energy to cool and dehumidify supply air. This study evaluates the energy consumption and associated cost for thermally conditioning outdoor air provided for building ventilation in tropical climates, considering Singapore as an exam-ple locale. We investigated the influence on energy consumption and cost of the following factors: outdoor air temperature and humidity, ventilation rate (L/s per person), indoor air temperature and <b>humidity,</b> air <b>conditioning</b> system coefficient of performance (COP), and cost of electricity. Results show that dehumidification of outdoor air {{accounts for more than}} 80 % of the energy needed for building ventilation in Singapore’s tropical climate. Improved system performance and/or a small increase in the indoor temperature set point would per-mit relatively large ventilation rates (such as 25 L/s per person) at modest or no cost incre-ment. Overall, even in a thermally demanding tropical climate, the energy cost associated with increasing ventilation rate up to 25 L/s per person is less than 1 % of the wages of an of-fice worker in an advanced economy like Singapore’s. This result implies that the benefits of increasing outdoor air ventilation rate up to 25 L/s per person — which is suggested to pro-vide for productivity increases, lower sick building syndrome symptom prevalence, and re-duced sick leave — can be much larger than the incremental cost of ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Approximately 16. 2 % of the Japanese {{population}} {{suffers from}} pollinosis. One {{of the forms}} of management is self-care (preventive care), which can be categorized as 'indoor' and 'outdoor'. Outdoor self-care is usually emphasized, but indoor self-care is also important. Considerable pollen is found in indoor dust and this {{is thought to be}} one of the factors that worsens pollinosis and enables it to persistent for a long time, even after the pollinating period has finished. Taking this into consideration, we investigated the dynamic state of indoor pollen. Methods: Floating indoor house dust was collected in Petri dishes. The amount of pollen in the house dust samples collected was measured using an LCD laboratory highly sensitive Cry j 1 assay kit. Results: The results showed that, indoors, a lot of Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) was found on the floor (tatami mats, carpets), sofas and curtains. The number of JCP in living rooms peaked in April after the pollinating period and decreased gradually; however, JCP was still found indoors, even as late as the following February. Floating JCP in the house was one-tenth of the JCP levels on the floor.

One {{of the challenges}} of passive humidity control is regeneration of the materials applied for the purpose. This paper looks at solar regeneration of a silica gel layer (bed) for typical seasons {{of the year in}} Harare, Zimbabwe. This bed forms the primary system that is then used for drying room internal surfaces during the night. The extent of silica gel solar drying is the main attention of this investigation. Solar regeneration of a silica gel bed that forms a solar ‘absorber’ surface of a rectangular solar channel is investigated. Simple mathematical models are developed and subsequent spreadsheet simulations are carried out. Silica gel sorption models are from literature or estimated through curve-fitting of available data. Solar radiation falling on a vertical surface at a given orientation is evaluated from the global solar radiation data using a developed simulator based on correlations obtained from literature and measured solar radiation data from the local meteorological department. For a vertical solar channel of an air gap of 20 mm, and a height of 3 m, silica gel is regenerated to some quite low moisture content of circa 0. 06 kg/kg.

40|$|In this thesis, a well proven {{corrosion}} testing method developed by SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden (SP) ISO 21207 method B is modified {{in order to}} increase even further the acceleration factor of corrosion attacks by 40 %. The method combines <b>humidity</b> cycling with <b>conditioning,</b> drying as well exposure to corrosive substances SO 2, NO 2 and NaCl solution. ISO 21207 method B is modified into three modifications; Modification A, Modification B and Modification C. In Modification A the quantity of gas is increased by 50 % for SO 2 and 25 % for NO 2 during gas exposure. For Modification B the pH of the NaCl solution is decreased to 3 - 4, during salt spray test. The last Modification C is a combination between Modification A and B i. e. a higher quantity of gas and a lower pH. Coupons of aluminum, AluZn, carbon steel, copper and zinc are exposed, both at SP and at SAAB. The geometrical size of the coupons is 25 cm 2 and the coupons are prepared by grinding and polishing down to 9 µm diamond, washing with ethanol in ultrasonic bath, drying in warm air and weighed before test. The coupons are then exposed to salt and hostile gases according to ISO 21207 method B, Modification A, B and C. The corrosion products are then removed by chemical cleaning in ultrasonic bath and the total mass loss is calculated. In this thesis copper is the most interesting metal since the method is mainly used for electronic components where copper is the dominating metal. In the case of copper all tests accelerate the corrosion rate but Modification C accelerates the most. However, the corroded surface in Modification C is very different compared to that of the coupons exposed to the standardized method ISO 21207 method B.
