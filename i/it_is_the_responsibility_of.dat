5|$|Responsibility {{lies with}} parents for {{making sure that}} their {{children}} attend and register at school. The law states that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the municipality to give instruction and fund institutions (this includes teaching, substitute teaching, administration and specialist services), and provide special education if required. There are no entry requirements for pupils, and the acceptance rate is 100% at six years of age.|$|E
5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} of Lincolnshire is constituted as a council-manager form government with elements of home rule, which it adopted via ordinance in 1976. The village {{is headed by}} a mayor who presides over a board of six trustees at every meeting, although the daily functions of the village are carried out by a professional salaried village manager. Once elected, the mayor serves a four-year term; the elected trustees serve four-year terms that are staggered. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the mayor to appoint a village manager, although the manager cannot take office until the board has approved the mayor's choice.|$|E

The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of the clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets.|$|E
25|$|Dogs - Dogs are {{considered}} fielders, and they effectively switch side with each innings to constantly {{remain on the}} fielding side. If a dog catches the ball (the one-bounce rule is also often allowed), or if the dog (or any other pet) is hit by the ball on-the-full, the batsman is declared out. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the fielding team to chase dogs when required, but ultimately <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> the bowler to clean the ball of any slobber.|$|E
50|$|In 1906 {{the newly}} formed districts needed 105 {{additional}} classrooms. The state would not bond indicating <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> of each district, but the districts didn't have enough money. A company in New York, saw the potential here and bought the bonds to finance the new buildings. A new high school was built in each district.|$|R
2500|$|In baseball, {{a player}} {{correcting}} an umpire's call {{to his own}} team's detriment is unheard of, {{at least at the}} professional level. Individual responsibility and vigilance <b>are</b> part of <b>the</b> game's tradition. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> umpire's <b>responsibility</b> to make <b>the</b> right call, and matters of judgment are final. Similarly, when a runner misses a base or leaves too early on a caught fly ball, the umpire keeps silent, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fielder's <b>responsibility</b> to know where <b>the</b> runners <b>are</b> and to make an appeal. When a fielder pretends not to know where <b>the</b> ball <b>is</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "hidden ball trick"), the umpire keeps silent, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> runner's <b>responsibility</b> to know where <b>the</b> ball <b>is.</b>|$|R
50|$|A decision, whether <b>the</b> Goebel {{anticipation}} <b>was</b> held true or untrue, {{required a}} final hearing, {{but there was}} never a final hearing in the litigations using <b>the</b> Goebel-Defense. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> of <b>the</b> Edison Electric Light Co. to move the case in St. Louis to a final hearing. Probably they did it not because of the expiry date of Edison's patent in 1894 and high cost.|$|R
