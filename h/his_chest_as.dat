5|$|Although Jaidev tells Bhagavan that Munna killed Jahnavi, Bhagavan still {{believes}} that Jaidev {{should not have}} murdered Munna. After an emotional sequence, Jaidev shoots Bhagavan in <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> Bhagavan shoots Sandhya. Sandhya survives, but Bhagavan dies. Jaidev unites with Sandhya, and they both start a new and happy life.|$|E
5|$|His body {{features}} are a third nipple, a veal-shaped birthmark and {{a scar on}} <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> a result of having a pacemaker inserted into his heart after suffering {{from a heart attack}} on the air in 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
60|$|He groped back to <b>his</b> chair, <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> labouring <b>as</b> he sat down.|$|R
50|$|He also shoots rockets {{out of a}} panel {{located in}} <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and (<b>as</b> do Mol and Gam) shoots {{electrical}} bolts from his antennae.|$|R
60|$|Anderssen {{tried to}} reply, but a sudden fit of {{coughing}} choked him. There was an arrow entirely through <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and <b>as</b> he coughed {{the blood from}} his wounded lung poured suddenly from his mouth and nostrils.|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{positively}} received. Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry called the second season's opening [...] "a bloody winner" [...] {{and said that}} Hall's performance [...] "remains a towering achievement". IGN's Eric Goldman thought that the episode's biggest problem was [...] "having to follow up such a great first season", but called [...] "It's Alive!" [...] "a solid episode". He praised Dexter's flashbacks and Dexter and Debra's storylines, though he said that Doakes' following Dexter was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that LaGuerta's overhearing Lt. Esmee Pascal's private conversation was [...] "a bit contrived". Keith McDuffee of TV Squad [...] "love the flashbacks to a young Dexter and living Harry". Regarding the episode's end, he wrote that [...] "just as Dexter's heart beats out of <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>as</b> does ours." [...] Paula Paige, writing for TV Guide, said that the episode [...] "made for some exciting, heart-pounding fear" [...] and called the discovery of Dexter's corpses [...] "a fantastic storyline". She commended Benz for [...] "develop her character, Rita, into a person instead of just the shell of one she appeared to be". Blogcritics Ray Ellis commented, [...] "If [...] is any indication, Dexters second season looks to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters. It certainly sets up a number of plot complexities [...] and new devices that offer a myriad of new developments." [...] The A.V. Club critic Scott Tobias stated that [...] "the writers have done a solid job setting the table for season two".|$|E
2500|$|Superman's {{appeal to}} licensees rests upon the character's {{continuing}} popularity, cross market appeal {{and the status}} of the [...] "S" [...] shield, the stylized magenta and gold [...] "S" [...] emblem Superman wears on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>as</b> a fashion symbol. The [...] "S" [...] shield by itself is often used in media to symbolize the Superman character.|$|E
2500|$|... "From a wrestler's bridge, he'll let three 200 pound men {{stand on}} his body and will support them; from the same bridge he'll lift 150 pounds on his two hands; he'll show {{that he has a}} neck {{expansion}} of four and one-half inches; instead of using a derby hat on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>as</b> Burns did, he'll hold a small boy, place a tape around the lad and himself and after the youngster has been extricated will fill the tape with muscle, bone, and of course air from his lungs. [...] These are only a few of his stunts." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the TV series Smallville; the cover of issue #1 features the main character tied up as a scarecrow with a red 'M' painted on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> much <b>as</b> Tom Welling is in the first episode of Smallville and in related publicity material.|$|R
60|$|His eyes fluttered {{and went}} shut. His chin fell forward on <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> And even <b>as</b> they eased him {{down upon the}} {{blankets}} his snores were rising on the frosty air.|$|R
60|$|A {{wash and}} a change, {{together}} with a good breakfast, effected as much change in his spirits as in his appearance. Refreshed in mind and body, he slowly paced the deck, <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> expanding <b>as</b> he sniffed the fresh air, and his soul, encouraged by the dangers he had already passed through, bracing itself for fresh encounters.|$|R
2500|$|Hinn conducts regular [...] "Miracle Crusades"—revival meeting / faith healing events held {{in sports}} stadiums {{in major cities}} {{throughout}} the world. Tens of millions attend his Holy Spirit Miracle Crusades each year. Hinn claims to have spoken to one billion people through his crusades, including memorable crusades with attendance of 7.3million people (in three services) in India, the largest healing service in recorded history. Evander Holyfield, who {{was diagnosed with a}} non-compliant left ventricle, has credited his healing to Benny Hinn, stating that through God working through Hinn, he was healed as he had [...] "a warm feeling" [...] go through <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> Hinn touched him.|$|E
2500|$|The 1971 Lions {{began the}} season with high {{expectations}} and won four of the first five games. The season took a dramatic downward turn in the sixth {{game of the season}} against the Chicago Bears on October 24, 1971. In the final two minutes of the game, Lions wide receiver Chuck Hughes caught a 32-yard pass as the Lions attempted to rally from a five-point deficit. On the next play, Hughes collapsed on the field clutching <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> he fell. [...] He was given chest compressions by the team doctor and taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead within an hour. From that game forward, the Lions won only three of the remaining games, lost the final three games, and ended with a disappointing 7–6–1 record.|$|E
2500|$|During his National Service, he was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Horse Guards {{and served in}} Cyprus, where he was almost killed in a machine gun accident. Annoyed by a fault in the machine gun on his armoured car which he drove frequently, he seized {{the end of the}} barrel and shook it, accidentally triggering the mechanism so that the gun fired several bullets through <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> <b>As</b> a result of his injuries, he lost his spleen, one lung, several ribs, and a finger, and suffered from pain and recurring infections {{for the rest of his}} life. While lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance he said to his platoon sergeant: [...] "Kiss me, Chudleigh." [...] He later recalled that [...] "Chudleigh did not recognise the allusion and from then on treated me with extreme caution." [...] He was first treated for his injuries at Nicosia General Hospital. While recuperating from the accident in Italy, he began his first novel, The Foxglove Saga.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] said Kelly. [...] "I {{saw that}} he was dead, and I did not dare to remain. I {{straightened}} the knot in his tie, laid his hands reverently across <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and departed <b>as</b> I had come." ...|$|R
60|$|His host {{took the}} {{ambassador}} {{by the arm}} and led him into a retired corner. Monsieur de Lamborne was a tall, slight man, somewhat cadaverous looking, with large features, hollow eyes, thin but carefully arranged gray hair, and a pointed gray beard. He wore a frilled shirt, and an eye-glass suspended by a broad black ribbon hung down upon <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> <b>His</b> face, <b>as</b> a rule, was imperturbable enough, but he had the air, just now, of a man greatly disturbed.|$|R
5000|$|Mazinkaiser has Kaiser Scrander (or [...] "Kaiser Scrambler"), {{which is}} very similar to Jet Scrander in its colour scheme (red and yellow) and the fact that it's not part of the mecha but connects to it when required. Notably, since Kaiser can't use <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> plate <b>as</b> boomerang (a Great Mazinger gimmick) he uses Kaiser Scrander in a similar fashion, due to its sharp wings.|$|R
2500|$|The Gathic role of atar as {{the medium}} for {{detecting}} guilt {{is not directly}} evident in the later texts of the Avesta, but reappears in modified form as an allegory of burning and annihilating the Angra Mainyu through righteousness, [...] "where Asha Vahishta is identified at times with the household fire on the hearth." [...] There, [...] "identification in the realms of matter and of spirit serves only to bring more into prominence the main tenets of Zoroaster's teachings in regard to Asha" [...] (Dhalla, 1938:170). A vestige of the ancient institution of ordeal by heat is nonetheless present in Vendidad 4.54–55, where speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is punishable by flogging and is detected by the consumption of [...] "water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt." [...] The Zend translation/commentary on this passage translates [...] "blazing" [...] as having brimstone and sulphur, and notes that innocence or guilt was established by the consumption of this [...] "guilt-detecting liquid". Similarly, in the Denkard, Adharbad Maraspand—the Sassanid era high-priest to whom the collation of the Avesta texts is attributed—is purported to have nine measures of [...] "unburning molten zinc" [...] applied to <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> proof of accuracy of the sacred texts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I 've got my character," [...] the old fellow said, {{making a}} gesture with a skinny hand towards <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>as</b> {{if it were}} there he kept his character.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw his}} head back, and, {{expanding}} <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> though he already breathed more freely, nodded to both men, and, {{walking through the}} shop, passed {{out into the street}} and disappeared.|$|E
60|$|The ex-parson {{was sitting}} with his back against a gnarled stump, which gave him some support. He had his hand to <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and <b>as</b> he breathed a ghastly {{whistling}} sound came from the wound, and spirts of blood rushed from his mouth. His glazed eyes were fixed upon {{the man who had}} shot him, and a curious smile played about his thin lips.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 2010, Youngs {{launched}} a Kickstarter campaign to fund her third album and reached her goal of $20,000 in 28 hours. Her drummer, Elliot Jacobson, had <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> waxed <b>as</b> {{an incentive to}} reach the goal. The campaign ended on August 13, 2010 {{with a total of}} $38,543 and 646 backers. On February 7, 2012 the Kickstarter-backed third studio album, titled An Unwavering Band of Light was released.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Chalk {{could not}} {{restrain}} {{a cry of}} admiration as he clambered on board the Fair Emily. The deck was as white {{as that of a}} man-of-war, and her brass-work twinkled in the sun. White paint work and the honest and healthy smell of tar completed <b>his</b> satisfaction. <b>His</b> <b>chest</b> expanded <b>as</b> he sniffed the breeze, and with a slight nautical roll paced up and down the spotless deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] said Mr. Pyecroft, who {{received}} me on <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> a large rock receives a shadow, [...] "represents the Gnome arrivin' cautious {{from the direction}} o' Portsmouth, with Admiralty orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say! you {{put me in}} mind of a peacock," [...] {{said the}} twin. [...] "My, just see how he swells up!" [...] and Randy himself raised <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> high as possible.|$|E
60|$|Presently Kaviri's head {{began to}} whirl--objects became {{confused}} and dim before his eyes--there {{was a great}} pain in <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> he struggled for the breath of life that the thing upon him was shutting off for ever. Then he lost consciousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Bounce, laying bare <b>his</b> broad <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> if {{to receive}} the knife, [...] "only, p'r'aps, ye'll allow me to eat the first slice off myself afore ye begin, 'cause I couldn't well have my share afterwards, d'ye see? But, now I think on't, I'd be rather a tough morsel. Young meat's gin'rally thought the tenderest. Wot say ye to cuttin' up March first, an' tryin' me nixt?" ...|$|R
60|$|And then {{he stood}} for minutes {{drinking}} in deep breaths of the pure, sweet air of the new day. Beside him, a head taller, savagely strong, stood Billy Byrne, his broad shoulders squared, <b>his</b> great <b>chest</b> expanding <b>as</b> he inhaled.|$|R
50|$|In the back-story of Twilight Princess, the Triforce of Power, {{along with}} his own dark magic (which is rejuvenated by being close to the malice and hatred of the {{execution}} grounds), allowed Ganondorf to survive his execution {{at the hands of}} the Ancient Sages. At the end of the game, Link defeats him by using the Master Sword to impale him through the wound on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and <b>as</b> Ganondorf grows weak, the Triforce crest fades from his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I could! I wish I could!" [...] in {{his voice}} quivered an almost passionate regret, and a great sob heaved <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>as</b> he turned his face away to hide the love and longing, still so tender and so strong.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. Thank you. It's {{a weight}} off my mind," [...] says the trooper with a heave of <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>as</b> he unfolds {{his arms and}} {{puts a hand on}} each leg, [...] "though I had set my heart on being scratched, too!" ...|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt she}} had been {{attracted}} by the fire, stolen up in the confusion of the house, remained hidden whilst Mr. Newton was going to bed, and when the fire went out, settled herself on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>as</b> it seems he slept on his back, {{and it was a}} warm position.|$|E
6000|$|Upon which Doctor Crocus, {{who is a}} tall, fine-looking Scotchman, {{but rather}} fierce and warlike in {{appearance}} for a professor of the peaceful art of healing, bursts out of the concourse with his right arm extended, and <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> thrown out <b>as</b> far as it will possibly come, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|Hake, who {{possessed a}} soft and deep bass voice of very fine quality, at once acceded to {{the request for}} a song. Crossing his arms on <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and looking, <b>as</b> if in meditation, towards the eastern horizon, he sang, {{to one of his}} {{national}} airs, [...] "The Land across the Sea." ...|$|R
60|$|They set off again, pace by pace, so slowly. And {{every step}} {{seemed like a}} weight on <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> He felt <b>as</b> if his heart would burst. At last {{they came to the}} top. She stood enchanted, looking at the castle gate, looking at the cathedral front. She had quite {{forgotten}} herself.|$|R
