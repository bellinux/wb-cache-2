Colonization of dung piles by <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> can help facilitate the decomposition of dung, control dung-breeding pests, and cycle important nutrients into the soil to improve pasture quality. Cattle are grazed on pastures at various stocking densities {{depending on the type of}} grazing practice. The influence of grazing practices on <b>dung</b> <b>beetle</b> communities and services remains largely unknown. Our first study investigated <b>dung</b> <b>beetle</b> activity across different cattle grazing practices to determine how grazing might influence <b>dung</b> <b>beetle</b> abundance and diversity. <b>Dung</b> <b>beetle</b> populations were monitored throughout the grazing season on pastures that were grazed under various practices: non-grazed/hay, continuous grazing, low-stocking rotational grazing, and high-stocking (mob) rotational grazing. Results from this study showed significantly higher <b>dung</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity on pastures exposed to rotational grazing practices compared to continuous grazing or no grazing. In some cases, <b>dung</b> <b>beetle</b> abundance and species richness were significantly greater on pastures that were grazed through high-stocking rotational grazing compared to low-stocking rotational or continuous grazing treatments. Based on these data, rotational cattle grazing may favor the colonization of <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> on rangeland, regardless of stocking density. Our second study investigated whether <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> exhibit preferences for dung from cattle exposed to different grazing practices.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] The DEFRA ecosystem services framework was implemented in an entomological context to provide preliminary estimates of the economic value of four key ecosystem service benefits delivered by <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae) to the U. K. cattle industry and individual cattle farmers. These benefits included (i) reduced pest flies; (ii) reduced gastrointestinal parasites; (iii) reduced pasture fouling and (iv) increased soil nutrients. 2. A mesocosm experiment was carried out to quantify the impacts of anthelmintic treatment on dung removal by <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> when (i) cattle were excreting anthelmintics (which affect <b>dung</b> <b>beetles)</b> in a sufficient concentration to impact <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> and (ii) when cattle were not excreting dung containing anthelmintics (which affect <b>dung</b> <b>beetles)</b> in a sufficient concentration to impact <b>dung</b> <b>beetles.</b> 3. Inferring from our mesocosm experiment and existing data, {{the value of the}} benefits of <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> under current farming practices (and current anthelmintic usage) was estimated. We estimated the potential economic benefits if <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> were protected (i) under all entry-level agri-environment schemes; (ii) under organic schemes; or (iii) if farmers stopped treating adult cattle with anthelmintics during the grazing season. 4. While these estimates are preliminary, and should not be treated as definitive values, we suggest that <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> may be currently saving the U. K. cattle industry c. ? 367 ?million each year: c. ? 354 ?million in conventional systems and c. ? 13 ?million in organic systems. Annual benefits per cow are greater in organic systems (? 43. 47) compared with conventional systems (? 37. 42). 5. Protecting <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> under agri-environment schemes could save the U. K. cattle industry an additional ? 40. 2 ?million?year? 1 (? 4. 36 per cow), while protecting <b>dung</b> <b>beetles</b> under organic schemes could save ? 378 ?k year? 1 (? 1. 26 per cow). The cessation of, largely unnecessary, treatment of adult cattle with anthelmintics could save the U. K. cattle industry an additional ? 6. 2 ?million?year? 1 (? 1. 40 per cow) in addition to savings on the anthelmintics themselves. 6. These estimates are based on a large number of underlying assumptions and, thus, may be overestimating or underestimating the economic value of ecosystem services delivered by <b>dung</b> <b>beetles.</b> 7. The potential for using the DEFRA ecosystem services framework in an entomological context is highlighted.
