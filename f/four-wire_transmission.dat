The equipment was experimental and experimental verification {{of the various}} equipment practices and maintenance aids {{was perhaps the most}} important feature of the field trial.|$|E

Two-wire bus transmission {{is designed to}} replace the conventional RS 485 <b>four-wire</b> <b>transmission,</b> which saves 50 % of the conductive wire material. The experiment proves the feasibility {{of the system and}} the load capacity of the two-wire bus...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a simple}} process for calibrating a transient scattering range. The process uses a paraboloidal scatterer to transform an axially {{incident plane wave}} into a spherical wave. Since {{the magnitude of the}} scattered field is known analytically, one can simply calibrate a meas-urement system. In order to calculate the scattered field, we use a stereographic projection that has previously been called the reflector transform. This technique provides three advantages over traditional calibration with a sphere. First, it is potentially more accurate, since the scattering characteristics of a paraboloid are independent of frequency. There is no need to convert the measured time domain data to the frequency do-main in order to deconvolve the characteristics of the scattere ~ the entire process takes place in the time domain. Second, this technique is simpler to implement. Finally, this technique is appro-priate for certain anechoic chambers built of two-wire and <b>four-wire</b> <b>transmission</b> lines, where the incident field is not quite uniform. I...|$|E
