5|$|The Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story {{of the origin of}} Varahi. Varahi, with other Matrikas, <b>is</b> <b>created</b> by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has the ability – like Raktabija – to regenerate from his dripping blood.|$|E
5|$|The normal rhythmical heart beat, called sinus rhythm, is {{established}} by the sinoatrial node, the heart's pacemaker. Here an electrical signal <b>is</b> <b>created</b> that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract.|$|E
5|$|A second Overmind <b>is</b> <b>created</b> in Brood War, {{formed from}} {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. This second Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and {{intelligence}} of the original and is much weaker; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into remission, although dark templar energies are still needed to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar <b>is</b> <b>created</b> by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring {{is most likely to}} take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of the}} acne lesion.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect <b>is</b> <b>created</b> by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand <b>is</b> <b>created.</b> At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E

5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} {{variable stars}} {{are those that}} undergo {{a dramatic change in}} their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion <b>is</b> <b>created</b> when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.|$|E
5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity <b>is</b> <b>created</b> using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|Each row in a smartsheet {{may have}} files {{attached}} to it, emails stored within it, and a discussion board associated with it. When a new smartsheet <b>is</b> <b>created,</b> notifications are pushed out to staff to populate its rows and columns. As information is updated, other smartsheets tracking the same task, project or data-point are updated automatically. The service also has alerts for when a task deadline is coming up, and {{keeps track of}} document versions.|$|E
