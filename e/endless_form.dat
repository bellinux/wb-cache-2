This {{is for him}} both a livening and spiritualizing artistic activity, which utters words to that effect in an equilibrium of mind and life. An endless beautiful reflection underlies this activity and finds utterance in a poetical prose, in which the <b>endless</b> <b>form</b> coalesces with the endless material. Hölderlin’s letters, in particular the letters in lyrical prose in Hyperion, give evidence for the expressly and sensuous art of this coalescing...|$|E
40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA {{has been}} shown to exist as a linear, {{double-stranded}} molecule in the virion and as a non-linear (endless), episomal, nucleosomal form in latently infected trigeminal ganglia. The kinetics of the formation and appearance of endless viral genomes and the stability of linear genomes in neuronal cells are not well understood. Nerve growth factor (NGF) -differentiated PC 12 cells can sustain long-term, quiescent infections with HSV- 1. In this report, the structure and stability of HSV- 1 viral DNA in NGF-differentiated PC 12 cells was studied as a function of time following infection using both wild-type and replication-defective virus. Unexpectedly, unencapsidated linear genomes were stable in the nucleus of NGF-differentiated PC 12 cells for up to 2 – 3 weeks following infection, beyond the period at which there is no detectable viral gene expression. However, following infection with wild-type HSV, the majority of quiescent viral genomes were in an <b>endless</b> <b>form</b> after 3 – 4 weeks. These data suggest that the stability and fate of HSV- 1 DNA in non-mitotic neuronal-like cells is different from that in productively infected cells and thus there is a significant cellular role in this process. The relevance to the virus life-cycle in neurones in vivo is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Following infection, the {{physical}} state of linear {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) genomes may change into an “endless” or circular form. In this study, using Southern blot analysis of the HSV genome, we provide evidence that immediate-early protein ICP 4 {{is involved in the}} process of converting the linear HSV- 1 ICP 4 -deleted mutant strain d 120 genome into its <b>endless</b> <b>form.</b> Under conditions where de novo viral DNA synthesis was inhibited, the genome of the ICP 4 deletion mutant d 120 failed to assume an endless conformation following infection of Vero cells (compared with the ability of wild-type strain KOS). This defect was reversed in the Vero-derived cell line E 5, which produces the ICP 4 protein, suggesting that ICP 4 is necessary and sufficient to complement the d 120 defect. When ICP 4 protein was provided by the replication-defective DNA polymerase mutant HP 66, the genomes of mutant d 120 could assume an endless conformation in Vero cells. Western blot analysis using antibody specific to the ICP 4 protein showed that although the d 120 virions contained ICP 4 protein, the majority of that ICP 4 protein was in a 40 -kDa truncated form, with only a small fraction present as a full-length 175 -kDa protein. When expression of ICP 4 protein from E 5 cells was inhibited by cycloheximide, the d 120 virion-associated ICP 4 protein was unable to mediate endless formation after infection of E 5 cells. Collectively, these data suggest that ICP 4 protein has an important role in mediating the endless formation of the HSV- 1 genome upon infection and that this function can be provided in trans...|$|E

40|$|Colour is {{the most}} enriched and <b>endless</b> <b>form</b> of human life. It {{reflects}} our mood and more importantly, it has more influence and effect on our lives than we realize. How can we define colour, a reality, a feeling that creates energy, enthusiasm, potential, anger, affection, passion and many other feelings in us. If we are in pleasant feeling, colour fills us with the feel of joy and happiness and in contrary to this if we are unhappy and sad the colours are there, who fill with the feel of unhealthy, unhappiness and sadness. Now {{it is a matter}} to think upon that why we correlate our feelings with colour or how colour reflects our mood or our internal expressions in a physical manner. It is not only because of colour but of course because of its composition too. We always look for a new colour palette range or a new invention but have we ever thought that from where did colours come and why they show their impact on us and our lives. Craving for colour, forces human to create invent and generate inventions, of course a human with artistic or creative brain and heart, who not only evolve in engraving of colours but also put efforts in to it to foster. A new innovation of colour means an exploration of colour, technology, culture and positive or negative impact on social psychological, physical life too. Often we use our personal choices to colour selection and it is influenced by inherited habits and culture. All colours have different – different impacts to others for example for common person a banana is of yellow colour while at the other hand of extreme it may be a colour of expressing emotion for a painter and so on the other colours too. If an external beauty whether it is a painting, a sculpture, a home, a dress or any place, if it is not explained with a sublime way, it is untrustworthy or a failure of composition. Colour {{is the most}} important element of any composition and similarly a composition means meticulously selecting what elements will appear in the picture and then placing them carefully in the frame to create a balanced and interesting organization. A composition is to accumulate the small - small units or elements, so the entire beauty of that composition will come to its best way of presentation...|$|E
