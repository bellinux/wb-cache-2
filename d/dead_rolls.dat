Once the end of Million <b>Dead</b> <b>rolled</b> around, I just didn’t {{want to be in}} a band anymore. The last year of Million Dead was just murderous.

50|$|E. insularis females hunt, {{usually in}} {{sunshine}} for retreat-making spiders in the concealed places where female spiders retreat to, such as <b>rolled</b> <b>dead</b> leaves; hollow plant stems; flax bushes; <b>dead</b> <b>rolled</b> fronds of tree-ferns; the abandoned cocoons of the bag-moth Liothula omnivora; deserted galleries of wood-boring beetles; {{and even the}} empty hatched galls of the moth Morova subfasciata in Muehlenbeckia australis and beneath loose bark on tree trunks. When she finds a female prey spider the female E. insularis runs at it and as the spider lifts its legs to adopt a defensive posture she stings it and lays her egg before moving away. The paralysis is light and the host usually recovers quickly and resumes movement. E. insularis does not normally build a nest but the host is usually parasitised on or near its retreat or some time after being parasitised spins its own retreat, the wasp larva being quite tolerant of the host spider's movement. If the host was gravid any eggs laid may be eaten by the wasp larva {{as well as the}} host herself.|$|R

5|$|With the {{increased}} number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I, Winston Churchill agreed to Ware's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths. A supplemental chapter {{was added to the}} Imperial War Graves Commission's charter on 7 February 1941, empowering the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War, which resulted {{in the creation of the}} Civilian War <b>Dead</b> <b>Roll</b> of Honour. The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67,000civilians. The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended. The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956; it added the final volume to the showcase in 1958.|$|R
5000|$|Greensky Bluegrass is a five-piece American bluegrass/rock band {{founded in}} Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2000. The band {{has evolved over}} the years, growing from 3 to 5 members, adding {{electric}} effects and touring with a full light show. [...] "The whole notion of “traditional bluegrass” strangely remains a sticking point for plenty of the genre's faithful. Partly because of their name, every article written about the band addresses the fact that what Greensky does is “not quite” bluegrass. These depths have been plumbed. In fact, in their own promotional material, GSBG describes their sound as “their own version of bluegrass music, mixing the acoustic stomp of a stringband with the rule-breaking spirit of rock & roll.” Greensky Bluegrass is known for their improvisation, multiple set shows, and open audience recording policy (akin to Phish and The Grateful Dead) and have broken through to a multi genre fanbase covering songs from Bruce Springsteen, Aerosmith, John Hartford, Dawes, Phish, The Grateful <b>Dead,</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stones, Prince and more.|$|R

50|$|Dogs can be {{obtained}} when created with the household, or can be adopted by computer or cell phone after the household has already been created. Sims who are giving them away will also put an advertisement in the newspaper. Sims will occasionally encounter stray dogs. These dogs can be befriended and adopted by the player. Most popular dog breeds are offered in the game. Breed {{has nothing to do}} within gameplay except the appearance of offspring. The reinforcement social system is used to correct bad behaviors and to praise good ones. Getting by with no punishment for bad behavior can lead a dog to take on that trait. Both dogs and cats can obtain fleas while outdoors. These make them very uncomfortable, and they can pass them to other pets and sims. When grown up, adult dogs can learn tricks, guard the house, and hunt for objects. They can be taught six tricks: sit, sit up, play <b>dead,</b> <b>roll</b> over, speak, and shake. Dogs can also be taught to hunt. They cannot learn on their own, but if taught, they can sniff out gems, metals and bones.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study is the {{high-carbon}} tool cast steel G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 3 - 3 used for metallurgical rolls, especially in section rolling mills. The test material was derived from a roll damaged in production; therefore, the authors had the material in a raw state at their disposal, on which they were able to carry out additional heat treatment operations. The pearlitic matrix of casting steel G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 3 - 3 allows machining to be done to modify the pass or to remove any defects, and the primary and secondary precipitates of carbides enhance the tribological properties. The authors have been for years involved in the optimization of the structure of this material by slight correction to its chemical composition and/or the modification of heat treatment. The presented principles of heat treatment modifications will lead to considerable economic and ecologic profits. It has also been demonstrated that raising slightly the contents of carbide-forming elements, which markedly increases the quantity of transformed ledeburite, results in an enhancement of tribological properties. The analysis of a dozen or so rolls exploited down to the <b>dead</b> <b>roll</b> diameter has shown that roll of cast steel with increased contents of carbon and carbide-forming elements exhibit better service properties, as characterized by the amount of feedstock rolled. Such a method of enhancing the service properties required the assessment of fracture toughness, which was verified using the linear-elastic methods of fracture mechanics...|$|R
