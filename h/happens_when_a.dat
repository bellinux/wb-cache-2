5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> {{situation is}} presented that {{can either be}} rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} that <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia {{is a major}} limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E

25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> signal and a masker are played together. It also <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E

It <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> trademark becomes so common that it starts {{being used as a}} common name and the original company has failed to prevent such use. Once it has become an appellative, the word cannot be registered any more; this is why companies try hard not to let their trademark become too common, a phenomenon that could otherwise be considered a successful move since it would mean that the company gained an exceptional recognition.|$|E
25|$|Each {{team can}} field six players {{at a time}} on the court, one player being a goalkeeper. But the coach can take the goalkeeper off for {{a short amount of}} time, and switch him with a field player. This can make {{advantages}} for the attacking side of the team, and disadvantages {{when it comes to their}} own defence. The team is also allowed to change players any time in the game, usually they change the whole team. Individual substitution happens sometimes, but it usually <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> player is exhausted or is hurt.|$|E
25|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} that <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> body dissipates more heat than it absorbs. Hypothermia {{is a major}} limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia in inadequately protected divers, although it is not often the direct clinical cause of death.|$|E

25|$|Iron {{deficiency}} <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> {{body has}} not enough (or not qualitatively enough) iron to supply its eventual needs. Iron {{is present in}} all cells {{in the human body}} and has several vital functions, such as: carrying oxygen to the tissues from the lungs as a key component of the hemoglobin protein; acting as a transport medium for electrons within the cells in the form of cytochromes; facilitating oxygen enzyme reactions in various tissues. Too little iron can interfere with these vital functions and lead to morbidity and death.|$|E
25|$|Collision {{detection}} typically {{refers to}} the computational problem of detecting the intersection {{of two or more}} objects. While the topic is most often associated with its use in video games and other physical simulations, it also has applications in robotics. In addition to determining whether two objects have collided, collision detection systems may also calculate time of impact (TOI), and report a contact manifold (the set of intersecting points). Collision response deals with simulating what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> collision is detected (see physics engine, ragdoll physics). Solving collision detection problems requires extensive use of concepts from linear algebra and computational geometry.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} reasons {{why some people}} suffer from more severe forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Different strains of viruses interacting with people with different immune backgrounds lead to a complex interaction. Among the possible causes are cross-serotypic immune response, through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement, which <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> {{person who has been}} previously infected with dengue gets infected for the second, third or fourth time. The previous antibodies to the old strain of dengue virus now interfere with the immune response to the current strain, leading paradoxically to more virus entry and uptake.|$|E

25|$|Plastid {{differentiation}} is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible. Chloroplasts may {{be converted}} to chromoplasts, which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit. Starch storing amyloplasts can also {{be converted to}} chromoplasts, {{and it is possible}} for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts. Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> carrot or a potato is illuminated. If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids. Chloroplast, amyloplast, chromoplast, proplast, etc., are not absolute statesâ€”intermediate forms are common.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> personâ€™s artery, which {{supplies}} blood to different areas of the brain, becomes blocked with a blood clot. This type of stroke happens 80% of the time. The blood clot may form in the blood vessel, which is called a thrombus, or the blood clot can travel from somewhere else in the blood system that is called an embolus. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or bursts. Overall, people experience bleeding inside or around brain tissue. This type of stroke happens 20% of the time and is very serious. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are weak vessels, traumatic injury, chronic high blood pressure hypertension, and an aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|A {{partnership}} reneges {{on their}} contract if they violate {{the rules of}} play; most often this <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> player plays off-suit when they could have, and therefore should have, followed suit. The penalty for reneging varies; in most cases it nullifies that team's contract (the team cannot make their contract and their score is reduced by 10 points for each bid trick), while sometimes reneging results in a three-trick penalty, meaning the team may still make contract but must take three additional tricks to do so. It does not matter if the player reneges on purpose. The bags still count against the opposing team, and will go against their points. On the other-hand if a team calls reneg and that team cannot prove or call out the first hand that was a potential reneg, then the team that called out the false accusation is penalized the three-trick penalty. The tricks do not count towards opponents bid.|$|E

In the song, Queen explores what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> relationship ends: [...] "Adam sinned because he loved Eve, the love of Celia and Pedro touched the stars, but only when you learn to value women, can you be happy".
