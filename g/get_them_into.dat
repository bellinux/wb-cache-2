5|$|The comics {{magazines}} {{showing up}} in Canada at the time suffered from promotion and distribution problems, however, getting most of their support from the fan press. Phil Seuling's California-based comics distributor Bud Plant was supportive of these underground and alternative comics, though, and helped <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> stores. Eventually, distributors like Bud Plant {{and the emergence of}} specialty comic shops would form a distribution network for small press comics that would thrive independently of the traditional newsstands.|$|E

They had their second innings victory in the BCCP Patron's Trophy in 1975-76 when Jalal Akbar took 11 for 59 against Pakistan Air Force. They won again by an innings in the BCCP Patron's Trophy in 1977-78 against the {{short-lived}} team from the Pakistan Security Printing Corporation.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Duke awakens to an exorbitant {{room service}} bill, and {{no sign of}} Gonzo (who has {{returned}} to Los Angeles while Duke slept), and attempts to leave town. As he nears Baker, California, a highway patrolman pulls him over for speeding, and advises him to sleep at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning {{that he has a}} suite in his name at the Flamingo Las Vegas so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy he has brought with him. Gonzo explains that Lucy has come to Las Vegas to meet Barbra Streisand, and that he gave her LSD on the plane not realizing she had never taken it before. Sensing the trouble this could <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into,</b> Duke convinces Gonzo to ditch Lucy in another hotel before her trip wears off.|$|E

25|$|The {{series has}} a number of {{parallels}} with long-running BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses, with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire and <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status than they really were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. Indeed, Only Fools and Horses creator / writer John Sullivan claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV's Minder, which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of Only Fools and Horses and Minder were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers (in the days before video recorders were commonplace in many UK homes).|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

Three decades later, Teller confirmed that it was during his visits that he concluded that Israel was in possession of nuclear weapons.

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave it a}} {{negative}} review stating, [...] "Thor is a failure as a movie, but a success as marketing, an illustration of the ancient carnival tactic of telling the rubes anything to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> the tent". A.O. Scott of The New York Times also disliked the film, calling it [...] "an example of the programmed triumph of commercial calculation over imagination". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times had mixed feelings, describing the film as [...] "an aesthetic stand-off between predictable elements and unexpected ones". [...] Turan praised the performances of Hemsworth, Hopkins, and Elba, but found the special effects inconsistent and the Earth storyline derivative.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} at Kyongju {{during the evening}} of September 4 was tense. Kim Hong Il, The South Korean corps commander, proposed to evacuate the town.

Coulter told him that he would not move his command post. Coulter put four tanks around the building where the command posts were located.

Mirror Image Records' indie rock group HelenaMaria covered {{the song and}} released it as a digital single in March 2009. At auditions for the ninth season of the television singing competition American Idol, [...] "The Climb" [...] {{was the most popular}} choice of song amongst contestants. Mandi Bierly, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented, [...] "it sounds like we could get an Idol whose voice actually suits the inspirational tune that he or she will be forced to record as a first single. (Though the odds of that song being anywhere as good as 'The Climb'...)". While informing Cyrus of its popularity on American Idol, the series' host Ryan Seacrest commented that the contestants [...] "believe [...] a song that will make an impression and [...] will <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> that next level". Cyrus said she was pleased because the song was about [...] "following your dreams and not giving up". Alan Cumming covered the song in his cabaret tour and included it on the audio CD Alan Cumming Sings Sappy Songs: Live at the Cafe Carlyle. Australian Judah Kelly covered the song on his debut album, Count On Me (2017).|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She {{noted that the}} episode suffered from a [...] "bland story" [...] filled with [...] "bland teens", noting that the actors playing the three main teenagers were [...] "as generic as can be". Vitaris ultimately concluded that [...] "'Rush' is hardly the worst of The X-Files; it's merely forgettable." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, arguing that the show was re-using plot lines and that the personalities of the teenagers were wholly uninteresting. He wrote, [...] "This episode unfolds with a bland sense of familiarity. Once again, troubled adolescents are toying with paranormal forces that can only <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> further trouble. Sadly, these adolescents lack interesting personalities, and the force in question remains wholly mysterious." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the episode was [...] "Not brilliant, but moderately entertaining." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. Despite praising the episode's set pieces, they ultimately concluded that [...] "The X-Files just isn't cool anymore daddio." ...|$|E
