5000|$|Congreve {{appears to}} have been unaware that rolling ball clocks had been invented earlier by both Nicolas Grollier de Servi√®re and Johann Sayller. Congreve's version {{differed}} from Grollier's rolling ball clock in that the ball travelled down a zig-zag rather than straight path. While Sayller's version had also used a zig-zag path, it had utilized a number of balls and a <b>fixed</b> <b>table</b> rather than the single ball and tilting table employed by Congreve. The [...] "Extreme Detached Escapement" [...] (as Congreve referred to his escapement design) was patented in 1808. Congreve, who was not a clock maker, hired Gravel and Tolkien to produce the first working version, which he then presented to the Prince of Wales in 1808.

The sail logo was the Thunderbird logo inside a large letter P. It was a scaled-up version to a LOA of 32 ft. It was made in Japan of fiberglass covered plywood. It had a fixed keel with a depth of about 6 ft, a beam of about 9.5 ft, a self-bailing cockpit, and an inboard engine. The mast height and sail area were also reduced somewhat, so the boat was more stable. Below it had headroom of about 6 ft, a spacious enclosed head, a <b>fixed</b> <b>table</b> with folding leaves, a full galley (sink, icebox, counter, and stove), and births for 5 (with the fifth birth running under the port side cockpit seat).

He served as the Governor of Kashmir (1820-21), Greater Hazara (1822-1837) and was twice appointed the Governor of Peshawar (1834-5 & 1836-his death). In his private capacity, Hari Singh Nalwa was required to administer his vast jagir spread all over the kingdom. He {{was sent to the}} most troublesome spots of the Sikh empire in order to [...] "create a tradition of vigorous and efficient administration". The territories under his jurisdiction later formed part of the British Districts of Peshawar, Hazara (Pakhli, Damtaur, Haripur, Darband, Gandhgarh, Dhund, Karral and Khanpur), Attock (Chhachch, Hassan Abdal), Jehlum (Pindi Gheb, Katas), Mianwali (Kachhi), Shahpur (Warcha, Mitha Tiwana and Nurpur), Dera Ismail Khan (Bannu, Tank, and Kundi), Rawalpindi (Rawalpindi, Kallar) and Gujranwala.

40|$|The Wu-Kaplan {{radiation}} parameterization (Krishnamurthy, 1982) {{used in the}} GLA Global Circulation Model (GCM) was {{improved by}} replacing its fixed tables of CO 2 transmittance in the 15 micron band with models developed by regression on line-by-line transmittances. The transmittances between layers are modeled as products of effective sublayer transmittances. The GLA GCM was integrated for 20 days starting at OZ, January 21, 1979, using the transmittance model. In the control run the <b>fixed</b> <b>table</b> of 15 micron CO 2 transmittances is used. The effect of the change of initial cooling rate is illustrated by {{a map of the}} difference of 50 mb temperature after 6 hours. The cooling is reduced over high topography, where the <b>fixed</b> <b>table</b> underestimates the transmittance, and is reduced slightly throughout the tropics and the north polar area where the stratosphere is relatively cold. Over elevated topography the surface cooling increases, also as expected. The stratospheric temperature increases over a degree in the arctic and smaller amounts over Antarctica and elsewhere.

40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} a cryptanalytical technique for distinguishing some stream ciphers from a truly random process. Roughly, the ciphers {{to which this}} method applies consist of a &quot;non-linear process &quot; (say, akin to a round function in block ciphers), and a &quot;linear process &quot; such as an LFSR (or even <b>fixed</b> <b>tables).</b> The output of the cipher can be the linear sum of both processes. To attack such ciphers, we look for any property of the &quot;non-linear process &quot; that can be distinguished from random. In addition, we look for a linear combination of the linear process that vanishes. We then consider the same linear combination applied to the cipher's output, {{and try to find}} traces of the distinguishing property...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the B-coder, an {{efficient}} binary arithmetic coder that performs extremely well {{on a wide}} range of data. The B-coder should be classed as an `approximate‚Äô arithmetic coder, because of its use of an approximation to multiplication. We show that the approximation used in the B-coder has an efficiency cost of 0. 003 compared to Shannon entropy. At the heart of the B-coder is an efficient state machine that adapts rapidly to the data to be coded. The adaptation is achieved by allowing a <b>fixed</b> <b>table</b> of transitions and probabilities to change within a given tolerance. The combination of the two techniques gives a coder that out-performs the current state-of-the-art binary arithmetic coders...|$|E
30|$|These {{results are}} all highly suggestive of stress {{reduction}} with robotic assistance. However, some critical remarks must be made. Firstly, {{this study was}} carried out under simulated, experimental conditions. Stressful or distracting factors that may be present in a real life theatre setting were absent in this experimental setup; therefore, these results may not be directly comparable with stress in actual surgical situations. Secondly, throughout the RALS task performance, subjects remained in a seated position and this may have influenced our results; however, this does reflect the surgeons position during actual robotic surgery. The <b>fixed</b> <b>table</b> height for all participants during the SLS tasks compared to the adjustable stool height and robotic arm position during the RALS tasks may also have impacted the results.|$|E
40|$|Experiments using a plastic-moderated {{assembly}} as a {{radiation source}} are described, and the hazards attendant to these experiments are evaluated. The critical assembly, designated Battelle's Plastic Reactor Facility, is {{constructed in the}} form of a cube. A portion of the plastic and fuel will be removed from the center of this reactor to provide a radiation environment for exposing fission-chamber devices. This central void region will approximate a flux trap in which a bigh neutron-to-gamma ratio is expected. The fuel-element assemblies are composed of strips of aluminum and Teflon-coated uranium sandwiched with plastic and encased in aluminum boxes. One portion of the core is on a movable table, while the other part is on a <b>fixed</b> <b>table.</b> The core is assembled remotely by driving the movable table against the <b>fixed</b> <b>table.</b> Primary control and safety of the assembly are achieved by insenting or withdrawing regulating and safety elements and by increasing or decreasing the distance between the two core halves. For safety, the maximum normal rate of reactivity addition has been limited to 0. 04 % DELTA k/k per sec for control-element withdrawal and table closure. The system is interlocked so that only one control element can be withdrawn at a time and so that the movable table and elements cannot be moved simultaneously. In addition, criticality cannot be reached by only moving the tables together. No experiments with the Plastic Reactor Facility are planned since it will serve only as a source of radiation operating at a constant power level. Consequently, the hazards of a nuclear excursion are minimized. However, the safety aspects of the operations and possible power excursions have been analyzed. The analysis indicates that these operations present no significant hazard to the public persons or operating staff. (auth...|$|E

50|$|One of the {{challenges}} of frequency-hopping systems is to synchronize the transmitter and receiver. One approach {{is to have a}} guarantee that the transmitter will use all the channels in a fixed period of time. The receiver can then find the transmitter by picking a random channel and listening for valid data on that channel. The transmitter's data is identified by a special sequence of data that is unlikely to occur over the segment of data for this channel, and the segment can also have a checksum for integrity checking and further identification. The transmitter and receiver can use <b>fixed</b> <b>tables</b> of channel sequences, so that once synchronized they can maintain communication by following the table.
