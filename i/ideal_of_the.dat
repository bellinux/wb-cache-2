5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosopher king. Bede also {{makes it clear that}} the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated from the time of Aldfrith's death.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She {{was inspired by the}} example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E

5|$|The DEQ has {{collected}} water-quality {{data in the}} Rogue basin since the mid-1980s and has used it to generate scores on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). The index is meant to provide an assessment of water quality for general recreational uses; OWQI scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (<b>ideal).</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> eight Rogue basin sites tested during the water years 1997–2006, five were ranked good, one was excellent, and two—Little Butte Creek and Bear Creek, in the most populated part of the Rogue basin—were poor. On the Rogue River itself, scores varied from 92 at RM138.4 (RK222.7) declining to 85 at RM117.2 (RK188.6) but improving to 97 at RM11.0 (RK17.7). By comparison, the average OWQI score for the Willamette River in downtown Portland, the state's largest city, was 74 between 1986 and 1995.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

25|$|Given {{a subset}} U of An, can one recover {{the set of}} polynomials which {{generate}} it? If U is any subset of An, define I(U) to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains U. The I stands for ideal: if two polynomials f and g both vanish on U, then f+g vanishes on U, and if h is any polynomial, then hf vanishes on U, so I(U) is always an <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial ring k.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book Schleiermacher gave {{religion}} an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation.

25|$|An {{algebraic}} set {{is called}} irreducible if it cannot be written as {{the union of}} two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the irreducible components of the algebraic set. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a variety. It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety {{if and only if}} it may be defined as the vanishing set of a prime <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polynomial ring.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> {{this work}} is to study <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Goldman Lie algebra S.

For Z-module case, we proved that there is an infinite class <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> S that contain a certain finite set of free homotopy classes. For Q-module case, we can classify all <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new structure and consequently obtain a new class <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original structure. Finally, we show an interesting infinite chain <b>of</b> <b>ideals</b> that are not those ideals obtained by considering the new structure. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
