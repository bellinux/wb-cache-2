5000|$|Jaroslawski {{collaborated with}} Baccarat for the perfume bottles but also had {{commissioned}} Lalique {{to create the}} luxurious Art Nouveau glass medallions. Baccarat produced the classic Ybry perfume bottle, a flattened square in colored crystal. These beautiful bottles were made by overlaying colored crystal on white crystal to create an opaque and unique luminescent quality. Each different color, was related to a particular perfume, and to a different gem. The colors range from a red, slag green to a darker green, jet black, orange to butterscotch, deep purple to lavender. Most of the time, the bottles had matching enameled and gilded metal covers. These covers were placed over the inner stoppers at an angle on {{one corner of the}} bottle. The atomizers came equipped with either chrome or gilt brass hardware. The colored bottles had round gold foil <b>embossed</b> labels, the <b>black</b> bottles had square, silver foil embossed labels. This bottle received a patent granted on 1925.The bottles ranged in size from 7 7/8" [...] tall down to diminutive sample sizes of just 1 3/8" [...] tall. The presentation boxes were covered with fine leather and often had color-coordinated small triangular segments and luxurious silk tassels. Other boxes looked like little suitcases and were covered in suede, and held multiple presentations, such as three bottles and two atomizers. Another rare example held two bottles, one atomizer and a Lalique medallion attached to the case with a silk tassel.|$|R
