5|$|Stuyvesant High School {{is named}} after Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch {{governor}} of New Netherland before the colony was transferred to England in 1664. The school was established in 1904 as a manual training school for boys, hosting 155 students and 12 teachers. In 1907, it moved from its original location at 225 East 23rd Street to a building designed by C. B. J. Snyder at 345 East 15th Street. The building, built in 1905 for $1.5 million, housed the Stuyvesant campus for the next 85 years. The school became renowned for excellence <b>in</b> <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>science,</b> and enrollment continued to grow so that by 1919, admission began to be restricted based on scholastic achievement. Stuyvesant went on a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students, with some students attending {{in the morning and}} others in the afternoon and early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until 1956.|$|E
5|$|While the {{vocational}} proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools {{for gifted students}} or those wishing to study a specific subject. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk {{to prepare students for}} a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing <b>in</b> <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>science.</b> Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, {{and by the time he}} left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before calculators, people would use {{mathematical}} tableslists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying argumentsto simplify and speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common <b>in</b> <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>science</b> textbooks.

Methods of numerical approximation existed, called prosthaphaeresis, that offered shortcuts around time-consuming operations such as multiplication and taking powers and roots. Astronomers, especially, were concerned with methods that could speed up the long series of computations involved in celestial mechanics calculations.|$|E

25|$|AAST {{was founded}} on a charter school {{framework}} in 1992 with the mission of preparing students for careers <b>in</b> <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>science</b> by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment.

The roots of the program {{can be seen in}} its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology, and physics, and its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. This academy celebrated ten years of excellence in 2006-07. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies.|$|E
25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses <b>in</b> <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>science</b> and vice versa.|$|E

500|$|Partnerships in Mathematics and Science (PIMS) {{began in}} Eva Evans's {{administration}} in 1994, {{and was a}} part of the SPIRIT program during the Linda White administration. Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, [...] "As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. We always had high GPA requirements. [...] And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for our girls. [...] We need more black women in those fields." [...] The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the National Science Foundation and historically black colleges from across the country. Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies. For example, a PIMS program at Park Street Elementary School in Marietta, Georgia, consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided educational field trips in order to stimulate involvement <b>in</b> <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>science.</b> Also, a national P.I.M.S.

While he held an impressive record on the drill field and baseball diamond, Crane generally did not excel in the classroom. Not having a middle name, as was customary among other students, he took to signing his name [...] "Stephen T. Crane" [...] in order [...] "to win recognition as a regular fellow". Crane was seen as friendly, but also moody and rebellious. He sometimes skipped class in order to play baseball, a game in which he starred as catcher. He was also greatly interested in the school's military training program. He rose rapidly in the ranks of the student battalion. One classmate described him as [...] "indeed physically attractive without being handsome", but he was aloof, reserved and not generally popular at Claverack. [...] Although academically weak, Crane gained experience at Claverack that provided background (and likely some anecdotes from the Civil War veterans on the staff) that proved useful when he came to write The Red Badge of Courage.|$|E
