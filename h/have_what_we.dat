From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should <b>have.</b> <b>What</b> <b>we</b> did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} the album is derived from a lyric from {{the bridge of the}} song [...] "Don't Stop". Taggart {{described}} the rationale behind choosing that title. [...] "'Don’t Stop' {{was one of the last}} songs we recorded, and that one kinda summed up all the stuff we had gone through. Raine had just gotten back from Sudan, he was trying to compress all the things he’d experienced. The shock was going there and then coming back here and realizing they have happiness and hope with no material possessions, they live in mud huts. But they <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want emotionally, you know." ...|$|E

In contrast, we find that if a client <b>has</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call a file transferor utility function, with a bounded file length, the client should be unwilling to pay until the final time slot of her file transfer. We also analyze a Bayesian model in which the provider does not know whether he faces a web browser or file transferor type client, and study the case where there is no bound on the client's file length...|$|R
