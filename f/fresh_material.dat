25|$|In {{addition}} to these and many more names, we must mention the numerous religious who seek in the archives <b>fresh</b> <b>material</b> for general ecclesiastical history, or {{the history of their}} order, e. g. the Benedictines and the Bollandists. The writer has observed at work in the archives during the last twenty-one years Dominicans, Jesuits, Franciscans, Minor Conventuals, Capuchins, Trinitarians, Cistercians, Benedictines, Basilians, Christian Brothers, Lateran Canons Regular, Vallombrosans, Camaldolese, Olivetans, Silvestrines, Carthusians, Augustinians, Mercedarians, Barnabites, and others. Women have at times secured temporary admittance, though for intelligible reasons this privilege is now restricted. Since 1879 the archives have welcomed Catholics, Protestants, Hebrews, believers and infidels, Christians and heathens, priests and laymen, men and women, rich and poor, persons of high social standing and plain citizens, of every nation and language. The writer is acquainted with nearly all the great archives of Europe, and knows that none of them afford similar facilities to the historical student or extend him more courtesy.

25|$|Mydland {{died of a}} {{speedball}} overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, {{leading him}} {{to believe that the}} band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's keys musically drove Garcia to new heights on stage. As the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with <b>fresh</b> <b>material.</b> The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a methadone clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{collected}} by the botanist William Russell Dudley in October 1888, in Tompkins County, New York. American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, who described it in the 1894 Annual Report of the New York State Botanist, named it Peziza Dudleyi after its discoverer. Peck noted a physical resemblance to P.aurantia (now known as Aleuria aurantia) and P.inaequalis, and said {{that it could be}} distinguished from those species by its yellow hymenium and larger spores. Several mycologists have considered the species to be synonymous with S.coccinea. However, as was later pointed out by Harrington (1990), [...] "the importance of <b>fresh</b> <b>material</b> for species diagnosis, especially for noting ascospore guttulation, cannot be overstated. Although I had examined material (dried herbarium specimens) from western North America I was not prepared to recognize that group as a species distinct from the two, large eastern North American species until I saw fresh (living) material." [...] As is the case with many fungi, microscopic differences between similar species can only be accurately determined by examining <b>fresh</b> <b>material.</b> Harrington analyzed herbarium specimens and <b>fresh</b> <b>material</b> of North American specimens of [...] "S.coccinea", and found that both S.dudleyi and S.austriaca were commonly misidentified.

[...] These were all pulp magazines, which meant that despite the occasional high-quality story, most of the magazines presented badly written fiction and were regarded as trash by many readers.

40|$|Ahuna Mons is {{the highest}} {{mountain}} on Ceres. A unique complex in terms of size, shape, and morphology, Ahuna is bordered by flanks of the talus around its summit. Recent work by Ruesch et al. [2016] based on Dawn's Framing Camera images {{shed light on the}} possible origin of Ahuna Mons. According to Ruesch et al. [2016], Ahuna Mons is formed by a volcanic process involving the ascent of cryomagma and extrusion onto the surface followed by dome development and subsequent spreading. Here we analyzed in detail the composition of Ahuna Mons, using data acquired by the Visible and InfraRed spectrometer aboard Dawn. The spectral analysis reveals a relatively high abundance of carbonates and a non-homogeneous variation in carbonates composition and abundance along Ahuna's flanks, associated with a lower amount of the Ceres's ubiquitous NH 4 -phyllosilicates over {{a large portion of the}} flanks. The grain size is coarser on the flanks than in the surrounding regions, suggesting the presence of <b>fresher</b> <b>material,</b> also compatible with a larger abundance of carbonates. Thermal variations are seen in Ahuna, supporting the evidence of different compactness of the surface regolith in specific locations. Results of the spectral analysis are consistent with a possible cryovolcanic origin which exposed <b>fresher</b> <b>material</b> that slid down on the flanks...|$|R

500|$|Jainism {{speaks of}} karmic [...] "dirt", as karma {{is thought to}} be {{manifest}} as very subtle and sensually imperceptible particles pervading the entire universe. They are so small that one space-point—the smallest possible extent of space—contains an infinite number of karmic particles (or quantity of karmic dirt). It is these karmic particles that adhere to the soul and affect its natural potency. This material karma is called dravya karma; and the resultant emotions—pleasure, pain, love, hatred, and so on—experienced by the soul are called bhava karma, psychic karma. [...] The relationship between the material and psychic karma is that of cause and effect. The material karma gives rise to the feelings and emotions in worldly souls, which—in turn—give rise to psychic karma, causing emotional modifications within the soul. These emotions, yet again, result in influx and bondage of <b>fresh</b> <b>material</b> karma. Jains hold that the karmic matter is actually an agent that enables the consciousness to act within the material context of this universe. They are the material carrier of a soul's desire to physically experience this world. When attracted to the consciousness, they are stored in an interactive karmic field called , which emanates from the soul. Thus, karma is a subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul. When these two components—consciousness and ripened karma—interact, the soul experiences life as known in the present material universe.|$|E

This {{attracted the attention of}} Laurice Guillen, who bought the script (the first time in her career that she had done so) and signed on to direct the eventual film. The script was brought to Star Cinema, who became interested in producing it, but production stalled due to difficulties finding an appropriate actress to play Malen. Guillen stated that [...] "Since she was a Magdalene, she had to be sexy but she also had to be much more than that....I was shown many sexy actresses, some of them name stars, but I couldn't find my Santa-Santita. I felt that the role should go to someone relatively new, who had no fixed image, so {{that there would be no}} expectations". An additional problem was over the religious content of the film, which met with controversy. Guillen eventually found Angelica Panganiban to play Malen, and after five years without production, work on the film began for Unitel Pictures International, whose CEO stated that [...] "the majority of Filipinos, the so-called masses, are not the targets of this movie.
