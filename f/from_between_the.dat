5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E

5|$|There are ten National Treasures of six {{works of}} Japanese prose and mixed Chinese-Japanese poetry {{compiled}} <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> early 9th {{and the first}} half of the 13th century. The manuscripts in this list date <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> early 10th to the second half of the 13th century. The three volume Nihon Ryōiki was compiled by the private priest Kyōkai around 822. It is the oldest collection of Japanese anecdotes or folk stories (setsuwa) which probably came out of an oral tradition. Combining Buddhism with local folk stories, this work demonstrates karmic causality and functioned as a handbook for preaching. Two out of four extant distinct but incomplete manuscripts have been designated as a National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{excavations}} since 1998 {{have revealed}} additional skeletal elements belonging to Eolambia. It {{is now the}} most completely-known iguanodont <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Cenomanian and Santonian stages. Nearly every single skeletal element belonging to the taxon is represented by multiple fossils across existing collections. At least twelve individuals, including at least eight juveniles, were discovered in a quarry south {{of the town of}} Emery, including parts from both the skull {{and the rest of the}} body. The quarry is known as the Cifelli #2 Eolambia caroljonesa Quarry, or more formally CEUM locality 42em432v. Another quarry south of the town of Emery – the Willow Springs 8 quarry, or CEUM locality 42Em576v – preserves at least four juveniles. Material from these quarries was described in 2012 by Kirkland along with Andrew McDonald, John Bird, and Peter Dodson, who also provided an updated diagnosis for Eolambia based on this material.|$|E
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E

5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. In Scotland {{most of these are}} located in the south of the country {{in the area of the}} British successor states that would be known as the Hen Ogledd, or the Old North. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to around 450. A slightly later stone at Kirkmadrine commemorates sacerdotes, which may be bishops. Among the key indicators of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists, which are generally east-west in orientation, like Christian graves. These cemeteries are suspected, or known to be Christian, because of their proximity to a church, or because they have Christian inscriptions. They are found <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> end of the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland. Writing in the sixth century, St. Patrick also mentioned Coroticus, who probably ruled from the fort at Dumbarton rock and who had already accepted Christianity. The poem Y Gododdin, set in the early sixth century and probably written in what is now Scotland, indicates that the warriors of Gododdin, probably a kingdom based the site of modern Edinburgh, were Christian, receiving communion and confessing their sins before battle.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the kingdom of the East Angles can be {{determined}} from a variety of sources. Isolated to the north and east by the North Sea, there were mainly impenetrable forests to the south and the swamps and scattered islands of the Fens on its western border. The main land route from East Anglia would at that time have been a land corridor, along which ran the prehistoric Icknield Way. The southern neighbours of the East Angles were the East Saxons and across {{the other side of the}} Fens were the Middle Angles. It has been suggested that the Devil's Dyke (near modern Newmarket) at one time formed part of the kingdom's western boundary, but as its construction can only be dated <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 4th and 10th centuries, it cannot be established to be of Early Anglo-Saxon origin.|$|E
5|$|There are 29 National Treasures of 14 {{collections}} of waka and two works on waka style, compiled <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 8th and the mid-13th century with {{most from the}} Heian period. The two works of waka theory are Wakatai jisshu (945) and Korai fūteishō (1197). The collections include the two first imperial waka anthologies: Kokinshū (905, ten treasures) and Gosen Wakashū (951); seven private anthologies: Man'yōshū (after 759, three treasures), Shinsō Hishō (1008), Nyūdō Udaijin-shū (before 1065), Sanjūrokunin Kashū (ca. 1112), Ruijū Koshū (before 1120), Shūi Gusō (1216), Myōe Shōnin Kashū (1248); and five utaawase contents: including one imaginary content (Kasen utaawase), the Konoe edition of the Poetry Match in Ten Scrolls (three treasures), Ruijū utaawase, the Poetry competition in 29 rounds at Hirota Shrine and the Record of Poetry Match in Fifteen Rounds. The designated manuscripts of these works found in this list date from the Heian and Kamakura periods.|$|E

25|$|Part of a well-furnished pagan period mixed inhumation and {{cremation}} cemetery was excavated at Alwalton near Peterborough. Twenty-eight urned and two unurned cremations dating <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 5th and 6th centuries, and 34 inhumations, dating <b>from</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> late 5th {{and early}} 7th centuries, were uncovered. Both cremations and inhumations {{were provided with}} pyre or grave goods, {{and some of the}} burials were richly furnished. The excavation found evidence for a mixture of practices and symbolic clothing; these reflected local differences that appeared to be associated with tribal or family loyalty. This use of clothing in particular was very symbolic, and distinct differences within groups in the cemetery could be found.|$|E
