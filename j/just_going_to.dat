5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially {{believed that they}} were <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> transit through Russia, {{on their way to the}} Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Across {{the line}} of scrimmage, the Eagles had not huddled, as {{defensive}} coordinator Marion Campbell called for an all-out 11-man blitz. Edwards, who as a defensive back normally would have been several yards deep, was instead close enough to Kotar {{to talk to him}} (the Giants player assured him that his team was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kneel again). Vermeil later said the blitz made the victory possible.|$|E
5000|$|ESPN's Mike Breen, {{who called}} the Finals for ABC, added: [...] "It's {{just another example of}} how he's <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let them lose.

25|$|Speck had frequented Frank's Place, and {{the empty}} hog house {{was one of several}} he had helped build in the {{preceding}} month, so Monmouth police briefly questioned him about Pierce's death when he showed up to collect his final carpentry paycheck on April 15 and asked him to stay in town for further questioning. When police showed up at the Christy Hotel on April 19 to continue questioning Speck, they found he had left the hotel a few hours earlier, carrying his suitcases and saying he was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the laundromat. He had instead left town. A search of his room turned up a radio and costume jewelry Mrs. Virgil Harris had reported missing from her house, as well as items reported missing in two other local burglaries in the past month.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{according to}} which the entire Torah was principally written by Moses, the first tithe is contrasted with the poor tithe, and second tithe, as entirely different tithes from each other, {{and for this reason}} gave the tithes the distinct names they possess; these latter tithes, which are mentioned by the Deuteronomic Code, differ by not covering cattle or fruit, and rather than <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Levites, are in one case shared among the poor and other charitable destinations, and in the other go to the food producer themselves. According to some secular scholars, the poor tithe and the second tithe, when taken together, are a conflicting version of the same single tithe as the first tithe; the poor tithe and second tithe together being the Deuteronomist's version and the first time being the version of the priestly source.|$|E
500|$|According to Nickson, Carey {{chose to}} express her {{innermost}} feelings in her songs rather than becoming depressed and bitter throughout the hardships in her life.

500|$|Canavan has {{suffered}} from asthma {{since he was a}} child, and has battled throughout his career to control the ailment.

[...] In later years, however, improved medication has afforded Canavan what he described as, [...] "a better quality of life".|$|E
500|$|... "It was {{the toughest}} year we've ever had, {{figuring}} out what to pick up, because [...] were all really, really good. We do have room for another midseason show. We have some reality, and we'll probably have another scripted drama. We're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take a beat and see where we are. In all honesty, I think the Gossip Girl spinoff is the show that {{we would love to}} be able to find a place for as the season goes on." ...|$|E

I’m going to school. I hosted the Oscars. I take these projects seriously".|$|E

As a result of what Liz said, Kenneth breaks the fourth wall, a term used when a character in a television show, film or on stage directly addresses the audience, when he glances down at the logo.|$|E
500|$|McCartney has {{publicly}} professed support for Everton, and also shown favour for Liverpool. In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, [...] "Here's the deal: {{my father was}} born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if {{it comes down to}} a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> support them both because it's all Liverpool.'" ...|$|E

The Vikings wanted a four-year deal, but Munnerlyn signed a three-year deal so he could receive his third contract before turning 30. Munnerlyn stated, [...] "I had other visits set up but the number that Minnesota offered me was the number I was looking for. I was like, 'Man, instead of leaving this offer out there I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take this. I think this team is on the up. They {{got a lot of}} talent".|$|E
500|$|... "Greatest Hits" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} for married couple Rose and Bernard since the late second season and fans welcomed the recurring characters' return. [...] The writers cited the actors' other projects {{as a reason for}} their absence. [...] Additionally, it was feared that fans would complain if they appeared, when many actors with star billing had received limited screentime in the early third season. [...] The writers also commented that {{they do not want to}} have the couple on the show if they are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be standing in the background; they want to have Rose and Bernard in the show with interesting storylines.|$|E

Houchen later said that [...] "it {{was the only time}} I ever gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere... I said to Yvonne, 'I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take the money'". In doing so he rejected moves to Preston North End and Third Division Bury. He quickly regretted the move, and despite getting along well with manager Frank Barlow he found himself hating everything at the club, from the supporters to the Old Showground itself.|$|E

[...] The album only contained three guest features with Drake, Gucci Mane and Soulja Boy Tell 'Em. Songz {{wanted to keep the}} amount of features very limited, and stated that [...] "anybody else I add {{is going to be very}} special". American rapper Fabolous was added as a guest feature on the track, titled [...] "Say Aah".|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something {{you know a lot}} about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with HM Magazine, Steve Rowe of Mortification, {{one of the}} best known figures in the scene, implies that evangelism is of secondary importance and that Christian metal should first and foremost bring [...] "spiritual encouragement" [...] for its Christian listeners. Moberg (2006) suspects that Christian metal music may suggest dissatisfaction with traditional forms of worship among today's young Christians: [...] "They may not feel comfortable with <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church and singing hymns, they need an alternative means to express the same faith." [...] Apart from evangelism, Christian metal may also provide a means [...] "to get away from the image of Christianity as something rigid and boring".|$|E
