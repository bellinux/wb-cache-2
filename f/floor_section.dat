500|$|Filming for {{the castle}} {{interiors}} {{took place in}} the United Kingdom from June 5 to10, 1988, at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, England. On June 16 Lawrence Hall, London, was used for the airport interiors. Filming returned to Elstree the next day to capture the motorcycle escape, continuing at the studio for interior scenes until July 18. One day was spent at North Weald Airfield on June 29 to film Indiana leaving for Venice. Ford and Connery acted much of the Zeppelin table conversation without trousers on because of the overheated set. Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy interrupted the shoot to make a plea to the Parliament of the United Kingdom to support the economically [...] "depressed" [...] British studios. July20–22 was spent filming the temple interiors. The temple set, which took six weeks to build, was supported on 80 feet of hydraulics and ten gimbals for use during the earthquake scene. Resetting between takes took twenty minutes while the hydraulics were put to their starting positions and the cracks filled with plaster. The shot of the Grail falling to the temple floor—causing the first crack to appear—was attempted on the full-size set, but proved too difficult. Instead, crews built a separate <b>floor</b> <b>section</b> that incorporated a pre-scored crack sealed with plaster. It took several takes to throw the Grail from six feet onto the right part of the crack. July25–26 was spent on night shoots at Stowe School, Stowe, Buckinghamshire, for the Nazi rally.|$|E
2500|$|The current layout has {{the campus}} divided into sections, seven {{of which are}} in the main building. The [...] "A" [...] wing, with the cafeteria, music rooms, and a small, {{secondary}} gymnasium, is the westernmost portion of the building. The [...] "B" [...] wing, a newer component of the building, contains mostly the English and Mathematics departments. The bottom floor of the large, southern [...] "C" [...] wing holds the library and two lecture theatres. The upper floors contain computer, biology, chemistry, and physics laboratories as well as several classrooms. The main [...] "D" [...] wing contains administrator offices, science, and social studies classrooms. The main gym and counselling department technically make up the [...] "E" [...] wing, though it is hardly referred to by that name. Construction technology, automotives, and the LCI Performing Arts Centre north of the main gym are the [...] "F" [...] wing, while a small, third <b>floor</b> <b>section</b> containing home economics is the [...] "H" [...] wing. Underneath the home economics area is a fitness centre housing various exercise equipment. The single-storey, peripheral [...] "G" [...] wing, a linear building separated by a 15-metre lane from the main building, houses a communication technology lab, electronic equipment, autobody, and an art room.

40|$|Graphite-epoxy <b>floor</b> <b>sections</b> {{representative}} of aircraft fuselage construction were statically and dynamically tested {{to evaluate their}} response to crash loadings. These <b>floor</b> <b>sections</b> were fabricated using a frame-stringer design typical of present aluminum aircraft without features to enhance crashworthiness. The <b>floor</b> <b>sections</b> were tested {{as part of a}} systematic research program developed to study the impact response of composite components of increasing complexity. The ultimate goal of the research program is to develop crashworthy design features for future composite aircraft. Initially, individual frames of six-foot diameter were tested both statically and dynamically. The frames were then used to construct built-up <b>floor</b> <b>sections</b> for dynamic tests at impact velocities of approximately 20 feet/sec to simulate survivable crash velocities. In addition, static tests were conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} of the failure mechanisms seen in the dynamic tests...|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{was built in}} 1911 for the Maine Supply Company, a retailer of agricultural implements. From 1919 to 1928 it housed an automobile sales showroom and service center, with garage service bays in a single-story addition (no longer standing) to the south. Two of the building's ground <b>floor</b> <b>sections</b> once housed garage bay doors to facilitate vehicular access. The building has since seen use as a warehouse and office building.|$|R

50|$|During {{the wedding}} event in 2001, this {{significantly}} overstressed <b>floor</b> <b>section</b> failed, {{resulting in the}} catastrophe. The engineer Eli Ron, inventor of the Pal-Kal method of construction, was arrested and subsequently indicted in August 2002 on the charge of manslaughter.

50|$|A {{manufactured}} home {{is built}} entirely inside a huge, climate-controlled factory {{by a team}} of craftsmen. The first step in the process is the flooring, which is built in sections, each attached to a permanent chassis with its own wheels and secured for transport upon the home’s completion. Depending {{on the size of the}} house and the floorplan’s layout, there may be two, three or even four <b>sections.</b> The <b>flooring</b> <b>sections</b> have heating, electrical and plumbing connections pre-installed before they are finished with laminate, tile or hardwood. Next, the walls are constructed on a flat level surface with insulation and interior Sheetrock before being lifted by crane into position and secured to the <b>floor</b> <b>sections.</b> The interior ceilings and roof struts are next, vapor sealed and secured to each section’s wall frame before being shingled. Then, the exterior siding is added, along with the installation of doors and windows. Finally, interior finishing, such as sealing the drywall, is completed, along with fixture installation and finishing the electrical and plumbing connections. The exposed portions of each section, where they will eventually be joined together, are wrapped in plastic to protect them for transport.|$|R
5000|$|About {{one-third of}} all 240s sold were station wagons, which {{featured}} very large cargo space of [...] They could be outfitted with a rear-facing foldable jumpseat in the passenger area, making the wagon a seven-passenger vehicle. The jumpseat came with three-point seat belts, and wagons were designed to have a reinforced <b>floor</b> <b>section,</b> protecting the occupants of the jumpseat {{in the event of}} a rear-end collision.|$|E
50|$|Still at {{this time}} {{considered}} advanced was the car’s monocoque steel bodied construction (without a separate chassis), the rigidity of which was enhanced in 1959 through the addition of reinforcing box section lengths {{on each side of}} the <b>floor</b> <b>section.</b> The front wheels were independently sprung and the rear suspension followed the usual pattern of the time, combining a rigid rear axle with leaf springing.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, repairs {{were made}} to the forward part of the mockup after decades of {{exposure}} to the weather had corroded the <b>floor</b> <b>section</b> near the vehicle's nose. This corrosion caused the [...] "belly pan" [...] to drop from a mounting bracket onto the external tank. The damaged area was part of the fiberglass and plywood added to the mockup before its exhibition in Japan.|$|E

50|$|The tunnel {{was opened}} to traffic on 22 December 2000. In February 2001 {{it was found}} that a wall panel was cracked with 5 litres of water a second {{entering}} the tunnel. The cause was later found to be <b>floor</b> <b>sections</b> lifting from water pressure, and modifications to correct this being approved in November 2001. Also in 2001 Transfield Obayashi Joint Venture agreed to pay Transurban $157 million in damages in an out-of-court settlement over late completion of the tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The storage/floor sections, each 1.2 by 2.4 m {{were made}} from plywood and {{insulated}} with R-7 fiberglass insulation, which provided a portable, warm and cleanable floor. The wooden arches holding up the roof were attached to the <b>floor</b> <b>sections</b> with steel fittings and wing nuts, and were strong {{enough to hold a}} winter’s snow. The arches, the key to the design, were curved, glue-laminated wooden 15 cm beams on 1.2 m centers that folded in quarters on steel hinges and removable pins.|$|R
