Experimenting <b>territorial</b> {{cohesion}} - Mid- 2006, the European Union adopts the Regulation {{establishing the}} <b>European</b> Grouping of <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (EGTC), new legal instrument supporting the cooperation between {{different levels of}} territorial government across the borders. The paper presents some early findings on {{the application of the}} Regulation, in the hopeful wait for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which would endow the Union with the new objective of territorial, in addition to economic and social, cohesion. The analysis focuses on those EGTCs already established and those which are close to be, striving to identify their potential added value in terms of enhanced cohesion and multilevel governance for an <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> policy still in fieri.

50|$|The {{mission of}} the {{programme}} is to support policy development {{in relation to the}} aim of territorial cohesion and a harmonious development of the European territory. Firstly it provides comparable information, evidence, analyses and scenarios on territorial dynamics and secondly it reveals territorial capital and potentials for the development of regions and larger territories thus contributing to <b>European</b> competitiveness, <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> and a sustainable and balanced development.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{takes into}} {{consideration}} the development of legal instruments of <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> between sub-national authorities in Europe.

5000|$|The Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MDRAP) {{carries out}} {{government}} {{policies in the}} fields of regional development, territorial development and cohesion, cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, spatial planning, [...] urban planning and architecture, housing, real estate and urban planning management and development, public works and construction.In these areas, the Ministry manages several programmes financed from European and national funds: The Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013 and 2014-2020, 12 <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> programmes for 2014-2020, <b>European</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> programmes for 2007-2013, PHARE - Economic and Social Cohesion, programmes for territorial development, housing construction, thermal rehabilitation of housing blocks, retrofitting of earthquake prone buildings, construction of sports halls and cultural homes.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Objective {{replaced}} the previous INTERREG Community Initiative (in the period 2000-2006) and thus many <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> programmes bear the name INTERREG.The [...] "objectives" [...] were introduced with the Single European Act {{as a criterion}} to make the Structural Funds spending more effective as Regional Policy started to be rationalised in a perspective {{of economic and social}} cohesion. The Single European Act, that entered into force in 1987, institutionalised the goal of completing the internal market with a total borders opening, by 31 December 1992. Regional competition would be tighter and a Cohesion Policy was needed to mitigate the negative side effects of market unification.The [...] "objectives" [...] were then created to discipline the capture of funds in terms of economic and social cohesion across the Union's territory. In the first multiannual financial framework, 1988-1999, there were seven objectives, which have been progressively reduced. Even though <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Objective is the smallest of the three Cohesion Policy objectives (in terms of budget), it gained a critical importance to address the key challenges of the European Union, particularly with some redefinitions of the Treaty of Lisbon ( [...] entered into force on 1 December 2009), and for contributing to achieve the goals of Europe 2020, the EU's growth strategy.|$|E
50|$|Both {{countries}} are full members of many international organizations, including NATO, the European Union, the Council of Europe, the OECD and the WTO. Greece and Italy were {{also part of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Programme (2007-2013), for the boost of cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> Grouping for <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (EGTC) is a European Union level form of {{transnational}} cooperation between countries {{and local authorities}} with legal personality. EU Council Regulation 1082/2006 of 5 July 2006 forms its legal basis. As of April 2016, 62 EGTCs are in existence.|$|R
50|$|Cross-border {{cooperation}} is the collaboration between adjacent areas across borders. In the European Union {{this is one}} of the forms of <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> (in addition to transnational and interregional cooperation). The European model is very diverse with cooperation between border regions or municipalities, or through specific cooperation structures. These structures are usually composed by public authorities (municipalities, districts, counties, regions) from different countries organized in working communities, euroregions or EGTCs (<b>European</b> Grouping of <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation).</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Objective is {{financed by}} the European Regional Development Fund, whereas the {{remaining}} two objectives of the Cohesion Policy set for the 2007-2013 period are also {{financed by the}} European Social Fund (Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective), and, in {{the case with the}} Convergence Objective, also the Cohesion Fund.|$|E
5000|$|<b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation,</b> also {{commonly}} known as Interreg, is a key instrument from the European Cohesion policy supporting cross-border Interreg A [...] cooperation across Europe. For the fifth programming period 2014-2020 Interreg A is exclusively funded through the European Regional Development Fund with EUR 6.6 billion for the fifth programming period, amounting for 1.9% of the total EU cohesion policy budget for 2014-2020.|$|E
5000|$|The Alpine Space Programme 2007-2013 {{is part of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> objective. The <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (ETC) {{has been}} {{developed}} from the Community Initiative INTERREG. INTERREG was created in the framework of the European Union’s cohesion policy as an incentive for cooperation within the European Union. Cohesion policy encourages regions and cities from different EU Member States to work together and learn from each other through joint programmes, projects and networks. In the Structural Fund period 2007-2013 the Community Initiative INTERREG has been upgraded to the [...] "European Territorial Cooperation Objective". In the current programme period 2007-13 the ETC objective covers three types of programmes: cross-border cooperation, transnational cooperation and interregional cooperation. The Alpine Space Programme is one of the 13 programmes of the transnational cooperation objective. The transnational programmes add an important extra European dimension to regional development, developed from analysis at a European level, leading to agreed priorities and a coordinated strategic response.|$|E

50|$|Together {{with the}} cities of Lille, Roubaix, Villeneuve-d'Ascq and eighty-six other communes, Tourcoing is part of four-city-centred {{metropolitan}} area inhabited by more than 1.1 million people: the Métropole Européenne de Lille. To a greater extent, Tourcoing belongs to a vast conurbation formed with the Belgian cities of Mouscron, Kortrijk and Tournai, which {{gave birth to the}} first <b>European</b> Grouping of <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> in January 2008, Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai with an aggregate of just over 2 million inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|The second {{objective}} {{includes the}} investigation of a possible status of a <b>European</b> Grouping of <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> (EGTC) {{on the condition that}} it covers all the ERB partners and aims at involving more intensively experts in the our work with the long-term objective of building a think-tank capacity of Euroregion Baltic.

5000|$|As {{with the}} {{remaining}} two objectives, the <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Objective is delivered by means of multi-annual programmes aligned on the Union’s objectives and priorities, expressed on the multi-annual financial framework. Each programme has a managing authority and a Joint Technical Secretariat, headquartered within the area it serves. They {{are responsible for the}} correct implementation of the programme, both from a financial and from an operational perspective.|$|E
50|$|The EUR 8.7 billion {{allocated}} to the <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> objective represents 2.5% of the total budget for Cohesion Policy in 2007-2013 and is financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). It supports cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation programmes, helping Member States to participate in European Union (EU) external border cooperation programmes supported by other instruments (Instrument for Pre-Accession and European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument).|$|E

50|$|Even though Kortrijk is a Dutch-speaking town, it borders Wallonia, {{and is only}} 9 km {{away from}} the border with France. This has created an urban area that extends across {{linguistic}} and national borders. The mayors of Lille, Kortrijk and Tournai met in Kortrijk on 28 January 2008 to sign a document creating the first <b>European</b> Grouping of <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> within the EU. The purpose of this organisation is to facilitate the movement of people within this area of nearly 2 million people.|$|R
50|$|<b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> is an {{objective}} of the European Union’s Cohesion Policy for the period 2007-2013, serving its ultimate goal to strengthen {{the economic and social}} cohesion of the Union. Regions and cities from different Member States are encouraged to work together, learning from each other and developing joint projects and networks.With the Convergence Objective and the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective it aims at contributing to reduce regional disparities across Union's territory.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the successful implementation of the lobbying activities, on 28 October 2010 ERB Council decided to create three ad hoc task forces. The Task Force on EU Cohesion Policy is responsible for monitoring the preparation of future EU Cohesion Policy and will actively promote a greater role of its objective 3 - <b>European</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation.</b> The Task Force on the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region will be analysing the current implementation of the Strategy and prepare a draft position on the Strategy’s review process and including a lobby plan. Finally, the Task Force on the Annual Forum of ERB Stakeholders {{is in charge of}} preparing and organising the Annual Forum in 2011.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to describe, analyze and compare the recent legal {{developments}} regarding <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> that can be observed on the international and supranational level in Europe: the EC Regulation on a <b>European</b> Grouping of <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> adopted in 2006, on the one hand, and the planned Third Protocol to the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co–operation between Territorial Communities and Authorities concerning Euroregional Co–operation Groupings of the Council of Europe, on the other hand. Which future perspectives for <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in Europe do these two new tools open and what could be the added value of having two (rather similar) instruments? These are just two of the questions standing behind this paper, entitled “Future Perspectives for <b>Territorial</b> <b>Cooperation</b> in Europe”, which–towards its end–will eventually come back to one of the most crucial determinants for the future development of <b>territorial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in Europe, i. e. the attitude of the national states towards CBC and their respective constitutional provisions...|$|R
