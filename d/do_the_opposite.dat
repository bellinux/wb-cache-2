By wearing pins or clothing {{from the more}} popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items will <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite,</b> and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district while wearing items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E
25|$|This {{asymmetric}} phospholipid distribution {{among the}} bilayer {{is the result}} of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent phospholipid transport proteins. Proteins called “Flippases” move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while others called “floppases” <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy dependent manner. Additionally, there are also “scramblase” proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy independent manner. There is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Wes Streeting the NUS abandoned its long-standing commitment to free education and backed a graduate tax as its preferred outcome of the Browne Review into higher education funding. Before the 2010 General Election, the NUS invited candidates sign a pledge not to raise tuition fees, receiving over 1000 signatories from prospective parliamentary candidates. This became a very high-profile campaign when many Liberal Democrat MPs, who all signed individual NUS pledges stating they would vote against any rise in tuition fees if elected, had to abstain or <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> {{as part of their}} coalition agreement.|$|E

25|$|According to many phoneticians, {{the sounds}} of {{language}} arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organization Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite,</b> favouring sounds which are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages {{turn out to be}} a compromise between acoustic distinctiveness on the one hand, and articulatory ease on the other.|$|E
25|$|After {{the race}} started, Alonso {{was the first}} driver to make a routine pit stop for fuel and tyres on lap 12, rejoining the race {{at the back of}} the field. He had put in a light fuel load in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low {{positions}} tend to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not want to waste a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of the turns on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the safety car.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare satirizes the {{hyperbole}} of the allusions used {{by conventional}} poets, which {{even by the}} Elizabethan era, had become cliché, predictable, and uninspiring. This sonnet compares the poet's mistress {{to a number of}} natural beauties; each time making a point of his mistress' obvious inadequacy in such comparisons; she cannot hope {{to stand up to the}} beauties of the natural world. The first two quatrains compare the speaker's mistress to aspects of nature, such as snow or coral; each comparison ending unflatteringly for the mistress. In the final couplet, the speaker proclaims his love for his mistress by declaring that he makes no false comparisons, the implication being that other poets do precisely that. Shakespeare's sonnet aims to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite,</b> by indicating that his mistress is the ideal object of his affections because of her genuine qualities, and that she is more worthy of his love than the paramours of other poets who are more fanciful.|$|E

500|$|In general, {{there is}} no {{significant}} interaction when consuming amphetamine with food, but the pH of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine, respectively. [...] Acidic substances reduce the absorption of amphetamine and increase urinary excretion, and alkaline substances <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite.</b> [...] Due to the effect pH has on absorption, amphetamine also interacts with gastric acid reducers such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 antihistamines, which increase gastrointestinal pH (i.e., make it less acidic).|$|E

He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers.

500|$|A mature {{tropical}} cyclone can release heat {{at a rate}} upwards of 6x1014 watts. Tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves, heavy rain, and high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks. Generally, after its passage, a {{tropical cyclone}} stirs up ocean water, lowering sea surface temperatures behind it. This cool wake can cause the region to be less favorable for a subsequent tropical cyclone. On rare occasions, tropical cyclones may actually <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite.</b> 2005's Hurricane Dennis blew warm water behind it, contributing to the unprecedented intensity of Hurricane Emily, which followed it closely. [...] Hurricanes help to maintain the global heat balance by moving warm, moist tropical air to the mid-latitudes and polar regions. Were {{it not for the}} movement of heat poleward (through other means as well as hurricanes), the tropical regions would be unbearably hot.|$|E
500|$|Both Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters {{inspired}} them {{to conceive}} Kim as [...] "a character that our daughters and other girls {{can look up}} to", all-the-while aware of the [...] "ancient truism" [...] that while girls seldom hesitate to watch a show about a male lead, boys are usually less willing to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite.</b> Thus, the writers decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's competent action hero and Ron her [...] "fumbling" [...] sidekick, longing to provide young girls with [...] "a character that they can pretend to be" [...] similar to their own childhood heroes, fictional spy James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek. According to McCorkle, Kim has much {{more in common with}} James Bond than comic book superheroes. The recurring character Monique was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that it would be more realistic if Kim had a female best friend in addition to Ron.|$|E
500|$|Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production.

[...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. He said, [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards." [...] The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.|$|E

Hurley refuses, and David ends up taking Sayid to Jack, who is successful in reviving him. At home, Hurley confesses to his mother Carmen that the Oceanic Six have been lying; she believes him, though doesn't understand his disjointed story. Later, Ben unexpectedly shows up at the house and tries to convince Hurley to go with him to meet up {{with the rest of the}} Oceanic Six, saying they all want the same thing—to go back to the island.
