5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case. Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> takes pictures of his gloved hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear {{the same as the}} one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
5|$|Urey {{actively}} campaigned {{against the}} 1946 May-Johnson bill because {{he feared that}} {{it would lead to}} military control of nuclear energy, but supported and fought for the McMahon bill that replaced it, and ultimately created the Atomic Energy Commission. Urey's commitment to the ideal of world government dated from before the war, but the possibility of nuclear war made it only more urgent in <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> went on lecture tours against war, and became involved in Congressional debates regarding nuclear issues. He argued publicly on behalf of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and was even called before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and it was some time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|Siddhpur, {{historically}} {{known as}} Sristhal. Sidhpur, under {{the rulers of}} Chaulukya dynasty, was a prominent town in the 10th century. In the tenth century (943 AD) Mularaja, {{the founder of the}} Chaulukya dynasty of Gujarat, started the erection of the Rudra Mahalay temple. In his youth, Muladev had slain his maternal uncle, usurped his throne, and murdered the whole of his mother's kindred; and in old age his crimes hung heavily on <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near. To a band of them he gave Sristhal, and committing the kingdom to his son Chamundaraja, he retired there to end his days in their company (996 AD). But the Rudra Mahalay was still incomplete, nor was it finished till 1140 AD.|$|E
5|$|Thompson's {{actions were}} {{initially}} overlooked by division commanders, who instead {{focused on the}} poor performance of the 24th Infantry Regiment, whose soldiers panicked and fled from combat. Thompson's battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Melvin Blair, initially refused to submit a recommendation, until 4 January 1951, {{five months after the}} action. Thompson initially received a Silver Star Medal for the action, but after Blair changed <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>he</b> began pushing the paperwork through, personally locating the witnesses who could attest to Thompson's valor. Blair hoped Thompson's recognition would improve other commanders' views on the 24th Infantry Regiment. Eventually, though, that unit was disbanded and its personnel integrated into other units.|$|E
5|$|When he was fifteen, Vainio {{felt sure}} he would become a writer. As a young man he read a book about poetics, and later said that the rules were easy to break once he had learned them. It became {{apparent}} in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer. However, teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column-like text he had written, because the teacher felt {{that it could not}} be graded as an essay. Although essays were his strong point, school was uninteresting for Juha. He considered quitting school, but the principal persuaded him to change <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus. In the end, the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled were singing and sports.|$|E

5|$|Writer and {{director}} David Lynch had previously studied {{for a career}} as an artist, and he had created several short films to animate his paintings. By 1970, however, he had switched his focus to film-making, and {{at the age of}} 24 he accepted a scholarship at the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies. Lynch disliked the course and considered dropping out, but after being offered the chance to produce a script of his own devising, he changed <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> was given permission to use the school's entire campus for film sets; he converted the school's disused stables into a series of sets and lived there. In addition, Greystone Mansion, also owned by the AFI, was used for many scenes.|$|E
5|$|Malgudi is a fictional, semi-urban town in {{southern}} India, conjured by Narayan. He created {{the town in}} September 1930, on Vijayadashami, an auspicious day to start new efforts and thus chosen for him by his grandmother. As he mentioned in a later interview to his biographers Susan and N. Ram, in <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>he</b> first saw a railway station, and slowly the name Malgudi came to him. The town was created with an impeccable historical record, dating to the Ramayana days when {{it was noted that}} Lord Rama passed through; it was also said that the Buddha visited the town during his travels. While Narayan never provided strict physical constraints for the town, he allowed it to form shape with events in the various stories, becoming a reference point for the future. Dr James M. Fennelly, a scholar of Narayan's works, created a map of Malgudi based on the fictional descriptors of the town from the many books and stories.|$|E
25|$|His name is the {{synonym for}} the {{faithful}} discharge of duty. In his business regulations {{he has won}} the respect and admiration of all who know him. As a public officer, when fortunes were within his grasp, not a thought of seizing them entered <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> is a man vigorously positive, determined, honest, generous and able. Not a stain has been cast on his name. Not a man can say a word against him to impeach his qualifications for the Mayoralty of New York.|$|E

25|$|Yamamoto practiced calligraphy. He and his wife, Reiko, {{had four}} children: {{two sons and}} two daughters. Yamamoto was an avid gambler, enjoying Go, shogi, billiards, bridge, mah jong, poker, and other games that tested his wits and {{sharpened}} <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> frequently made jokes about moving to Monaco and starting his own casino. He enjoyed the company of geisha, and his wife Reiko revealed to the Japanese public in 1954 that Yamamoto was closer to his favorite geisha Kawai Chiyoko than to her, which stirred some controversy. After his death, his funeral procession passed by Kawai's quarters {{on the way to}} the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The bride-price varied greatly, {{according}} {{to the status of}} the parties, but surpassed the price of a slave. The Code stipulated that if the father did not give the suitor his daughter after accepting the suitor's gifts, he must return the gifts. The bride-price had to be returned even if the father reneged on the marriage contract because of slander of the suitor {{on the part of the}} suitor's friend, and the Code stipulated that the slanderer should not marry the girl (and thus would not profit from his slander). Conversely, if a suitor changed <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>he</b> forfeited the presents.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the subject}} of This Is Your Life on two occasions: in November 1977 when he was {{surprised}} by Eamonn Andrews at Pinewood Studios on the set of Death on the Nile, and a week before, he was surprised at a book signing at book printers Butler and Tanner in Frome, Somerset. This footage was not used, as Ustinov flatly refused to take part and swore at Andrews. His wife persuaded him to change <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> was surprised again in December 1994, when Michael Aspel approached him at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva.|$|E

25|$|Although Grant had {{not created}} the {{character}} {{to be used}} beyond the two-part debut story, positive reactions from reader letters and his editor caused him to change <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> then decided to make Lonnie Machin the third Robin, following Jason Todd, desiring a new sidekick who would act as a foil to Batman, and {{not have the same}} motivations for vengeance. This was abandoned when he learned that Tim Drake had already been created to fill the role by Marv Wolfman. Quickly rebounding from this decision, Grant instead used the second appearance of Anarky as the antagonist for Tim Drake's first solo detective case.|$|E
25|$|Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, {{wrote about}} Duke:He once {{presented}} a {{bill on the}} floor, {{one of the few}} which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>he</b> had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.|$|E
25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>he</b> speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience {{that we have a}} false ideal of choice predicated upon this.|$|E

25|$|Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, {{treasurer}} of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied {{to testify in}} the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, {{in order to maintain}} their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, because they all knew that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story.|$|E
25|$|The sadhaka {{may also}} meditate on a deity. Offerings to the deity {{are put in}} the corpse's mouth. The {{practitioner}} may perform pranayama and meditate on his guru and the deity in <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> can also practice japa (repetition of a mantra or a deity's names or epithets), till the corpse promises him to grant his wish. He may encounter an Akashavani (a voice from the skies) which may try to tempt him with material things. He will experience terrifying visions and sounds as well as temptations; however the practitioner should remain untouched and concentrate on the meditation. On conducting the rite successfully, the sadhaka would be blessed with mantra-siddhi (a supernatural power to use a mantra) or become one with Shiva. Uniting with Shiva is said to lead to detachment, a characteristic of the ascetic god. Shiva is himself equated with shava, the corpse. As the vessel of Shiva, the adept becomes an avadhuta, a mystic who is beyond egoic-consciousness, duality and common worldly concerns. The Tantrasara says that a voice may ask for more offerings or bless the practitioner by granting his wishes.|$|E
25|$|In the September invasion, the Vendean leaders {{utilized}} {{the strategy of}} the central position to concentrate upon each of the isolated Republican divisions that attempted to invade the area of rebellion. Though Rossignol agreed {{to cooperate with the}} 2 September plan, the defeat at Chantonnay made him change <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>He</b> ordered Chalbos to pull back to Fontenay and the Luçon division, now under Louis Paul Beffroy, to return to Luçon. At the same time he foolishly authorized Santerre with the Saumur Division and Charles François Duhoux with the Angers Division to invade the Vendée from the east. At first, Santerre was successful at Doué-la-Fontaine and penetrated as far as Vihiers on 17 September. The next day he was ambushed in the Battle of Coron and routed, losing all his field guns. Duhoux's column suffered a similar defeat at the Battle of Pont-Barré on the 20th. The Brest Army made great progress in the west but on 19 September, the attacks of Jean Baptiste Kléber were repelled in the Battle of Tiffauges and Jean-Michel Beysser was defeated at the Battle of Montaigu on the 22nd. In the final blow, Charette mauled the Sables d'Olonne division under Jean Quirin de Mieszkowski in the Battle of Saint-Fulgent on 22 September. The Blues lost 3,000 out of 6,000 soldiers while the Whites lost only 300 casualties out of 11,000 men engaged.|$|E
