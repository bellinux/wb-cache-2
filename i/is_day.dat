25|$|The BMD-4 {{features}} an advanced fire control system (FCS).

The FCS implements a significant increase of the armament effectiveness by engaging a wide scope of targets in complicated weather and landscape conditions. Advanced ballistic calculations allow the BMD-4 to fire from an enclosed position and the capability of effectively firing at low and slow aerial targets is provided.|$|E

The highway heads southeast from the junction, running along the northeastern edge of Lake Tiorati as it passes by the dense forests that comprise most of Harriman State Park. After , the highway serves the Tiorati Workshop, a collaboration between the State Park and Bank Street College of Education, located adjacent to the eastern lake shore. Past the workshop, the road takes on a more southerly routing and descends down a hill before crossing Tiorati Brook by way of a dam. Just south of the dam <b>is</b> <b>Day</b> Camp in the Park, where Tiorati Brook Road turns back to the east to follow its namesake waterway away from the lake.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} tradition <b>is</b> <b>Day</b> of the Dead, celebrated {{throughout the}} borough but San Andrés Mixquic’s is particularly well known, attracting {{thousands of visitors}} from Mexico and abroad. The celebration generally lasts three days from October 31 to November 1 each day focusing on different groups, children, adults and saints. One local tradition related to the day is to hang a paper lantern often {{in the form of}} a star at the entrance to home as a way to greet the return of the souls of the dead. The Fiestas del Santo Jubileo is a custom observed on different days in the communities of the borough. It consists of a mass and exhibition of the Host on the main altar of the church for 40 hours, surrounded by flowers, sawdust carpets, live music, dances and fireworks. Carnival is important in San Francisco Tlaltenco and Santiago Zapotitlán, where dancers generally are chinelos and those in charro suits. These carnivals begin on the fourth Sunday of Lent. The tradition in San Francisco Tlaltenco goes back to the end of the 19th century. A reenactment of Palm Sunday has been held each year at San Pedro Tláhuac for over eighty years, with the procession winding its way through eight different neighborhoods. San Pedro Tláhuac is also the site of the Regional Fair of Tláhuac. It was first organized in 1956, with the goal so attracting tourism and encouraging youth to maintain traditions. It begins with a procession of the image of the patron saint, the Apostle Peter, in decorated trajinera boats in the chinampa areas of Lago de los Reyes Aztecas. Other events include the selection of a fair queen, conferences, cultural events, concerts, dances, fireworks and more, with proceeds going to the restoration of the San Pedro Apostal Church.|$|E
500|$|The first logicians {{to debate}} {{conditional}} statements were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo. Writing five-hundred years later, Sextus Empiricus {{refers to a}} debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct antecedent had an incorrect consequent, and this meant a proposition such as [...] "if it <b>is</b> <b>day,</b> then I am talking," [...] is true unless it <b>is</b> <b>day</b> and I fall silent. But Diodorus argued that a true conditional {{is one in which}} the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion – thus, because the proposition [...] "if it <b>is</b> <b>day,</b> then I am talking" [...] can be false, it is invalid. However, paradoxical propositions were still possible such as [...] "if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists." [...] Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible: to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent. This corresponds to the modern-day strict conditional.|$|E

500|$|Chrysippus wrote much on {{the subject}} of logic and created a system of propositional logic. Aristotle's term logic had been {{concerned}} with the interrelations of terms such as [...] "Socrates" [...] or [...] "man" [...] ("all men are mortal, Socrates is a man, so Socrates is mortal"). Stoic logic, on the other hand, was concerned with the interrelations of propositions such as [...] "it is day" [...] ("if it <b>is</b> <b>day,</b> it is light: but it is day: so it is light"). Though the earlier Megarian dialecticians –Diodorus Cronus and Philo– had worked in this field and the pupils of Aristotle –Theophrastus and Eudemus– had investigated hypothetical syllogisms, it was Chrysippus who developed these principles into a coherent system of propositional logic.|$|E
500|$|In Norse mythology, Dagr (Old Norse [...] "day") <b>is</b> <b>day</b> personified.

Depending on manuscript variation, the Prose Edda adds that Dagr is either Dellingr's son by Nótt, the personified night, or Jörð, the personified Earth. Otherwise, Dagr appears as a common noun simply meaning [...] "day" [...] throughout Old Norse works. Connections have been proposed between Dagr and other similarly named figures in Germanic mythology.|$|E

500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>Day</b> 15, October 6, 2004, and Claire {{wakes up}} from nightmares two {{nights in a}} row, screaming. In the first, Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant, as she walks into the forest and {{encounters}} John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at a table, playing cards. She asks him why he is there, but Locke interrupts, telling her [...] "He was your responsibility, but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now." [...] Locke looks up with one white and one black eye. She hears crying and finds a baby crib.

Later, at the caves the team discovers two bodies, according to Jack a man and a woman, whom Locke dubs [...] "Adam and Eve".

500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>Day</b> 9, September 30, 2004. On the beach, Sawyer catches Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) {{searching through}} his stash of items he {{salvaged}} from the crash, and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) attends to a wound {{on the head}} of Sayid. Sayid reports his failure in triangulating the distress signal, and the destruction of the transceiver by his attacker. Shannon brings a bloody Boone to the caves, where he explains to Jack that Sawyer beat him, and that his sister Shannon's asthma has become a problem. Many of the survivors become convinced that Sawyer is hoarding some inhalers from the wreck. Jack unsuccessfully demands the inhalers from Sawyer, and when Kate does the same, Sawyer says he will give up the inhaler if Kate kisses him. Kate calls his bluff and challenges him about the letter he often reads. Sawyer makes Kate read the letter aloud. The letter is addressed to [...] "Mr. Sawyer" [...] and explains that Mr. Sawyer had sex with the letter writer's mother and stole all of the letter writer's father's money, resulting in the father killing his wife and himself.|$|E

2500|$|Inference {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with implication. [...] An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false. [...] The Stoic logician Philo of Megara was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true. [...] An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'. [...] An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid. [...] However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is true, the inference 'p therefore q' is valid. [...] This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it <b>is</b> <b>day,</b> it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it <b>is</b> <b>day,</b> therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.|$|E
