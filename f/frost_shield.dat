5000|$|In the 2015 rebooted series, Kopaka {{carries an}} Ice Spear and a <b>Frost</b> <b>Shield,</b> the latter weapon {{being able to}} split apart {{into a pair of}} skiis. He retains much of his {{original}} personality, primarily his cold demeanor, with the added elements of clumsiness, a poor sense of direction, and perfectionism.|$|E
5000|$|Iceman's levels {{most closely}} {{resemble}} flight-sim games similar to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron as he continuously rides on his trademark ice slide. Iceman creates an icy path {{in front of}} him, {{flying through the air}} while shooting his ice beam and ice projectiles. Iceman's attacks are an Ice Beam, which cools off fires and damages foes; <b>Frost</b> <b>Shield,</b> which will cancel any damage he takes while it is [...] "up"; and Hailstorm, which is his main attack, hurling several balls of ice at targets. Iceman will heal automatically as long as he doesn't incur damage for an amount of time. The player must keep up a quick speed when sliding, as slowing down too much will knock Iceman off the slide.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} manufacture car shades, either universal or custom patterned for a precise fit. Covercraft offers easy to use sunscreens {{in a number of}} colors and patterns. WeatherTech provides vehicle-specific windshield sun shades that protect both from UV rays in the summer and snow and frost buildup in the winter thanks to reflective surface on the front side and the reverse black side that absorbs the heat in the winter. Coverking manufactures both sun <b>shields</b> and <b>frost</b> <b>shields</b> for summer and winter use respectively.|$|R
