40|$|Peter Kotschy 1, Sascha Virnik 2, Doris Christ 3, Alexander Gaggl 21 Private Practice, Vienna, Austria; 2 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Central Hospital, Klagenfurt, Austria; 3 Klagenfurt, AustriaObjective: The aim of {{periodontal}} therapy is {{the healing of}} periodontal inflammation; {{the protection of the}} attachment and the alveolar bone; and the regeneration of the periodontal structures. In the therapy of periodontitis, supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing plays a main role. The procedure described combines perfect root cleaning without scaling and root planing and minimal invasive periodontal surgery without a scalpel. Material and methods: Glass beads of 90 &micro;m were used with the kinetic preparation unit PrepStart&reg; under a pressure of 0. 5 &ndash; 5 bar. This technique was practised only under visual control using the OPMI&reg; PRO Magis microscope. Seven examinations were carried out at baseline after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Results: Time shows a statistically significant influence on all of the considered target variables (P &lt; 0. 0001 for all). As the according estimate is negative, probing depth decreases over time. The major decrease seems to be during the first 6 months. Considering probing depth, plaque on the main effect root shows significant influence (again, P &lt; 0. 0001 for all). Observations with high probing depth at the beginning were faster than those with low probing depth. The same characteristic appears by attachment level. Patients with more loss of attachment show more gain. Conclusions: Using microscope-controlled <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> results in a perfectly clean root surface using visual control (magnification 20 &times;). Microscope-controlled <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> is therefore a good alternative to periodontal surgery. Keywords: {{periodontal therapy}}, microscope, periodontiti...|$|E

The objective of this research {{study was to investigate}} these primary processes and its variations with different surface treatments of titanium. This may further aid in finding surface characteristics which {{have a positive effect on}} osseointegration. Firstly, ion adsorption from a physiological solution and ion and protein adsorption from a simulated in vivo environment to polished, <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> <b>blasted</b> and alkali etched + heat-treated titanium surfaces were tested with the aid of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Secondly, the adhesion strength of bone cells to the 3 different titanium surfaces in two force directions (normal and tangential to the surface) was assessed with the aid of centrifugal accelerations. The theory here was that ions are adsorbed first to the surfaces, proteins then bind to the ions, and then cells can bind to the RGD sequence in certain proteins. Calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were found to be adsorbed to all titanium surfaces from the physiological solution to varying degrees, however, only trace levels of Ca and P could be detected on all surfaces after exposure to a simulated in vivo environment, instead large amounts of protein were found. Bone cell adhesion strength was found to vary (between < 2 x 10 - 8 N and 8 x 10 - 8 N) statistically significant (p< 0. 001 - p< 0. 05) with surface treatment and force direction.

40|$|The bead {{blasting}} process is widespread {{in both the}} automotive and aerospace industry and is performed {{in order to improve}} the fatigue strength of various components. Bead blasting is a cold plastic forming process during which the surface of the material processed is hit by small, hard particles consisting of steel pellets, bearing balls or glass beads. It increases the hardness of the outer layer and establishes compression stresses inside it, which is why this processing is often used to improve fatigue strength. Contrary to other peening methods, {{bead blasting}} does not result in a reduction in the height of the processed surface’s unevenness in most cases. Shot peening changes the residual tensile stresses into residual compression stresses, thanks to which, the lifetime of the parts processed is extended and their carrying capacity is increased. The double shot peening process proposed by the authors consists in a two-stage bead blasting process. The first stage consists in blasting with round cast steel pellets, pellets cut from wire or cast iron pellets. During the second stage the same samples underwent <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> <b>blasting.</b> The tests conducted on the RSA- 501 aluminum alloy indicate {{that as a result of}} the processing medium’s impact in the form of glass beads or pellets of different diameter and shape, a permanent plastic deformation of the material surface occurs. On the basis of the obtained results it is possible to infer that the choice of parameters of both conventional shot peening and the double shot peening determine the impact thereof on the material’s mechanical properties. Thanks to the application of the double shot peening process there is a noticeable decrease in value of the Ra parameter, by about 40 % on average. When analyzing the compressive stress results it is possible to state that after the first blasting process the value of stress was increasing when moving deeply into the sample from its surface, while after the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> the value of compressive stress was significantly higher already near the surface. Double shot peening results in an increase in the value of compressive stresses by 40 - 50 % when compared to conventional blasting...|$|E

It has been demonstrated that noise can be reduced by the application of certain coatings to the high voltage conductors. Various coatings/treatments have been evaluated with respect to contact angle measurements under {{a wide range of}} conditions including discharge levels.

The surfaces mentioned formed the lower electrode of a parallel plate discharge gap. Contact angles were determined by first producing an electronic image of the drop which was then assessed by means of software developed in this study. It has been shown that the voltage at which instability, resulting in ejection of a fine jet of water of a few μm with increasing electric field, is reached depends strongly on the initial shape of the water drop and thus on the contact angle which, in turn, is controlled by the surface properties.

40|$|Effective {{management}} of heritage assets relies on decision-making which is underpinned by empirical evidence of impact of treatments on long term survival prospects of materials. Historic wrought iron presents {{a particular problem}} for conservation. It occupies a niche position between heritage and engineering, is frequently exposed to outdoor atmospheric corrosion and, {{in the case of}} bridges, gates and similar structures, may be required to perform a distinct function. Sector guidance to direct practices is based on anecdotal evidence and established methods. British Standards relate to modern steels hence application to historic ferrous metals is complicated by differences in metallurgy and lack of concession to conservation ethics. This study generates empirical evidence of the effects of five surface preparation methods and three protective coating systems on the corrosion rate of historic wrought iron samples. Immersion in sodium hydroxide solution and blasting with crushed walnut shells are found to reduce corrosion rates of uncoated wrought iron. Aluminium oxide and <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> <b>blasting</b> increase corrosion rate but offer removal of contaminants and a keyed surface for coating adhesion. Flame cleaning increases corrosion rate by almost four times the uncleaned wrought iron corrosion rate. A two-pack epoxy resin coating system with polyurethane topcoat applied over substrate surfaces blasted to Sa 2. 5 (near white metal) and a surface tolerant single-pack alkyd coating applied over coherent oxide layers successfully prevented corrosion for almost two years in high static relative humidity environments. An alkyd system applied over Sa 2. 5 blasted surface does not significantly reduce corrosion rate of the uncoated substrate. A cost benefit approach to interpreting the empirical results in relation to practicalities of applying the treatments is advocated. The methods developed for standardising historic sample material and measuring oxygen consumption of coated samples as proxy corrosion rate offer scope for further work in this area.

40|$|Increasing {{requirements}} for energy and resource efficiency promote {{the usage of}} lightweight materials. Moreover, hybrid parts made of different materials can provide {{a wider range of}} properties than parts from a single material. One of today’s challenges in production technology is the development of efficient manufacturing methods. Within the scope of the Cluster of Excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries”, the so called In-Mould-Metal-Spraying (IMMS) is being developed for manufacturing of metal/plastics hybrid parts. It is based upon the transfer of thermally sprayed coatings from the mold insert to the plastic coating carrier during injection molding. A key factor of the IMMS process is the adjustment of the coating bond strength to the mold insert for a residue-free transfer. The surface topography and therefore the surface pretreatment of the mold insert are important for the IMMS process. In the preliminary study, a surface topography fabricated by <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> <b>blasting</b> has enabled the transfer of wire arc sprayed Zn-coatings. How-ever, further investigations indicated limitations regarding the mold insert material and local coating residuals on the mold insert surface after coating transfer. For the close investigation of this effect, laser structuring is chosen as surface pretreatment method because of its capability of fabricating freely selectable, defined surface topographies. Surface structures in micron range overlaid by LIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures) in submicron range can be prepared using ultrashort pulse lasers. Different surface structures produced by regularly drilling on the surface and variation of the drilling diameter, depth and distance, which lead to the variation of the coating bond strength, are investigated. The aim of this investigation is to identify a suitable surface topography and to understand the bonding mechanism regard-ing the IMMS process...|$|E

50|$|The {{end result}} is that while <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> peening may be {{excellent}} for the immediate removal of incrustation and other matter, the long-term effect may be that it could harm the sculpture, and so should be used only with much consideration. An alternate to <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> peening is using walnut shells, which Veloz and his associates tested {{in conjunction with the}} <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and is discussed in the next section.|$|R
40|$|The {{roughness}} of superhydrophobic silicone nanofilaments (SNFs) is exploited {{to enlarge}} the contact area of conventional filter material. As an efficient wetting of the filter material is crucial for water treatment, the wettability of SNFs is readily modified from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic during the functionalization process. SNFs are coated on <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and subsequently modified with biocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The enlarged surface area of SNFs allows a 30 times higher loading of AgNPs in comparison to <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> without SNF coating. Thus, in column experiments, the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> exert superior antibacterial activity towards suspensions of E. coli K 12 compared to AgNP functionalized <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> without SNFs. Additionally, reusing the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-coated <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> with fresh bacteria contaminated medium increases their efficacy and reduces the colony forming units by ≈ 6 log units. Thereby, the silver loss during percolation is below 0. 1 μg mL− 1. These results highlight, first, the potential of AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> as an effective filter substrate for water disinfection, and second, the efficiency of SNF coating in increasing the contact area of conventional filter material...|$|R
50|$|According to Peter Francis, Jr., {{the making}} of powder <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in West Africa may date back a few hundred years, and to {{possibly}} 1200 CE in Mauritania. Maure powder <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> are believed to copy older, Islamic beads, of the type made in Fustat and elsewhere. Although {{the making of}} Mauritanian powder <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> {{appears to be an}} ancient tradition, no archaeological evidence to establish their age has been found to date.|$|R
