40|$|Abstract: This study investigates a {{heavy duty}} diesel engine with swept vol. 12. 6 L, 4 cycle-OHC type {{to verify the}} effects of the {{performance}} and exhaust gas emission according to the variable specifications of both swirl ratio and flow coefficient in inlet port, combustion bowl and fuel injection system. To meet the high BMEP and stringent <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standard,</b> a turbocharger with wastegate and an intercooler were installed in the engine. Helical port, major design parameters for combustion chamber and electronic fuel injection pump with 1, 000 bar were reviewed and applied. Confirmation tests were also performed to meet the target value, NOx 5. 0 g/kWh and PM 0. 1 g/kWh of Euro 3 exhaust emission legislation. The results of this study show that not only is it effective to use a relatively bigger bowl size for controlling rapid burning condition due to the decreased in-bowl swirl, but also to use a concave cam with double injection rates to decrease NOx...|$|E
40|$|Emission Control Program with Tier 1 exhaust {{emission}} standards in all States except California and those States in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region (OTR) where a California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) {{program has been}} adopted.

40|$|Staff {{recommends}} that the Board adopt the proposals both to require qualifying federal lightand medium-duty vehicles {{to be certified}} in California, and to adopt the federal <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for heavy-duty gasoline vehicles and engines. In 1998 California adopted {{the second phase of}} its Low-Emission Vehicle Program (LEV II) for lightand medium-duty vehicles. In 1999 the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) followed suit and adopted new <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for light- and medium-duty passenger cars and trucks- the Tier 2 standards-that mirror California standards. Earlier this year, EPA also adopted more stringent standards for heavy-duty gasoline vehicles and engines. The purpose of this rulemaking is to incorporate portions of the recently promulgated federal programs into California’s <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> requirements for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines to ensure that California continues to receive only the cleanest vehicles in every vehicle category. Staff has determined that the emission impacts from this rulemaking would be small emission reductions for light- and medium-duty vehicles and an emissions benefit from adopting the federal heavyduty gasoline standards of about 1 ton per day.

40|$|DISCUSSION: The {{purpose of}} this {{rulemaking}} is threefold. First, staff is proposing that the Board align California’s <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for heavy-duty Ottocycle (gasoline) engines with the recently adopted more stringent federal <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> and allow participation in the federal averaging, banking, and trading program. Second, staff is proposing a new <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> for fuel-fired heaters used on non-zero-emission vehicle applications. Finally, staff is proposing clarifying modifications and other non-substantive language that would update the LEV II regulations for light- and medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty Otto-cycle and heavy-duty diesel requirements. These changes will ensure that vehicles sold in California {{will be at least}} as clean as their federal counterparts, and also include a number of minor modifications intended to clarify and update existing regulatory language and align with updated federal requirements. SUMMARY AND IMPACTS: Staff has determined that the emission benefits from adoption of the federal heavy-duty gasoline standards will be approximately 3. 6 tons per day of reactive organic gas plus oxides of nitrogen and 10. 3 tons per day of carbon monoxide in the South Coast Air Basin in 2020. Staff does not anticipate any significant emission benefits from the portion of this proposal pertaining to light- and medium-duty vehicles. Staff believes that the cost to manufacturers would also be minimal {{and there would be no}} noticeable impact on California employment, business status or competitiveness. 31431...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> {{have been}} {{tightened}} in the EU {{for several decades}} now, {{in order to protect}} health and the environment. This has led to a substantial decrease in total pollutant emissions, despite the growing volumes of passenger and freight transport. However, national emissions, particularly of NOx, exceed the ceilings accorded under the Gothenburg Protocol of the UNECE's Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) (EEA 2012) in twelve EU Member States. The main reasons for such exceedances are that more diesel cars have been sold than originally predicted when fixing the targets, and that diesel cars emit much more than expected under real-world driving conditions. The latter appears {{as a consequence of the}} effort to achieve high fuel efficiency. While this has largely helped to control CO 2 emissions, it was to the detriment of NOx. In this study we estimate what the impact of the different vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> has been so far and to predict what the impact of upcoming <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> will be in the future, using the best current knowledge on road transport activity statistics and emission factors in Europe. We present several sensitivity calculations to reflect the considerable uncertainty about the real-driving NOx emissions of diesel light duty vehicles. The results of this work can be useful in designing both limits for upcoming standards but also in assessing the impact of deviating from such limits. This is necessary in both deciding on the next steps of emission control policy and to relevant air quality prediction models...|$|R
40|$|Particulate {{emissions}} from motor vehicles have received increased attention {{over the past}} two decades owing to associations observed between ambient Particulate Matter (PM) levels and health effects. This has led to numerous changes in emissions regulations worldwide, including more stringent standards, the broadening of these to include non-road engines, and the adoption of new metrics. These changes have created a demand for new instruments that are capable of real time measurement, enhanced sensitivity, and on-board vehicle operation. In response, researchers and instrument manufacturers have developed an array of new and improved instruments and sampling methods. It is generally recognized that the exhaust aerosol concentration measured depends on both the sampling technique and the instrument used. Hence, many of the new instruments are complementary and offer merits in measuring a variety of particulate emissions attributes. However, selecting the best instrument for each application is not a straightforward task; it requires on one hand a clear measurement objective and, on the other, an understanding of the characteristics of the instrument employed. This paper reviews how vehicle <b>exhaust</b> particulate <b>emission</b> measurements have evolved over the years. The focus is on current and newly evolving instrumentation, including gravimetric filter measurement, chemical analysis of filters, light extinction, scattering and absorption instruments, and instruments based on the electrical detection of exhaust aerosols. Correlations between the various instruments are examined in the context of steadily more stringent <b>exhaust</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>standards.</b> The review concludes with a discussion of future instrument and sampling requirements for the changing nature of exhaust aerosols from current and future vehicles.

40|$|In 1995, Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA/TW) {{instituted a}} policy of levying {{emission}} taxes on polluters in order to combat the rampant national issue of pollution. Since that time, pollution control strategies, tightening <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for industry, improvements in fuel quality, and new stricter vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>standards,</b> etc., have been implemented. This study evaluates {{the effectiveness of these}} measures and examines the improvement of Taiwan's air quality. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of change in the concentrations of pollutants (SO(2), NO(x) and particulate matter [PM]) between two three-year periods (from 1996 to 1998 and from 2000 to 2002). The pollution levels were generally lower in the latter period. Concentrations at 14 EPA/TW stations in central Taiwan were simulated and source apportionment analyses in three of Central Taiwan's largest cities were conducted using a trajectory transfer-coefficient air quality model. Correlation coefficients (r) between simulations and observations for the monthly means of the concentrations of SO(2). NO(x), PM(2. 5) and PM(10) during the study periods at the 14 stations are 0. 56, 0. 63, 0. 70 and 0. 31, respectively. The sulfur control policy greatly reduced SO(2) concentration island-wide, a stringent <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> put into place for gasoline vehicles reduced NO(x) concentration along highways, and an emissions tax placed on construction sites, as well as a regular program for road-dust sweeping, reduced primary particulate matter. Among all of the pollution abatement policies implemented, the most effective method for reducing PM(2. 5) concentrations in the three largest cities involved the reduction of fine ammonium sulfate aerosols from point sources (56 - 63 % of net PM(2. 5) reduction). The next largest reduction was attributed to a diminishment in primary PM(2. 5) emanating from point sources (27 - 56 % of net PM(2. 5) reduction). Secondary particulate matter, especially sulfate, was reduced from distances up to 150 km leeward of major pollution point sources such as Taichung Power Plant. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractA chassis {{dynamometer}} {{study was conducted}} to compare the characteristics of particle emissions from a port fuel injection (PFI) and a gasoline direct injection (GDI) car, both of which comply with Euro 4 <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> Experiments were carried out over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), the ECE– 15 segments, the period from 0 to 49 s within the NEDC procedure (FSE) and the Extra Urban Driving Cycle segment. Exhaust particles were characterized in terms of the particle number, surface area, volume and size distributions between 30 nm and 1 μm. Under the NEDC, the GDI car had particle emissions weighted by particle number, surface area and volume that were 56 – 2 739 % higher than the emissions from the PFI car in the range of particle size measured, and the particle number, volume and surface area emissions per km for the GDI car are respectively 5. 3, 9. 0 and 14. 6 times higher than those for the PFI car. Among the testing conditions employed, the highest concentrations of average particle number, surface area and volume were found in the FSE, and the particle number, surface area and volume for the GDI car were respectively 9. 5, 33. 2 and 39. 8 times higher than those for the PFI car. Moreover, the peak of the particle size distributions for the PFI car was toward a smaller size, while that for the GDI was toward a larger size, indicating that particles emitted by the PFI car are much smaller than those emitted by the GDI car...|$|R
40|$|This report compares and {{contrasts}} two potential {{motor vehicle}} emission control scenarios: (1) {{the continuation of}} the Federal Motor Vehicle Emission Control Program with Tier 1 <b>exhaust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> in all States except the Northeast Ozone Transport Region (OTR) States, where either the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) -Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) or CAL-LEV programs apply (the Base Case), and (2) a national LEV program in all States. The national LEV program includes a provision for adopting LEVprogram standards in the OTR beginning with the 1997 model year. In States outside the OTR, the national LEV program starts with model year 2001 light-duty vehicles (LDVs). By 2015, a year when the full benefits of the LEV program are realized, a national LEV program is expected to reduce highway vehicle nonmethane organic gas (NMOG) emissions nationally by 6 percent, and oxides of nitrogen (NO) emissions by 8 percent, when x compared with the OTC-LEV program. By 2007, when most areas must attain the ozone standard, national NMOG and NO emissions are estimated to be 3 to 4 percent lower x compared with those from the current program (Tier 1 plus OTC-LEV). The national LEV program provides benefits beyond the reductions achieved in criteria pollutants; reductions in NMOG associated motor vehicle-emitted air toxic compounds such as benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 1, 3 -butadiene are also achieved.
