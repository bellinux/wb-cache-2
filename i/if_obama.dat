Harper has denied that Brodie {{was responsible for the}} leak, and launched an investigation to find the source. The Opposition, as well as Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, criticized the Government on the issue, stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama. They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> ever were to become President. Obama was elected President in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit, as president, to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.|$|E

The U.S. funds 20% of Egypt's military costs (US$1.3 billion) and gives another US$250 million in economic aid. Al Jazeera noted that the refusal to term the events as a coup were tied with the U.S. stance in stopping military aid to countries that have perpetrated a coup.|$|E

5000|$|In late May 2008, Michael Kinsley, a {{longtime}} critic of Ayers, argued in Time that Obama's relationship with Ayers {{should not be}} a campaign issue: <b>If</b> <b>Obama's</b> relationship with Ayers, however tangential, exposes Obama as a radical himself, or at least as a man with terrible judgment, he shares that radicalism or terrible judgment with a comically respectable list of Chicagoans and others - including Republicans and conservatives - who have embraced Ayers and Dohrn as good company, good citizens, even experts on children's issues ... Ayers and Dohrn are despicable, and yet making an issue of Obama's relationship with them is absurd.|$|R

In a September 2010 {{survey by the}} United States Presidency Centre of the Institute for the Study of the Americas at the University of London School of Advanced Study—one year and eight months into the Obama presidency—47 unnamed respondents who were U.K. academic specialists on American history and politics ranked 40 of 42 U.S. presidents from 1789 to 2009, not including Obama; <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> had been included he would have ranked 8th, behind Harry S.

In a June 2012 survey by Newsweek magazine—three years and five months into the Obama presidency—ten selected American historians and biographers ranked Obama 10th of 20 U.S. presidents since 1900. In an April 2013 survey by History News Network (HNN) website in Seattle—four years and three months into the Obama presidency—203 scholars from 69 top U.S. colleges and universities gave Obama a B- grade on an A–F scale. A February 2015 Brookings Institution survey {{of members of the}} American Political Science Association put Obama in 18th place out of the 43 presidents. Additionally, a 2011 Gallup poll found that 5% of Americans saw Obama as the country's greatest president.|$|E
500|$|Although Blagojevich's {{corruption}} {{was reported}} to have been under federal investigation, journalist Howard Fineman of the Huffington Post allegedly has sources that claim Jackson attributes the Obama replacement case to Obama's neutral stance. [...] According to Fineman's reported source, Jackson felt <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> had endorsed him, Blagojevich would have selected Jackson. [...] When the scandal first broke, the reaction was that Jackson's reputation was sullied to the point that his viability as a senatorial candidate was diminished. [...] However, reports that Jackson has been a longtime federal information provider has led political allies to continue to speak of his viability as a candidate. After much controversy, Roland Burris was successfully nominated by Blagojevich.|$|E
2500|$|A common claim {{among those}} arguing that President Obama {{was not born}} in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> {{released}} his [...] "long form" [...] birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why {{it took so long}} to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory. Finally, it would open the door to demands for other personal records unrelated to his birth certificate. Despite these concerns, both Obama and his press secretary have responded to reporters' questions about the issue.|$|E

2500|$|Before the 2008 presidential {{election}}, Trudeau {{sent out}} strips {{to run in}} the days after the election in which Barack Obama was portrayed as the winner. Newspapers were also provided with old strips as an alternative. When asked whether he created the original strip with complete confidence in an Obama victory, Trudeau replied: [...] "'Nope, more like rational risk assessment. Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning – pretty comfortable odds. Here's the way I look at it: <b>If</b> <b>Obama</b> wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. If he loses, it'll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar. I figure I can survive a little egg on my face'."

2500|$|With Democrats facing {{possible}} large {{losses in}} the 2010 midterm elections and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the 2012 presidential election led {{to the notion that}} Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal. Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> won. That it would ever happen was unlikely, but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, she smiled and shook her head. A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was [...] "completely unfounded" [...] and that [...] "they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are." [...] (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley did conduct some research into the idea of Clinton replacing Biden, but the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama.) ...|$|E

50|$|Much of the IMF’s {{report is}} devoted to the first option of a levy on all major {{financial}} institutions balance sheets.

2500|$|In May 2008, Cantor {{said that}} the Israeli–Palestinian {{conflict}} is not a [...] "constant sore" [...] but rather [...] "a constant reminder of the greatness of America", and following Barack Obama's election as President in November 2008, Cantor stated that a [...] "stronger U.S.–Israel relationship" [...] remains a top priority for him {{and that he would}} be [...] "very outspoken" [...] <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> [...] "did anything to undermine those ties." [...] Shortly after the 2010 midterm elections, Cantor met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just before Netanyahu was to meet with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. According to Cantor's office, he [...] "stressed that the new Republican majority will serve as a check on the Administration" [...] and [...] "made clear that the Republican majority understands the special relationship between Israel and the United States." [...] Cantor was criticized for engaging in foreign policy; one basis for the criticism was that in 2007, after Nancy Pelosi met with the President of Syria, Cantor himself had raised the possibility [...] "that her recent diplomatic overtures ran afoul of the Logan Act, which makes it a felony for any American 'without authority of the United States' to communicate with a foreign government to influence that government's behavior on any disputes with the United States." ...|$|E

Kobach said he did not have enough evidence to determine <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> could appear on the Kansas ballot for the 2012 presidential election. The New York Times editorialized that the actions of the Kansas authorities [...] "reignited long-running conspiracy theories that the president was not born in the United States." [...] CNN reported that [...] "the Kansas ballot measure is one ofseveral examplesof the birther movement's still-persistent presence." [...] At the time, Obama had released his long-form birth certificate but CBS News noted that [...] "so-called [...] "birthers" [...] persist with a variety of arguments that he is ineligible for the presidency. Generally, they claim that the birth certificate as released by the president is a forgery or that he is not eligible for the presidency despite being born in Hawaii." [...] Kobach maintained that the questioning of Obama's citizenship was not frivolous. Later that September, after a complainant dropped his challenge of Obama's eligibility for the Kansas ballot and after Hawaii officials sent a note to Kobach saying that Obama's birth certificate was genuine, Kobach allowed Obama to remain on the ballot and said, [...] "That, for me, settles the issue".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{political}} science professors questioned whether Obama's speech {{would have the}} effect he hoped for in terms of distancing himself from the controversial comments made by Wright and allaying the concerns {{of a number of}} white voters. Michael Munger—head of the {{political science}} department at Duke University, and a Libertarian candidate for Governor of North Carolina in 2008—called the speech [...] "brave", but said that Obama was [...] "being naive". Munger argued that [...] " [...] black candidate named Barack Hussein Obama can't have questions about his patriotism, and commitment to America, not if he is going to beat a genuine war hero" [...] (a reference to John McCain and the general election). He argued that Obama [...] "had to distance himself far from Wright. Instead, he was brave." [...] Susan B. Hansen of the University of Pittsburgh noted that [...] "the dilemma for Obama is that the more he talks about race being unimportant or transcended, the more important it will become to the media and voters' perceptions." [...] She suggested Obama did not put the Wright issue to rest and that, <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> became the nominee, Wright's comments would no doubt {{play a role in the}} general election as fodder for Republican attacks against him. Similarly, Eric Plutzer of Penn State argued that Obama's speech [...] "did not put the Rev. Wright controversy behind him.

2500|$|The {{campaign}} was criticized {{and in one}} case a lawsuit filed for its use of music during campaign events and in advertising. [...] Pioneering rock-n-roll artist Chuck Berry publicly snubbed McCain's use of his song [...] "Johnny B.

[...] When Berry publicly stated his support for Obama in June, the McCain campaign began using ABBA's [...] "Take a Chance on Me" [...] instead. In August 2008, singer Jackson Browne filed suit against the McCain Campaign, The Republican National Committee and the Ohio Republican Party for use of [...] "Running on Empty" [...] in a commercial stating that the use violates the Lanham Act by implying an endorsement by Browne. In October, the Foo Fighters asked the campaign to stop using [...] "My Hero", stating that this use of the song [...] "tarnished" [...] the original intent.

2500|$|Later in December, {{there was}} {{controversy}} regarding Obama's admissions {{of drug use}} as a teen. Obama first publicly acknowledged the issue in his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father.

[...] The issue was revived {{on the campaign trail}} after a November 2007 speech at a New Hampshire high school. Obama told the students, [...] "I've made some bad decisions that I've actually written about," [...] noting that his [...] "drinking and experimenting with drugs" [...] accounted for a lot of [...] "wasted time" [...] in high school. Some, including Republican candidate Mitt Romney, criticized Obama for discussing these examples with students. Romney said that [...] "in order to leave the best possible example for our kids, we're probably wisest not to talk about our own indiscretions in great detail." [...] However, fellow GOP candidate Rudy Giuliani and Partnership for a Drug-Free America president Stephen J. Pasierb praised Obama's candor. [...] "I respect his honesty," [...] Giuliani said. Pasierb told CNN that [...] "really the truth works best" [...] when discussing drug use with kids. Bill Shaheen, the co-chairman of Clinton's campaign in New Hampshire, mentioned the drug use in a December 12 conference call with reporters. Shaheen said that <b>if</b> <b>Obama</b> were to win the nomination, Republicans would use Obama's admissions against him in a general election. He suggested that in such a scenario, Republicans would ask, [...] "'When was the last time? Did you ever give drugs to anyone? Did you sell them to anyone?'" [...] He added that such [...] "Republican dirty tricks" [...] would be difficult to overcome. The comments immediately caused controversy, and Shaheen resigned the next day. Clinton denounced the comments and personally apologized to Obama. Her spokesman said that she [...] "made it clear that this kind of negative personal statement has no part in this campaign." [...] Appearing on Hardball with Chris Matthews, Axelrod accused the Clinton campaign of giving a [...] "wink and a nod" [...] to negative tactics. He criticized Clinton's December 3 statement in which she signaled a more aggressive approach and called it the [...] "fun part" [...] of the campaign.
