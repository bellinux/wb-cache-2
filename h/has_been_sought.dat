5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that Téa's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E

In December 2015, an additional $3.1 million in State Government funding was announced. Additional funding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> from the Commonwealth Government.|$|E
25|$|The {{most extreme}} {{estimation}} {{for the size}} of the Anglo-Saxon settlement suggests that some 80% of the resident population of Britain were not Anglo-Saxon. Given that, explanation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> to account for the change in culture of the Britons to one where by the 8th Century the majority of people in southern Britain saw themselves as heirs to the Anglo-Saxon culture. Whilst the developments were rather complicated, there are two competing theories.|$|E

Cyprus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> as a base for several offshore businesses for its low tax rates. Tourism, financial services and shipping are significant parts of the economy. Economic policy of the Cyprus government has focused on meeting the criteria for admission to the European Union. The Cypriot government adopted the euro as the national currency on 1 January 2008.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods. However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence (such as fungal spikes) provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> are most readily explained by sampling bias.|$|E
25|$|Restoration {{of the old}} monasteries in Ladakh, {{including}} the Thiksey Monastery, is being {{carried out by the}} Archaeological Survey of India, {{at the request of the}} concerned Monastery administration. This, however, has not been without its controversy. It is said that the traditional mud and stone courtyards have been changed to granite, which has marred the brightness of the place. Similarly, the restored right wing of the monastery involving construction of new kitchen, the dining hall for the monks by replacing the old traditional central courtyard has caused dissonance to the entire old edifice of the monastery. As a result, a balance to the restoration and renovation works <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> to retain the old order in consonance with the new works.|$|E

500|$|Interpretation of {{the wording}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> in the {{correspondence}} {{leading to the}} final version of the declaration. An official report to the War Cabinet sent by Sykes on 22 September said that the Zionists did not want [...] "to set up a Jewish Republic or any other form of state in Palestine or in any part of Palestine" [...] but rather preferred some form of protectorate as provided in the Palestine Mandate. A month later, Curzon produced a memorandum circulated on 26 October 1917 where he addressed two questions, the first concerning the meaning of the phrase [...] "a National Home for the Jewish race in Palestine"; he noted that there were different opinions ranging from a fully fledged state to a merely spiritual centre for the Jews.|$|E
500|$|The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{abandoned}} the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1962, {{and ever since}} it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> after for reactivation for train service. The line hasn't been reactivated due to local opposition, specifically the homeowners who live along the right-of-way. One group wants the line's reactivation for transit service. A second group would use the right-of-way as a linear park, known as the Queensway, a proposal inspired {{by the success of}} the High Line in Manhattan. The final group involving homeowners would have nothing done, keeping the line as is. Most plans call for the line to be used for subway service, with the line being connected to the south with the IND Rockaway Line. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented [...] "The commute for people here is only going to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation." [...] Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park, but said {{people who live in the}} Rockaways, Ozone Park and other areas have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates Resorts World casino and have been asked to construct the convention center, are evaluating several plans to increase transportation access. Genting is committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Advocates of the Queensway, a proposed public park along the branch's route, are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area. Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013. Both representatives will push to allocate federal transportation subsidies to study a plan for restored passenger service.|$|E

2500|$|The arbitral {{tribunal}} has not invited Taiwan {{to join the}} arbitration, and no opinion of Taiwan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought.</b> The Philippines claimed that Taiping Island is a rock. In response, President Ma Ying-jeou of the Republic of China on Taiwan rejected the Philippines' claim as [...] "patently false". Taiwan invited the Philippines and five arbitrators to visit Taiping Island; the Philippines rejected the invitation, {{and there was no}} response from the PCA tribunal.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of genetic}} data to {{supplement}} traditional disciplines {{has now become}} mainstream. Given the palimpsest nature of modern genetic diversity, more direct evidence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> from ancient DNA (aDNA) Although data from southeastern Europe is still at an incipient stage, general trends are already evident. For example, it {{has shown that the}} Neolithic revolution imparted a major demographic impact throughout Europe, disproving the Mesolithic adaptation scenario in its pure form. In fact, the arrival of Neolithic farmers might have been in at least two [...] "waves", as suggested by a study which analysed mtDNA sequences from Romanian Neolithic samples.|$|E
2500|$|Peace is {{a certain}} quality of {{existence}} which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> after, yet seldom found in a long enduring form, since time immemorial. In a behavioral sense, peace is generally understood to be a lack of conflict and freedom from fear of violence between heterogeneous social groups. [...] Throughout history benevolent leaders have often exhibited {{a certain type of}} behavioral or political restraint, which in turn has often resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties. [...] Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the de-escalation of conflicts, or in multilateral or bilateral peace talks. [...] The avoidance of war or violent hostility is often the result of compromise, and is often initiated with thoughtful active listening and communication, which may tend to enable a greater genuine mutual understanding.|$|E

If this were so, I can find no reason for the plaintiff's importation into the correspondence of the figures of twelve thousand pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds. The defendant's contention would render these figures meaningless. It is manifest to me that by his letter of May 20 he assented to a very clear proposition, by the terms of which he must be held to be bound.|$|E

60|$|That is {{the very}} best kind of advice, but most people find that out when it is too late. Grandfather Frog did. Of course he had heard that little verse all his life. Indeed, he had been very fond of saying it to those {{who came to the}} Smiling Pool to ask his advice. But Grandfather Frog seemed to have left all his wisdom behind him when he left the Smiling Pool {{to go out into the}} Great World. You see, it is very hard work for any one whose advice <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>sought</b> to turn right around and take advice themselves. So Grandfather Frog had been getting into scrapes ever since he started out on his foolish journey, and now here he was in still another, and he had landed in it head first, with a great splash.|$|E
