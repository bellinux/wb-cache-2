In focused ion beam technology, however, the ion penetration depth is limited, thus requiring the use of extremely thin resist layers or higher ion acceleration energies. These requirements are often undesirable for the current IC manufacturing processes. One {{solution to this problem}} is to exploit the Top Surface Imaging (TSI) technique for dry developed FIB lithography schemes. In this paper, we investigate a novel lithography process, which combines focused Ga+ ion beam (Ga+ FIB) exposure, silylation and oxygen dry <b>etching.</b> The Negative <b>Resist</b> <b>Image</b> by Dry Etching (NERIME) is a TSI scheme for DNQ/novolak based resists, and can result in either positive or negative <b>resist</b> <b>images</b> depending on the extent of the ion beam exposure dose.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry microanalysis shows that gallium is implanted into the SPR 660 resist to a depth of 50 nm and the oxidised gallium layer has a thickness of approximately 15 nm. It is also shown that the NERIME process can resolve nanometer resist patterns down to 65 nm, and yet maintain a high aspect ratio of 15.

50|$|Photolithography shares some {{fundamental}} principles with photography {{in that the}} pattern in the <b>etching</b> <b>resist</b> is created by exposing it to light, either directly (without using a mask) or with a projected image using an optical mask. This procedure is comparable to a high precision version of the method used to make printed circuit boards. Subsequent stages in the process {{have more in common}} with etching than with lithographic printing. It is used because it can create extremely small patterns (down to a few tens of nanometers in size), it affords exact control over the shape and size of the objects it creates, and because it can create patterns over an entire surface cost-effectively. Its main disadvantages are that it requires a flat substrate to start with, it is not very effective at creating shapes that are not flat, and it can require extremely clean operating conditions.|$|R

Based on the results of the application of the ARC on a planar aluminum substrate, an increase of the latitude of exposure and an improvement of the <b>resist</b> <b>image</b> quality were found. The ARC had a specific concentration of dyes and a specific thickness. The image was a 1. 0 µm line and space pattern. By using the ARC, even though the resist thickness varied from 1. 2 µm to 1. 5 µm, the resulting 1. 0 µm image remained within a ± 10 % tolerance range. This result was then used to apply the ARC technique on an uneven aluminum substrate with a 0. 5 µm height step. The final aluminum image was obtained by transferring the positive <b>resist</b> <b>image</b> to the aluminum film.

In order to insert extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography at the 15 nm technology node and beyond, we have thoroughly characterized one EUV mask, a so-called NOVACD mask.

The results of the analysis show a good correlation between the mask AFM and the mask SEM measurements, However, the resist printing results for the isolated space patterns are slightly different.

40|$|We have {{developed}} novel photopolymers {{based on the}} triazeno chromophore group. The absorption properties can be tailored for a specific irradiation wavelength (e. g. 308 nm XeCl laser). With {{the introduction of a}} photolabile group into the main chain of the polymer we expected a mechanism which is mainly photochemical. This should result in high resolution etching with no thermal damage or chemical / physical modification to the material. The gaseous products of the photochemical decomposition were thought to assist the material removal, and to prevent the re-deposition of solid products which would contaminate the surface. We confirmed (SEM/AFM) that the irradiation of the polymer at 308 mn resulted in high resolution etching. No debris has been found around the etched comers. Maximum ablation rates of about 3 {mu}m / pulse were achieved due to the dynamic absorption behavior (bleaching during the pulse). No physical or chemical modifications of the polymer surface could be detected after irradiation at the tailored absorption wavelength, whereas irradiation at different wavelengths resulted in modified (physical and chemical) surfaces. The etching mechanism can be described as a laser induced microexplosion, revealed by ns-imaging. The etching of the polymer starts and ends with the laser pulse, shown by ns-interferometry, confirming that the acting mechanism is mainly photochemical at high fluences for our polymers.
