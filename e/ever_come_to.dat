25|$|In 1971, Hawke {{along with}} other members of the ACTU {{requested}} that South Africa send a non-racially biased team for the Rugby Union tour, with the intention of unions agreeing not to serve the team in Australia. Prior to arrival, the Western Australian branch of the Transport Workers Union, and the Barmaids' and Barmens' Union, announced that they would serve the team, which allowed the Springboks to land in Perth. The tour commenced on 26 June and riots occurred as anti-apartheid protesters disrupted games. Hawke and his family started to receive malicious mail and phone calls from people who thought that sport and politics should not mix. Hawke remained committed to the ban on apartheid teams and later that year, the South African cricket team was successfully denied and no apartheid team was to <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Australia again. It was this ongoing dedication to racial equality in South Africa that would later earn Hawke the respect and friendship of Nelson Mandela.|$|E

500|$|... "Discipline" [...] {{was written}} and {{composed}} by Reznor, who produced it with Atticus Ross and Moulder.

Rolling Stone magazine described the track as [...] "the closest Reznor has <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> disco, right down to a splashing high-hat, boosted way up in the mix". Eric Harvey of Pitchfork also compared the song to disco, saying that the song [...] "eschews a typically monstrous chorus for an airtight industrial disco grind ventilated by an airy piano and falsetto cooing." ...|$|E

[...] With the authorization of the Kennedy half dollar on December 30, 1963, the Franklin half dollar series came to an end. [...] Breen reports rumors of 1964 Franklin half dollars, produced possibly as trial strikes to test 1964-dated dies, but none has <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> light.

500|$|One of {{the first}} {{original}} songs recorded for the album was [...] "Stuck in a Closet With Vanna White", describing a bizarre recurring dream about Vanna White. Allmusic described the song as a [...] "real winner for Yankovic" [...] because it [...] "was the first song [...] wrote that his [...] target audience [...] actually liked as much or even more than his parodies." [...] "You Make Me" [...] is a song involving a person's desire to engage in strange or violent behavior compelled by the weirdness of another person. According to the liner notes of The Permanent Record, [...] "It's about as close as [...] <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> writing a real love song." [...] Musically, the song is a style parody of Oingo Boingo.|$|E
500|$|From 1885 to 1889 Shaw {{attended}} the fortnightly {{meetings of the}} British Economic Association; it was, Holroyd observes, [...] "the closest Shaw had <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> university education." [...] This experience changed his political ideas; he moved away from Marxism and became an apostle of gradualism. When in 1886–87 the Fabians debated whether to embrace anarchism, as advocated by Charlotte Wilson, Besant and others, Shaw joined the majority in rejecting this approach. After a rally in Trafalgar Square addressed by Besant was violently broken up by the authorities on 13 November 1887 ("Bloody Sunday"), Shaw became convinced of the folly of attempting to challenge police power. Thereafter he largely accepted the principle of [...] "permeation" [...] as advocated by Webb: the notion whereby socialism could best be achieved by infiltration of people and ideas into existing political parties.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in June 2001 at an {{airplane}} hangar at Los Angeles International Airport {{and at a}} Lifehouse show in London. It was directed by Marcos Siega, who is most notable for his work with Blink-182 and Papa Roach. In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera tricks that make it look amazing. From far away, the stage set looked normal, {{but when you get}} closer you get smaller and it gets huge. We were being filmed in front of this bookcase that was like 150 feet high. It's a real visual trip." [...] It premiered on VH1.com on June 27, 2001.|$|E

I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|TJ of Neon Limelight gave a mixed review, {{calling it}} [...] "sassy" [...] but [...] "would work better {{for an artist}} {{at least a decade}} younger than Aguilera", with its [...] "painfully {{adolescent}} lyrics". Becky Bain of Idolator wrote, [...] "It's one of those pandering songs that will no doubt have young girls singing along, particularly the chorus, but it's a lazy one that leaves rubs us the wrong way." [...] Bradley Stern from MuuMuse named it a [...] "filler, including the noisy, childish chant." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "it's the kind of trite glitter-disco might've dispensed", while comparing it to Spice Girls' songs. Eric Henderson gave to the song a negative review, writing, [...] "Considering 'I Hate Boys' is closer than I ever thought Christina would <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> recording a Daphne Aguilera track, it's ironically also one of many tracks on Bionic that sound tailor-made to accompany the opening credits of Johnny Weir's forthcoming reality show." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna: Like an Icon was {{released}} on 27 August 2007, in the United Kingdom by Bantam Press. The book cover was designed by Holly MacDonald, with an image of Madonna from 2002, during the premiere of her film, Swept Away. It {{was released}} {{more than a year}} later in the United States. The biography faced mixed reviews from critics. Sarah Churchwell from The Guardian criticized O'Brien's extended commentary about Madonna's recording process. She believed that more emphasis should have been given on Madonna's personal life as well. Pointing out examples like Madonna's relationship with actor Warren Beatty, which was widely covered in the media but was only lightly touched in the book, Churchwell wondered about the claim of the book in its press release: [...] "This is the closest you will <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Madonna's autobiography". The reviewer concluded by saying, [...] "Since her voice is nowhere in evidence, this book, however capable and intelligent its writer, is probably about the farthest you will ever get from Madonna's autobiography." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{guiding the}} club to {{promotion}} Andy Nelson left to take over as manager of Charlton Athletic {{and was replaced by}} Len Ashurst, but his managerial reign lasted only 16 months. [...] Gerry Summers took over and was to take the club the closest it had <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> promotion to Division Two when, in 1978–79, Gillingham finished just one point off a promotion place, [...] but two years later Summers was replaced by Keith Peacock. [...] Peacock put together a team which developed a reputation for exciting, attacking play, and also brought through the ranks a number of young players who went on to achieve success at a higher level, including Micky Adams, Steve Bruce, and Tony Cascarino, who was famously bought from non-league Crockenhill in exchange for a set of tracksuits. [...] Gillingham came close to promotion several times during Peacock's reign, with four top-six finishes in six years, and in 1986–87 reached the play-offs (in their first year of existence) only to lose in the final to Swindon Town. [...] Deadlocked at 2–2 after the home and away legs of the final, the two teams had to play a third match at a neutral venue, which Swindon won 2–0.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the home was used as a {{temporary}} hospital. Colonel John Glover and the Marblehead Regiment occupied the house as their temporary barracks in June 1775. Initially, General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the newly formed Continental Army, used the Benjamin Wadsworth House at Harvard College as his headquarters, but decided he needed more space for his staff. Washington moved into the Vassall House on July 16, 1775, and used it as his headquarters and home until he departed on April 4, 1776. During the Siege of Boston, he found the view of the Charles River from the house particularly useful. [...] The home was shared with several aide-de-camps, including colonel Robert H. Harrison. During his time there, Washington was visited by John Adams and Abigail Adams, Benedict Arnold, Henry Knox, and Nathanael Greene. In his study, Washington also confronted Dr. Benjamin Church with evidence that he was a spy. It was in this house that Washington received a poem written by Phillis Wheatley, the first published African-American poet. [...] "If you should <b>ever</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Cambridge", he wrote to her, [...] "I shall be happy to see a person so favored by the Muses".|$|E
