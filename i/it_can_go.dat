5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E

25|$|The {{exact number}} of people with MDS is not known because <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> undiagnosed and no {{tracking}} of the syndrome is mandated. Some estimates are on the order of 10,000 to 20,000 new cases each year in the United States alone. The number of new cases each year is probably increasing as the age of the population increases, and some authors propose that the number of new cases in those over 70 may be as high as 15 per 100,000 per year.|$|E
25|$|Scale counts can {{sometimes}} be used to tell the sex of a snake when the species is not distinctly sexually dimorphic. A probe is inserted into the cloaca until <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> no further. The probe is marked {{at the point where}} it stops, removed, and compared to the subcaudal depth by laying it alongside the scales. The scalation count determines whether the snake is a male or female as hemipenes of a male will probe to a different depth (usually longer) than the cloaca of a female.|$|E

25|$|The trans-Planckian {{problem is}} {{nowadays}} mostly considered a mathematical artifact of horizon calculations. The same effect occurs for regular matter falling onto a white hole solution. Matter which {{falls on the}} white hole accumulates on it, but has no future region into which <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>go.</b> Tracing {{the future of this}} matter, it is compressed onto the final singular endpoint of the white hole evolution, into a trans-Planckian region. The reason for these types of divergences is that modes which end at the horizon {{from the point of view}} of outside coordinates are singular in frequency there. The only way to determine what happens classically is to extend in some other coordinates that cross the horizon.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{availability}} of drugs proven to treat neuropathic pain is limited and varies widely from patient to patient. Many developed drugs have either been discovered by accident or by observation. Some past treatments include opiates like poppy extract, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like salicylic acid, and local anesthetics like cocaine. Other recent treatments consist of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, although no substantial research on the actual mechanism of these treatments has been performed. However, patients respond to these treatments differently, possibly because of gender differences or genetic backgrounds. Therefore, researchers {{have come to realize}} that no one drug or one class of drugs will reduce all pain. Research is now focusing on the underlying mechanisms involved in pain perception and how <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> wrong in order to develop an appropriate drug for patients afflicted with neuropathic pain.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{a breakup}} lament {{dealing with the}} theme of commitment. Its title refers to the turning point of a {{relationship}}. The lyrics address a relationship {{in a state of}} tension and uncertainty: [...] "We've reached the climax / We're together / Now we're undone / Won't commit so we choose to run away / Do we separate?" [...] Usher sings in a pleading falsetto and a plaintive tone on the song, alternating restrained vocals and anguished howls. In an interview for V-103, Usher stressed that [...] "Climax" [...] focuses more on the complication of relationships rather than sex, saying that [...] "it's really about the ultimate experience or lack thereof. Or the finale of an experience of love and life. When you're in a relationship and it has kinda reached the climax of where <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>go,</b> you gotta let it go if {{you are not going to}} commit." [...] He viewed that his falsetto vocals and the song's tone give the song a sexual feel with music that works as a [...] "double entendre".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders get it wrong is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a [...] "brilliant episode from start to finish". He commented that [...] "We see what an amazing amount {{of goods and services}} one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode [...] "typically inspired", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: [...] "And just when you think the Simpsons creators have taken parody as far as <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>go,</b> they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a [...] "classic". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a [...] "fan" [...] of the episode's second half: [...] "Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste". He thought the first part was [...] "absolutely brilliant", though.|$|E
