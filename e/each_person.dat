5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark.

5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for <b>each</b> <b>person</b> who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the formal {{administration}} of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where <b>each</b> <b>person</b> could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E
