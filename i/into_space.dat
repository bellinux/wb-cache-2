5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock.

The analogous question for mappings of m <b>space</b> <b>into</b> n <b>space,</b> 2 < m ≤ n, has been open for a long time. We answer this question in the affirmative in a more general setting. Accordingly, as a special case, we show that if a continuous mapping of m <b>space</b> <b>into</b> n <b>space,</b> m ≤ n, has partial derivatives which belong to Lm then the Lebesgue area is given by the classical formula...|$|R

40|$|If H is a lattice in {{a locally}} compact second {{countable}} group G, then {{we show that}} G has property A (respectively is coarsely embeddable <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space)</b> {{if and only if}} H has property A (respectively is coarsely embeddable <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space).</b> Moreover, we show three interesting generalizations of this result. If H is a closed subgroup of G that is co-amenable in G, and if H has property A (respectively, is coarsely embeddable <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space),</b> then we show that G has property A (respectively, is coarsely embeddable <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space).</b> We also show that an extension of property A groups still has property A. On the coarse embeddability side, we show that if {e}→ H→ G→ Q→{e} is a short exact sequence, and if either H is coarsely embeddable <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space</b> and Q has property A, or H is compact and Q is coarsely embeddable <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space,</b> then G is coarsely embeddable <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space.</b> We extend the theory of measure equivalence to locally compact non-unimodular groups. In a natural way, we can also define measure equivalence subgroups. We show that property A and uniform embeddability <b>into</b> Hilbert <b>space</b> pass to measure equivalence subgroups. Using the same techniques, we show that also the Haagerup property, weak amenability and the weak Haagerup property pass to measure equivalence subgroups...|$|R
