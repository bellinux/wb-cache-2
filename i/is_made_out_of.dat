The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter, although this may have been a coincidence on George's part. Elizabeth had the necklace shortened by removing the biggest sapphire in 1952, and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone. In 1963, a new sapphire and diamond tiara and bracelet were made to match the original pieces. The tiara <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a necklace that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium, daughter of Leopold II.

Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong {{is made up of}} only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
