That requires the storage <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> for the food needs can be fulfilled in a sustainable manner. To maintain the quality <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> produced the need for good storage <b>of</b> <b>rice.</b> Therefore, investigation <b>of</b> the influence of storage on the quality <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> {{is needed to determine}} changes in physical properties during storage. Components <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> quality standard set forth in the quality <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> is the degree sosoh, moisture content, head rice / whole grains, broken grains, groats, grain red, yellow grain / grain damage, grain lime / green grains, foreign matter, grain and mixed grain varieties other. This research method is a method of sampling, ie taking a sample <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> about 100 grams <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> stored in sacks <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> BULOG. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> using the method of observation. Analysis of water content made with grain moisture tester. Analysis of water uptake is done by soaking the samples then were weighed to determine the amount of water absorbed. During the storage of grain and grain yellow chalk has increased in each type <b>of</b> test <b>rice.</b> As for the grain head is decreasing, an increase of broken grains, and grain groats increased in each type <b>of</b> test <b>rice.</b> Increased water content in each type <b>of</b> test <b>rice.</b> Water uptake was reduced in each type <b>of</b> test <b>rice.</b> For rice quality remains good even if stored for long periods, conditions of temperature and humidity during storage must be suitable and maintained stability.
