30|$|One {{could argue}} that any {{additional}} eyes off road time beyond that required to safely operate the vehicle in accordance with for example the rules laid out for the <b>driving</b> test (<b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> side mirror checks etc.) is intuitively negative in terms of safety, however, as introduced previously, relationships have been suggested between the length of glances away from {{the road and the}} risk of accident involvement. However, these relationships also need to be contextualised with vehicle speed and complexity of road environment which also influence crash risk.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Imagine a man {{driving down}} a street that he has driven {{everyday}} for the past 10 years. In the years that he has driven on this street, {{it has always been}} one-way. Over time, this driver has become so familiar with this street that he no longer looks out the windshield at the road, but drives while looking in the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror.</b> At first, looking in the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror</b> was just an interesting way of driving for this man. More recently however, since he had never been in an accident while driving by looking in the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror,</b> he has come to believe that this is a safe and effective manner of driving. Now imagine that, unbeknownst to this man, the street has become, for the first time today, a two-way street. Since the man does not know of the change, he is driving on the road as if it is still one-way and he continues to look exclusively in the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror</b> to navigate. He sees in his <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>mirror</b> cars swerving as they pass. He can see the drivers of these other cars swearing at him. He wonders what has gotten into these people; why are they going the wrong way? Why are they acting so angry with him? He has not done anything wrong. He has been a model driver for 10 years. What is wrong with these crazy people? He thinks {{they are going to get}} him into an accident. He begin...|$|R
