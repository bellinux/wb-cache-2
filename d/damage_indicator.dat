40|$|In this paper, the {{distance}} measures of autoregressive (AR) models {{are used as}} <b>damage</b> <b>indicators.</b> Two distance measures are discussed: one is the Itakura distance, {{and the other is}} the cepstral distance. The distance measures of AR model have been successfully applied in image, speech, and neurological signal processing applications. This research explores new applications of two distance measures for damage detection in civil engineering. A five-storey building model is used for performance verification. Verification simulations show efficiencies of both distance-based <b>damage</b> <b>indicators</b> when the excitations are mutually uncorrelated. However, the ability of <b>damage</b> <b>indicators</b> for <b>damage</b> localization is deteriorated when the multiple excitations are mutually correlated as there are strong correlations among them. In practice, the excitations acting on civil engineering structures are mutually dependent and correlated, such as wind and traffic loading. To overcome this difficulty, a pre-whitening filter is applied for removal of correlations in excitations before calculating the <b>damage</b> <b>indicators.</b> To examine the proposed methodology, simulation and experiment data have been tested. It can be concluded from the results that, by using the pre-whitening filter, the damage identification ability of the proposed <b>damage</b> <b>indicators</b> improves significantly, especially for damage localization.

There are a number of heavy pneumatic-tyred proof rollers available in Australia for this purpose. These rollers are predominantly owned by the Department of Defence and made available to airfield constructors, on a project-by-project basis. The selection of rollers and the design of proof rolling regimes should utilise the stress with depth calculation function of layered elastic design tools such as APSDS. Proof rolling regimes can be determined by comparison {{of aircraft}} and roller induced plots of the <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> with depth. The traditional use of Boussinesq’s equation for simple load stress with depth in a single elastic layer is also viable for many practical applications.

40|$|Fatigue cracks under {{high-cycle fatigue}} loading due to normal traffic {{are one of}} the major damage modes of steel bridges. Monitoring these cracks is of great {{importance}} especially for fracture-critical bridges in order to ensure safe operation by preventing catastrophic failure due to excessive damage. A newly developed soft elastomeric capacitive (SEC) sensor [1] is able to monitor strain changes over a large area of structural surface and resist large deformation due to cracking without being damaged. To examine the feasibility of monitoring fatigue cracks under high-cycle fatigue loading using the SEC sensor, a compact tension specimen is tested under cyclic tension loads with varying load ranges (Fig. 1), which are designed to ensure realistic stress level, hence the size of crack opening, one would see in real bridges. The measured capacitance time history from the SEC sensor is converted into power spectral densities (PSD), such that the amplitude of the signal can be extracted at the dominant loading frequency. A crack <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> is proposed as the ratio between the amplitude of PSD and load range.

The main objective of the studies carried out in this thesis was to identify the occurrence of cracks in a stiffened plate model representing the ship's side shell structure. [...] Based on analysis using a finite element program package, a one-twentieth aluminum stiffened plate model of a tanker ship's side shell structure was designed. Three models were fabricated; the models were tested using random excitation forces whose dominant frequency was far separated <≈ 2 Hz) from the first natural frequency of the models <≈ 580 Hz) under intact and 8 (eight) damaged conditions. These damages occurred at flange(s) and web(s) of the model's longitudinal(s). In damage cases # 1 to # 4, the damage occurred at a longitudinal in {{the connections between}} the longitudinal and bulkheads while in damage cases # 5 to # 8, damage the intersections of longitudinals and a web frame. Using the model's responses obtained from finite element analysis the best accelerometer and strain gage locations were determined. Output-only modal analysis was implemented in the experimental investigations; random decrement method and Ibrahim time domain identification technique were employed to extract modal parameters. [...] Natural frequencies, root mean square (rms) of acceleration and strain response and amplitudes of {{a function of the}} natural frequency, the damping ratio and free response (which was called Dn in this study) obtained from numerical and experimental investigations were compared. Although natural frequencies, the rms and the Dn amplitude values computed from the results of numerical investigations were different from those obtained from the experimental investigations, most of them had similar trends due to increasing crack lengths. [...] Damage identification schemes for on-line and off-line identification of cracks, using the rms of acceleration and strain response and the amplitude of Dn function, were presented. Using these values a <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> was proposed. It was demonstrated that the schemes could identify the crack locations and lengths. In the first scheme, a <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> was computed from the rms of acceleration and strain response obtained from numerical and experimental investigations. To estimate the <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> values as cracks increased in length an algebraic function was developed and used. It was observed that the difference between the actual and extrapolated <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> values was a maximum of 18. 63 %. Crack lengths could also be estimated by employing the function along with an iteration procedure using assumed <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> value as initial value and defined error tolerance. Very good results were obtained; a maximum error of 3 % was observed. Another damage identification scheme using numerically computed rms response to obtain crack length and location was also presented. This scheme can be categorized as a nomogram technique. It is shown that the scheme can be used to identify accurately the extent and the location of cracks occurring in the horizontal's flange and web with maximum error of 2 %. [...] The amplitude of Dn function was also examined to assess damage in the investigated model. The function was obtained utilizing a neural network technique. While the modal frequencies decreased and modal damping ratios did not have definable trend as the crack lengths grew, the Dn amplitudes changed consistently as a results of cracks occurring at one location. A <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> was also computed from the amplitudes of Dn function, for different damage cases. The algebraic function developed earlier was also employed to extrapolate the <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> values for subsequent damage cases with assumed crack lengths and locations. In addition, the function was also employed to estimate the crack sizes for known <b>damage</b> <b>indicator</b> values.
