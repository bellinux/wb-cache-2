40|$|Oralin ® is a {{microbial}} {{feed additive}} {{based on the}} Enterococcus faecium DSM 10663 /NCIMB 10415 strain. This product has previously been authorized at Community level for chickens for fattening, piglets and calves and for turkeys. The notifier is now seeking authorisation for an extension of use for dogs. EFSA has been requested by the European Commission to give an opinion on the safety of Oralin®, when used as a feed additive (109 - 1010 cfu kg- 1 <b>feedingstuff)</b> for dogs. In a 21 day tolerance study {{with a total of}} 16 beagle dogs (6 months of age) a control diet was compared to a diet containing ten times the highest recommended Oralin ® dose. All parameters tested support the conclusion that the additive is well tolerated by dogs. Two experiments to determine the influence of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 on the faecal microflora were reported. In one study Oralin ® significantly reduced numbers of E. coli. In the second Clostridium spp. counts were reduced but no differences were noted in the counts made on media selective for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. Thus, overall, the use of Oralin ® does not appear to adversely affect the microflora. The potential presence of virulence factors in the E. faecium NCIMB 10415 strain was also investigated. The cell adhesion efaAfm gene was found in the production strain but this is commonly found in other E. faecium strains, and is not a cause of concern.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were made with}} S. C. W. L. roosters {{to test the hypothesis}} that the apparent M. E. value of a <b>feedingstuff</b> is affected by the level of intake. In the first experiment the birds were starved for 18 hr. and then fed varying amounts of whole wheat. Excreta voided during the 24 hr. experimental period was collected quantitatively and assayed for gross energy. Energy voided as excreta increased in a linear manner as the intake of wheat increased. The apparent M. E. value also varied with wheat consumption according to the equation M. E. (kcal. /g.) = 3. 17 X- 8. 5 /X where: 3. 17 kcal. /g. is the true M. E. value of the wheat; 8. 5 kcal. represents the sum of the metabolic fecal and endogenous urinary energy losses; and X is the weight of wheat consumed (g.). A supplementary observation was that the metabolic fecal and endogenous nitrogen excretion of the roosters was 144 mg. /kg. / 24 hr. In the second experiment corn oil was placed in the crops of starved roosters and the energy voided as excreta in 24 hr. was measured. The true M. E. value of the corn oil was 9. 40 kcal. /g. but the apparent value varied with intake. It is therefore concluded that the original hypothesis is correct. The findings of these experiments may explain some of the reported variations in M. E. data. A new approach to the assay for M. E. is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The work {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the Milk thistle (used substance Silymarin) on the carcass yield of hybrid combinations rabbits Hyla. Hybrid combination Hyla was purposefully bred for meat performance, showing excellent results in breeding. Rabbits behave primarily on meat, because nutritional properties correspond to the current requirements of rational nutrition. Therefore, it is appropriate to increase the carcass yield. The average slaughter yield is indicated from 40 to 53 % according to the breed. It was found that the addition of milk thistle {{in the form of a}} powder in the complete <b>feedingstuff</b> at a concentration of 0. 2 % increased the carcass yield, relative to the control group (which was fed only KKS), on average by 0. 4 %. The group with the addition of 1 % showed an average value of 1. 2 % higher than the group control. The average slaughter yield of all the groups ranged from 54, 68 into 63, 02 %. In both farms also decreased the incidence of diarrheal disease. Silymarin has a favorable effect on the operation and growth of the liver. In the group with the addition of 0. 2 % increased the average liver weight of 8. 1 g, in the group with a concentration of 1 % weight on average picked up about 10 g.

40|$|The global {{problem of}} food {{products}} contaminated by residues of the banned carcinogenic nitrofuran drugs has prompted research into how such residues accumulate in tissues. In the study described here, two aspects {{have been investigated}} where the nitrofurans accumulate in tissues from chickens exposed to either a dietary or an environmental source of contamination. Twenty groups of broilers were fed a diet containing one of the nitrofurans: furazolidone, nitrofurazone, nitrofurantoin or furaltadone at concentrations of 30, 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 ?µg?kg- 1. At the lowest concentration of furazolidone contamination (0. 01 % of the therapeutic dose) tissue bound AOZ metabolite residues were detected in liver (1. 1 ?±? 0. 2 ?µg?kg- 1) and in muscle (0. 33 ?±? 0. 03 ?µg?kg- 1). Similar results were obtained for AMOZ (0. 6 ?±? 0. 2 ?µg?kg- 1 in liver), the tissue bound metabolite of furaltadone. There was no appreciable accumulation of nitrofurantoin in chicken muscle. The AHD metabolite was not detected in muscle from birds fed nitrofurantoin at either 30 or 100 ?µg?kg- 1. For nitrofurazone the concentrations of the SEM metabolite were higher in muscle than in liver for all dietary concentrations. The potential for a contaminated environment to cause nitrofuran residues in chickens was investigated. Six chickens were placed in a pen that was previously occupied by birds fed a diet containing 3000 ?µg?kg- 1 of furazolidone. After 24 hours¿ exposure of the chickens to the litter in the pen, AOZ residues of 0. 13 ?±? 0. 04 and 0. 10 ?±? 0. 03 ?µg?kg- 1 were detected in liver and muscle, respectively.

40|$|A {{novel and}} {{suitable}} clean-up method that allows, {{for the first}} time, the simultaneous determination of a rather large number of macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, rosamicin, spiramycin, tylosin, kitasamycin and josamycin in <b>feedingstuffs</b> by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) is presented in this work. The effectiveness of the developed clean-up method allows the quantification of the target macrolides in poultry feed using standard calibration curves instead of matrix matched standards, which overcomes the general problem of finding representative blanks. Furthermore an additional back extraction included in the sample preparation procedure allows the determination of an additional macrolide (oleandomycin) with detection limits, expressed as apparent concentration in poultry feed, ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 22 mg kg- 1 and relative standard deviation values ranging from 3. 6 to 10. 1 % depending on the target analyte. Moreover, this additional step has been proven to enlarge {{the scope of the}} method by the extension of its applicability, at the target level of concentration, to other animal <b>feedingstuffs</b> such as pig and cattle. The analysis of real <b>feedingstuffs</b> containing macrolides demonstrated the fitness for purpose of the whole analytical procedure as well as a good fitting between real and spiked samples. The proposed methods appeared therefore as a sound alternative in the frame of control (e. g. for post-screening purposes) and/or monitoring surveillance programmes at the target level of 1. 0 mg kg- 1 established according to the reported lowest dosage of additive needed to lead a growth promoting effect.

40|$|Intensification of milk {{production}} {{is associated with}} {{an increase in the number}} of dairy cows and milk yielding. In order to maintain high milk yield and quality of the produced raw material it is very important to adjust the appropriately balanced dose of feeds. Production of good quality own roughage is a valuable and cheap source of food for animals, but it may be insufficient to provide high milk yielding. As a result, it is necessary to buy commercial concentrated <b>feedingstuffs</b> (mainly protein concentrates and concentrated compounds) which may lead to an increase of production costs. Intensification of {{milk production}} in the economic aspect is justified only in the case of a simultaneous increase in the profitability of this production, which is the relation of the production value and incurred costs. For the economic purpose of milk production the way of feeding the dairy cows should also result from economic calculation and the purchase of commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> must be economically justified. This article attempts to answer the question whether the increased consumption of commercial concentrated <b>feedingstuffs</b> and increased direct costs are justified by achieved economic results from milk production. The accountancy data were collected according to the methodology of the AGROKOSZTY and Polish FADN system among dairy farms. Grouping of the surveyed farms concerned a level of commercial feedingstuff quantity which (as shown by statistical analysis) was strongly correlated with milk yielding. The designated groups (with small level and high level of usage of commercial <b>feedingstuffs)</b> were analysed in terms of direct costs and labour input as well as the level of income from the activity. The economic results of the surveyed farms showed that the higher costs incurred for the purchase of commercial feedstuffs in the group with high usage of commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> (average herd in the group was 30 dairy cows with milk yielding of 6, 000 liters per cow) did not allow to achieve much better economic results than in the group with small usage of commercial feedstuffs (average herd in group was 15 cows with milk yielding of 5, 200 litres per cow) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Ninety-six adult Single Comb White Leghorn {{males were}} divided into two 48 -bird groups to assay <b>feedingstuffs</b> for {{apparent}} metabolizable energy (AME) and true metabolizable en-ergy (TME). The metabolizable energy contents of corn, wheat, oats, rye, barley, glucose and soy-bean, rapeseed, sunflower, dehydrated alfalfa, feather, and fish and meat meals were evaluated. The experiment consisted of three replicates in a cross-over design. The excreta voided by birds in both assays was collected quantitatively at 24 - and 48 -hr intervals after feeding. A set of corrected AME values (AMEC) was obtained by correcting AME results for endogenous excreta losses.

The resulting maximum safe concentration was calculated for dogs and cats and was extrapolated to other non food-producing animals. The maximum safe concentration was 25 mg Quinoline Yellow/kg complete feed for all non food-producing animals. Since no information regarding dusting potential was available, it would be prudent to regard both the powder and the granulated forms as hazardous if inhaled.

40|$|A novel liquid {{chromatography}} single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC¿MS) method for {{the determination of}} the feed additive semduramicin, in poultry feed, was developed and single-laboratory validated. This work was selected as a real case scenario to outline the different steps that may be needed whenever the standardisation of an analytical method in the field of methods of analysis for animal <b>feedingstuffs</b> is attempted. In this manuscript the main achievements reached within the development and the singlelaboratory validation of an analytical method for the determination of semduramicin in <b>feedingstuffs</b> are detailed. Semduramicin is extracted from the <b>feedingstuffs</b> with acetonitrile. The obtained extracts are then filtered and diluted appropriately. The separation has been carried out in a reverse phase C 18 column using isocratic elution with a mixture of methanol and 20 mM ammonium formate solution as mobile phase. The ammonium adducts have been selected for monitoring the coccidiostats signals in the mass spectrometry detector. The method has been successfully validated for the determination of semduramicin concentrations ranging between half of the minimum authorized concentration (10 mgkg- 1) to twice of the maximum authorized concentration (50 mgkg- 1). Agood relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) varying from 2. 8 to 3. 2 % has been obtained whereas the relative standard deviation for intermediate precision (RSDInt.) ranged from 3. 7 to 7. 3 %. The obtained analytical performance characteristics of the method demonstrated its fitness for the purpose, making thus the proposed method suitable to be submitted for the last phase within the standardisation procedure, i. e. the inter-laboratory study.

40|$|Fumaric acid is {{currently}} authorised as a preservative in <b>feedingstuffs</b> for all animal species. Fumaric acid is considered safe for {{pigs and poultry}} provided that an expected use level of 20 000 mg/kg in complete diets for pigs and poultry is not exceeded. The margin of safety for pigs and poultry is approximately two. The tolerated fumaric acid concentration in complete diets for ruminants is higher. The margin of safety for pigs, poultry and ruminants is sufficiently high that setting a maximum content is not necessary. In contrast, the maximum safe level in milk replacer for veal calves (and probably other young mammals) is provisionally estimated to be 10 000 mg/kg milk replacer, with no margin of safety. Fumaric acid is rapidly metabolised by well-recognised pathways, and neither fumarate nor its metabolites are expected to accumulate in animal tissues. Consequently, human exposure {{is not expected to}} be increased by the use of fumaric acid in animal nutrition. Fumaric acid is a severe irritant to eyes. Given the potential for eye irritation, the particle size and the dusting potential, exposure to other mucous membranes such as the respiratory tract may also be a concern and it is advisable to minimise exposure by inhalation.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} method based on HPLC with postcolumn derivatization and spectrophotometric detection for the quantification of semduramicin in poultry <b>feedingstuffs</b> have been determined via a collaborative study. Semduramicin is a feed additive that is authorized for fattening chickens within the European Union at a minimum and maximum content of 20 and 25 mg/kg in <b>feedingstuffs,</b> respectively. The target concentration of semduramicin in the test samples ranged from 11. 5 to 45. 0 mg/kg. The study has been conducted with {{two different types of}} test material, namely, feedingstuff samples that have been previously ground in our laboratory and pelleted <b>feedingstuffs.</b> In the latter case, the laboratories participating in the study had to grind the samples prior to analysis. The obtained RSD for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 2 to 10 % for the ground materials, and from 2 and 7 % for the pelleted materials. The RSD for reproducibility (RSDR) varied between 11 and 16 % for the ground materials, and between 12 and 15 % for the pelleted materials. These data indicated that grinding as an additional step in the analytical procedure did not influence the precision profile of the method. In addition, the HorRat values for all test materials were below or equal to 1. 5, thus demonstrating that the obtained precision data were acceptable for the purpose of the method. Furthermore, an estimation of trueness based on statistical treatment of the results reported from the laboratories for spiked samples revealed acceptable mean recovery values of 88 ± 4 %.

Among possible methods, those based on DNA {{turned out to be a}} reliable tool for this aim, since DNA is a quite thermostable molecule able to resist severe heat treatments applied in the manufacturing of animal meals. The application of such methods by control laboratories implies that the method has been validated including an assessment of its robustness. Successful transferability between laboratories is considered an important robustness criterion of the method. However, corresponding guidelines regarding the design of such a study relevant to this field are missing. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a new concept that was applied to check for the transferability of a qualitative assay for the detection of banned MBM in <b>feedingstuffs</b> at trace level based on real time PCR. This approach can be of interest for other research groups working in the development of real-time PCR methods and in their use by control laboratories. JRC. D. 8 -Food safety and qualit...|$|E
40|$|A reversed-phase liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) method for narasin in <b>feedingstuffs</b> and premixtures was developed, validated, and interlaboratory studied. The extraction solvent was methanol-K 2 HPO 4 solution (9 + 1, v/v). Narasin was detected at 600 nm after post-column derivatization with dimethylamino-benzaldehyde. Recovery was > 90 %. The repeatability (RSDr) in feed (20 - 140 mg/kg) ranged between 1. 2 and 10. 5 %; the within-laboratory reproducibility (RSD(R)) ranged between 2. 2 and 4. 9 %.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a microbiological method {{for the detection}} of antibacterial substances in <b>feedingstuffs.</b> The method allowed detection of the main antibiotic groups, including tetracyclines. In 2013 - 2014, a total of 171 feed samples were analysed to determine antibacterial substances. Among the analysed samples 84 (49. 1 %) were suspected to contain tetracyclines. Out of the 84 feeds analysed using chromatography, 28 (33. 3 %) contained undeclared tetracyclines, which were identified at concentrations ranging from 0. 32 mg kg- 1 to 48. 98 mg kg- 1...|$|E
