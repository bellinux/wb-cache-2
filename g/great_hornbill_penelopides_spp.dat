50|$|The Visayan <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (<b>Penelopides</b> panini) is a hornbill {{found in}} rainforests {{on the islands}} of Panay, Negros, Masbate, and Guimaras, and formerly Ticao, in the Philippines. It formerly included all other Philippine tarictic hornbills as subspecies, {{in which case the}} common name of the 'combined species' was shortened to tarictic hornbill.|$|R
50|$|The Luzon <b>hornbill</b> (<b>Penelopides</b> manillae), {{sometimes}} called Luzon tarictic hornbill, is {{a species of}} hornbill in the Bucerotidae family. It is endemic to forests on Luzon and nearby islands in the northern Philippines. As {{is the case with}} all Philippine tarictic hornbills, it has been considered a subspecies of P. panini.|$|R
25|$|Several species {{endemic to}} the Philippines {{are found in}} the province. Examples include {{endangered}} animals such the Philippine spotted deer (Cervus alfredi), the Visayan warty pig (Sus cebifrons), and the Visayan <b>hornbill</b> (<b>Penelopides</b> panini). As of 2007, conservation efforts are being made by the Aklan State University and the DENR with varying success.|$|R
50|$|The Samar <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (<b>Penelopides</b> samarensis) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the Bucerotidae family. It is found in forests on the islands of Samar, Calicoan, Leyte and Bohol in the east-central Philippines. As {{is the case with}} all Philippine tarictic hornbills, it has been considered a subspecies of P. panini. Alternatively, it is considered a subspecies of P. affinis.|$|R
50|$|The Mindanao <b>hornbill</b> (<b>Penelopides</b> affinis), {{sometimes}} called the Mindanao tarictic hornbill, is a medium-small species of hornbill found in the canopy of rainforests on Mindanao, Dinagat, Siargao and Basilan in the southern Philippines. As {{is the case with}} all Philippine tarictic hornbills, it has been considered a subspecies of P. panini. The Samar hornbill is often included as a subspecies of the Mindanao hornbill.|$|R
50|$|The Mindoro <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (<b>Penelopides</b> mindorensis) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the Bucerotidae family. It is endemic to forests on Mindoro in the Philippines. As {{is the case with}} all Philippine tarictic hornbills, it has been considered a subspecies of P. panini. It is the only tarictic hornbill where both sexes are creamy-white and black. The sexes are very similar, differing primarily in the colour of the ocular ring (pinkish-white in the male, blue in the female). It is threatened by habitat loss, and is consequently considered endangered by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Buceros bicornis) {{also known}} as the <b>great</b> Indian <b>hornbill</b> or <b>great</b> pied <b>hornbill,</b> is one of the larger members of the hornbill family. It is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. The <b>great</b> <b>hornbill</b> is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.|$|R
40|$|Philippine {{hornbills}} {{of the genera}} Aceros and Penelopides (Bucerotidae) {{are known}} to possess a large tandemly duplicated fragment in their mitochondrial genome, whose paralogous parts largely evolve in concert. In the present study, we surveyed the two distinguishable duplicated control regions in several individuals of the Luzon Tarictic <b>Hornbill</b> <b>Penelopides</b> manillae, compare their characteristics within and across individuals, and report on an intraspecific mitochondrial gene rearrangement found in one single specimen, i. e., an interchange between the two control regions. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} observation of two distinct mitochondrial genome rearrangements within a bird species. We briefly discuss a possible evolutionary mechanism responsible for this pattern, and highlight potential implications for the application of control region sequences as a marker in population genetics and phylogeography...|$|R

50|$|<b>Great</b> <b>hornbills</b> {{are usually}} seen in small parties, with larger groups {{sometimes}} aggregating at fruit trees. A congregation of 150 to 200 birds {{has been recorded}} in southeastern Bhutan. In the wild, the <b>great</b> <b>hornbill's</b> diet consists mainly of fruit. Figs are particularly important as a food source. Vitex altissima has been noted as another important food source. <b>Great</b> <b>hornbills</b> also forage on lipid-rich fruits of the Lauraceae and Myristicaceae families such as Persea, Alseodaphne and Myristica. They obtain the water that they need entirely from their diet of fruits. They are important dispersers of many forest tree species. They will also eat small mammals, birds, small reptiles and insects. Lion-tailed macaques have been seen to forage alongside these hornbills.|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} of <b>great</b> <b>hornbills</b> (Buceros bicornis) in the United States is rapidly aging, and captive breeding efforts have not met population managers’ expectations for a sustainable captive group. Little {{is known about}} the reproductive physiology of these birds. This study reports the first data on the re-productive endocrinology of the <b>great</b> <b>hornbill.</b> The hormone profiles of the only pair of these birds that hatched a chick in the 1999 – 2000 breeding season are compared to the profiles of six other pairs of hornbills, from different institutions in the United States, that did not reproduce successfully that season. The study investigates the estradiol, corticosterone, and testosterone profiles of these seven pairs of birds, establishing a base of knowledge from which endocrine data may be used to improve the success of captive breeding programs. The estradiol profiles from this study indicate a difference in hormonal patterns between laying and non-laying female <b>great</b> <b>hornbills.</b> Egg-laying females had significantly higher estradiol concentrations during the breeding season than the non-laying females (Po 0. 003).

The exhibit has multiple educational displays focusing on deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade and their affects on wild bird populations. The most prominent residents of the exhibit include the maleos, a pair of Sanford's tarictic <b>hornbills</b> (<b>Penelopides</b> exarhatus sanfordi), green junglefowl, fawn-breasted bowerbirds, Cuban amazons, pink pigeons, Andean cocks-of-the-rock, plate-billed mountain toucans, Oriental pied hornbills, Abdim's storks, keas, three species of birds-of-paradise, a golden-headed quetzal, blue-billed curassows, white-throated bee-eaters, western capercaillies, white-fronted bee-eaters and common hoopoes. Emus can be found in an outdoor yard. Golden lion tamarins, Bolivian grey titis, cotton-top tamarins, and red-footed tortoise make up the exhibit's non-bird species. In mid-2009, the zoo's hand-reared pair of great blue turacos successfully raised chicks, the first known instance of a hand-reared pair doing so.
