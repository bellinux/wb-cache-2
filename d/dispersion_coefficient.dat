The suitable method to resolve the ADE equation is by providing estimates for all the involved terms in the equation to be known except the <b>dispersion</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which become the only unknown of the problem (Benedini and Tsakiris 2013). However, field tracer studies to obtain data on concentration profiles are an arduous process and can be costly and time-consuming, especially for deep and wide rivers (Kim 2012). Moreover, the estimated <b>dispersion</b> <b>coefficients</b> through a tracer experiment are valid for only the examined stream segment (Abderrezzak et al. 2015). Consequently, numerous studies were conducted to develop empirical formulas for the determination of both the longitudinal and transverse <b>dispersion</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Fischer 1967; Fischer et al. 1997; Seo and Cheong 1998; Baek and Seo 2013), or sometimes the coefficients are achieved by researcher’s own experience (Velísková et al. 2014). Detailed and brief reviews and comparison of these empirical formulas can be found in Seo and Cheong (1998) and Baek and Seo (2016). Unfortunately, when applying these formulas on one river, the calculated <b>dispersion</b> <b>coefficients</b> may vary over several orders of magnitude (Abderrezzak et al. 2015; Benedini and Tsakiris 2013).

However, information on spatial and temporal variations of this coefficient at low and high tide is scarce. Three years of hydrographic data taken at low and high tide along the main axis of the Sumjin River Estuary (SRE), Korea are used to estimate the spatial and temporal variation of the effective longitudinal <b>dispersion</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The range of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>coefficient</b> is rather broad at high water slack (HWS) and narrower at low water slack (LWS) because of the different tidal amplitudes.

Simulation codes written in C programming language using MPI library allowed an efficient use of the high-performance computing systems (supercomputers). The first part of this thesis investigates the influence of the cross-sectional geometry of the confined random sphere packings on the hydrodynamic dispersion.
