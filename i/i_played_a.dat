[...] The next week Katsura faced Kilgore again in another exhibition at Welker Cochran's room, beating him 50–33 in 45 innings.|$|E

500|$|Christina Pickles {{had also}} been {{considered}} for the part, and Berman stated {{that she was the}} second choice for the role. Muldaur was offered a main cast credit, but declined in favor of a [...] "special guest appearance" [...] credit, and went into the role expecting only to be in the show for a single season. Muldaur left after season two, with McFadden returning as Crusher for season three. Muldaur said that [...] "People have tried to create some kind of something out of it, but she played one part and <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> totally different part... {{it would not have been}} good to have continued very much longer, even though everyone was really lovely".|$|E
500|$|... "Beck's Bolero" [...] {{is roughly}} {{divided into three}} parts. The first begins with a {{reworking}} of Ravel's two-chord progression, transposed to the key of A. Power points out that by using a 12-string guitar, Page is {{able to take advantage}} of the instrument's [...] "rich chiming quality to emulate the distinct, orchestral 'bolero' sound". [...] Beck then introduces the melody line on electric guitar with a fuzz-tone effect producing indefinite sustain; alternating between major and minor modes, it is described as [...] "haunting" [...] by Power and as a [...] "distinctive piercing, sinister tone" [...] by critic Richie Unterberger. [...] In the second section, the piano, bass, and drums come in and the tension builds. [...] Unterberger describes the third section as [...] "suddenly set off from the main motif into a beautiful serene section highlighting slide-glissando guitars", with Beck's echo-laden slide sounding similar to a steel guitar. [...] The fourth section returns to the main melody with overlaid drawn-out descending slide. According to Beck, [...] "the phasing was Jimmy's idea... <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> load of waffle and he reversed it". The tension mounts as Moon adds drum flourishes, climaxing with a break.|$|E
500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E

2500|$|The April Congress {{effectively}} {{destroyed the}} PSDMR. Diamandy, Morțun and their followers, collectively {{referred to as}} [...] "the generous youth", resigned and joined the PNL. The PSDMR that survived through June was an informal political club, whose members included Buzdugan, Ionescu, and Panait Zosin. In later socialist historiography, this schism {{was seen as a}} victory for Stere and his Poporanist faction, who redirected the leftist vote toward the PNL. According to cultural historian Z. Ornea, the [...] "generous youth" [...] so efficiently adapted itself to the new environment, and Stere so poorly, that the rumor should be discounted. Diamandy himself was dismissive of his contribution: [...] "I entered the ranks of the liberal party, where <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> most silent and irrelevant part".|$|E

5000|$|Most of the time, metal bass players play basslines which {{consist of}} <b>a</b> single note <b>played</b> at <b>a</b> time; that is, without playing {{multiple}} notes {{at the same}} time to form chords, the way a rhythm guitarist would on an electric guitar. There are, however, a few metal bassists who play chords. Robert Trujillo of Metallica is known for playing [...] "massive chords" [...] and [...] "chord-based harmonics" [...] on the bass. Lemmy of Motörhead often played power chords in his bass lines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:No, <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> lot of notes, but <b>I</b> also <b>play</b> <b>a</b> lot of chords. And <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> lot of open strings. <b>I</b> just don't <b>play</b> like <b>a</b> bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time.

2500|$|Bloom has {{appeared}} in numerous roles on television such as her portrayal of Lady Marchmain in Brideshead Revisited (1981). In 1996, she wrote, [...] "I still find it puzzling when I am told <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> manipulative and heartless woman; that is not how I saw her. Lady Marchmain is deeply religious, and her dilemma includes trying to raise a willful brood of children on her own, while instilling them with her rigid observance of the Catholic code. Sebastian is both an alcoholic and a homosexual, and from her point of view, {{he lives in a}} state of mortal sin. She has to fight for his soul by any means in her power, with the knowledge that her efforts may lead to his destruction. A born crusader, the Marchioness confronts her difficult choices head on; her rigidity of purpose, which I don't in any way share, is understandable in context. The aspect that rings most true is her sense of being an outsider, a Catholic in Protestant England. Not such a leap from being a Jew in Protestant England as one would imagine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1980s {{seem to have}} posed {{something}} of a stumbling-block to Sokolov's career in the U.S. [...] "In the beginning, <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> lot of single concerts in America, in 1969, '71 and, I think, 1975. After {{that there was a}} break in relationships between the U.S. and the Soviet Union--they were disconnected by the Afghanistan war. A scheduled tour in the U.S. was cancelled in 1980. Then all cultural agreements between the two countries were cancelled." [...] In addition, during the breakup of the former Soviet Union, Sokolov played no concerts outside Russia. He is now a well-known figure in concert halls around Europe, but much less so in the U.S. Sokolov has released relatively few recordings to date, and released none for the twenty years between 1995 and 2015. But in 2014 he signed a contract with Deutsche Grammophon to release recordings of some of his live performances, and in 2015 he released a 2-CD live Salzburg recital featuring two sonatas by Mozart, Chopin's cycle of 24 Preludes, and encore pieces by Scriabin, Chopin, Rameau and Bach.|$|E

He also mentioned {{that he had been}} offered the lead roles in Deliverance and Straw Dogs but turned both offers down because {{he did not want to}} appear in violent films at the time. The role in Deliverance went to Jon Voight and the role in Straw Dogs to Dustin Hoffman, and both films enjoyed critical and box office success. After declining these violent roles, he quipped: [...] "and then <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> fascist in 1900 by Bernardo Bertolucci."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and <b>I</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E
