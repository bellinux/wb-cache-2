50|$|Valley of Flowers National Park is an Indian {{national}} park, {{located in}} West Himalaya, {{in the state}} of Uttarakhand and is known for its meadows of endemic alpine flowers and the variety of flora. This richly diverse area is also home to rare and endangered animals, including the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, musk deer, brown bear, red fox, and blue sheep. Birds found in the park include <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> <b>pheasant</b> and other high altitude birds. At 3352 to 3658 meters above sea level, the gentle landscape of the Valley of Flowers National Park complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park to the east. Together, they encompass a unique transition zone between the mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Great Himalaya. The park stretches over an expanse of 87.50 km2 and it is about 8 km long and 2 km wide. Both parks are encompassed in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (223,674 ha) which is further surrounded by a buffer zone (5,148.57 km2). This Reserve is in the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves since 2004.|$|E

50|$|The {{density of}} wild {{animals in the}} valley is not high, but all the animals found are rare or endangered. A total 13 species of mammals are {{recorded}} for the park by CP Kala and its vicinity although only he sighted 9 species directly: {{northern plains grey langur}} Semnopithecus entellus, flying squirrel Petaurista petaurista, Himalayan black bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), red fox Vulpes vulpes, Himalayan weasel Mustela sibirica, and Himalayan yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, Indian chevrotain Moschiola indica, Himalayan thar Hemitragus jemlahicus (VU) and serow Capricornis sumatraensis (VU). The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare. The common leopard Panthera pardus is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear Ursus arctos and bharal or blue sheep Pseudois nayaur. A recent faunal survey in October 2004 has established the presence of snow leopard Panthera uncia (EN) in the national park. The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area but there have been no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> <b>pheasant</b> Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, common yellow swallowtail Papilio machaon, common Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.|$|E

50|$|The zoo {{includes}} an off-display breeding center for snow leopards and red pandas.

The red panda program was started in 1994 with individuals from the Cologne Zoo, the Madrid Zoo, Belgium, and the Rotterdam Zoo. In addition to these species, the zoo is breeding the Himalayan tahr, blue sheep, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal,</b> grey peacock <b>pheasant,</b> <b>Himalayan</b> salamander, blood pheasant and satyr tragopan. The zoo is famous for its conservation breeding programmes of the red panda, Himalayan salamander, Tibetan wolf, and snow leopard.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus impejanus), {{also known}} as the Impeyan <b>monal,</b> Impeyan <b>{{pheasant}},</b> is a bird in the pheasant family, Phasianidae. It is the national bird of Nepal, where it is known as the danphe, and state bird of Uttarakhand India, where it is known as the monal. It was also the state bird of Himachal Pradesh until 2007.Traditionally, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> has been classified as monophyletic. However, {{studies have shown that the}} male <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> of northwestern India lacks the white rump of other <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monals,</b> and it has more green on the breast, indicating the possibility of a second subspecies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus impejanus) {{also known}} as the impeyan <b>monal,</b> impeyan <b>{{pheasant}}</b> or danphe is a bird of the genus Lophophorus of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. It is the national bird of Nepal, where it is known as the danfe in Nepali.|$|R
40|$|<b>Himalayan</b> <b>Monal</b> and Koklass were {{observed}} from three selected sites (Batandar, Anakar and Janshai) in winter about 7900 ft and 7500 ft and in summer 12381 ft and 10108 ft {{from the sea}} level respectively. The altitudinal migration of <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Monal</b> and Koklass from lower to upper elevated zones {{was the result of}} human activities and livestock grazing in summer season while their downward migration was the result of heavy snowfall in their natural habitats. The first nidification record was also observed in kalam valley during the study sites where three nests were detected one of <b>Monal</b> <b>pheasant</b> and two of Koklass pheasant. The Koklass nests were present on the ground at batandar (8620 ft), and Janshai (9305 ft) while the only nest of <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Monal</b> was observed in Janshai (9447 ft). The nesting behavior of Koklass was professionally like other birds but on the ground while the Monal nest was just like a temporary scrapes on the ground. Concluding from the study work that nests of these pheasants are mostly affected from local residents in early summer and foraging mostly from livestock. Awareness and education to the local villagers will help in conservation of habitats. The strict action of wildlife staff against poachers and illegal hunters will also be helpful for the conservation of these pheasants...|$|R

The cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi), crested argus (Rheinardia ocellata), the crested partridge (Rollulus roulroul) and the crested guineafowl (Guttera pucherani) are similar ecologically to the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> in that they too forage in rotting wood for termites, ant and beetle larvae, molluscs, crustaceans and young rodents.|$|R
