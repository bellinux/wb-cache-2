40|$|From the {{pioneering}} {{efforts of the}} early 1960 2 ̆ 7 s, flexography has shown steady progress {{in the development of}} four color process printing. However, the ability to consistently produce it is limited to an elite group. The vast majority of companies have yet to competitively enter this demanding area of printing. For these companies the time, expense, and expertise required to conduct an indepth study is a major deterrent. Outside information must be made available to aid the companies. The FTA and its members have greatly contributed by publishing an array of information; although, some basic questions have yet to be answered. Of these questions, proper screen angling for the elimination of moire 2 ̆ 7 patterns is an open topic. The occurrence of moire 2 ̆ 7 patterns in flexography {{is the result of the}} 45 degree cellular pattern of the anilox combined with the 45 degree tonal pattern of the plate image. To eliminate the moire 2 ̆ 7, most f lexographers 2 ̆ 2 offset 2 ̆ 2 the four screening angles by a predetermined amount. For example, instead of screening at 45, 75, 90, and 105 degrees, a company may screen at 52, 82, 97, and 112 degrees. The recommendation of offsetting the four screening angles was given in 1968 and was based on tests conducted with 200 and 220 anilox rolls. Since that time, Parmarco, Inc., has introduced finer count anilox rolls under the trade name of 2 ̆ 2 Tone and Process. 2 ̆ 2 It is the belief of Mr. Douglas E. Tuttle, Vice President, Marketing, Parmarco, Inc., that when using Tone and Process anilox rolls, the following is true: [1] A moire 2 ̆ 7 will not be produced with the 45 <b>degree</b> <b>plate</b> image. [2] The standard angles can be used by f lexographers when printing four color process work via flexography. [3] A Tone and Process anilox roll will produce a moire 1 once it is sufficiently worn. The thesis hypothesis addresses the topic of screen angling when printing four color process work with 4 00 TPB anilox rolls and 100 line plate images. The methodology focuses on three separate tests. Tests one and two investigate the suggestion that the standard angles can be used without a moire 2 ̆ 7 appearing in the final print. Test three considers the suggestion that a moire 1 will be produced with the 45 degree printer once the 400 TPB anilox is sufficiently worn. The results of tests one and two support the hypothesis that the standard angles of 45, 75, 90, and 105 degrees can be used by the flexographer when printing with 4 00 TPB anilox rolls and 100 line plate images. It is also concluded that a 400 TPB anilox will produce a moire 2 ̆ 7 once it is sufficiently worn...|$|E

Six plates were constructed with laminates of unidirectional carbon fiber and cross ply weaves of fiberglass. The orientations that were examined included 0, +/- 45, and 90 degrees. Half of the plates had fiberglass lamina {{on the outside of the}} laminate while the other three plates had the carbon fiber on the outside. Experimental and analytical tests were performed to determine the best orientations and stacking sequence. For the numerical analysis, plates with fibers oriented at +/- 45 degrees showed the highest strength.

These high displacements would not allow the joint to maintain its relative position to the adjacent part. The discrepancy between the strength of the FEA models and the experimental data is attributed to inaccurate strength properties.

40|$|Bathymetry and the geoid anomaly of the {{northern}} flank of the Hawaiian swell is broader and higher than the southern flank, and it is characterized by higher heat flow than the axis or southern flank. It is here proposed that {{the northern}} flank of the Hawaiian swell has been augmented by heat conducted from the hotspot conduit into the upper mantle then transported northward of the volcanic axis by flow in the upper mantle (similar to 325 degrees) that is more northerly than Pacific <b>plate</b> motion (292 <b>degrees).</b> By assuming that the deep upper mantle is decoupled from the Pacific plate and is flowing at 325 degrees to the northwest, changes in direction and rate of volcanic propagation and in geochemistry along individual volcanic segments of the Hawaiian volcanic chain can be interpreted in terms of tank experiment results showing that a volcanic hotspot conduit breaks into diapirs when tilted by mantle flow. Hawaiian volcanoes are aligned in en-echelon segments, and the Hawaiian Islands {{are the two most}} recent segments. For an individual segment, older northwestern volcanoes are aligned nearly parallel to the 292 <b>degrees</b> <b>plate</b> motion direction, and they propagated to the southeast at approximately the same rate as the 92 km/m. y. speed of northwestward plate motion. In contrast, the alignment of the younger southeastern volcanoes is close to 325 degrees, and they show a conspicuous acceleration in propagation of volcanism marked by out-of-sequence eruptions. Within the model proposed here, diapirs rise from instability nodes that develop along the tilted conduit of a mantle hotspot plume as it is sheared in the direction of deep upper-mantle flow and each diapir gives rise to a single volcanic center. As tilting progresses, diapirs form at lower levels along the conduit in more upstream positions of the mantle flow zone, rise sequentially into the decoupled lithosphere, erupt sequentially, and are translated in the direction of plate motion (older, northwestern Hawaiian Islands). Eventually, flow in the highly tilted conduit is impeded to the degree that the remaining upstream conduit breaks into a number of diapirs that rise together into the lithosphere. These late diapirs, translated as a group aligned in the direction of horizontal mantle flow, erupt over a relatively short time span and show out-of-sequence volcanism (younger, southeastern Hawaiian Islands). At this stage, a new cycle of rising and tilting will initiate the next en-echelon segment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In the blade plate group, we noticed three femoral head necrosis without major flattening, two non-unions, one plate's breakage and two malunions; fracture healing is acquired at 6. 3 months. The two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand.

Down- and up-slope flows are generated via cooling and heating 20 <b>degrees</b> inclined <b>plates.</b> The urban heat island is simulated by an electric heater centred in the valley. In {{order to understand the}} main features of the circulation established by thermal effects in an initially stably-stratified environment, an advanced Lagrangian particle tracking technique (Hybrid Lagrangian Particle Tracking) is employed. This allows one to obtain the velocity and acceleration of passive tracer particles as the first and second derivatives of a moving spline function that filters the particle trajectory coordinates. Experiments show the dependence of mean quantities and turbulent statistics on different slope heating. Furthermore, the effects of the slope flows on the circulation in a large city located in a narrow valley appear significant. During day-time simulations the urban heat island circulation is opposed by anabatic winds, creating critical situations for pollutant dispersion. During night-time simulations, the katabatic winds increase the city updraft motion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Nondimensional {{parameters}} and equations governing the buckling behavior of rectangular symmetrically laminated plates are presented {{that can be}} used to represent the buckling resistance, for plates made of all known structural materials, in a very general, insightful, and encompassing manner. In addition, these parameters can be used to assess the <b>degree</b> of <b>plate</b> orthotropy, to assess the importance of anisotropy that couples bending and twisting deformations, and to characterize quasi-isotropic laminates quantitatively. Bounds for these nondimensional parameters are also presented that are based on thermodynamics and practical laminate construction considerations.

As an illustration of this point, upper bounds on the buckling resistance of long rectangular orthotropic plates with simply supported or clamped edges and subjected to uniform axial compression, uniform shear, or pure inplane bending loads are presented. The results indicate that the maximum gain in buckling resistance for tailored orthotropic laminates, with respect to the corresponding isotropic plate, is in the range of 26 - 36 % for plates with simply supported edges, irrespective of the loading conditions. For the plates with clamped edges, the corresponding gains in buckling resistance are in the range of 9 - 12 % for plates subjected to compression or pure inplane bending loads and potentially up to 30 % for plates subjected to shear loads...|$|R

The 2 D finite element analysis in conjunction with Doublet-lattice Method (DLM) has been opted for structural and unsteady aerodynamic analysis, respectively. The interpolation between aerodynamic boxes and structural nodes has been done using surface spline. To study the effect of stacking sequence the classical lamination theory (CLT) has been chosen. All the analyses have been implemented in MSC. NASTRAN/PATRAN. The parametric studies showed the effective ply orientation angle to be somewhere between 15 and 30 <b>degree,</b> while the <b>plates</b> with lower aspect ratio seems to have higher flutter speed. Forward swept configurations show higher flutter speed, yet imposed by divergence constraint...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on the static behaviour of damaged steel plates strengthened with Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRP). Key parameters varied {{in the test}} program include steel <b>plate</b> thickness, damage <b>degree</b> of steel <b>plates</b> and elastic modulus of CFRP. The load carrying capacity of strengthened members significantly increased by up to 117 % for specimens strengthened with normal modulus CFRP and 78 % increase for those with High modulus CFRP, compared with those non-strengthened damaged members. Ductile behaviour is observed for specimens strengthened with normal modulus CFRP and even those strengthened with High Modulus CFRP sheets, given the damage degree of base steel plates not exceeding 40 %. It is also found {{that there is little}} effect of damage degree on bond strength for specimens with Normal modulus CFRP, but damage degree is more critical on bond strength for specimens with High Modulus CFRP...|$|R
