In this study, digital surveying techniques were used to survey the boundaries, sample plots, and land use of the <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> Combining with the field survey data, a comprehensive spatial database consisting of topographic maps, digital orthoimage, digital elevation model, cadastre, and other related data was built for the <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> Moreover, in order to efficiently provide accurate and timely information for <b>protection</b> <b>forest</b> management and inventory, a geographic information system was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic, ArcView, and ArcIMS. The system has graphical user interface, and provides easy access for data inquiry, maintenance, updating, printing, and overlaying analysis, which can provide useful spatial information to facilitate decision making for <b>protection</b> <b>forest</b> management. The results indicate that the total area of <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> is increased from 2, 349 hectares to 2, 539 hectares as compared to the original records.
