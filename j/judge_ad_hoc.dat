The New Jersey study found serious conflicts between the relative grading judgments of New Jersey residents and those contained in existing New Jersey criminal law, as well as instances where mandatory minimum sentences often require sentences that exceed the maximum appropriate punishment, inconsistencies among the grading of similar offenses, overly broad offenses that impose similar grades on conduct of importantly different seriousness, and a flawed grading structure that provides too few grading categories, thereby assuring pervasive problems in failing to distinguish conduct of importantly different seriousness. These systemic failures risk undermining the criminal justice system 2 ̆ 7 s moral credibility with the community, improperly delegate the value judgments inherent in grading decisions to individual sentencing <b>judges</b> <b>ad</b> <b>hoc,</b> fail to give citizens notice of the relative importance of conflicting duties, and invite application of different sentencing rules to similarly situated offenders.

40|$|Up to 25 years ago, {{fundamental}} analysis {{was the primary}} focus of research in investment analysis. Correspondingly, financial accounting re-search embraced a measurement perspective. Fundamental analysis involves the determination of the value of securities from available information, with a particular focus on accounting information.

40|$|Assessing the {{vulnerability}} of an enterprise’s infrastructure {{is an important step}} in judging the security of a network and the trustworthiness and quality of the information that flows through it. Currently real-world infrastructure vulnerability is often <b>judged</b> in an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> manner, based on the criteria and experience of the assessors. While methodological approaches to assessing infrastructure vulnerability exist, in practice they are not academically rigorous, having grown organically to meet business requirements. Our aim in this paper therefore is to study infrastructure vulnerability from a more structured perspective. We introduce and explore a novel way of assessing computer network infrastructure vulnerability. Instead of attempting to find vulnerabilities in infrastructure, we instead assume the network is insecure, and measure its vulnerability based on the controls that have (and have not) been put in place. We consider different control schemes for addressing vulnerability, and look at how one of them, namely the Council on Cyber Security’s Top 20 Critical Security Controls, can be applied. </p...|$|R
