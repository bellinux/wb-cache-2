40|$|The paper {{employs a}} {{heuristic}} comparative approach suggested by Ismail (2009) {{to search for}} evidence of Dutch disease in oil-rich countries of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). While these countries have benefitted from high international oil prices in recent years, they have also experienced relatively large real exchange rate appreciations, raising concerns regarding the presence of Dutch disease and casting doubts {{on their ability to}} achieve high growth and employment in the long run. To isolate from any dynamics related to the exchange rate regime, we focus on the 14 member countries that constitute the CFA franc zone. We separate them into net oil importers and net oil exporters and look at economic growth, the real exchange rate, and the agricultural and external sectors. Based on traditional models, our findings are broadly consistent with the presence of Dutch disease in the second group during the oil-price boom. Departing from these models yields mixed results, suggesting the need to employ a case-by-case approach.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the relation between yields and prices for ma-jor crop plants in Poland. The main objective of the paper was to examine the presence of <b>natural</b> <b>hedging.</b> For that purpose, yield value variances were calculated and compared with the theoretical variations of independent price and yield product. It was revealed that for sugar beet and rape a <b>natural</b> <b>hedge</b> could be observed, which leads to a 53 % reduction in yield value variance. In case of wheat and barley, no <b>natural</b> <b>hedge</b> effect was observed. Practical implications of the conducted analysis are such that the tendency to consider pro-duction and price risk separately, could be very misleading in assessing the income risk of specific crop plants. It was also found that the negative correlation coefficient, commonly considered as being equivalent of a <b>natural</b> <b>hedge</b> effect, can be used only as a very rough measure of <b>natural</b> <b>hedge</b> strength.

The fall of the Romanov Dynasty provided an opportunity for nationalist Muslims to liberate their country in Central Asia. Nationalist Muslims’ independence struggle was initially politically supported by the Bolsheviks who still faced an internal conflict with the non-Bolshevik groups and supporters of the Romanov regime. After successfully defeating their Russian rival, the Bolseheviks withdrew their support and combated Muslim countries that had been independent.

The impact of bank and firm variables on credit dollarization is studied in an optimal portfolio allocation model and estimated using new aggregate data for 21 transition economies for the period 1990 - 2003.

Additionally, we have explored which fi nancial institutions and intermediaries are the most important in providing risk management instruments and what are the reasons why Croatian com-panies do not manage corporate risks or use derivative instruments. The survey has revealed that the majority of analysed companies are using some form of interest-rate, <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> or commodity price risk management and that price risk and <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk have the highest infl uence on the company’s performance, while companies are not so affected by interest-rate risk.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effects of data {{aggregation}} and farm-level crop acreage on the level of <b>natural</b> <b>hedge,</b> i. e. the level of price-yield correlations, which is an important issue in risk modeling and management. Design/methodology/approach – Swiss FADN data for five crops covering the period 2002 - 2009 are used to estimate price-yield correlations at the farm- as well as on an aggregated level. Tobit regressions are used to estimate empirical relationships between the level of <b>natural</b> <b>hedge</b> and the underlying crop acreage. Findings – Price-yield correlations differ significantly between farm- and aggregated-level. More specifically, the <b>natural</b> <b>hedge</b> observed at the farm-level is much smaller, i. e. correlations are closer to zero. Taking correlations from aggregated levels thus leads to an underestimation of farm-level revenue variability. Furthermore, it is found that larger farms have a stronger <b>natural</b> <b>hedge.</b> For instance, a 1 percent increase in area under maize and intensive barley leads to a change in the correlation by 20. 02 and 20. 08, respectively. Practical implications – The <b>natural</b> <b>hedge</b> is often approximated with correlations observed at more aggregated levels, e. g. the county level. The results show that this implies errors in risk assessment and modeling as well as insurance applications. Thus, farm-level estimates should be used. The here presented relationship between price-yield correlations and farm-level crop acreage can be used to derive better information on levels of the <b>natural</b> <b>hedge.</b> Originality/value – Even though the effects of data aggregation on price-yield correlations have been discussed in earlier research, this paper is the first to also account for on-farm effects of underlying crop acreage on levels of <b>natural</b> <b>hedge.</b> It is found that this simple relationship can be useful in risk management and modeling applications...|$|R
