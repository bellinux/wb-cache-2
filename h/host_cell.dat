40|$|Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an obligately {{intracellular}} bacterium {{and is the}} causative {{agent of}} human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), an emerging and major tick-borne disease in the USA {{and other parts of}} the world. This study showed that the prenylation inhibitor manumycin A effectively blocked A. phagocytophilum infection in <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> (HL- 60 or RF/ 6 A cells). A. phagocytophilum infection activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase in <b>host</b> <b>cells,</b> and manumycin A treatment reduced ERK activation in A. phagocytophilum-infected <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> As ERK activation is required for A. phagocytophilum infection, we examined whether manumycin A inhibited the bacteria directly or through host ERK signalling. Treatment of A. phagocytophilum alone with manumycin A significantly reduced the bacterial infectivity of <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> and bacterial viability in the absence of <b>host</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas pre-treatment of <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> did not inhibit bacterial infection in <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> The inhibitory effect of manumycin A on A. phagocytophilum infection in <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> was achieved even at a concentration 100 times lower than that required for effective inhibition of mammalian cell signalling. These results suggested that manumycin A directly inactivates the bacterium, resulting in reduced infection and ERK 1 / 2 activation. Thus, the manumycin group of drugs may have a therapeutic potential for HGA...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: After {{infection}} of non-phagocytic cells, some Staphylococcus aureus strains {{are able to}} survive and kill their <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the action of various antibiotics on the survival of <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> and/or intracellular S. aureus. Methods: Murine keratinocyte (PAM 212) and fibroblast (mKSA) cell lines were infected with cytotoxic S. aureus and cultured in the presence of various antibiotics at graded concentrations. The viability of <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> was measured 24 h after infection. To determine the bacterial viability within <b>host</b> <b>cells,</b> cellular lysates were prepared and colony forming units were quantified using a spiral plater. <b>Host</b> <b>cells</b> infected with fluor-escein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled S. aureus were analysed by flow cytometry and microscopy to deter-mine the subcellular localization S. aureus. Results: Oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole did not rescue <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> from cell death induced by intracellular S. aureus. In contrast, linezolid, rifampicin, azithro-mycin, clindamycin, erythromycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin suppressed the cytotoxic action of S. aureus. After withdrawal of antibiotics, intracellular S. aureus regained cytotoxic activity and killed their <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> Only rifampicin was able to eliminate intracellular S. aureus completely within 72 h.

40|$|Flow cytometry has {{provided}} {{a powerful tool for}} analyzing bacteria–host cell associations. Established approaches have used bacteria, labeled either directly with fluorochromes or indirectly with fluorescently conjugated antibodies, to detect these associations. Although useful, these techniques are consistently unable to include all <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> in the analysis while excluding free, aggregated bacteria. This study describes a new flow cytometry method of assessing bacterial adherence to <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> based on direct fluorescent labeling of both bacteria and <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> Eukaryotic <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> were labeled with PKH- 26, a red fluorescent dye, and bacteria were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, a green fluorescent dye. The red <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> were gated and the mean green fluorescence intensity (MFI) of these red cells was determined. We used MFI values obtained from control samples (unlabeled and labeled <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> with unlabeled bacteria) to eliminate contributions due to autofluorescence. The final MFI values represent fluorescence of <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> resulting from the adherent bacteria.

5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a <b>host</b> <b>cell,</b> it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the <b>host</b> <b>cell,</b> are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E
5|$|Fully {{assembled}} poliovirus {{leaves the}} confines of its <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> by lysis 4 to 6 hours following initiation of infection in cultured mammalian cells. The mechanism of viral release from the cell is unclear, but each dying cell can release up to 10,000 polio virions.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi are obligate {{intracellular}} parasites that multiply until lysis of <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> The {{present study}} was undertaken to evaluate the effect of hydroxyurea (an inhibitor of cell division at the G 1 /S phase) on the multiplication of L. amazonensis, T. gondii, and T. cruzi in infected <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> Infected cells were treated with hydroxyurea (4 mM) for 48 h. Hydroxyurea arrested intracellular multiplication of all infective forms of the parasites tested.

Ultrastructural observations showed no morphologic change in <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> while intracellular parasites presented drastic morphologic alterations or disruption.

5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new <b>host</b> <b>cell.</b> Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.|$|E
30|$|In {{mammalian}} cell lines, there are 2 typical ways for introducing a {{gene of interest}} into <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b> One involves {{the integration of the}} gene of interest into the genome for stable expression, and the other is its introduction into <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> as a plasmid for transient expression. Usually, a single copy of the gene of interest is maintained in the <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> when the gene in integrated into the genome. In contrast, plasmids used for transient expression are typically present in multiple copies. Production of the foreign protein from a multi-copy plasmid is thought to affect metabolic load in the <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> (Khoo et al. 2007), which could result in different effects in different cell lines. Therefore, the impact of using different fluorescent proteins as molecular probes should also be examined in various kinds of <b>host</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
30|$|On {{the basis}} of one step growth curve both phages {{characterized}} as short latent period phages with latency period of about 30  min.

The image of 3 S infected UPEC <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> (NE) revealed multiple internal projections which showed progeny phages released out from <b>host</b> <b>cells</b> through these multiple sites.

50|$|The innate {{immune system}} is common to all {{multicellular}} organisms and forms {{the first line of}} defence against pathogens.

5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|The type-IV {{secretion}} apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA {{into the}} stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities. Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK). CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2. Pathogenic strains of H. pylori {{have been shown}} to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a TK domain. Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A great deal of diversity exists between strains of H. pylori, and the strain that infects a person can predict the outcome.|$|E
5|$|When a cell's DNA {{is damaged}} by a virus, {{and if the}} cell cannot repair itself, this often {{triggers}} apoptosis.

5|$|A second defence of {{vertebrates}} against viruses {{is called}} cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells {{such as the}} macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the viral particle {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the <b>host</b> <b>cell.</b> On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. This region of the viral genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E
5|$|Some {{nucleic acids}} of RNA viruses {{function}} directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.

In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production {{is similar to that}} of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the <b>host</b> <b>cell</b> a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase.
