An antifungal, griseofulvin, is tested to determine <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> and elastic modulus for different crystal orientations. Hardness and elastic modulus are determined by nanoindentation on single crystals that are rotated in 15 ° intervals.

30|$|Some <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> {{results may}} be {{explained}} by the effect of porosity in nano-TiN as well as <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> measurement techniques [6, 7, 23]. Since the estimated volume of the material involved in the nanohardness test is only about 8 – 10 grains, the influence of porosity is negligibly low. The Vickers hardness test requires much larger volume of the material, so the residual porosity may affect the measured hardness and elastic modulus of the material.|$|R

However, the aesthetic qualities of the hamon are quite valuable—not only as proof of the differential-hardening treatment but also in its artistic value—and the patterns can be quite complex.|$|E
50|$|Differential heat {{treatment}} (also called selective {{heat treatment}} or local heat treatment) {{is a technique}} used during heat treating to harden or soften certain areas of a steel object, creating a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> between these areas. There are many techniques for creating a difference in properties, but most {{can be defined as}} either differential hardening or differential tempering. These were common heat treating techniques used historically in Europe and Asia, with possibly the most widely known example being from Japanese swordsmithing. Some modern varieties were developed in the twentieth century as metallurgical knowledge and technology rapidly increased.|$|E
5000|$|In swordsmithing, hamon (hamon) (from Japanese, {{literally}} [...] "blade pattern") is {{a visual}} effect created on the blade by the hardening process. The hamon is {{the outline of}} the hardened zone (yakiba) which contains the cutting edge (ha). Blades made in this manner are known as differentially hardened, with a harder cutting edge than spine (mune) (for example: spine 40 HRC vs edge 58 HRC). This <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> results from clay being applied on the blade (tsuchioki) prior to the cooling process (quenching). Less or no clay allows the edge to cool faster, making it harder but more brittle, while more clay allows the center (hira) and spine to cool slower, thus retaining its resilience.|$|E

5000|$|A {{very large}} number of low-quality {{reproduction}} katana and wakizashi are available; their prices usually range between $10 to about $200. These cheap blades are Japanese in shape only—they are usually machine made and machine sharpened, and minimally hardened or heat-treated. The hamon pattern (if any) on the blade is applied by scuffing, etching, or otherwise marking the surface, without any <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> or temper of the edge. The metal used to make low-quality blades is mostly cheap stainless steel, and typically is much harder and more brittle than true katana. Finally, cheap reproduction Japanese swords usually have fancy designs on them since they are just for show. Better-quality reproduction katana typically range from $200 to about $1000 (though some can go easily above two thousand for quality production blades, folded and often traditionally constructed and with a proper polish [...] ), and high-quality or custom-made reproductions can go up to $15,000-$50,000. These blades are made to be used for cutting, and are usually heat-treated. High-quality reproductions made from carbon steel will often have a differential hardness or temper similar to traditionally made swords, and will show a hamon; they won't show a hada (grain), since they're not often made from folded steel.|$|E
5000|$|To {{produce a}} <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness,</b> the steel is cooled at {{different}} rates by controlling {{the thickness of the}} insulating layer. By carefully controlling the heating and cooling speeds of different parts of the blade, Japanese swordsmiths were able to produce a blade that had a softer body and a hard edge.This process also has two side effects that have come to characterize Japanese swords: 1.) It causes the blade to curve and 2.) It produces a visible boundary between the hard and soft steel. When quenched, the uninsulated edge contracts, causing the sword to first bend towards the edge. However, the edge cannot contract fully before the martensite forms, because the rest of the sword remains hot and in a thermally expanded state. Because of the insulation, the sword spine remains hot and pliable for several seconds, but then contracts much more than the edge, causing the sword to bend away from the edge, which aids the smith in establishing the curvature of the blade. Also, the differentiated hardness and the methods of polishing the steel can result in the hamon 刃紋 (frequently translated as [...] "tempering line" [...] but better translated as [...] "hardening pattern"). The hamon is the visible outline of the yakiba (hardened portion) and is used as a factor to judge both the quality and beauty of the finished blade. The various hamon patterns result from {{the manner in which the}} clay is applied. They can also act as an indicator of the style of sword-making, and sometimes as a signature for the individual smith. The differences in the hardenability of steels may be enhanced near the hamon, revealing layers or even different parts of the blade, such as the intersection between an edge made from edge-steel and sides made from skin-steel.|$|E

40|$|The {{hardness}} and toughness of ThO 2 sintered under reducing and oxidizing conditions {{has been}} investigated and, quite unexpectedly, a significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> was observed for {{the entire range of}} porosities studied. Reducing conditions systematically yielded higher hardness values than oxidizing conditions. Extrapolated to zero porosity, the hardness for ThO 2 is H 0 = 10. 5 ± 0. 3 GPa for oxidizing conditions and H 0 = 12. 4 ± 0. 7 GPa for reducing conditions. Toughness values have been derived from Vickers indentations; differences in toughness were insignificant and only a single value is proposed: KIC = 0. 97 ± 0. 12 MPa √m. The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> is attributed to the presence of point defects, also acting as color centers and causing grey coloration of ThO 2 sintered under reducing conditions.

50|$|However, {{when the}} {{patterns}} occur from a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> carbon content, {{there will be}} distinct indications of this near the hamon, because the steel with higher hardenability will become martensite beyond the hamon while the adjacent layers will turn into pearlite. This leaves a distinct pattern of bright nioi, which appear as bright streaks or lines that follow the layers {{a short distance away}} from the hamon and into the hira, giving the hamon a wispy or misty appearance. The patterns were most likely revealed during the polishing operation by using a method similar to lapping, without bringing the steel to a full polish, although sometimes chemical reactions with the polishing compounds may have also been used to provide a level of etching. The <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> primarily appear as a <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the microscopic scratches left on the surface.

40|$|This {{technical}} note presents new experimental {{evidence for the}} role of grain shape in the static liquefaction behaviour of sand–ﬁnes mixtures. The laboratory experiments comprise a series of strain-controlled triaxial tests on several types of sand–ﬁnes mixtures that are intended to clarify a concern remaining in a previous study by the same authors: whether the observed effect of grain shape was due to the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>hardness</b> of the added ﬁnes. The comparison of new test results with the previous ones conﬁrms that it is grain shape rather than grain hardness that is responsible for the observed <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> overall behaviour. Adding ﬁnes of rounded shape into a clean sand indeed results in a marked increase of liquefaction potential compared with adding ﬁnes of more angular shape into the same sand. It is also shown that the concept of the combined roundness is effective and useful for quantifying in an integrated manner the inﬂuence of grain shape and ﬁnes content on the overall friction angle of sand–ﬁnes mixtures at critical state...|$|R
