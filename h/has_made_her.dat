5|$|In a {{secondary}} plot, male Sheriff's deputy Kenny Lacos (Costas Mandylor) {{is given a}} promotion over female deputy Maxine Stuart (Lauren Holly) after she is asked in her interview about such things as whether she was planning {{to get married and}} get pregnant in the near future. She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be proud to serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> less proud to serve under him.|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E
5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

5|$|The group goes to IBF {{in search}} for a cure, but starts showing signs of Tief Blau. An {{exception}} is Tsugumi, as the Cure virus <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> immune; the group injects themselves with her antibodies. They get contact with the surface, and a rescue pod is sent down, but is only able {{to stay for a}} short period of time. Tsugumi disappears to find Chami, who has gone missing; Takeshi chases after her, and saves Sora's data onto a disk, to save her memories. Returning to IBF, they have missed the rescue vessel. They find a submarine and escape, but its batteries die; Takeshi exits it, giving it enough buoyancy to save Tsugumi, while he dies on the ocean floor. Coco dies in IBF, as she had been looking for Pipi, and the rescue team could not find her.|$|E

25|$|Anna Maria Lenngren {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous poets in the history of Sweden. Her {{production}} <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> one of the few 18th-century Swedish poets who are still commonly read, and she has been published a number of times after her death during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.|$|E
25|$|Back in the weaver's home, Joan and Simon {{have escaped}} the ruffians that chased them from Philip's castle. Laine returns. She {{is still in}} her rich clothes, but she has decided to {{relinquish}} the stone that <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> beautiful. She removes it from her neck, throws it on the ground, and hurries into her bed-chamber.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major element}} is Pushkin's {{creation}} of a woman of intelligence and depth in Tatyana, whose vulnerable sincerity and openness {{on the subject of}} love <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> the heroine of countless Russian women, despite her apparent naivete. Pushkin, in the final chapter, fuses his Muse and Tatyana's new 'form' in society after a lengthy description of how she has guided him in his works.|$|E

25|$|Sharapova {{has lived}} in the United States since moving there at the age of seven, but retains her Russian citizenship, and is {{therefore}} eligible to play in the Fed Cup for Russia. However, the behavior of Sharapova's father during her matches on the WTA Tour, combined with a perceived lack of commitment by her to the Fed Cup, <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> selection for the Russian Fed Cup team controversial in the past.|$|E
25|$|Baker, the character's recast, {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} taking over a prominent character. She said she had studied scenes of Havins as Babe, {{and that she was}} focused on her portrayal as the character. Before landing the role, Baker was screen tested with actors who often interact with the character (Jacob Young, who portrays JR Chandler and Bobbie Eakes, portrayer of the character's mother, Krystal). A few days after her audition, she received a phone call informing her that she had won the part. Baker said that she was treated with a warm welcome {{from the rest of the}} cast and Havins herself, and that this <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feel at home while on set.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E
60|$|However, she <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> choice, <b>made</b> it suddenly, {{but none}} the less <b>had</b> <b>made</b> it. It lay between her father's {{interest}} {{and the interest}} of the family at large and her own honour as a woman--for the mere empty ceremony of marriage which satisfies society cannot make dishonour an honourable thing. She <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> choice, and the readers of her history must judge if that choice was right or wrong.|$|R
60|$|But I, {{thinking}} that terror <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> sick of mind, asked her {{of what she}} would speak.|$|R
60|$|At {{the very}} top of the hay-mow in the barn, the Speckled Hen <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> nest, and each day for twelve days she had laid in it a pretty white egg. The Speckled Hen <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> nest in this out-of-the-way place so that no one would come to disturb her, as it was her {{intention}} to sit upon the eggs until they were hatched into chickens.|$|R
500|$|Love's candidness {{concerning}} her {{struggles with}} drug addiction {{and legal issues}} <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> subject to significant media interest {{over the course of}} her career, and Rolling Stone once referred to her as the [...] "most controversial woman in the history of rock." [...] She has openly discussed the substance abuse problems she has had throughout her life.|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of the series, Marceline is a half-demon and half-human vampire, and the eponymous Vampire Queen, after having killed the {{previous}} Vampire King. Although she is over 1,000 years old, she was designed to appear {{in the form of an}} 18- to 21-year-old. In her first role, Marceline functions as the antagonist of the story, forcing Finn and Jake from their home. However, as the series progressed, she became a close friend to the two. Ward has stated that she is not a villain. Marceline's wandering of the Land of Ooo <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> into a fearless daredevil. Her fondness for mischief and fun has turned her into a trickster. Although appearing hostile at first, Finn soon realizes that she is [...] "a radical dame who likes to play games".|$|E
500|$|The player {{controls}} {{a silent}} protagonist, a second-year student who acts as their in-game representation.

500|$|Stevenson {{described}} {{the character of}} Marion as [...] "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> [...] "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that [...] "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" [...] which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying [...] "it is easier for me than someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience". Richards spoke {{of the character of}} April, saying that [...] "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life. [...] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is".|$|E

500|$|Robin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews notes {{a lack of}} {{characterization}} {{given to}} Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in Batman: The Killing Joke, stating, [...] "Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a cocoa-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings." [...] Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis {{at the hands of}} the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer Devin Grayson stated that being [...] "yper-defensive about her , she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind." ...|$|E
