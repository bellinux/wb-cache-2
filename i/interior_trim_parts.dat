40|$|In {{response}} to increasing {{awareness of the}} environment and energy, the fields of application for new types of plant fiber functional materials are expanding. In this study, different weight proportions of coir fiber were added to wood particle debris to produce hybrid boards. The two forms of coir fiber used were random distribution and non-woven needle mat. A mixed orthogonal experiment was designed to use the weight mixing ratio of wood debris and coir, the density of the hybrid boards, and the mixing form of the raw material as the experimental factors. The mechanical and sound absorption performances were evaluated. The experimental results provided evidence that the addition of the coir fibers enhanced the mechanical performance and sound absorption performance of the hybrid boards. The non-woven needle mat form in particular was effective at evenly distributing the fibers. The optimal plan for this kind of hybrid composite was obtained through experimental analysis. The excellent sound absorption performance and sufficient strength of the hybrid boards made them suitable for use on inner walls as sound-absorbing material or on <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> <b>parts</b> in automotive applications. The research results demonstrated the advantages of using coir fiber and wood debris resources...|$|E
5000|$|Although not as {{deliberate}} a downsizing as {{what was}} to come to future Ford cars, the 1977 Thunderbird was far smaller than its predecessor, shedding nearly 10 in of length and 900 lb of weight; height and width remained essentially unchanged. The 1977 Thunderbird was created on the existing intermediate car platform by recycling a select mix of body, <b>interior</b> and <b>trim</b> <b>parts</b> from the previous year's Ford Elite, Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar combined with some all new body, <b>interior</b> and <b>trim</b> <b>parts</b> to create a dramatic new Thunderbird look. The Thunderbird was distinguished from the LTD II and Cougar 2-door models by its unique wrap-over [...] "basket handle" [...] roofline with opera windows and large rear side quarter windows separated from the rear window by thin C-pillars. Headlamps hidden with retractable covers and full-width dropped center taillamps made a comeback from the late 1960s. As such being based on the intermediate Ford platform, a wider range of powertrains were now available. The base engine was the 302 cuin L Windsor V8, while the larger 351 cuin L 351M and 400 cuin L and T-tops were available as options along with the 351W. In California, the 351 was the only engine available. Although the smaller engines had lower output than the 460 V8, the lighter weight did compensate towards overall performance; the 400 was dropped in 1979 with the introduction of CAFE requirements.|$|R
50|$|Local {{distributor}} New Zealand Motor Corporation initially imported the Australian Tasman and Kimberley {{models from}} Zetland but later assembled {{most of its}} stock from CKD kits at its Petone plant near Wellington. The Kiwi cars had different <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials as <b>part</b> of the 40-50% local parts content common at the time but otherwise differed only in detail from Australian made cars. They were, however, sold as Morris models instead of Austin.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigid walled car cabin model {{to predict the}} acoustic effects of vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials. The car cavity is made of a rigid walled enclosure system with one flexible wall on the front firewall position, where the <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials are applied to the inner surface of the front firewall to modify the coupling between the flexible wall and the cabin air cavity. The car cabin is acoustically excited by using a single point source positioned at {{one corner of the}} inner air cavity to imitate the airborne noise. The propagated noise is measured by using pressure microphones at different locations inside the car cabin: one near the driver&# 039;s ear position and another one near the passenger&# 039;s ear position. An acoustic FE (Finite Element) model is also developed to investigate and predict the effects of <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials on the car cabin noise level. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the experimentally acquired acoustic effects of the <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials. The predicted acoustic response results show that the simulation agrees well with the experiment data, both with and without the <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials. The noise propagating inside the car cabin is reduced by a similar ratio in both the experimental method and in the numerical analysis. The selected <b>interior</b> <b>trim</b> materials are starting to absorb noise at frequencies above 500 Hz, but they do not reduce the low-frequency noise effectively...|$|R
