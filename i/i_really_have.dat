500|$|Jackson told Sister 2 Sister magazine, [...] "There {{were some}} people who didn't like the {{direction}} I took with this album. I love doing dance songs and I think my fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A {{few months before the}} split, a spokesperson for the label told Billboard, [...] "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{decided to}} use the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac. Fincher remarked in an interview, [...] "Dailies almost always end up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and you look at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to work with.' But when you can see what you have as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process." ...|$|E
500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> no strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people like you and me, {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E

500|$|Stewart told Vibe {{how he and}} The-Dream came up {{with the}} song's concept. He said [...] "That was Dream and I just getting in the room and clicking,... We were both on two {{different}} keyboards, two different drum machines and once again just got behind the mic and the rest is history." [...] Lyrics include lines like, [...] "But it's the last time, I'm movin' on / I'm throwing on my Louboutins." [...] Lopez described the idea behind the song as [...] "that point in a bad relationship and you're like, 'Damn, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to leave. It's just not good for me,' ... It's not the girl who's like, 'I'm gonna take my stuff, and I'm gonna put on my sweatpants, and I'm gonna cry,'... This girl is like putting on her hottest dress and her sexiest Louboutin shoes, and leaving your ass". In the chorus Lopez singles [...] "I'm throwing on my Louboutins" [...] eight times and overall the word [...] "Louboutins" [...] is spoken thirty-two times across the song. Prefix magazine said that [...] "Louboutins" [...] is used as a metaphor for female empowerment.|$|E
2500|$|When {{questioned}} by reporters, Cowell said, [...] "There {{are a lot}} of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here." [...] The Silvermans released separate statements expressing concern for the well-being of their son during the divorce process. In August 2013, the Silvermans settled their divorce out of court, enabling Cowell to avoid being called as a witness in the divorce proceedings. Cowell subsequently confirmed that Silverman was pregnant with his child, and she gave birth to baby Eric on 14 February 2014.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Detroit News, when asked {{what it was like}} being CEO in a [...] "testosterone-charged industry", McMahon replied, [...] "It's lots of fun. I'm an only child, so I grew up as my father's son and mother's daughter. I was quite a jock. I played baseball, basketball—I think that background made Vince and I very compatible. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> a very good understanding of the male psyche—I'm very comfortable in a guy environment. I have {{to say that there are}} very strong women in this company as well. Our human resources division and our consumer goods division are headed by women—It's still a testosterone business, and I like it." ...|$|E

The next night he asked the Arab wife the same question. [...] "It must be dawn as the pearls of my {{necklace}} feel cool on my breasts", she answered. On the third night, he asked the same question to the Coptic wife. [...] "It must be dawn as <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to shit", she said.|$|E
2500|$|Oates's spouse Raymond Smith died of {{complications}} from pneumonia on February 18, 2008, and the death impacted Oates profoundly. In April 2008, Oates wrote to an interviewer, [...] "Since my husband's unexpected death, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> very little energy [...] My marriage—my love for my husband—seems to have come first in my life, rather than my writing. Set beside his death, the future of my writing scarcely interests me at the moment." [...] After six months of near suicidal grieving for Raymond Smith, Oates met Charles Gross, {{a professor in the}} Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Princeton, at a dinner party at her home. In early 2009, Oates and Gross were married.|$|E

None of the interviewees noticed the insertion of [...] "Poutine". A few years later when Bush made his first official visit to Canada as President, he joked during a speech, [...] "I told [...] Paul [...] that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> only one regret about this visit to Canada. There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him for that endorsement. I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine." [...] The remark was met with laughter and applause.|$|E
