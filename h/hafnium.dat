5|$|<b>Hafnium</b> must {{be removed}} from {{zirconium}} for nuclear applications because <b>hafnium</b> has a neutron absorption cross-section 600 times greater than zirconium. The separated <b>hafnium</b> {{can be used for}} reactor control rods.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} is {{effected by}} a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, <b>hafnium</b> reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and <b>hafnium</b> are set free. The <b>hafnium</b> forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional <b>hafnium,</b> {{resulting in a}} steady turn over.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hafnium</b> {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective nuclear charge by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing it between the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in zirconium ores. <b>Hafnium</b> was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of <b>hafnium</b> {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that <b>hafnium</b> would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for <b>hafnium</b> to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and <b>hafnium</b> made a separation difficult and, without knowing what to look for, <b>hafnium</b> was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of <b>hafnium..</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hafnium</b> {{reserves}} {{have been}} infamously estimated to last under 10 years by one source {{if the world}} population increases and demand grows. In reality, since <b>hafnium</b> occurs with zirconium, <b>hafnium</b> can always be a byproduct of zirconium extraction {{to the extent that}} the low demand requires.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hafnium</b> was {{separated}} from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer {{were the first to}} prepare metallic <b>hafnium</b> by passing <b>hafnium</b> tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and <b>hafnium</b> is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to <b>hafnium</b> in the {{workplace}} by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for exposure to <b>hafnium</b> and <b>hafnium</b> compounds in the workplace as TWA 0.5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the same recommended exposure limit (REL). At levels of 50mg/m3, <b>hafnium</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys {{have a wide}} range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant <b>hafnium</b> and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors. Zirconium has a very low and <b>hafnium</b> has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, while <b>hafnium</b> is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each <b>hafnium</b> atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of <b>hafnium.</b> The most notable nuclear properties of <b>hafnium</b> are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different <b>hafnium</b> isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} <b>hafnium</b> because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but <b>hafnium</b> compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for <b>hafnium</b> compounds.|$|E
5|$|Due to its heat {{resistance}} and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, <b>hafnium</b> {{is a good}} scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and incandescent lamps. <b>Hafnium</b> is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because {{of its ability to}} shed electrons into air.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hafnium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, <b>hafnium</b> chemically resembles zirconium and {{is found in}} many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, {{though it was not}} identified until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element to be discovered. <b>Hafnium</b> is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hafnium</b> {{is used in}} alloys with iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, {{and other}} metals. An alloy used for liquid rocket {{thruster}} nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% niobium, 10% <b>hafnium</b> and 1% titanium.|$|E
5|$|If the {{abundance}} of elements in Earth's crust is compared for titanium, zirconium and <b>hafnium,</b> {{the abundance}} decreases with increase of atomic mass. Titanium is the seventh most abundant metal in Earth's crust and has an abundance of 6320ppm, while zirconium has an abundance of 162ppm and <b>hafnium</b> has only an abundance of 3 ppm.|$|E
5|$|The {{high energy}} content of 178m2Hf was {{the concern of}} a DARPA-funded program in the US. This program {{determined}} {{that the possibility of}} using a nuclear isomer of <b>hafnium</b> (the above-mentioned 178m2Hf) to construct high-yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of induced gamma emission—was infeasible because of its expense. See <b>Hafnium</b> controversy.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, <b>hafnium</b> impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and <b>hafnium</b> is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for <b>hafnium.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{major source}} of zircon (and hence <b>hafnium)</b> ores is heavy mineral sands ore deposits, pegmatites, {{particularly}} in Brazil and Malawi, and carbonatite intrusions, particularly the Crown Polymetallic Deposit at Mount Weld, Western Australia. A potential source of <b>hafnium</b> is trachyte tuffs containing rare zircon-hafnium silicates eudialyte or armstrongite, at Dubbo in New South Wales, Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} {{elements were}} still {{missing from the}} periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (<b>hafnium)</b> the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, <b>hafnium</b> was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>hafnium</b> {{produced}} {{is used in}} {{the production}} of control rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Several details {{contribute}} {{to the fact that}} there are only a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between <b>hafnium</b> and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, <b>hafnium</b> was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} <b>hafnium</b> and {{zirconium}} {{are used in}} super alloys to improve the properties of those alloys.|$|E
5|$|The most {{conclusive}} aqueous chemistry {{studies of}} rutherfordium {{have been performed}} by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, <b>hafnium,</b> zirconium, {{as well as the}} pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, {{in a manner similar to}} <b>hafnium</b> and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} <b>hafnium</b> {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes <b>hafnium</b> a good material {{for use in}} the control rods for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses <b>hafnium</b> as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military reactors, particularity in US naval reactors, but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|Zr and Hf {{can also}} be {{separated}} by fractional crystallization of potassium hexafluorozirconate (K2ZrF6), which is less soluble in water than the analogous <b>hafnium</b> derivative.|$|E
5|$|Garnet {{is another}} mineral that {{contains}} appreciable amounts of <b>hafnium</b> {{to act as}} a geochronometer. The high and variable Lu/Hf ratios found in garnet make it useful for dating metamorphic events.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hafnium</b> is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of <b>hafnium</b> metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium-based {{compounds}} {{are employed}} in gate insulators in the 45nm generation of integrated circuits from Intel, IBM and others. <b>Hafnium</b> oxide-based compounds are practical high-k dielectrics, allowing reduction of the gate leakage current which improves performance at such scales.|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} the elements titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), <b>hafnium</b> (Hf) and rutherfordium (Rf). This group {{lies in the}} d-block of the periodic table. The group itself has not acquired a trivial name; {{it belongs to the}} broader grouping of the transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Small {{additions}} of <b>hafnium</b> {{increase the}} adherence of protective oxide scales on nickel-based alloys. It improves thereby the corrosion resistance especially under cyclic temperature conditions {{that tend to}} break oxide scales by inducing thermal stresses between the bulk material and the oxide layer.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} element <b>hafnium</b> {{is named after}} Copenhagen (Latin name Hafnia), where it was discovered. The bacterium Hafnia is also named after Copenhagen: Vagn Møller of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen named it in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The heavy mineral sands ore {{deposits}} of the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile yield {{most of the}} mined zirconium, and therefore also most of the <b>hafnium.</b>|$|E
5|$|At least 34 {{isotopes}} of <b>hafnium</b> {{have been}} observed, ranging in mass number from 153 to 186. The five stable isotopes {{are in the}} range of 176 to 180. The radioactive isotopes' half-lives range from only 400ms for 153Hf, to 2.0petayears (1015 years) for the most stable one, 174Hf.|$|E
5|$|In an {{analogous}} manner to zirconium and <b>hafnium,</b> rutherfordium {{is projected to}} form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.|$|E
5|$|Inorganic iodides find {{specialised}} uses. Titanium, zirconium, <b>hafnium,</b> and thorium are purified by the van Arkel process, {{which involves}} the reversible {{formation of the}} tetraiodides of these elements. Silver iodide is a major ingredient to traditional photographic film. Thousands of kilograms of silver iodide are used annually for cloud seeding to induce rain.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes of <b>hafnium</b> and {{lutetium}} (along with ytterbium) {{are also}} used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications. It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earth’s mantle through time. This is because 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of <b>hafnium</b> in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{the first}} transactinide element and the second member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are {{similar to that of}} <b>hafnium</b> and very different from that of lead. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements, below titanium, zirconium, and <b>hafnium.</b> Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state. In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state. The standard reduction potential of the Rf4+/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than −1.7V.|$|E
