On March 2, 1927, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> announced it was the true collective bargaining agent for all New York City fur workers, that it alone administered their union contracts, and that they must become members of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> or be fired by their employers. Thousands of workers refused; many were fired, and some had to be forcibly removed from their place of employment in protest. Gold and the Joint Board fought the <b>Joint</b> <b>Council's</b> actions. As the dispute between the Joint Board and <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> continued, employers ceased to honor the 1926 contract. Soon, the work week crept as high as 70 hours over seven days. Overtime pay was eliminated, wages were cut {{by as much as}} 50 percent, and subcontracting became rampant.|$|R
