After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing plate is used here to block light.|$|E
5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect.

Following the vapor cell is a low-pass filter, designed to block all of the light that the first filter did not, except the designated frequency of light which came from the fluorescence. In Faraday and Voigt filters, a second polarizing plate is used here.|$|E

40|$|Diffuse objects {{generally}} tell us {{little about}} the surrounding lighting, since the radiance they reflect blurs together <b>incident</b> <b>lighting</b> from many directions. In this paper we discuss how occlusion geometry can help invert diffuse reflectance to recover lighting or surface albedo. Selfocclusion in the scene {{can be regarded as}} a form of coding, creating high frequencies that improve the conditioning of diffuse light transport. Our analysis builds on a basic observation that diffuse reflectors with sufficiently detailed geometry can fully resolve the <b>incident</b> <b>lighting.</b> Using a Bayesian framework, we propose a novel reconstruction method based on high-resolution photography, taking advantage of visibility changes near occlusion boundaries. We also explore the limits of single-pixel observations as the diffuse reflector (and potentially the lighting) vary over time. Diffuse reflectance imaging is particularly relevant for astronomy applications, where diffuse reflectors arise naturally but the <b>incident</b> <b>lighting</b> and camera position cannot be controlled. To test our approaches, we first study the feasibility of using the moon as a diffuse reflector to observe the earth as seen from space. Next we present a reconstruction of Mars using historical photometry measurements not previously used for this purpose. As our results suggest, diffuse reflectance imaging expands our notion of what can qualify as a camera. 1...|$|R

The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind.

5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the <b>incident</b> <b>light</b> is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{photovoltaics}} (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide.

40|$|We {{present a}} new, {{real-time}} method for rendering diffuse and glossy objects in low-frequency lighting environments that cap-tures soft shadows, interreflections, and caustics. As a preprocess, a novel global transport simulator creates functions over the object s surface representing transfer of arbitrary, low-frequency <b>incident</b> <b>lighting</b> into transferred radiance which includes global effects like shadows and interreflections from the object onto itself. At run-time, these transfer functions {{are applied to}} actual <b>incident</b> <b>lighting.</b> Dynamic, local lighting is handled by sampling it close to the object every frame; the object can also be rigidly rotated {{with respect to the}} lighting and vice versa. Lighting and transfer functions are represented using low-order spherical harmonics. This avoids aliasing and evaluates efficiently on graphics hardware by reducing the shading integral to a dot product of 9 to 25 element vectors for diffuse receivers. Glossy objects are handled using matrices rather than vectors. We further introduce functions for radiance transfer from a dynamic lighting environment through a preprocessed object to neighboring points in space. These allow soft shadows and caustics from rigidly moving objects to be cast onto arbitrary, dynamic receivers. We demonstrate real-time global lighting effects with this approach...|$|R
