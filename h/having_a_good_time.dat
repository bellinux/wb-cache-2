5|$|Musically, Animal {{draws from}} the electropop genre, while {{incorporating}} elements of dance-pop in its production and beats. Lyrically, {{the majority of}} the album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some appreciated its fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and said that it seemed insincere. The album attained chart success, debuting at number one on Canadian Albums Chart, US Billboard 200 and IFPI Greece Albums Chart, while charting within the top ten in seven other countries. Animal was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies to the United States and has sold over two million copies worldwide.|$|E

25|$|He {{disliked the}} provinces outside London, and while his family enjoyed the seaside, and men of science were <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> {{at a meeting}} of the British Association in the country, he {{remained}} in the hot and dusty libraries of the metropolis. He said that he felt like Socrates, who declared that the farther he was from Athens the farther was he from happiness. He never sought to become a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he never attended a meeting of the Society; he said that he had no ideas or sympathies in common with the physical philosopher. His attitude was possibly due to his physical infirmity, which prevented him from being either an observer or an experimenter. He never voted at an election, and he never visited the House of Commons, the Tower of London or Westminster Abbey.|$|E
25|$|Hill was {{nominated}} {{to enter the}} United States Military Academy in 1842, in a class that started with 85 cadets. He made friends easily, including such prominent future generals as Darius N. Couch, George Pickett, Jesse L. Reno, George Stoneman, Truman Seymour, Cadmus M. Wilcox, and George B. McClellan. His future commander, Thomas J. Jackson, {{was in the same}} class but the two did not get along. Hill had a higher social status in Virginia and valued <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> in his off-hours, whereas Jackson scorned levity and practiced his religion more fervently than Hill could tolerate. In 1844, Hill returned from a furlough with a case of gonorrhea, medical complications from which caused him to miss so many classes that he was required to repeat his third year. Reassigned to the class of 1847, he made new friendships in particular with Henry Heth and Ambrose Burnside. He graduated in 1847, ranking 15th of 38. He was appointed to the 1st U.S. Artillery as a brevet second lieutenant. He served in a cavalry company during the final months of the Mexican-American War, but fought in no major battles. After some garrison assignments along the Atlantic seaboard, he served in the Seminole Wars, again arriving {{near the end of the}} war and fighting various minor skirmishes. He was promoted to first lieutenant in September 1851.|$|E
25|$|By 1923, during Prohibition, Long Hill was {{attracting}} more {{guests for}} its supply of home-brewed ciders and beers than its sporting facilities. While in 1924, through their mutual acquaintance of Ring Lardner, F. Scott Fitzgerald {{turned up at}} the farm and sparred three rounds with Welsh. In 1924, Welsh was back in court, after {{he was involved in}} a car collision caused by him driving his vehicle {{on the wrong side of}} the road. Welsh began looking for other ventures to take him away from the health farm, and in 1925 he rejoined the US Army, becoming a boxing instructor at the Plattsburg Barracks in upstate New York. While in the forces he placed an advertisement for a manager to run Long Hill, which was accepted by neighbour and friend, Sidky Bey, and his wife Hranoush, known as Madame Bey. With strict curfew hours and a no-alcohol policy, Madame Bey made the farm a success, and Long Hill became an important training venue for New York boxers. But her tenure at the farm ended acrimoniously, over an argument with boxer Battling Siki, who Welsh believed to be a bad influence. After discussing the matter with other boxers, Madame Bey left Long Hill and set up her own rival venue. With Welsh in the Army and Madame Bey gone, the farm fell into disrepair. Bey later recalled Welsh fondly, stating that he was a man who enjoyed <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time,</b> but was a terrible businessman.|$|E
