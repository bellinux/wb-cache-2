5000|$|One {{measurement}} ton or <b>freight</b> <b>ton</b> {{is equal to}} , but historically it has had several different definitions. It is sometimes abbreviated as [...] "MTON". It is {{used to determine the}} amount of money to be charged as [...] "Freight" [...] in carrying different sorts of cargo. In general if a cargo is heavier than salt water, the actual tonnage is used. If it is lighter than salt water, e.g. seathers, freight is calculated using Measurement Tons of 40 cubic feet. The <b>freight</b> <b>ton</b> represents the volume of a truck, train or other freight carrier. In the past it has been used for a cargo ship but the register ton is now preferred. It is correctly abbreviated as [...] "FT" [...] but some users are now using <b>freight</b> <b>ton</b> to represent a weight of 1 t, thus the more common abbreviations are now M/T, MT, or MTON (for {{measurement ton}}), which still cause it {{to be confused with the}} tonne, or even the megatonne.|$|E

50|$|The ton is {{a unit of}} measure. It has a {{long history}} and has {{acquired}} a number of meanings and uses over the years. It is used principally as a unit of mass. Its original use as a measurement of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in terms such as the <b>freight</b> <b>ton.</b> It can also be used as a measure of energy, for truck classification, or as a colloquial term.|$|E

50|$|A {{shipping}} ton, <b>freight</b> <b>ton,</b> {{measurement ton}} or ocean ton {{is a measure}} of volume used for shipments of freight in large vehicles, trains or ships. In the USA, it is equivalent to 40 cubic feet while in the UK it is 42 cubic feet. It {{should not be confused with}} other types of ton which also measure volume. For example, the register ton, which is used to measure the capacity of ships, is 100 cubic feet.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in the 1990s, the Port of Male {{received}} over 10 {{million in}} {{loans from the}} Asian Development Bank designated for infrastructure upgraded. The ADB notes that from 1991 to 2011, due to the loans, the ports annual throughput in <b>freight</b> <b>tons</b> equaled 273,000. By 2011 that number reached 1 million. The ADB also provided training for port authority staff to increase efficiency.

30|$|More recently, Sahoo et al. (2010) have {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} infrastructure investment on economic growth in China. Recognising that results have varied depending on whether measures of infrastructure are defined by investment expenditure or physical measures they developed a composite index of infrastructure using principal component analysis based on per-capita energy consumption, per-capita energy use, telephone lines per 1000 population, rail density per 1000 population, air-transport <b>freight</b> <b>tons</b> per kilometre and paved road {{as a proportion of}} total roads. Their research found that investment in infrastructure made a significant contribution to economic growth in China and they concluded that ‘there is unidirectional causality from infrastructure development to output growth justifying China’s high spending on infrastructure development since the early nineties’ (Sahoo, et al., 2010).|$|R

40|$|The {{movement}} of freight {{is an important}} but often overlooked aspect of the transportation system. While much research and planning has centered on passenger transport, freight demand and modeling have received relatively little attention {{due to lack of}} appropriate data from which accurate vehicle flows could be predicted. This report proposes a methodology {{that can be used to}} better understand commodity movement. A method for estimating traffic volumes by commodity type on the transportation network from inter-region commodity flow data is presented. This approach was applied to a case study using the Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization, and has been evaluated for effectiveness. <b>Freight</b> <b>tons</b> of different commodities originating, traveling within and ending in the Boston area have been converted to truck numbers and distributed to different areas in the state using industrial employment density as an indicator variable. Truck flows have then been assigned to the highway network using the 1 user-equilibrium technique, and the resulting link volumes have been validated against existing survey counts. On comparison, a large percentage of roads showed that the estimated truck counts were within a tolerable error margin...|$|R
