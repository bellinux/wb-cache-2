40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} mastering the complexity of interacting with a large set of applications on smartphones. In one hand, number of applications increases. In the other <b>hand,</b> <b>screen</b> size reduces. To tackle this paradoxical evolution, we investigate adaptive user interfaces. We assume {{that it is possible}} to predict the applications of interest for a user in a given situation. Based on this hypothesis, our challenge is to accelerate user interaction when prediction is correct, without penalizing it when prediction is wrong. The paper proposes the concept of Evanescent Adaptation. The principle is a two-layer based representation: the predicted items (first layer) are displayed above the full list of items (second layer). The first layer is said to be evanescent in the sense that it automatically disappears progressively. The paper claims for putting this disappearing process under the control of the end-user. Thereby the user can close the first-layer as soon as s/he perceives prediction as irrelevant...|$|E

40|$|Wallpaper is {{the biggest}} {{commitment}} we make to design in our homes. It is a statement of colour and patternity bigger than any other. And more than anything else, the wallpaper we choose instantly communicates our taste. For craft makers, wallpaper is a huge canvas that requires many stages of design, planning and making. Modern digital printing techniques have allowed new designs of wallpapers to be manufactured, designs that rely less on repeats than traditional wallpapers. But as this exhibition will show, many makers are drawn to traditional <b>hand</b> <b>screen</b> or lino printing techniques for the different quality of finish they allow. This exhibition will explore and celebrate the hand printed techniques of wallpaper production, showcasing the most exciting designers and makers across the UK who champion a return to this better quality of wallpaper production. 23 makers will be on show in the exhibition, including hand–blocked beauties by octogenarian designer Marthe Armitage, St Jude’s delicate, illustrative wallpapers and Mini Moderns’ graphic wallpaper lusciousness.

40|$|Background. Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) –associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are not routinely assessed {{due to the}} lack of an adequate screening strategy. We aimed to develop a clinically relevant screening procedure for symptomatic HAND, validated against a gold standard neuropsychological (NP) test battery. Methods.  Representative HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically matched HIV-uninfected (HIV−) participants in an observational study completed a standard evaluation for mood, drug and/or alcohol use, and activities of daily living and a newly designed 20 -minute computerized CogState battery that assessed 5 cognitive domains. A subset completed standard NP assessment for 8 cognitive domains. <b>HAND</b> definition on <b>screening</b> and gold standard NP was determined using demographically corrected z scores and the global deficit score (≥ 0. 5), applying the Frascati criteria. Participants were blinded to screening results, and the NP examiner was blinded to screening and HIV status. Results.  A total of 254 HIV+ participants were enrolled—mean age, 48. 9 ± 10. 2 years; median nadir CD 4, 270 cells/mL; tertiary educated, 54 %; and HIV− controls, 72. HIV+ <b>HAND</b> <b>screening</b> prevalence was 30. 7 % (HIV-associated dementia, 3. 2 %; mild neurocognitive disorder, 12. 6 %; and asymptomatic neurocognitive disorder, 15. 0 %; HIV− group: 13. 9 %; P =. 004). Of the 75 participants who completed the NP battery, the HAND rate in the HIV+ group was 50. 9 % vs 43. 4 % by screening (P >. 50). <b>HAND</b> <b>screening</b> vs gold standard NP sensitivity was 76 % and specificity was 71 %. Clinically relevant HIV-associated dementia and mild neurocognitive disorder sensitivity was 100 % and specificity was 98 % (positive predictive value 0. 92). Conclusions.  Symptomatic HAND warranting neurological review was accurately predicted using a CogState-based screening procedure. 7 page(s...|$|R

This project will deliver an automated <b>hand</b> wash <b>screening</b> audit system using a vision system. The amount of the <b>hand</b> wash <b>screening</b> audit is done manually by an expert to monitor the hands under ultraviolet light once it’s been washed. This project is proposed to automate this <b>hand</b> wash <b>screening</b> audit by using a vision system. By using the vision system, the <b>hand</b> wash <b>screening</b> audit will be done automatically and accurately without the attendance of human expert to detect the unclean areas of the hands. The vision system is designed to increase accuracy to detect the unclean areas of washed hands after using the GLO GERM. GLO GERM acts as stimulated germs. This system will not only detect the unclean areas, but will also estimate {{the percentage of the}} unclean areas which will be used as further analysis of the efficiency of the system. However, we need to build the hand wash prototype using ultraviolet light and a camera that is connected to the computer to process and display the results of the <b>hand</b> wash <b>screening</b> audit using image processing software. In the image processing technique, we used hand detection to detect the areas of the palm of the hand and stain on palm detection to detect the unclean areas of the hands using HSV thresholding and RGB masking techniques. We detected the areas of unclean hands which dictated by the colored that has GLO GERM stains. The GUI will show the captured image and detected unclean area image and also the percentage of the unclean areas of the hands. The GUI will notify the decision of clean or unclean based on the percentage of unclean areas. This system design is efficient and commercial in the market especially in HUSM for requirements of health care applications.

50|$|HIF's {{important}} {{role as a}} homeostatic mediator implicates PHD2 as a therapeutic target {{for a range of}} disorders regarding angiogenesis, erythropoeisis, and cellular proliferation. There has been interest both in potentiating and inhibiting the activity of PHD2. For example, methylselenocysteine (MSC) inhibition of HIF-1α led to tumor growth inhibition in renal cell carcinoma in a PHD-dependent manner. It is thought that this phenomenon relies on PHD-stabilization, but mechanistic details of this process have not yet been investigated. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>screens</b> of small-molecule chelators have revealed hydroxypyrones and hydroxypyridones as potential inhibitors for PHD2. Substrate analog peptides have also been developed to exhibit inhibitory selectivity for PHD2 over factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), for which some other PHD-inhibitors show overlapping specificity.|$|R
