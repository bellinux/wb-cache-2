The total number of arm entries and number of closed-arm entries are sometimes used as measures of general activity.

40|$|Introduction: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor, {{may have}} various {{effects on the}} central nervous system via the nitric oxide (NO) -cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. Preclinical studies have shown the controversial effect of sildenafil on anxiety-like behavior in animals. This study was undertaken to investigate the acute effect of sildenafil on anxiety-like behavior in mice. Methods: Male mice were intraperitoneally (i. p.) administrated sildenafil (1, 2, or 10 mg/kg), and the control group was given the vehicle 15 min before the plus-maze test. The number of <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> the open arms of the plus-maze, the time spent in the open arms, and the total numbers of <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> the arms were recorded. Results: The results indicated that compared to the control group, the sildenafil-treated mice spent more time in the open arms and had a greater number of <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> open arms. The total number of <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> the arms did not significantly differ between the sildenafil-treated groups and the control group. Discussion: Acute administration of sildenafil could have anxiolytic effects on male mice. This effect might be mediated in a time-dependent manner by the NO/ cGMP/PDE 5 pathway...|$|R
