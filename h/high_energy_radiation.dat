For the purpose of designing the high intensity proton accelerator facilities at JAERI, the dose evaluation code system of <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>radiations</b> based on the HERMES code was developed and the dose conversion coefficients of effective dose were evaluated for photons, neutrons and protons up to 10 GeV, and electrons up to 100 GeV.

There were some discrepancy between two data owing to the difference of cross sections in the nuclear reaction models.

30|$|We {{have applied}} a {{technique}} to determine earthquake magnitudes, using durations of <b>high</b> frequency <b>energy</b> <b>radiation</b> and the maximum displacement amplitudes, to the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. The estimated duration of <b>high</b> frequency <b>energy</b> <b>radiation</b> and magnitude are 170.5 s, and 8.96, respectively. This agrees well with preliminary analyses for this earthquake. Compared with the December 26, 2004, Sumatra earthquake (Mw 9.0), this event {{is characterized by a}} shorter duration of <b>high</b> frequency <b>energy</b> <b>radiation</b> and a larger displacement amplitude. The measured durations of <b>high</b> frequency <b>energy</b> <b>radiation</b> show azimuthal dependence, which indicates rupture propagation in the southwest direction. This result, together with rupture models obtained by other studies using lower frequency seismic signals or tsunami waveforms, suggests that there were two distinct rupture propagations in this event: one in a southwest direction from which <b>high</b> frequency <b>energies</b> were radiated efficiently, and the other in an east direction from which a very large seismic moment was released. We measured the time differences between P-wave arrivals and the times at which the absolute amplitudes of high bandpass (2 – 4 Hz) filtered P-waves became the largest. Most of the measured time differences, normalized by twice the centroid time shift, are in the range between 50 and 80 per cent. This is consistent with the frequency distribution that we obtained previously for a set of 68 large shallow earthquakes.|$|R
