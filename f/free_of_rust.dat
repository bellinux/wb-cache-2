The development <b>of</b> stripe <b>rust</b> was monitored during the season. The resistant cultivar CFR 02 - 452 was <b>free</b> <b>of</b> stripe <b>rust</b> in all treatments, including the no fungicide treatment. There was more disease in the autumn-sown trial than in the spring-sown trial. The moderately resistant cultivar Torlesse had less stripe rust than the susceptible cultivar Claire in both trials and negligible disease in the spring-sown trial. In cultivar Claire for both trials, two fungicide applications that started before disease was present provided disease control that was similar to four applications, but fungicide applications that commenced once the disease had established provided little control <b>of</b> stripe <b>rust...</b>|$|R

50|$|Various alloys {{of steel}} {{can be made}} which offer {{a wide range of}} {{physical}} and chemical properties desirable for blades. For example, surgical scalpels are often made of stainless steel so that they remain <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>rust</b> and largely chemically inert; tool steels are hard and impact resistant (and often expensive as retaining toughness and hardness requires expensive alloying materials, and, being hard, they are difficult to make into their finished shape) and some are designed to resist changes to their physical properties at high temperatures. Steels can be further heat treated to emphasize their toughness (important for impact blades), or hardness, which is a major factor in how well they will retain an edge in use and in how easy they will be to resharpen (harder metals require more effort to sharpen).|$|E

40|$|Brown rust, {{caused by}} Puccinia melanocephala, has had devastating effects on {{sugarcane}} (Saccharum spp.) breeding programs and commercial production. The discovery of Bru 1, a major gene conferring resistance to brown rust, represented a substantial breakthrough. Markers for Bru 1 {{are the first}} available for sugarcane molecular breeding. The contribution of Bru 1 towards brown rust resistance in the Canal Point (CP) sugarcane breeding program was determined {{as a means of}} directing future breeding strategies. Bru 1 was detected in 285 of 1, 072 (27 %) clones used for crossing; this germplasm represents the genetic base for cultivar development in Florida. The frequency of Bru 1 was greatest in CP clones (42 %) and lowest among Louisiana clones (6 %). Bru 1 was not detected in clones with year assignments before 1953. However, Bru 1 frequency increased from 15 % (assignments 1975 - 1985) to 47 % in the current decade. The increase coincided with the introduction <b>of</b> brown <b>rust</b> to Florida. Bru 1 was detected in 155 (32 %) of 485 parental clones tested for brown rust susceptibility at two field locations. Of clones classed resistant to brown rust, 154 (59 %) contained Bru 1, yet none of 100 susceptible clones contained the gene. Bru 1 was detected in 667 (44 %) clones in the second clonal stage of selection, 87 % <b>of</b> which were <b>free</b> <b>of</b> brown <b>rust</b> symptoms. Bru 1 is the predominant source of resistance in the Florida sugarcane genetic base. Efforts to identify and integrate new brown rust resistance genes must be pursued to minimize risks associated with a future breakdown in major gene resistance provided by Bru 1.
