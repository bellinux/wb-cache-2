25|$|In Mark, Jesus is crucified {{along with}} two rebels, and the <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> dark for three hours. Jesus calls out to God, then gives a shout and dies. The curtain of the Temple is torn in two. Matthew follows Mark, adding an {{earthquake}} and the resurrection of saints. Luke also follows Mark, though he describes the rebels as common criminals, one of whom defends Jesus, who in turn promises that he (Jesus) and the criminal will be together in paradise. Luke portrays Jesus as impassive {{in the face of}} his crucifixion. John includes several of the same elements as those found in Mark, though they are treated differently.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E

500|$|Accompanied by {{delicate}} harmonies, [...] "Tatanka" [...] is a funk-infused and bass-driven {{track that}} features intricate percussion and guitar riffs, {{as well as}} unique fret-work by Guerrero. The album contains three atmospheric break tracks, [...] "Train of Thought", [...] "So Many Years Ago" [...] and [...] "And the <b>Day</b> <b>Goes</b> By". One critic stated that the interludes [...] "render the ambience palpable". The adumbral [...] "It Gets Heavy" [...] features melancholic lyrics and folk vocals by Gresham Taylor, which {{are similar to those}} of singer-songwriter John Secada. [...] "Thin Brown Layer" [...] has a noticeable Latin rhythm and guitar arrangement. The song also contains a predominant hypnotic beat, which, according to one music critic, [...] "makes you feel stoned even after completing a Twelve step program".

500|$|Trenyce's work in theatre {{has mostly}} focused on [...] "various {{entertainment}} aspects of African-American interest". In 2004, {{she made her}} theatre debut as Yancey in a North American tour of Not a <b>Day</b> <b>Goes</b> By, a play with songs adapted from the E. Lynn Harris' 2000 novel of the same name. The tour ran from January to May 2004. Jet magazine wrote that Trenyce [...] "breathes life and voice into Yancey", describing her {{as one of the}} show's [...] "rich vocal talents". The Chicago Defender felt that Trenyce displayed a [...] "theatrical perception as she interprets a character". She soon performed in the play The Vagina Monologues. In 2005, she played in two Nicci Gillbert stage productions: Soul Kittens Cabaret and Mama's Sweet Potato Pie, participating in a North American tour of the latter.

500|$|Mantle is {{best known}} for his long stint as general surgeon Dr Mike Barratt in 85 episodes of the TV series Casualty from October 1992 to November 1996, and 32 episodes of Holby City between 1999 and 2001. He {{previously}} appeared in Casualty as the brother of a patient in 1988. Mantle received much acclaim for his role and was one of the show's most popular characters. He was praised for being entirely convincing as a hospital consultant and very dominant and authoritative in his role, [...] "shouting orders in incomprehensible hospital-speak." [...] Daily Mirror described him as a [...] "heart-throb consultant" [...] and said that the role brought him [...] "an army of female fans". A 2001 poll by the Scottish Sunday Mail voted him 7th on a list of Top [...] "10 heart-throb docs on the box" [...] in a list which included the likes of George Clooney and Goran Višnjić. Mantle has said that during his role as the doctor he received a lot of fan mail, some of which were medically related and asking for his advice, believing him to be a real doctor, but professed that he couldn't even stand the sight of real blood. He has said, [...] "It's funny because people always treat me like a doctor. Not a <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> by without someone coming up to me and asking me for advice." [...] In 1996, he turned down an offer of £250,000 to continue playing the character, and last appeared in Casualty in November 1996. He said of his departure: ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{argument}} of the Dunciad B {{is the same as}} that of Dunciad A: [...] It begins with the same Lord Mayor's <b>Day,</b> <b>goes</b> to Dulness contemplating her realm, moves to Cibber (called [...] "Bays," [...] in honour of his being Poet Laureate and thereby having the laurel wreath and butt of sherry) in despair, announces Cibber's choice as new King of Dunces, etc. Other than a change of hero, however, Pope made numerous adaptations and expansions of key passages. Not only are the topical references altered to fit Cibber's career, but Pope consistently changes the nature of the satire subtly by increasing the overarching metaphor of Cibber as [...] "Anti-Christ of Wit," [...] rather than Classical hero of Dulness. Most of the adaptations increase the parody of the Bible at the expense of the parody of Virgil.|$|E

Neil Finn said of [...] "Help Is Coming"..."It was always a song about refugees, even if at the time I was thinking about the immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families.
