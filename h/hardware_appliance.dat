50|$|Defendants sold three accused {{computer}} security products: a “Webwasher” software download, a “Webwasher” <b>hardware</b> <b>appliance</b> and a “Cyberguard TSP” <b>hardware</b> <b>appliance.</b> All three products contained source code for eight different software modules. Three of those modules — Anti-Virus, Anti-Malware, and Content Protection — offered proactive scanning functionality, which {{was related to}} the patents held by Finjan. The eight modules were “locked” when the three products were sold, requiring a customer to purchase a separate key to activate each individual module. Therefore, a customer who purchased an accused product can activate all, some, or none of the eight modules at different cost.|$|E

40|$|Network {{functions}} (e. g., firewalls, load balancers, etc.) {{have been}} traditionally provided through proprietary <b>hardware</b> <b>appliances.</b> Often, <b>hardware</b> <b>appliances</b> {{need to be}} hardwired back to back to form a service chain providing chained network functions. <b>Hardware</b> <b>appliances</b> cannot be provisioned on demand since they are statically embedded in the network topology, making creation, insertion, modification, upgrade, and removal of service chains complex, and also slowing down service innovation. Hence, network operators are starting to deploy Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), which are virtualized over commodity hardware. VNFs can be deployed in Data Centers (DCs) or in Network Function Virtualization (NFV) capable network elements (nodes) such as routers and switches. NFV capable nodes and DCs together form a Network enabled Cloud (NeC) that helps to facilitate the dynamic service chaining required to support evolving network traffic and its service demands. In this study, {{we focus on the}} VNF service chain placement and traffic routing problem, and build a model for placing a VNF service chain while minimizing network resource consumption. Our results indicate that a NeC having a DC and NFV capable nodes can significantly reduce network-resource consumption...|$|R
