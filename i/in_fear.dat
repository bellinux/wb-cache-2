5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E

2500|$|Potter {{makes it}} clear that Timmy Willie is {{justified}} <b>in</b> <b>fearing</b> the cat and the maid in the town house because they are his mortal enemies. Johnny Town-mouse however displays little discrimination <b>in</b> <b>fearing</b> the cows that provide milk for Timmy Willie's table or the [...] "fearful racket" [...] of the lawnmower that provides grass clippings for his bed. In the illustrations, Potter underscores the absurdity of Johnny's fears by placing both the cows and the lawnmower in the distance and never close enough to be threats.|$|R
5|$|In Part Three, Henri Christophe {{has become}} the first King of Haiti and {{subjects}} the black population to worse slavery than that experienced under French rule. His regime carries out brutal torture and grips the city <b>in</b> <b>fear.</b> He is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken {{to be buried in}} a fortress on a mountain and this becomes his mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>fear</b> of {{a crusade}} by Emeric, Ban Kulin of Bosnia held a synod of the Church of Bosnia at Bilino Polje on 6 April 1203. The synod {{acknowledged}} papal primacy {{and ordered the}} reform of the rites. Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's suzerainty. In a letter written in 1203, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in Bulgaria, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.|$|E

When told that they had seen a ghost, Anwar enters the cemetery with Hasan to disprove its existence. However, Hasan thinks he sees a ghost and runs away frightened. When ridiculed for this by Anwar, Hasan's faith is broken. This leads {{him to have a}} large fight with his family about their Islamic faith, which results in Hasan's family disowning him. Upon his return to Bandung, Hasan marries Kartini.|$|E

5|$|Parker's murder led to {{increased}} racial tensions in Peterborough. At his former school, three Asian pupils were suspended {{for an attack}} on an Afro-Caribbean pupil; a relative of the victim then attacked an Asian teacher. A number of taxi firms stopped work early {{in the days after}} the attack <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of reprisals. In November 2001 Home Secretary David Blunkett banned all marches in Peterborough for three months as it was feared violence would be caused by the Anti-Nazi League and National Front who both sought to hold protests on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses.

5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed <b>in</b> <b>fear.</b> There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} hippocampus has overlapping characteristics {{with both}} the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced {{the amount of information}} sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{begins by}} {{describing}} how Hester {{and her family}} (who in the story represent all citizens) live <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> of the Judges, and have virtually no say over their lives. Even on a family picnic in the park they are threatened and intimidated by a judge when their young son accidentally throws a ball at him. Finally deciding that enough is enough, Hester reveals that she has decided to join a terrorist group and take over a television studio at gunpoint to announce their manifesto for reform to the whole city.|$|E

As such, <b>Fears</b> <b>in</b> Solitude does not seek to leave the location to help humanity, but to stay as a protector over his family.|$|R
