500|$|In {{the flash}} sequences, Jack {{is shown to}} be depressed, bearded, heavily {{drinking}} and addicted to Oxycodone. After reading {{about the death of}} someone he knew, Jack appears to be ready to commit suicide by jumping off the Sixth Street Viaduct bridge. However, a firey car crash occurs on the bridge before he jumps and he goes to the victims; it is eventually revealed that the driver crashed after being distracted by Jack. Later, Jack visits the memorial service for the person he read about and finds himself to be the only attendee. In the last of the flashes, Kate appears and Jack discusses the island with her. It becomes clear that the sequences are actually flashforwards rather than flashbacks. s Matthew Fox Flashforwards to Season 4] [...] ", Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved on January 4, 2007. Jack tells Kate about the memorial service. Kate says that she did not know about it, but she would not have attended <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> Jack also talks about using the [...] "golden pass" [...] they had received from Oceanic Airlines to fly {{back and forth across the}} Pacific Ocean every Friday, hoping that he will crash in the island. Jack laments that they should have never left and must return. However, Kate disagrees and leaves, not wanting to continue a conversation that they have apparently had before.|$|E
500|$|Justin Kanter from Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave a {{positive}} review and {{commented on the}} performances: [...] "Over {{the course of two}} full, uninterrupted hours comes an abundance of grandiose sets and effects; a voluminous line-up of dancers; precisely engineered sound and sequence; and sharply produced, celebrity-studded video clips. [...] Unquestionably, it’s Madonna and company’s actual show — the entire spectacle of song, dance, style, and attitude — that make the Sticky & Sweet Tour an invigorating and highly memorable happening." [...] However, he felt that the performances of [...] "Borderline" [...] (1984) and [...] "Human Nature" [...] were disappointing. Ben Kaplan from Canada.com said [...] "Sticky & Sweet is a document of a woman in her fifties who actually started peaking after most people thought she was through. Madonna doesn't speak with a British accent on her new record. But <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> it wouldn't really have mattered: Most of the stage banter is drowned out by the crowd's roar." [...] He listed the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] (1985) as a highlight of the tour. Tony clayton-Lea from The Irish Times said [...] "Madonna has the experience to know what works and what doesn’t. It is this that makes Sticky Sweet such an interesting proposition: a superbly shot movie of the 'four-act' show that blends muscle with music, depth with deftness." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said [...] "Since so much of the tour depended on overblown spectacle, Sticky & Sweet Tour is better experienced as a video instead of a CD – but even as a video this doesn’t rank among the best Madonna live albums, as there’s too much precision and not enough inspiration in the whole show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amy McDougall/Barone (Monica Horan) becomes Robert Barone's {{second wife}} (in season 7), {{and is the}} best friend of Debra, who {{introduces}} her to Robert. A recurring character for the first seven seasons of the series, Amy became essentially a regular cast member {{for the remainder of}} the show's run. However, Horan's name did not get added to the opening credits until the final season. Many issues cause Amy and Robert to break up in the first six seasons, with one being caused by Raymond. Quite often, Amy apologizes to someone <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not do anything wrong. She was born to very religious parents who, according to Amy, [...] "wouldn't yell if they were on fire." [...] In real life, Horan is the wife of creator/executive producer Philip Rosenthal.|$|E

2500|$|The case exposed deep mistrust in {{the black}} {{community}} about winning justice from legal institutions. Some opinions remained fixed despite the overwhelming evidence. Legal scholar Patricia J. Williams wrote in 1991 that the teenager [...] "has been the victim of some unspeakable crime. No matter how she got there. No matter who did it to her—and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it to herself." [...] These comments aroused controversy as well; Sue Sherry responded to Williams in her book Beyond All Reason: The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law, writing [...] "The radical multiculturalists seem unable or unwilling to differentiate between Brawley's fantasized rape and another woman's real one. Indifference to the distinction between fact and fiction minimizes real suffering by implying that it is no worse than imagined or self-inflicted suffering." [...] On May 21, 1990, Alton H. Maddox was indefinitely suspended by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn after failing to appear before a disciplinary hearing to answer allegations regarding his conduct in the Brawley case.|$|E

60|$|The Cardinal took {{leave of}} her with his usual dignified benevolence. It did not suit him at present {{to appear to be}} taking notice of her thinly veiled threats. He did not think that she would {{actually}} betray him, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> talk to His Grace for a few moments, for to betray the lie would mean also to acknowledge her love and her jealousy, and proud Ursula Glynde would never suffer that humiliation.|$|E
