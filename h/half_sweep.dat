40|$|Numerical {{application}} helps {{researchers in}} simulating various problems {{and used for}} solving partial differential equation. <b>Half</b> <b>sweep</b> and quarter sweep approach have been applied onto iterative method to gain approximation solution. In this paper, the implementation of full sweep successive over relaxation (FSSOR), <b>half</b> <b>sweep</b> successive over relaxation (HSSOR) and quarter sweep successive over relaxation (QSSOR) methods and full sweep accelerated over relaxation (FSAOR), <b>half</b> <b>sweep</b> accelerated over relaxation (HSAOR) and quarter sweep accelerated over relaxation (QSAOR) for its numerical engines are shown. QSSOR and QSAOR method was the fastest among FSSOR, HSSOR, FSAOR and HSAOR methods. Additionally, QSAOR performance is more accurate than QSSOR...|$|E
40|$|A new multigrid scheme using <b>half</b> <b>sweep</b> nine-point finite {{difference}} approxi­mation {{in solving}} the two dimensional Poisson equation is presented. The concept of <b>half</b> <b>sweep</b> multigrid was initiated by Othman and Abdullah (1997) where promising results was established and confirmed. The five-point method was shown {{to be very much}} faster compared to the fullsweep multigrid method due to Gupta et al. (1995). In this paper, we apply the multigrid V-cycle algorithm on the nine-point finite difference approximation derived from the rotated nine-point stencil (Ali & Abdullah 1998). This nine­-point finite difference approximation has been proven to be a viable Poisson solver with second order accuracy. Using different grid sizes, the efficiency of this multigrid scheme is compared with the fullsweep multigrid derived from the standard nine-point stencil (Adams et al. 1988) in terms of execution times and maximum error...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the ordering of the lattice sites in the momentum space and quantum chemistry versions of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method we have studied the separability and entanglement of the target state for the 1 -D Hubbard model and various molecules. By analyzing the behavior of von Neumann and Neumann-Renyi entropies we have found criteria that help to fasten convergence. A new initialization procedure has been developed which maximizes the Kullback-Leibler entropy and extends the active space (AS) in a dynamical fashion. The dynamically extended active space (DEAS) procedure reduces significantly the effective system size during the first <b>half</b> <b>sweep</b> and accelerates the speed of convergence of momentum space DMRG and quantum chemistry DMRG to a great extent. The effect of lattice site ordering {{on the number of}} block states to be kept during the RG procedure is also investigated. Comment: 15 pages, 15 figure...|$|E
25|$|After {{putting his}} title {{defenses}} on hold {{due to an}} injury, Rutten returned to the ring in a rematch against Maurice Smith. Overwhelmed by Rutten's strikes, Smith opted for taking him down every time possible, but Rutten ended up performing a <b>half</b> guard <b>sweep</b> into a rear naked choke for the tap out. His next time would be against the man he debuted against in Pancrase, Ryushi Yanagisawa, {{and this time the}} match lasted 27:35. Despite breaking his hand during the match, Rutten scored three consecutive submissions through the affair before ending it with another rear naked choke.|$|R

I felt more sure of it at first than I do now, for there is a slight mist rising from the water. If they don't come out to us by the {{afternoon}} we will go in and have a look at them. We have got <b>half</b> a dozen <b>sweeps</b> on board, and with those and the boats we could work her in in a couple of hours." ...|$|R
40|$|Ferrocenoyl {{peptides}} incorporating thioether functionality respond {{more strongly}} to mercury(II) than to other heavy metal ions in solution. Compounds reported previously {{in this context}} are all 1, 1 ′-disubstituted, and all include two or more sulfur-containing amino acids. To test whether two thioether groups are required for effective mercury binding by these systems, we have prepared a series of singly-substituted ferrocenoyl peptides from ferrocenecarboxylic acid and l-methionine, S-methyl-l-cysteine or S-trityl-l-cysteine, and tested them as electrochemical probes for mercury(II). Nine ferrocenoyl peptides have been synthesised using a Boc-protecting group strategy and HBTU-mediated peptide coupling. The electrochemical properties of these compounds have been determined using cyclic voltammetry, and all show fully reversible one electron oxidation steps. Forward <b>sweep</b> <b>half</b> wave peaks (E), reverse <b>sweep</b> <b>half</b> wave peaks (E), peak separations (ΔE) and half wave potentials (E) are reported. Changes in {{the potential of the}} iron(II) /iron(III) redox couple of the ferrocene core have been used to quantify heavy metal-peptide interactions, revealing that these monotopic systems also respond more strongly to mercury(II) than to zinc(II), cadmium(II), silver(I) and lead(II). NMR experiments to characterise the peptide-mercury interaction implicate the thioether sulfur as the site of mercury binding and indicate 1 : 1 stoichiometry. The crystal structure of ferrocenoyl-S-methyl-l-cysteine methyl ester is also reported. The greater responsiveness of these systems to mercury(II) makes them interesting leads for the development of biologically inspired sensors for this toxic heavy metal...|$|R
50|$|At {{approximately}} 23:40, Ed Whitlock, {{the radar}} operator in Lieutenant Commander Jesse D. Taylor's Avenger aircraft, detected a surface contact on his malfunctioning radar (only the right <b>half</b> of its <b>sweep</b> was working). Taylor immediately dropped flares, illuminating the area, and attacked. After his first pass {{he saw the}} depth charge explosions just to starboard of the submarine - a near miss - and the submarine dove. Taylor dropped a purple sonobuoy, a newly developed underwater microphone that floats on the surface, picks up underwater sounds and transmits them to the aircraft. A searching aircraft usually drops these in packs of five, code-named purple, orange, blue, red and yellow (POBRY). The operator is able to monitor each buoy in turn to listen for sounds emitted by enemy craft.|$|R
50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the door. Some closers allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most door closers use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the door and some closers are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly the first <b>half</b> of the <b>sweep</b> range. Door closers which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' door closers.|$|R
6000|$|Your {{work will}} look very odd for some time, {{when you first}} begin to paint in this way, and before you can modify it, as I shall tell you {{presently}} how; but never mind; it is of the greatest possible importance that you should practice this separate laying on of the hues, for all good coloring finally depends on it. It is, indeed, often necessary, and sometimes desirable, to lay one color and form boldly over another: thus, in laying leaves on blue sky, it is impossible always in large pictures, or when pressed for time, {{to fill in the}} blue through the interstices of the leaves; and the great Venetians constantly lay their blue ground first, and then, having let it dry, strike the golden brown over it {{in the form of the}} leaf, leaving the under blue to shine through the gold, and subdue it to the olive-green they want. But in the most precious and perfect work each leaf is inlaid, and the blue worked round it; and, whether you use one or other mode of getting your result, it is equally necessary to be absolute and decisive in your laying the color. Either your ground must be laid firmly first, and then your upper color struck upon it in perfect form, forever, thenceforward, unalterable; or else the two colors must be individually put in their places, and led up to each other till they meet at their appointed border, equally, thenceforward, unchangeable. Either process, you see, involves absolute decision. If you once begin to slur, or change, or sketch, or try this way and that with your color, it is all over with it and with you. You will continually see bad copyists trying to imitate the Venetians, by daubing their colors about, and retouching, and finishing, and softening: when every touch and every added hue only lead them farther into chaos. There is a dog between two children in a Veronese in the Louvre, which gives the copyists much employment. He has a dark ground behind him, which Veronese has painted first, and then when it was dry, or nearly so, struck the locks of the dog's white hair over it with some half-dozen curling sweeps of his brush, right at once, and forever. Had one line or hair of them gone wrong, it would have been wrong forever; no retouching could have mended it. The poor copyists daub in first some background, and then some dog's hair; then retouch the background, then the hair; work for hours at it, expecting it always to come right to-morrow--"when it is finished." [...] They may work for centuries at it, and they will never do it. If they can do it with Veronese's allowance of work, <b>half</b> a dozen <b>sweeps</b> of the hand over the dark background, well; if not, they may ask the dog himself whether it will ever come right, and get true answer from him--on Launce's conditions: [...] "If he say 'ay,' it will; if he say 'no,' it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will." ...|$|R
