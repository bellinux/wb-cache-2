40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} and isolation {{of a stable}} complex containing the formally neutral Fe 2 Ge 2 motif, which is stabilized by the coordination of an N-heterocyclic carbene to the <b>germanium</b> and carbon <b>monoxide</b> to the iron center. [(NHCiPr 2 Me 2) GeFe(CO) 4] 2 is obtained by reduction of the NHCiPr 2 Me 2 -coordinated dichlorogermylene adduct with Fe(CO) 4, {{which in turn is}} obtained from reaction of Fe 2 (CO) 9 with GeCl 2 ·NHCiPr 2 Me 2 (NHCiPr 2 Me 2 = 1, 3 -diisopropyl- 4, 5 -dimethylimidazol- 2 -ylidene). The solid state structure of the title compound reveals two distinct coordination modes for the Fe(CO) 4 fragments: bridging (p-type) and terminal (s-type). In solution, the rapid equilibrium between the two modes was resolved by NMR at − 35 °C. Reaction with propylene sulfide at room-temperature affords the sulfide-bridged digermanium complex with two terminal Fe(CO) 4 moieties.

For both compounds, an orthorhombically distorted SnO(s) structure {{is found to}} display the highest stability. The bondings in SiO(s) and GeO(s) display considerable degrees of both covalency and ionicity in conjunction with significant metallic character in the bc planes. SiO(s) is predicted {{to be a better}} conductor than GeO(s). Possible importance to CMOS technology is emphasized as supposedly insulating thin SiO 2 (s) layers may display local phase separation, resulting in metallic perforation due to microscopic SiO(s) ‘spikes'...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between <b>germanium</b> <b>monoxide</b> (GeO) desorption and either improvement or deterioration in electrical characteristics of metal∕GeO 2 ∕Ge capacitors fabricated by thermal oxidation has been investigated. In the metal∕GeO 2 ∕Ge stack, two processes of GeO desorption at different sites and at different temperatures were observed by thermal desorption spectroscopy measurements. The electrical characteristics of as-oxidized metal∕GeO 2 ∕Ge capacitors shows a large flat-band voltage shift and minority carrier generation {{due to the}} GeO desorption from the GeO 2 ∕Ge interface during oxidation of Ge substrates. On the other hand, the electrical properties were drastically improved by a postmetallization annealing at low temperature resulting in a metal catalyzed GeO desorption from the top interface...|$|E
40|$|Germanium layers {{are very}} {{attractive}} for future semiconductor devices {{due to their}} high carrier mobility. To form pn-junctions in such devices, ion implantation followed by an annealing step is the most feasible way. Several previous studies reported severe surface degradation during annealing of germanium without a capping layer. The observed deteriorations are, e. g., heavy surface roughness or even loss of bulk material. To study the loss of germanium, samples with patterned silicon dioxide layer were annealed at temperatures between 500 and 600 °C in different atmospheres. The chosen atmospheres were selected to be nominally inert (N 2, Ar, or vacuum). Yet, the samples showed rates of substrate loss, e. g., up to 3 nm/min at 600 °C in Ar atmosphere. The resulting rates of substrate loss c an be approximately described by Arrhenius laws with an activation energy of 2. 08 +/- 0. 21 eV {{in the case of}} Ar. Direct evaporation of germanium or germanium dioxide can be excluded because of the low vapor pressures reported in the literature. As mechanism, we propose the evaporation of <b>germanium</b> <b>monoxide</b> formed with residual oxidants such as oxygen or water vapor in the atmosphere used for processing. Rough calculations exhibit that a desorption rate of about 10 − 8 mol GeO per min is required in our experiments to achieve the maximum rate of substrate loss in argon at 600 °C. Results for the different atmospheres will be compared...|$|E
