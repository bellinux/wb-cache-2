40|$|Today, India faces {{two most}} vital {{problems}} which {{are directly related}} to agriculture. The first one is to meet the rising demand for food and other agricultural products, and the second is the widespread poverty in rural areas. The good performance in agricultural sector can diminish levels of rural poverty and meet increasing demand of agricultural products (Ahluwalia, 1978). Agricultural productivity {{is a measure of the}} efficiency with which inputs are used in agriculture to produce an output. When a given combination of inputs produces a maximum output, the productivity is said to be at its maximum. The measurement of agricultural productivity enables a comparison of relative performance of farmers’ farms, the types of farming and geographical regions. The areas which experiences high land productivity may always have been leading agricultural regions. In the present study the measure adopted by the economists has been employed to compute the level of agricultural productivity (Bhalla 1989). The total output of selected crops is multiply by respective farm harvest prices. The figure of the output, us computed represented only the part of the total cropped area covered by the selected crops. This figure is multiplied by relevant multiplier (in ratio with area not covered by selected crops) and added to the original figure to get the total output <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>terms</b> for total cropped area.

For example, the effect of £ 1 of extra Family Credit entitlement is zero unless it triggers programme participation in which case it is 4.152 (= 4.474 - 0.3223) – which, <b>in</b> <b>money</b> metric <b>terms,</b> is approximately £ 0.93 (i.e. 4.152 / 4.474), which {{is what it is}} for those already taking up. The probability that it triggers programme participation is the marginal effect of entitlement of 0.03 (0.069 x 0.45, the take-up rate). Thus, the expected impact on someone not taking up is just 0.125 (3 % of 4.152), worth £ 0.03. The overall expected impact is 0.03 for the 55 % not taking up and 0.93 for those who are – on average an effect of approximately £ 0.44. Similarly £ 1 of child nutrition has no effect unless it triggers programme participation in which case the effect is 3.9 – <b>in</b> <b>money</b> metric <b>terms</b> approximately £ 0.87, which is what it is for those already taking up. While the expected impact is just 0.25 (6 % of 3.9) – which, <b>in</b> <b>money</b> metric <b>terms,</b> is approximately £ 0.06 for someone not taking up. Therefore, the overall average effect, across the 15 % who are not taking up and the 85 % who are, is £ 0.74. Importantly, our results indicate that Family Credit is valued less than child nutrition programmes.|$|R
