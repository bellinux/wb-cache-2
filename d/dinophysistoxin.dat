40|$|Diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poisoning (DSP) is a gastrointestinal disease {{caused by}} lipid soluble polyether toxins produced by dinoflagellates and accumulated in shellfish. Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning is a worldwide threat {{to public health}} and the shellfish industry. To date, only four lipid soluble polyethers have been known as diarrhetic shellfish toxins. Among them, Okadaic acid (OA), <b>Dinophysistoxin</b> 1 (DTX- 1, 35 -methyl OA), <b>Dinophysistoxin</b> 2 (DTX- 2, OA isomers) and <b>Dinophysistoxin</b> 3 (DTX- 3, 7 -O-acyl- 35 -methyl OA), all of which have free carboxilic groups. To perform quantitative analysis of DSP toxins in shellfish samples is a requirement, because DSP toxins are endemic in the Chilean mollusks of the southern regions, and although human symptoms of DSP appear relatively mild in comparison with the Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP), the necessity of monitoring the chronic effects of continued uptake of low doses of DSP toxins more closely is imperative, since DSP toxins have been described as potent tumor promoters. This paper shows the synthesis pathway of a chromophore, 1 -pyrenyldiazomethane (PDAM), a fluorescent labeling reagent for determination of carboxilic acids, using High Performance Liquid Chromatography with fluorescence on-line detection. This procedure was developed {{in order to have a}} quantitative method for DSP toxins analysis that would be useful for health public services and private shellfish industries. The features of this labeling reagent are compared against ADAM and used for quantitative analysis of DSP toxins in Chilean mussels and cultured dinoflagellates samples...|$|E
40|$|Okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues, <b>dinophysistoxin</b> 1 (DTX 1) and <b>dinophysistoxin</b> 2 (DTX 2), are {{lipophilic}} and heat-stable marine toxins {{produced by}} dinoflagellates, which can accumulate in filter-feeding bivalves. These toxins cause diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) in humans {{shortly after the}} ingestion of contaminated seafood. Studies carried out in mice indicated that DSP poisonous are toxic towards experimental animals with a lethal oral dose 2 – 10 {{times higher than the}} intraperitoneal (i. p.) lethal dose. The focus of this work was to study the absorption of OA, DTX 1 and DTX 2 through the human gut barrier using differentiated Caco- 2 cells. Furthermore, we compared cytotoxicity parameters. Our data revealed that cellular viability was not compromised by toxin concentrations up to 1 μM for 72 h. Okadaic acid and DTX 2 induced no significant damage; nevertheless, DTX 1 was able to disrupt the integrity of Caco- 2 monolayers at concentrations above 50 nM. In addition, confocal microscopy imaging confirmed that the tight-junction protein, occludin, was affected by DTX 1. Permeability assays revealed that only DTX 1 was able to significantly cross the intestinal epithelium at concentrations above 100 nM. These data suggest a higher oral toxicity of DTX 1 compared to OA and DTX 2...|$|E
40|$|Diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poisoning (DSP) is {{a severe}} gastrointestinal illness caused by consumption of shellfish contaminated with toxigenic dinoflagellates such as certain Dinophysis and Prorocentrum species. In {{spite of the}} identification of DSP {{as the cause of}} numerous cases of hum. an intoxication throughout the world and comprehensive monitoring for shellfish toxicity, the fate and kinetics of DSP toxins in shellfish are not well described. Major limitations to the detailed study of DSP toxins dynamics in shellfish have been the inability to mass culture Dinophysis species for feeding studies and the chemical complexity of the toxin components associated with this toxin syndrome.

To assess the possible functions of protein phosphatases in this respect, we studied the effects of the phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A, okadaic acid, and <b>dinophysistoxin</b> 1 (35 -methylokadaic acid) on BHK- 21 fibroblasts. Within minutes of incubation with these inhibitors, changes are seen in the structural organization of intermediate filaments, followed by a loss of microtubules, as assayed by immunofluorescence. These changes in cytoskeletal structure are accompanied by a rapid and selective increase in vimentin phosphorylation on interphase-specific sites, and they are fully reversible after removal of calyculin A. The results indicate that there is a rapid phosphate turnover on cytoskeletal intermediate filaments and further suggest that protein phosphatases are essential for the maintenance and structural integrity of two major cytoskeletal components...|$|E
40|$|Further {{studies on}} mussel samples from Galicia, Spain, have {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} okadaic acid (OA), <b>dinophysistoxin</b> 2 (DTX 2), and the fatty acid acyl esters of both of these toxins as the 2 ̆ 01 cDTX 32 ̆ 01 d complex. Measurements were performed with an improved in situ method {{for the formation of}} 9 -anthryldiazomethane (ADAM) derivatives followed by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Base hydrolysis of DTX 3 toxins gave free OA and DTX 2, which were determined following ADAM derivatization. Results were confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses, and in most of the samples, free DTX 2 was the most abundant toxin. However, the OA/DTX 2 ratio in the DTX 3 conjugated form was different, with OA being the most abundant in all cases. This difference could be due to different rates of metabolism of OA and DTX 2 to the acyl esters or due to contamination of the shellfish by the two toxins at different points in time, resulting in less acyl ester formation for one toxin versus the other. The second possibility would be reasonable if two different source organisms were producing the toxins. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Lipophilic marine toxins pose {{a serious}} threat for {{consumers}} and an enormous economic problem for shellfish producers. Synergistic interaction among toxins may {{play an important role}} in the toxicity of shellfish and consequently in human intoxications. In order to study the toxic profile of molluscs, sampled during toxic episodes occurring in different locations in Galicia in 2014, shellfish were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), the official method for the detection of lipophilic toxins. The performance of this procedure was demonstrated to be fit for purpose and was validated in house following European guidelines. The vast majority of toxins present in shellfish belonged to the okadaic acid (OA) group and some samples from a particular area contained yessotoxin (YTX). Since these toxins occur very often with other lipophilic toxins, we evaluated the potential interactions among them. A human neuroblastoma cell line was used to study the possible synergies of OA with other lipophilic toxins. Results show that combination of OA with <b>dinophysistoxin</b> 2 (DTX 2) or YTX enhances the toxicity triggered by OA, decreasing cell viability and cell proliferation, depending on the toxin concentration and incubation time.

Current hypotheses propose an elevated impact of those environmental changes on the biodiversity, community composition and metabolic processes of species. The effects on ecosystem function and services, particularly when invasive or toxigenic harmful species become dominant, can be expressed over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in plankton communities. Our study focused on the comparison of molecular biodiversity of three size-fractions (micro-, nano-, picoplankton) in the coastal pelagic zone of West Greenland and their association with environmental parameters. Molecular diversity was assessed via parallel amplicon sequencing the 28 S rRNA hypervariable D 1 /D 2 region. We showed that biodiversity distribution within the area of Uummannaq Fjord, Vaigat Strait and Disko Bay differed markedly within and among size-fractions. In general, we observed a higher diversity within the picoplankton size fraction compared to the nano- and microplankton. In multidimensional scaling analysis, community composition of all three size fractions correlated with cell size, silicate and phosphate, chlorophyll a (chl a) and <b>dinophysistoxin</b> (DTX). Individually, each size fraction community composition also correlated with other different environmental parameters, i. e. temperature and nitrate. We observed a more homogeneous community of the picoplankton across all stations compared to the larger size classes, despite different prevailing environmental conditions of the sampling areas. This suggests that habitat niche occupation for larger-celled species may lead to higher functional trait plasticity expressed as an enhanced range of phenotypes, whereas smaller organisms may compensate for lower potential plasticity with higher diversity.

Their morphology was examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Among 47 Prorocentrum strains, seven morphospecies were identified as P. lima, P. rhathymum, P. concavum, P. cf. emarginatum, P. fukuyoi, P. cf. maculosum and P. panamense. The latter five species have not been previously reported in Chinese waters, {{and this is the}} first record of P. panamense outside its type locality. Partial large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA and internal transcribed spacer region sequences were obtained and molecular phylogenetic analysis was carried out using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference.

Ongoing surveillance {{is needed to}} prevent similar illness outbreaks. Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is an acute gastrointestinal illness caused by consumption of bivalve mollusks that have accumulated okadaic acid (OA) or related <b>dinophysistoxins</b> through filter feeding. DSP toxins are produced by several species of marine dinoflagellates from the genera Dinophysis and Prorocentrum (1 – 4). Symptoms of DSP include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, chills, and fever (5). Onset occurs 0. 5 – 4 hours after consumption of contaminated food, and symptoms last up to 72 hours; treatment is supportive. To date, no sequelae have been reported, but speculation has suggested that chronic exposure may increase risk for gastrointestinal cancers (6, 7). The earliest clinical reports of DSP were from the Netherlands in 1961; however, DSP toxins were structurally elucidated> 15 years later in Japan (2, 8, 9). DSP illnesses have since been documented worldwide. In the United States, sporadic DSP-like illnesses have been recorded on the East Coast since 1980, coinciding with detection of toxin-producing dinoflagellates in shellfish beds (2, 4).

The prime producers of the DSP toxins that end up in filter feeding shellfish are species of the marine mixotrophic dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis. Intraspecific toxin contents of Dinophysis spp. vary a lot, but the regulating factors of toxin content are still poorly understood. Dinophysis spp. {{have been shown to}} sequester and use chloroplasts from their ciliate prey, and with this rare mode of nutrition, irradiance and food availability could {{play a key role in}} the regulation of toxins contents and production. We investigated toxin contents, production and excretion of a Dinophysis acuta culture under different irradiances, food availabilities and growth phases. The newly isolated strain of D. acuta contained okadaic acid (OA), pectenotoxins- 2 (PTX- 2) and a novel <b>dinophysistoxin</b> (DTX) that we tentatively describe as DTX- 1 b isomer. We found that all three toxins were excreted to the surrounding seawater, and for OA and DTX- 1 b as much as 90 % could be found in extracellular toxin pools. For PTX- 2 somewhat less was excreted, but often > 50 % was found extracellularly. This was the case both in steady-state exponential growth and in food limited, stationary growth, and we emphasize the need to include extracellular toxins in future studies of DSP toxins. Cellular toxin contents were largely unaffected by irradiance, but toxins accumulated both intra- and extracellularly when starvation reduced growth rates of D. acuta. Toxin production rates were highest during exponential growth, but continued at decreased rates when cell division ceased, indicating that toxin production is not directly associated with ingestion of prey. Finally, we explore the potential of these new discoveries to shed light on the ecological role of DSP toxins...|$|E

Such toxins and the algae producing them are regularly surveyed in many countries, including Europe, North America, Japan and others. However, very little is known regards the occurrence of such algae and their toxins in most African countries. This paper reports on a survey of phytoplankton and algal toxins in Nigerian coastal waters. Seawater samples were obtained from four sites for phytoplankton identification, on three occasions between the middle of October 2014 {{and the end of}} February 2015 (Bar Beach and Lekki in Lagos State, Port Harcourt in Rivers State and Uyo in Akwa Ibom State). The phytoplankton community was generally dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria; however several species of dinoflagellates were also identified: Dinophysis caudata, Lingulodinium polyedrum and two benthic species of Prorocentrum. Passive samplers (containing Diaion® HP- 20 resin) were deployed for several 1 -week periods on the same four sites to obtain profiles of algal toxins present in the seawater. Quantifiable amounts of okadaic acid (OA) and pectenotoxin 2 (PTX 2), as well as traces of <b>dinophysistoxin</b> 1 (DTX 1) were detected at several sites. Highest concentrations (60 ng OA g- 1 HP- 20 resin) were found at Lekki and Bar Beach stations, which also had the highest salinities.

Screening against a marine natural products database indicated the potential presence of cyanobacterial compounds in the water column, which was also consistent with phytoplankton analysis. During this study, the occurrence of the marine dinoflagellate toxins OA and PTX 2 has been demonstrated in coastal waters of Nigeria, despite unfavourable environmental conditions, with regards to the low salinities measured.

Samples were taken over two years from late spring to early autumn (2007 – 2008 period) and from early spring to late summer (2008 – 2009 period). Dinophysis spp., in particular Dinophysis acuminata, were always detected, often forming thin layers {{in the region of}} the salinity driven pycnocline, with cell maxima for D. acuminata of 28. 5 × 103 cells L− 1 in March 2008 and 17. 1 × 103 cells L− 1 in November 2008. During the 2008 – 2009 sampling period, blooms of D. acuminata co-occurred with high densities of cryptophyceans and the ciliate Mesodinium spp. The highest levels of pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX- 2; 2. 2 ng L− 1) were found in the plankton in February 2009, associated with moderate densities of D. acuminata, Dinophysis tripos and Dinophysis subcircularis (0. 1 – 0. 6 × 103 cells L− 1). However, only trace levels of PTX- 2 were observed in bivalves at that time. <b>Dinophysistoxin</b> (DTX- 1 and DTX- 3) levels in bivalves and densities of Dinophysis spp. were not well correlated. Low DTX levels in bivalves observed during a major bloom of D. acuminata in March 2008 suggested that there is a large seasonal intraspecific variability in toxin content of Dinophysis spp. driven by changes in population structure associated with distinct LST toxin profiles in Reloncaví fjord during the study period. A heterogeneous vertical distribution was also observed for P. reticulatum, whose presence was restricted to summer months. A bloom of this species of 2. 2 × 103 cells L− 1 at 14 m depth in February 2009 was positively correlated with high concentrations of yessotoxins in bivalves (51 – 496 ng g− 1) and plankton samples (3. 2 ng L− 1).

40|$|Two oceanographic surveys for toxigenic {{phytoplankton}} in the South and North Atlantic Ocean, {{including the}} adjacent Irminger Sea and the Arctic coasts of Greenland and Iceland, were conducted {{for analysis of}} putative toxic microalgal species and their respective toxins. During both expeditions, plankton was sampled by phytoplankton net (20 μm mesh) vertical hauls with subsequent size-fractionation, and by filtration of Niskin bottle water samples from discrete depths. In addition, sediment samples at selected stations were taken for identification and analysis of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts). Among the toxins detected in both areas were domoic acid (DA), pectenotoxins (PTXs), yessotoxin (YTX), and paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs). In addition, in the northern hemisphere, <b>dinophysistoxins</b> (DTXs) and spirolides were present, but these toxins were not found in Argentinean waters. In the sediments of San Jorge Gulf of Argentina, cysts of the dinoflagellate species Alexandrium tamarense and Protoceratium reticulatum were found, and their respective toxins (PSTs and YTX) {{were associated with the}} planktonic samples from the same stations...|$|R
40|$|Planktonic Dinophysis spp. and epiphytic Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) Dodge {{are known}} dinoflagellate {{producers}} of okadaic acid (OA) and <b>dinophysistoxins</b> (DTX), causative phycotoxins of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Underestimation of toxic dinoflagellates {{associated with a}} toxic event {{may be due to}} the lack of sampling of species with epiphytic and epibenthic strategies, such as P. lima. As Dinophysis spp. is not found in the Fleet Lagoon, Dorset, but previous DSP events have closed the Crassostrea gigas oyster farm, P. lima is the most likely causative organism. A field assay for separating microalgal epiphytes and concentrating wild cells on to filters was successfully applied to sub-samples of a variety of macroalgae and macrophytes (seagrass) collected from the Fleet during summer 2002. P. lima was present in increasing cell densities on most substratum species, over the sampling period, from 102 to 103 cells g? 1 fresh weight (FW) plant biomass. LC–MS analysis detected OA and DTX- 1 in extracts of wild P. lima cells, in ratios characteristic of P. lima strains previously isolated from the Fleet. No toxins, however, were detected in oyster flesh...|$|R
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantitative analysis of lipophilic marine toxins in shellfish extracts (mussel, oyster, cockle and clam) was validated in-house using European Union (EU) Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC as a guideline. The validation included the toxins okadaic acid (OA), yessotoxin (YTX), azaspiracid- 1 (AZA 1), pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX 2) and 13 -desmethyl spirolide-C (SPX 1). Validation was performed at 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 times the current EU permitted levels, which are 160  µg kg- 1 for OA, AZA 1 and PTX 2 and 1, 000  µg kg- 1 for YTX. For SPX 1, 400  µg kg- 1 {{was chosen as}} the target level as no legislation has been established yet for this compound. The method was validated for determination in crude methanolic shellfish extracts and for extracts purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Extracts were also subjected to hydrolysis conditions to determine the performance of the method for OA and <b>dinophysistoxin</b> esters. The toxins were quantified against a set of matrix-matched standards instead of standard solutions in methanol. To save valuable standard, methanolic extract instead of the homogenate was spiked with the toxin standard. This was justified {{by the fact that the}} extraction efficiency is high for all relevant toxins (above 90 %). The method performed very well with respect to accuracy, intraday precision (repeatability), interday precision (within-laboratory reproducibility), linearity, decision limit, specificity and ruggedness. At the permitted level the accuracy ranged from 102 to 111 %, the repeatability from 2. 6 to 6. 7 % and the reproducibility from 4. 7 to 14. 2 % in crude methanolic extracts. The crude extracts performed less satisfactorily with respect to the linearity (less than 0. 990) and the change in LC-MS/MS sensitivity during the series (more than 25 %). SPE purification resulted in greatly improved linearity and signal stability during the series. Recently the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has suggested that to not exceed the acute reference dose the levels should be below 45  µg kg- 1 OA equivalents and 30  µg kg- 1 AZA 1 equivalents. A single-day validation was successfully conducted at these levels. If the regulatory levels are lowered towards the EFSA suggested values, the official methods prescribed in legislation (mouse and rat bioassay) will no longer be sensitive enough. The validated LC-MS/MS method presented has the potential to replace these animal tests...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{fine scale}} {{vertical}} distribution of Dinophysis spp. and Protoceratium reticulatum (potential producers of lipophilic shellfish toxins, LSTs) {{and its relation}} with LSTs in shellfish was studied in Reloncaví fjord, a strongly stratified system in Southern Chile. Samples were taken over two years from late spring to early autumn (2007 – 2008 period) and from early spring to late summer (2008 – 2009 period). Dinophysis spp., in particular Dinophysis acuminata, were always detected, often forming thin layers {{in the region of}} the salinity driven pycnocline, with cell maxima for D. acuminata of 28. 5 × 103 cells L- 1 in March 2008 and 17. 1 × 103 cells L- 1 in November 2008. During the 2008 – 2009 sampling period, blooms of D. acuminata co-occurred with high densities of cryptophyceans and the ciliate Mesodinium spp. The highest levels of pectenotoxin- 2 (PTX- 2; 2. 2 ng L- 1) were found in the plankton in February 2009, associated with moderate densities of D. acuminata, Dinophysis tripos and Dinophysis subcircularis (0. 1 – 0. 6 × 103 cells L- 1). However, only trace levels of PTX- 2 were observed in bivalves at that time. <b>Dinophysistoxin</b> (DTX- 1 and DTX- 3) levels in bivalves and densities of Dinophysis spp. were not well correlated. Low DTX levels in bivalves observed during a major bloom of D. acuminata in March 2008 suggested that there is a large seasonal intraspecific variability in toxin content of Dinophysis spp. driven by changes in population structure associated with distinct LST toxin profiles in Reloncaví fjord during the study period. A heterogeneous vertical distribution was also observed for P. reticulatum, whose presence was restricted to summer months. A bloom of this species of 2. 2 × 103 cells L- 1 at 14 m depth in February 2009 was positively correlated with high concentrations of yessotoxins in bivalves (51 – 496 ng g- 1) and plankton samples (3. 2 ng L- 1). Our results suggest that a review of monitoring strategies for Dinophysis spp. in strongly stratified fjord systems should be carried out. They also indicate that early warning of LST events based on Dinophysis cell numbers are not reliable for seafood control. This study was supported by FONDECYT(Chile) grant 1070706.

40|$|Coastal {{marine waters}} are {{experiencing}} significant environmental changes (e. g. increasing water temperature) that are influencing the dynamics and increased occurrence of harmful microalgal blooms (HABs) worldwide. Harmful blooms from benthic microalgae (e. g. dinoflagellates) are annually reported in some UK waters but {{little research has}} been conducted to date regarding the impact of a global warming scenario on their abundance and toxin production Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of increasing water temperature on the growth and toxin production of three toxigenic/benthic dinoflagellates isolated from the Fleet Lagoon, Dorset, UK. The harmful/epibenthic dinoflagellates Amphidinium car/erae, Prorocen/rum lima, and Coolia mono/is were isolated from the Fleet Lagoon and grown in clonal batch non axenic monocultures between 5 and 30 ºC using Guillards F/ 2 medium. Cultures were maintained at irradiances between 35 and 65 umol m• 2 S-I and under a 12 h L: 12 h D photoperiod. A single strain was used of each microalgal species and samples for cell abundance, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), inorganic nutrient concentration (nitrate, N 03 +N 02 and phosphate, P 04), chlorophy 11 a and toxin measurements were collected every few days over periods of up to 80 days. Toxins were detected and measured by LC-MS/MS from P lima samples while copepod and brine shrimp bioassays and haemolytic assays were used to estimate the potential toxicity of A. carterae and C. monotis. A. carterae cell growth rate produced a strong linear relationship (r 2 = 0. 97, p= 0. 001) with temperature, with higher growth rates (~= 0. 14 - 0. 55 d') at increasing growth temperatures ranging between 5 and 25 QC. Photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm values) increased with temperature from 5 to 25 QC but showed a strong decrease at 30 QC. A. carterae growth produced higher N 03 +N 02 and P 04 consumption at increasing temperatures resulting in P 04 limitation at temperatures between 15 - 25 QC. Toxin assays confirmed that A. carterae produced hemolysins causing deleterious effects on red blood cells and mortality in harpacticoid copepods. P lima cell growth rate was linearly related (r 2 = 0. 97, p= < 0. 00 I) to temperature between 5 QC (u= 0. 05 d-I) and 15 QC (u= 0. 17 d') with similar growth rates at 15 and 25 QC. Maximum Fv/ Fm values increased at higher temperatures, but {{there was a lack of}} coincidence between the highest Fv/Fm value (at 20 QC) and highest growth rate. N 03 +N 02 and P 04 uptake ratios showed that P Lima cells removed nutrients more efficiently at increasing temperatures, causing P 04 limitation at 20 - 30 QC. N 03 +N 02 and P 04 uptake in cultures, particularly P 04 depletion during the stationary growth phase, was linked with higher concentrations of the toxins okadaic acid (OA) and <b>dinophysistoxin</b> 1 (DTX I). Furthermore, toxin production was influenced by increasing growth temperatures, Total OA varied between 2. 0 - 10. 99 pg cell' while Total DTXl ranged between 0. 82 - 5. 96 pg cell" in P. Lima cells, with OA/DTXI ratios between 1. 7 and 2. 9. P. Lima was highly toxic to Artemia salina with toxins causing a rapid rate of mortality « 24 h). C. mono/is cells growth rates also increased linearly (u= 0. 003 to 0. 24 d"; r 2 = 0. 69, p= < 0. 001) with increasing growth temperatures between 5 and 20 QC. The highest Fv/Fm value was determined in C. mono/is cells at 15 QC and higher or lower temperatures caused a reduction of Fv/ Fm values. N 03 +N 02 and P 04 were substantially removed from culture flasks at increasing temperatures between 10 and 25 QC and P 04 limitation occurred at these temperatures towards the end of the stationary growth phase. Haemolytic compounds were detected in C. mono/is cells and bioassays confirmed a toxic effect of cell extracts on red blood cells. This study provides evidence that the toxigenic dinoflagellates A. carterae, C. mono/is, and P lima can tolerate and grow at a range of temperatures suggesting that increasing sea water temperatures will have a positive effect on the growth of these toxigenic/epibenthic dinoflagellates, particularly under N 03 +N 02 and P 04 replete conditions. Theses toxic dinoflagellates can therefore be considered a threat to the Fleet Lagoon which will become a particular problem as water temperatures increase.

40|$|Abstract: The {{illness of}} {{three people in}} 2011 after their {{ingestion}} of mussels collected from Sequim Bay State Park, Washington State, USA, demonstrated the need to monitor diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) in Washington State {{for the protection of}} human health. Following these cases of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, monitoring for DSTs in Washington State became formalized in 2012, guided by routine monitoring of Dinophysis species by the SoundToxins program in Puget Sound and the Olympic Region Harmful Algal Bloom (ORHAB) partnership on the outer Washington State coast. Here we show that the DSTs at concentrations above the guidance level of 16 μg okadaic acid (OA) + <b>dinophysistoxins</b> (DTXs) / 100 g shellfish tissue were widespread in sentinel mussels throughout Puget Sound in summer 2012 and included harvest closures of California mussel, varnish clam, manila clam and Pacific oyster. Concentrations of toxins in Pacific oyster and manila clam were often at least half those measured in blue mussels at the same site. The primary toxin isomer in shellfish and plankton samples was dinophysistoxin- 1 (DTX- 1) with D. acuminata as th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{determination}} of toxin profile of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected in November-December 2003 along the Emilia Romagna coasts (Italy) when {{a high concentration of}} Alexandrium ostenfeldii cells was detected in sea water. Detailed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses were performed on the crude extracts in both selected ion monitoring (SIM) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) modes. They revealed that M. galloprovincialis had accumulated the three major spirolides produced by the alga, namely 13 -desMethyl spirolide C, 13, 19 -didesMethyl spirolide C and 27 -hydroxy- 13, 19 -didesMethyl spirolide C, which fully accounted for toxicity of lipophilic extracts shown in mouse bioassay. Interestingly, yessotoxin (YTX) and its analogues were still present in mussel polar extracts but YTX itself was not the major toxin contained in mussels. The presence of pectenotoxin- 2 seco acid (PTX- 2 sa) and its putative epimer was also assessed. The presence of azaspiracids, never reported from the Adriatic sea, as well as of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins (okadaic acid, <b>dinophysistoxins</b> and OA esters) and domoic acid, long known as contaminants of Adriatic mussels, was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|A new LC-MS/MS {{method for}} the {{separation}} and detection {{of the most}} prominent marine lipophilic toxin groups comprising okadaic acid, <b>dinophysistoxins,</b> yessotoxins, azaspiracids, pectenotoxins, spirolides and some okadaic acid fatty acid esters has been developed. With this method 28 different marine lipophilic biotoxins can be analysed in a single run. Separation was achieved with an acetonitrile/water gradient containing ammonium hydroxide (pH 11). All toxins were stable under these basic conditions. Compared to chromatography using an acidic gradient, the limit of detection (LODs) for okadaic acid, yessotoxin, gymnodimine and 13 -desmethyl spirolide C were improved two- to three-fold, mainly due to better peak shapes. The azaspiracids and pectenotoxins- 2 showed comparable LODs under acidic and basic conditions. A major advantage of the developed method is that toxins can be clustered in retention time windows separated for positively and negatively ionized molecular ions. Therefore, {{there is no need for}} rapid polarity switching or two separate runs for one sample. The new method showed good repeatability and reproducibility and is an important step in the development of alternatives to the animal tests currently in use for shellfish toxin analysis. © 2009 Elsevier B.
