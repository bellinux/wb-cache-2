5|$|Brotherhood {{is set on}} the Earth-like {{world of}} Eos, {{occurring}} within the events of Final Fantasy XV. The kingdom of Lucis, keeper of the world's last surviving magical crystal, has been {{at war with the}} technologically-advanced empire of Niflheim, the latter dominating much of the known world. After many years of war, a peace is agreed between Lucis and Niflheim. As part of the peace agreements, Noctis Lucis Caelumson of the reigning King Regis and heir to the Lucian throneis to marry Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, former princess of Tenebrae and now hostage of Niflheim. Noctis sets off to marry Lunafreya in the company of his loyal companions and friends: <b>Gladiolus</b> Amicitia, Prompto Argentum, and Ignis Scientia. On their journey, Niflheim betrays and invades Lucis, stealing the crystal and killing Regis, leaving Noctis to go on a quest to reclaim his throne and defeat Niflheim.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Gladiolus</b> {{reaches the}} inner sanctum, he {{must go on}} alone and face Gilgamesh in combat. Gilgamesh {{challenges}} him once again, repeating Cor's warning {{that he may be}} risking his life for nothing. The two fight and <b>Gladiolus</b> emerges victorious, but not before Gilgamesh scars him. Gilgamesh reveals that there is no ultimate power, but reminds <b>Gladiolus</b> that he must have been a capable warrior to defeat him and so should be reassured of his ability to defend Noctis. He offers <b>Gladiolus</b> his favourite sword, which is revealed to have been Cor's. <b>Gladiolus</b> and Cor leave the Tempering Grounds, with <b>Gladiolus</b> planning to reunite with the party while reflecting on the experience.|$|E

25|$|Disturbed at {{how easily}} {{the party is}} {{defeated}} in combat by Ravus, <b>Gladiolus</b> begins to question his ability to protect Noctis {{in his role as}} the King's Shield. Seeking the means to acquire greater power, he calls upon Cor Leonis to accompany him to the Tempering Grounds, a network of millennia-old caverns where generations of Crownsguard soldiers have sought to prove their strength against Gilgamesh, the Blademaster. Cor agrees, but warns <b>Gladiolus</b> that by venturing into the caverns he faces certain death and that even if he survives, he may have nothing to show for it.|$|E
25|$|As <b>Gladiolus</b> and Cor {{enter the}} caverns, the disembodied voice of Gilgamesh taunts {{them while they}} {{encounter}} the bodies of fallen soldiers reanimated by their souls. Cor reveals that the souls swore fealty to Gilgamesh in both life and death, and that the souls of fallen soldiers remain trapped the caverns. <b>Gladiolus</b> passes each of Gilgamesh's trials and gradually learns more about Cor's previous expedition to the Tempering Grounds thirty years ago. Headstrong, reckless and arrogant, Cor confronted Gilgamesh in his inner sanctum, but fell from the cliffs into the waters below without defeating him. When he returned from the Tempering Ground he was dubbed 'The Immortal'.|$|E
25|$|In a mid-credits flashback, Noctis tells <b>Gladiolus,</b> Ignis and Prompto {{how much}} they mean to him during their last camp together. In a post-credits scene, Noctis and Lunafreya reunite in the afterlife, as a new dawn rises over Eos.|$|E
25|$|From an {{economic}} point of view, the order Asparagales {{is second in}} importance within the monocots to the order Poales (which includes grasses and cereals). Species are used as food and flavourings (e.g. onion, garlic, leek, asparagus, vanilla), as cut flowers (e.g. freesia, <b>gladiolus,</b> iris, orchids), and as garden ornamentals (e.g. day lilies, lily of the valley, Agapanthus).|$|E
25|$|Flower {{cultivation}} {{has gained}} importance in recent years. <b>Gladiolus,</b> lily, and chrysanthemum are grown in winter; and ginger lily and lotus flower in summer. Peach blossom is grown {{especially for the}} Lunar New Year. A wide range of fruit is grown on the lower hill slopes, the main types being lychee, longan, wampei, local lemon, orange, tangerine, guava, papaya and banana.|$|E
25|$|Brackens {{substitute}} {{the characteristics}} of a woodland canopy, and are important for giving shade to European plants such as common bluebell and wood anemone, where the woodland does not exist. These plants are intolerant to stock trampling. Dead bracken provides a warm microclimate for development of the immature stages. Climbing corydalis, wild <b>gladiolus</b> and chickweed wintergreen also seem to benefit from the conditions found under bracken stands.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 William Brown, a {{professor}} of agriculture and then superintendent of the experimental farm at Guelph, Ontario, was granted permission {{by the government of}} Ontario to purchase Aberdeen Angus cattle for the Ontario Agricultural College. The herd comprised a yearling bull, <b>Gladiolus,</b> and a cow, Eyebright, bred by the Earl of Fife and a cow, Leochel Lass 4th, bred by R.O. Farquharson. On January 12, 1877, Eyebright gave birth to a calf, sired by Sir Wilfrid. It was the first to be born outside of Scotland. The OAC went on to import additional bulls and cows, eventually began selling Aberdeen Angus cattle in 1881.|$|E
25|$|The body, or <b>gladiolus,</b> is {{the longest}} part. It is flat and {{considered}} to have only a front and back surface. It is flat on the front, directed upward and forward, and marked by three transverse ridges which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth, and fifth articular depressions. The pectoralis major attaches to it on either side. At the junction of {{the third and fourth}} parts of the body is occasionally seen an orifice, the sternal foramen, of varying size and form. The posterior surface, slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines, less distinct, however, than those in front; from its lower part, on either side, the transversus thoracis takes origin.|$|E
25|$|Following the Oslo Accords and the {{tensions}} between the Jewish and Palestinian civilian populations in the Palestinian Territories, three combat companies were founded in the military police, which kept the order in the Jewish settlements. Sahlav (lit. orchid, a.k.a. 60th MP Company) and Sayfan (lit. <b>gladiolus),</b> which were subordinate to the central command unit (391), were located in the Hebron area and the Binyamin area, respectively. The third company, Sirpad (lit. nettle), was founded {{on the principle of}} the first two, and was subordinate to the southern command unit (392). It was located in the Gaza Division's base, but later relocated to Nisanit (Gaza Strip), after a merged with Military Police Erez.|$|E
25|$|Noctis' companions, while {{controlled}} by the game's artificial intelligence, can perform contextual commands. When Noctis successfully parries an enemy attack, or performs a Side Strike or Blindside, cooperative attacks {{between him and his}} companions called Link-strikes can be triggered. During battle, a meter called the Tech Bar fills. When full, Noctis can command his companions to perform special moves called Techniques: <b>Gladiolus</b> performs a sweeping attack with his sword, Ignis uses his daggers to mark enemies so Noctis can perform a warp strike attack, and Prompto uses his firearm to launch a flare that distracts enemies and damages Daemons. After each of these, Noctis can initiate a follow-up attack. Noctis can also trigger an Armiger Chain, where he splits his Royal Arms between his companions before launching a single attack.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} North-West University Botanical Garden spans {{less than three}} {{hectares}} more than a 1500 plant species can be found here. Most plants in the Botanical Garden are indigenous to South Africa {{with the exception of}} a few exotic plants which are kept for research or educational value. A large section of the garden, around a man-made ridge, is managed as a natural wooded grassland area. A variety of theme gardens make up the rest of the Botanical Garden, including the swamp garden, vlei garden, contemporary indigenous garden, vegetable and herb garden, invader display, plant evolution garden and succulent rockery. Some more common plant genera represented in the garden include Acacia, Aloe, Bonatea, Crinum, Dierama, Encephalartos, Eucomis, Eulophia, Euphorbia, Gasteria, <b>Gladiolus,</b> Haworthia, Hypoxis, Indigofera, Kniphofia, Plectranthus, Podocarpus, Polygala, Scadoxus, Searsia, Stapelia and Zantedeschia.|$|E
25|$|The story {{revolves}} around {{a conflict between}} Lucis, the last free kingdom in the world, and the expansionist empire of Niflheim. The main protagonist is Noctis Lucis Caelum, sole {{heir to the throne}} of Lucis. On his journey, he is accompanied by three companions: <b>Gladiolus</b> Amicitia, a brother-figure from a noble family sworn to Noctis's protection; Ignis Scientia, Noctis's strategist; and Prompto Argentum, a friend of Noctis from a lower-class family. A key character is Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, Noctis's fiancée through an arranged marriage. Other characters include Noctis's father Regis, the king of Lucis; Cor Leonis, a famous warrior of Lucis; Gentiana, Lunafreya's companion and attendant; Cindy, who with her grandfather Cid acts as mechanic for Noctis' car; and Iris, Gladiolus's sister. Characters from Niflheim serve as the game's main antagonists, including emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, his chancellor Ardyn Izunia, Lunafreya's brother Ravus Nox Fleuret, and mercenary dragoon Aranea Highwind.|$|E
25|$|A {{major element}} of Prompto's {{character}} is his humble origins {{when compared to}} <b>Gladiolus</b> and Ignis, expressing this in his words and actions. Prompto's facial features and hairstyle underwent multiple redesigns, the more recent ones based on negative feedback from fans, {{so that he would}} have international appeal. As {{with the rest of the}} party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family. The character was initially unpopular with series fans, so the team designed Prompto's photography hobby—and its subsequent gameplay and story interactions—as a way of making him useful and enabling each player to chronicle their journey through the game. Tabata later defined Prompto's camera as a manifestation of Prompto's wish to record Noctis and Lunafreya's journey. Prompto proved to be the starting point for Brotherhood, as producer Akio Ofuji conceived the series based around wanting to expand upon a backstory created by staff surrounding his difficult childhood. For Prompto's English performance, Inoue based him on the titular protagonist of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Noctis Lucis Caelum, {{the crown prince}} of Lucis and the sole playable character who lost his father in the Niflheim invasion, and his fiancée Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, an Oracle and a former princess of Tenebrae. Noctis is accompanied on his journey by three others: <b>Gladiolus</b> Amicitia, Noctis’ bodyguard; Ignis Scientia, a prodigy military tactician and Noctis’ advisor; and Prompto Argentum, a friend of Noctis from a lower social class. Guest characters include Cor Leonis, a legendary warrior of Lucis who acts as a guardian to Noctis’ party, and Iris Amicitia, Gladiolus’ sister. Other key characters are Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII, king of Lucis and Noctis’ father, Gentiana, Lunafreya's attendant; and Cid Sophiar and his granddaughter Cindy Aurum, mechanics who maintain the party's car. The empire of Niflheim is ruled by Emperor Iedolas Aldercapt. Aldercapt's allies include Ardyn Izunia, the imperial chancellor and the game's main antagonist; Ravus Nox Fleuret, Lunafreya's brother and the high commander of the imperial army; Verstael Besithia, the empire's head researcher; and Aranea Highwind, a mercenary dragoon in service to Niflheim.|$|E
25|$|In Lucis, Noctis and {{his friends}} <b>Gladiolus,</b> Ignis, and Prompto are en route to Accordo's capital city of Altissia, where Noctis’ wedding to Lunafreya is to take place. Along the way, they receive news of the empire's attack on Insomnia and theft of the Crystal, and that Noctis’ father King Regis has been assassinated. They meet up with Crownsguard {{commander}} Cor Leonis, who tasks Noctis with retrieving the weapons of the Lucii—the ancient kings of Lucis—in order to rescue the Crystal and reclaim his throne. The party also comes across Niflheim's chancellor Ardyn Izunia, who guides them to the Astral Titan at the Disc of Cauthess. After he fulfills Titan's trial and fights off imperial forces attacking the Astral, Noctis learns that Lunafreya persuaded Titan to lend him his power. They continue to travel across Lucis, retrieving Noctis’ ancestral relics and meeting the Astral Ramuh with assistance from Gentiana, Lunafreya's spirit attendant. Over {{the course of their}} journey, they discover days are steadily growing shorter, accompanied by the Daemons increasing in number. These phenomena are part of the Starscourge, which if left unchecked, will see Eos plunged into eternal darkness and overrun by Daemons.|$|E
25|$|The party {{eventually}} {{arrives in}} Altissia, where Lunafreya {{has taken up}} sanctuary. Lunafreya awakens the Astral Leviathan so Noctis can obtain her power, only for Leviathan {{to go on a}} rampage when Niflheim attacks. Ardyn reveals his true colors by mortally wounding Lunafreya, disrupting the ritual; however, she succeeds in awakening Noctis’ powers, allowing him to defeat Leviathan. While unconscious, he is visited in a dream by Lunafreya's spirit, who gives him the Ring of the Lucii. Noctis wakes to find Altissia in chaos, and that Ignis was blinded during the battle. The party continues towards Niflheim's capital of Gralea by train, while Ignis' blindness and Noctis’ prolonged mourning of Lunafreya cause friction between Noctis and <b>Gladiolus</b> until Ignis forces a reconciliation. Ardyn tricks Noctis into throwing Prompto from the train, and holds Prompto and the Crystal captive in Gralea's main fortress, revealing that the Crystal's power can destroy the Daemons. Noctis continues to Graleareceiving the Astral Shiva's blessing from Gentiana, who reveals herself to be Shiva's human formwhere the party finds that it has been overrun by Ardyn's Daemons. Noctis’ powers are suppressed, forcing him to don the Ring of the Lucii. After rescuing Prompto, who is revealed to be from Niflheim, the party continues to fight their way through the fortress, encountering Lunafreya's brother Ravus and Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, who have been transformed into Daemons by Ardyn.|$|E
500|$|The planned DLC {{included}} a weapon pack, three story episodes that make Noctis' companions playable, and was termed an [...] "Online Expansion Pack". The latter is an expansion that allows online multiplayer battles {{with up to}} four players. Titled [...] "Comrades", it takes place the ten-year gap in the game's narrative, focusing on player-created members of the Kingsglaive combating powerful monsters. With the release of [...] "Comrades", Final Fantasy XV became the first mainline Final Fantasy game to feature multiplayer content. [...] "Episode Gladiolus" [...] released on March 28, 2017; featuring <b>Gladiolus</b> as a playable character, the scenario also featured recurring Final Fantasy character Gilgamesh. Following his defeat by Ravus Nox Fleuret, <b>Gladiolus</b> leaves the party to grow his strength under Cor Leonis' guidance while challenging Gilgamesh. [...] "Episode Prompto" [...] was released on June 27; featuring Prompto as a playable character and taking place during a late-game narrative gap while Prompto left the party, the gameplay shifts towards third-person shooting and stealth-based mechanics. [...] "Episode Ignis", planned for release in December 2017, was originally planned {{to be the last}} installment of the game's post-release DLC. Due to popular demand, the team decided to extend DLC support into 2018, focusing on content to expand character stories and the world's lore.|$|E
500|$|Suzuki {{acted as}} main {{composer}} for the game's story-based downloadable content (DLC). Keiichi Okabe, the composer for , was brought on {{to help with}} the DLC episode [...] "Episode Gladiolus". He worked on the theme song [...] "Shield of the King" [...] and an arrangement of [...] "Battle at the Big Bridge", a battle theme associated with recurring character Gilgamesh. When writing [...] "Shield of the King", Okabe wanted to portray the burden of responsibility and fate <b>Gladiolus</b> bore, which he compared to the burden of character 2B in Nier: Automata. [...] "Battle at the Big Bridge" [...] was initially going to have minimal work done due to its favored place among fans of the Final Fantasy series, but with encouragement from game staff Okabe arranged the track within his own musical style. To accomplish this, Okabe incorporated vocal elements similar to those used in Nier: Automata.|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of XV, [...] "Stand by Me" [...] was not {{intended}} as a love song, {{but rather as a}} message or prayer of gratitude from Noctis to all who had supported him on his journey, including Lunafreya, his father Regis and his three companions <b>Gladiolus</b> Amicitia, Ignis Scientia and Prompto Argentum. [...] Welch's contribution is notable as Final Fantasy theme songs have traditionally been performed by Asian singers, with the exception of XIII which had the Leona Lewis single [...] "My Hands" [...] substituted for [...] "Kimi ga Iru Kara" [...] in its English release. In addition to the cover for [...] "Stand by Me", Florence and the Machine created two original songs inspired by the world and story of XV, also sung by Welch: [...] "Too Much Is Never Enough" [...] and [...] "I Will Be". Not all of the theme songs were used in the base game, with some coming in future content.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{the eldest}} son of a noble family pledged to the {{protection}} of the Lucian royal family. While he acts as Noctis's guardian as tradition demands, his bond with Noctis is more akin to that between brothers. During their youth, <b>Gladiolus</b> disliked Noctis due to the latter's cold attitude, but warmed to him when Noctis kept Gladiolus' sister Iris out of trouble. During the course of the story, <b>Gladiolus</b> serves as both Noctis' most loyal companion and a foil for his impulsive nature. He is briefly demoralized when he is easily defeated by Ravus, and during the events of Episode <b>Gladiolus</b> proves himself to the first King's Shield Gilgamesh and regains his faith in his role as Noctis' King's Shield. The events at Altissia and Ignis' injury drive a brief wedge between <b>Gladiolus</b> and Noctis until Ignis forces a reconciliation. <b>Gladiolus</b> and Ignis later make their way through the Niflheim fortress Zegnautus Keep after being separated from Noctis, encountering the Daemon form of Emperor Aldercapt and seeing footage of Ravus' death. <b>Gladiolus,</b> along with Noctis' other companions, become Daemon Hunters until his return, and accompanies him to the final battle against Ardyn.|$|E

2500|$|... is a guest {{character}} in XV. The younger sister of <b>Gladiolus</b> and {{a childhood friend}} of Noctis and Ignis, she escaped Insomnia during Niflheim's invasion, taking refuge in Lestallum. Iris is depicted as having a carefree attitude and is close to {{all four of the}} party members; particularly Noctis, whom she has a crush on. While <b>Gladiolus</b> is very protective of her, he acknowledges that she is capable of taking care of herself. Following Ardyn's conquest of the world and Eos' descent into eternal night, Iris becomes {{one of the most notorious}} Daemon hunters in the world, being dubbed [...] "the Daemon Slayer".|$|E
2500|$|The Flower-class {{corvette}} [...] (also {{referred to}} as the <b>Gladiolus</b> class after the lead ship) was a British class of 267 corvettes used during World War II, specifically with the Allied navies as anti-submarine convoy escorts during the Battle of the Atlantic. Royal Navy ships of this class were named after flowers, hence the name of the class.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Gladiolus,</b> plural Gladioli, {{was one of}} Van Gogh's {{favorite}} flower. [...] He especially enjoyed {{how they}} opened up like a fan after having been placed in a vase. Because of their height, Van Gogh liked to use Gladioli to create triangular-structured compositions, such as Vase with Gladioli and Carnation (F237) or an inverted triangle as in Vase with Gladioli and China Asters (F248a).|$|E
2500|$|Dame Edna Everage is a {{character}} created and performed by Australian comedian Barry Humphries, famous for her lilac-coloured or [...] "wisteria hue" [...] hair and cat eye glasses or [...] "face furniture", her favourite flower, the <b>gladiolus</b> ("gladdies") and her boisterous greeting: [...] "Hello, Possums!" [...] As Dame Edna, Humphries has written several books including an autobiography, My Gorgeous Life, appeared in several films and hosted several television shows (on which Humphries has also appeared as himself and other alter-egos).|$|E
2500|$|... {{known as}} , is a guest {{character}} in XV. The Marshal of the Crownsguard and a famous warrior of Lucis, he follows {{the party in}} order to protect the prince and his group, occasionally joining them in battle. He fought alongside King Regis against the forces of Niflheim in his youth. While Cor initially assists the party by organising the search for tombs holding the Royal Arms, he is later referred to as suspending the search to assist the hunters in dealing with particularly difficult Daemons. He admits to Noctis that he struggles to deal with his failure to protect King Regis, and is last seen sitting alone. In Episode <b>Gladiolus,</b> it is revealed that he was the sole human to fight Gilgamesh and escape with his life, which earned him his moniker.|$|E
2500|$|... {{is a man}} raised {{alongside}} Noctis to be his advisor. Provided with {{an extensive}} education, he developed a collected composure and tactical instinct. Ignis acts as Noctis' confidant and helper, forming a deep connection to Noctis during their youth when Noctis begins realizing his eventual fate of becoming Lucis' king. Ignis ends up severely wounded during the Covenant ceremony with Leviathan; while most of his injuries heal, he is left permanently blind. His blindness causes tension within the group until he forces a reconciliation. [...] Ignis and <b>Gladiolus</b> later make {{their way through the}} Niflheim fortress Zegnautus Keep after being separated from Noctis, encountering the Daemon form of Emperor Aldercapt and seeing footage of Ravus' death. Ignis, along with Noctis' other companions, become Daemon Hunters until his return, and accompanies him to the final battle against Ardyn.|$|E
2500|$|Noctis Lucis Caelum is {{the only}} son and heir of King Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII of Lucis; the Caelum dynasty {{safeguards}} the Crystal, a divine artifact connected to the world's deities. When he was five years old, Noctis was chosen by the Crystal as the [...] "True King", a figure who would use the Crystal's power to purge the Starscourge, a plague that will trigger eternal darkness on Eos and turns living things into monstrous Daemons. At eight years old, Noctis is attacked by a Daemon and {{is sent to the}} nation of Tenebrae for healing, where he meets and bonds with the nation's princess Lunafreya Nox Fleuret. However, Noctis and Regis are forced to flee Tenebrae when it is attacked by the Niflheim Empire. By the events of Final Fantasy XV, Lucis is under siege from Niflheim, and Regis agrees to a ceasefire. As part of the treaty, Noctis is to marry Lunafreya, and Regis dispatches him to Altissia where they are to be married. Following Noctis' departure, Niflheim attacks Lucis' capital Insomnia, steals the Crystal and kills Regis. Noctis—together with his three companions and sworn protectors <b>Gladiolus</b> Amicitia, Prompto Argentum and Ignis Scientia—sets out on a quest to retrieve the Crystal and defeat Niflheim.|$|E
2500|$|Final Fantasy XV {{is an open}} world action {{role-playing}} {{game where}} players take control of main protagonist Noctis during his journey across the world of Eos. While accompanied by his three companions <b>Gladiolus,</b> Ignis and Prompto, Noctis is the only character directly controlled by the player: he can navigate through simple movement, jump over small obstacles, sprint for a limited time, and perform context-based actions such as taking cover behind objects. The kingdom of Lucis is a large connected landmass that can be explored on foot, by using the party's car [...] "Regalia", or chocobos, recurring galliform birds in the Final Fantasy series. Both the Regalia and chosen Chocobos can be customised by the player, and Chocobos can join in battles if their connection to the characters is strong enough. While Chocobos are controlled manually, the Regalia can be either manually or automatically controlled. The party can also fast-travel to areas unlocked on the world map. The Regalia must be refueled periodically at petrol stations. In towns the party can visit, there are inns and hotels where they can stay, shops where items and equipment can be purchased with the in-game currency gil, and local tipsters, non-playable characters (NPCs) who provide information on quests, from main story missions to side quests. Side quests are also available from individual NPCs found in towns. During some story sequences, dialogue choices appear for Noctis, with the selected option altering the response from NPCs. The game also contains two difficulty modes, Easy and Normal, with players being able to switch between the two. In Easy mode, the summon Carbuncle will appear once per battle to revive Noctis when he is defeated.|$|E
