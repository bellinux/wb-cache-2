Methodology: Ordinary conditions (control conditions) were compared with four types of modified atmosphere packaging: (N 270 %+ CO 230 %), (N 230 % + CO 270 %), (45 %CO 2 + 45 %N 2 + 10 %O 2), and vacuum conditions. Samples of quail meat were packaged in <b>flexible</b> multilayer <b>pouches</b> under modified atmosphere packaging, 3 -layer (PET(12) /AL(12) /LLD(100)), 4 -layer (PET(12) /AL(7) /PET(12) /LLD(100)), and 3 -layer (PET(12) /AL(7) /LLD(100)), in different times during 16 days, with 15 treatment, 3 run. Statistical analysis and comparison of data, were done by software SPSS (Ver: 22) and Duncan’s new multiple range test, with confidence level of 95 % (P < 0. 05). Results: Packed samples were performed chemical test (pH test). The changes of pH in fresh samples were not acceptable under % 30 CO 2 and also vacuum conditions in these containers. However, the best conditions belonged to CO 2 70 %, and then CO 2 45 %, that were acceptable. Packed samples in 4 -layer under gas combination CO 2 70 % had best results. Conclusion: Protection­ of these meats in 4 -layer container was better than 3 -layer container because the steam permeability of 4 -layer was lower than 3 -layer and also increasing CO 2 could not adversely effect on pH,and postponed the pH changes and preserving quail meat till 16 days...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteJames L. MarsdenConsumers {{demand for}} high quality, natural and fresh tasting food, free from {{preservatives}} and additives, {{with a clean}} label and an extended shelf life has increased. High pressure processing (HPP), also known as high hydrostatic pressure, is a non-thermal food preservation technique {{that has the potential}} to meet these demands. It is an opportunity to preserve food, by applying intensive pressure in the range of 300 - 900 MPa, without adversely affecting organoleptic, textural and nutritional qualities as thermal processing like pasteurization and sterilization may do. In a typical high pressure batch cycle, the food prepackaged in a high-barrier <b>flexible</b> <b>pouch</b> or a plastic container is loaded into a perforated basket that goes into the pressure vessel; the pressure is then increased to the processing target pressure (come-up time); the product is held at the desired pressure for 3 to 10 minutes (pressure holding time); after which the pressure is released in usually few seconds (decompression time) and the product can be unloaded at this point. The pressure is applied uniformly in all directions simultaneously and this is known as isostatic pressure. Pressurization is usually accompanied by a moderate and uniform temperature increase called adiabatic heating. However, the food product usually rapidly returns to its initial temperature at decompression. With the recent shift in consumer lifestyle toward healthy living and healthier food, the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables has increased in popularity. However, as per the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, fruits and vegetables have recently been associated with multiple foodborne disease outbreaks; the effect of high pressure processing on microbial safety, quality and sensory characteristics of fruits and vegetables has therefore been widely investigated as an alternative to traditional food processing and preservation methods. HPP inactivates microorganisms and quality-deteriorating enzymes and has limited effects on covalent bonds resulting in minimal modifications of food-quality attributes such as color, flavor and nutritional values. However, depending on the fruit or vegetable, high pressure could induce chemical or biochemical reactions that can affect their quality attributes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an innovative thermal and humidity control system for future space suits. The system comprises an evaporation cooling and dehumidification garment (ECDG) and a lithium chloride absorber radiator (LCAR). The ECDG absorbs heat and water vapor from inside the suit pressure garment, while the LCAR rejects heat to space without venting water vapor. The ECDG is built from thin, flexible patches with coversheets made of non-porous, water-permeable membranes that -enclose arrays of vapor flow passages. Water vapor from inside the spacesuit diffuses across the water permeable membranes, enters the vapor flow channels, and then flows to the LCAR, thus dehumidifying the internal volume of the space suit pressure garment. Additional water evaporation inside the ECDG provides cooling for sensible heat loads. -The heat released from condensation and absorption in the LCAR is rejected to the environment by thermal radiation. We have assembled lightweight and <b>flexible</b> ECDG <b>pouches</b> from prototypical materials and measured their performance {{in a series of}} separate effects tests under well-controlled, prototypical conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Deboned, {{skinless}} {{white and}} dark meat from fowl was pretreated by overnight soaking at 3 C in either deionized water, 2 % sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, 3 % Kena solution (sodium polyphosphate), or 2 % NaCl plus 3 % Kena solution. Meat was subsequently water cooked 90 min at 92 C: then diced and batched with ground cooked skin, fat, and broth. Ingredients were packaged and sealed in <b>flexible</b> retortable <b>pouches</b> and retorted at 121 C (250 F). Finished prod-ucts were evaluated for proximate composition, mineral content, and sensory properties. Presoaking the meat in water or 2 % NaCl {{had little effect}} on product composition or sensory properties after retorting. Soaking in Kena, with or without NaCl, increased moisture, decreased percentage protein, and increased ash. Kena plus NaCl had significantly higher Na and CI contents than all other treatments. Finished products made from meat presoaked in Kena, with or without NaCl, were lighter in color, more tender, and less off-flavored than products presoaked in water or 2 % NaCl only. Product made from Kena plus NaCl differed significantly from product made from Kena alone in higher initial juiciness, increased perception of seasoning, and higher Na and CI contents; however, {{there were no significant differences}} in other parameters. The value of increased juiciness and seasoning perceived versus the value of increased Na content would need to be con-sidered in making a recommendation on the use of polyphosphates with or without NaCl to improve fowl meat products. If dietary sodium content is a concern, small differences in quality may be negated by increased sodium content resulting from treatment with polyphosphates plu...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is a multidisciplinary field that develops biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or improve damaged tissues. Biodegradable tissue engineering applications are often complex composite structures that combine a biodegradable medical device with biological factors. Materials used in tissue engineering applications are sensitive and cannot withstand high temperatures, humidity, irradiation, and/or chemicals. These qualities pose special challenges to sterilization process and packaging design. The heavy regulations {{that apply to}} tissue engineering products affect the packaging solution from choosing the sterilization method to the design and testing of the final package. This thesis is a literature review. The scope of this thesis was to examine suitable packaging solutions for biodegradable tissue engineering products. For background, the current relevant legislation and regulations in the European Union and in the United States were reviewed, and different aspects of packaging of medical devices were discussed. Also several sterilization methods, as well as aseptic processing were reviewed, and multiple packaging solutions that are or could be suitable for sterile biodegradable implantable medical devices were presented. Due to the diverse nature of biodegradable tissue engineering products, {{it is impossible to}} suggest one universal packaging solution. Some general guidelines, however, can be suggested based on the common features of biodegradable tissue engineering products, usability studies, and sustainability considerations.

40|$|Most {{packaged}} food products deteriorate in quality due to mass transfer phenomena such as moisture absorption, oxygen invasion, flavor loss, undesirable odor absorption and packaging material migration. An approach {{to increase the}} shelf life of the {{packaged food}}, while exploiting the advantages of flexible packaging, is to use flexible multi-layer polyethylene (PE) -based films including a barrier layer.

40|$|Shelf life of reconstituted {{orange juice}} after {{conventional}} thermal (80 degreesC, 30 s) or high hydrostatic pressure (500 M Pa, 35 degreesC, 5 min) pasteurisation was comparatively studied. Polypropylene bottles and laminated <b>flexible</b> <b>pouches</b> were used. Ascorbic acid loss, colour, viscosity and sensory characteristics were measured during storage at 0 - 15 degreesC. Ascorbic acid degradation rates were lower for high pressurised juice, {{leading to an}} extension of its shelf life compared to conventionally pasteurised juice. Kinetic modelling established a higher temperature dependence of ascorbic acid loss for high pressurised juice as expressed by activation energy values (61. 1 and 43. 8 kJ/mol respectively for high pressurised and thermally treated bottled juice). Based on ascorbic acid retention, the increase of shelf life of high pressurised juice stored in bottles compared to thermally pasteurised one ranged from 11 % (storage at 15 degreesC) to 65 % (storage at 0 degreesC). Respective values of shelf life increase for juices in pouches were 24 % and 57 %. Colour was not substantially affected by type of processing. Higher viscosity values were determined for high pressurised juice, while its sensory characteristics were judged superior. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{successful}} innovation of the 2010s thus far has been the Stand Up Pouch, which is {{a special kind of}} retort pouch that features a bottom gusset, making it able to stand upright. Stand Up Pouches are mostly used for human alimentation products, but also for pet food as well as beauty care products. In the Brazilian market, Stand Up Pouches constantly have been managing to fit into new market niches. While showing immense growth (CAGR of 6,1% in volume and 5,8% in value between 2011 and 2014), the distribution of Stand Up Pouches in Brazil yet lags behind the Chilean and the U.S. market, which is {{due to a lack of}} supply of scale of important components like resealable zippers and nylon, causing the price for the production of Stand Up Pouches to be higher than in comparable markets. Among the ten fastest growing <b>flexibles,</b> Stand Up <b>Pouches</b> rank third with regard to CAGR in volume and fourth as regards CAGR in value.There are two common types of processes of filling Stand Up Pouches, namely vertical form fill seal (VFFS) and fill-seal (FS). Whereas the former uses rolls of film of the packaging material and complex machines that shape the pouch in its typical form before filling and eventually sealing it, the latter process uses pre-formed pouches as well as two separate machines for filling and sealing the pouch, respectively. Because of the trade-off of having a high initial investment but low operational costs, VFFS is more of a long-run rather than short-run option and useful for the production of large quantities. However, as the FS process is more decentralized than the VFFS process and does not rely on one extensive machine, the chance of suffering from long downtimes for maintenance is significantly lower with FS, since failures in single production processes can be fixed more easily.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pressure-assisted thermal {{processing}} (PATP) is {{an advanced}} thermal process involving applica-tion of elevated pressures above 600 MPa on a preheated {{food for a}} holding time of 3 to 5 min, causing the volumetric temperature of food to increase above 100 C, to inactivate bacterial spores and enzymes. This study evaluated the influence of PATP on two state-of-the-art multilayer EVOH films. <b>Flexible</b> <b>pouches</b> containing water as the food simu-lant were made from the two films and processed at 680 MPa for 3 min at 105 C and 680 MPa for 5 min at 100 C. Each film was investigated for its oxygen transmission rates (OTRs), melting temperature (Tm), enthalpy of melting (DH), and overall crystallinity before (control) and after processing. The changes in OTRs and total DH of the two films were also analyzed during a storage period of 240 days in ambient conditions after processing. Results showed a significant (P 0. 05) change in the Tm and DH of the two films. The overall crystallinity of film A decreased, but improved slightly for film B after PATP. A recovery in the OTRs of the two films occurred during storage.

40|$|Flexible {{packaging}} is {{a growing}} successful market {{and the majority of}} flexible package applications are for the food industry. The demand for process optimization and reduced production costs, has led to an increase in flexible packaging. However, fast production lines can result in contamination in the seal area. For flexible food packaging, contamination is considered any food particle or substance trapped in the seal area. Current quality control processes can detect contamination in the seal area, but it is not determined if seal contamination affects seal quality. Oil-based and sodium based snack foods are two common categories that can be packaged on a horizontal form fill and seal (HFFS) flow-wrap machine. The study uses vegetable oil and a salt water solution to simulate the effect of liquid contamination along the T-point of <b>flexible</b> <b>pouches</b> made on an HFFS. The T-point refers to where the fin seal meets the end seal and requires the seal jaw to seal through four layers of film, which is the most difficult point to seal. The study tests a combination of different sealing temperatures and dwell time to determine the optimal sealing condition for a hermetic seal. A quality hermetic seal provides an enclosed seal with no leaks due to successful polymer chain entanglement between the two sealant layers. The different test categories of the study are non-contaminated (control), salt water solution for salt based foods, and vegetable oil for oil-based foods. Given the test parameters of the study, 140 ⁰C sealing temperature and 0. 3 seconds dwell time are considered to be the optimal sealing condition for all three test categories. For Phase 1 of the study, salt water had a lower Hermeticity pass rate compared to vegetable oil and non-contaminated seals. In addition, the effect of refrigerated storage temperature and ambient storage temperature did not show to be significant for any of the test categories. However, refrigerated conditions showed a higher Hermeticity pass rate, but it was not statistically different. The findings for seal strength indicated no test category had higher or lower seal strength over the 14 day test period. Overall, the study shows there is no effect of liquid contaminant on Hermeticity and seal strength for flexible film with LLDPE sealant layer...|$|E

Nucleic acid amplification testing {{can be used}} to identify pathogens, but typically requires highly-trained personnel and large, expensive lab equipment, neither of which is available in low-resource settings. Our overall goal is to develop a portable diagnostic system that utilizes a low-cost, disposable, mesofluidic cartridge and a handheld electronics unit to perform fully-integrated nucleic acid testing at the point of care in low-resource settings. As a first step toward this goal, we developed a subunit to execute isothermal nucleic acid amplification coupled with lateral flow detection, in parallel with the development of a sample preparation subunit by our collaborators at Claremont BioSolutions.

The closed-system disposable prevents workspace amplicon contamination. The cartridge design is based on standard, scalable manufacturing techniques, such as injection molding. Using an initial prototype system, we demonstrated detection of purified Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic DNA. We then developed a refined amplification and detection cartridge in conjunction with an improved portable instrument, which automates pumping, heating, and timing, using a design format compatible with eventual integration with the sample preparation subunit. This refined cartridge incorporates a novel, inexpensive, stand-alone, passive valve, smaller, integrated pump components, a more complex injection molded polycarbonate cartridge core piece, and enhanced lateral flow chambers to improve visual detection. The independent valve component can be tailored for a variety of fluidic systems.

40|$|Irradiation {{sterilization}} of precooked, {{hermetically sealed}} meat provides a shelf-stable, ready-to-eat product {{that can be}} stored {{for long periods of}} time without refrigeration. The Atomic Energy Corporation of South Africa started to develop precooked, shelf-stable meat products during the late 1970 ’s, using gamma radiation from a 60 Co source at dose levels of at least 45 kGy. A number of meat dishes were successfully developed though problems were experienced with the texture of dry-packed roast beef slices, as these were found to be slightly dry. Polyphosphates can possibly be used to alleviate the textural problems found in precooked irradiation-sterilized meat because polyphosphates are known to increase the water binding properties of meat proteins, resulting in a juicy, tender product. The choice of cattle breed used for the preparation of precooked meat dishes may also affect cooked meat texture, due to genotypic differences in the amount and especially the solubility of collagen. Biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscles obtained from Afrikaner (Bos Indicus), Hereford (Bos Taurus) and Simmental (Bos Taurus) steers were treated with low levels of sodium tripolyphosphate (0. 3 % and 0. 5 %) and tetrasodium pyrophosphate (0. 22 % and 0. 36 %) in combination with 0. 7 % salt. The precooked meat was vacuum packed in <b>flexible</b> <b>pouches</b> and irradiated in the frozen state (- 40 °C) with a 60 Co gamma source until a minimum target dose of 45 kGy was reached. Various physico-chemical tests as well as descriptive generic sensory evaluation were performed on the samples to determine the effect of breed, polyphosphate treatment and irradiation on the physico-chemical and sensory properties of irradiated precooked beef. Cattle breed affected the texture of precooked, irradiated, shelf-stable beef, with Afrikaner biceps femoris giving a more tender, juicy product than that of Hereford and Simmental. The low levels of polyphosphates used in combination with salt successfully increased the juiciness and tenderness of precooked, shelf-stable beef. There was little difference in the physico-chemical and sensory results obtained from samples treated with the two different polyphosphates, or the level at which the polyphosphates were administered. Irradiation sterilization of precooked beef resulted in a tender product. Comparison of irradiated and non-irradiated samples revealed that the irradiated samples had longer sarcomere and I-band lengths, and shorter A-band lengths, which explained the increased tenderness in irradiated samples. An increase in both soluble collagen and % collagen solubility after irradiation sterilization further substantiated the tenderness results. Treatment of the biceps femoris with low levels of sodium tripolyphosphate or tetrasodium pyrophosphate in combination with salt, prior to cooking and irradiation, resulted in a juicy, shelf-stable product. Irradiation sterilization did, however, produce a detectable wet dog flavour and aroma, and more research is required into improving the flavour and aroma of irradiation sterilized beef. Although this research indicated that irradiation of cooked, polyphosphate treated Afrikaner meat resulted in the most tender and juicy end-products, it is recommended that sensory evaluation using a consumer panel also be conducted, in order to determine if this level of tenderness is acceptable, or if it is over tender due to excessive degradation of the connective tissue.

O absorvedor de oxigênio "Agelese®" foi fornecido pela Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Ino. do Japão e utilizado no acondicionamento de leite em pó integral, em embalagens metálicas e flexíveis de alta barreira à gases e ao vapor de água. Além do absorvedor, foram utilizados acondicionamentos sob gás inerte para embalagens metálicas e à vácuo para embalagens flexíveis. A estocagem do produto foi aproximadamente de 18 meses, em duas condições de temperatura: ambiente e a 37 °C. Durante este período de armazenamento foram {{realizadas}} as seguintes análises: Índice de acidez, Índice de solubilidade, índice de peróxido, atividade de água, análises microbiológicas, determinações de vitaminas A e C e concentração de oxigênio e gás carbônico do espaço livre das embalagens. Paralelamente, foi realizada uma análise sensorial, utilizando-se análise descritiva quantitativa, com os seguintes atributos de sabor: característico de leite, velho, oxidado, adstringente/aderente: encorpado, ao lado de uma escala hedônica. Para a avaliação dos resultados, utilizou-se análise de variância multivariada (MANOVA) e análise de variância (ANOVA), onde a significância estatística das diferenças entre as médias foi determinada pelo Teste de Tukey. Foi realizado, também, um estudo de correlação entre os principais parâmetros fíeico-quimicos e os atributos sensoriais utilisados e estimada a vida útil do leite em pó integral nas diferentes condições de estocagem e tratamentos. Com base nos atributos sensoriais, concluiu-se que, para o leite em pó integral acondicionado em embalagem metálica e estocado a 37 °C, a vida útil foi superior a 20 meses para o tratamento absorvedor. Para o armazenamento a temperatura ambiente, a vida útil foi de 19 meses para os tratamentos absorvedor e inertização e 45 dias para o tratamento controle. Para o leite em pó em embalagem flexível e estocado a 37 °C, a vida útil foi de 8 meses para o tratamento absorvedor e 4 meses para o tratamento à vácuo. Para as amostras ã temperatura ambiente, a vida útil foi de 12 meses para o tratamento absorvedor e 4 meses para o tratamento a vácuo e 2 meses para o tratamento controleAbstract: The {{objective of}} this research was to study the use the of oxygen absorber as an option for preservation of whole dry milk in ours packing sistems. The oxygen absorbers were obtained from the Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. {Japan. } and were utilised during the- packaging of whole dry milk in cans and pouches of flexible material with low gas permeability. In addition, the milk was packed in cans under inert atmosphere arid in <b>flexible</b> <b>pouches</b> under vacuum. The storage period of the product was approximately 13 months and two storage conditions were used: room temperature and 37 °C. During this period the following physico-chemical analyses were conducted: titratable acidity, solubility index, peroxide value, water activity, microbiological analysis, vitamin A and C, oxygen and carbon dioxide content in the headspace of packages. Besides a sensory evaluation of the samples was carried out, utilising a quantitative descritive analysis with the following flavor attributes: characteristic of milk, stale, oxidize, adstringent, heavy and also a hedonic scale. The results were evaluated by using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistic significancy of the difference between means was determined by Tukey's Stundentiaed Range (HSD) Test. Also, correlation study between physico-chemical analysis and sensory attributes and a shelf life estimation of the whole dry milk were made. Based on the sensory attributes it was concluded that for the whole dry milk in can at 37 °C the shelf life was over 20 months for absorber treatment. For the dry milk at room temperature the shelf- 1 ife was 19 months for the absorber treatment and under inert atmosphere samples and 45 days for the control treatment. For the whole dry milk in flexible pouch and storaged at 37 °C the shelf life was 8 months for the absorber treatment and 4 months for vacuum packed samples. For the samples at room temperature the shelf life was 12 months for the absorber treatment, 4 months for the vacuum packed samples and 2 months for the control treatmen...|$|E
