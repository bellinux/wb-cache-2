5|$|There are {{indications}} of D. horneri possessing <b>integumentary</b> sensory organs, possibly used in touch, modulation of precise jaw movements, temperature reading, and prey detection. The large flat scales may have further protected the snout during prey capture and intra-specific combat.|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} <b>integumentary</b> sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while {{alligators}} and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired <b>integumentary</b> glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's <b>integumentary</b> system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, {{slightly}} acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve <b>integumentary</b> structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had <b>integumentary</b> sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved <b>integumentary</b> impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E
25|$|Feathers are {{epidermal}} growths {{that form}} the distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on birds. They are considered the most complex <b>integumentary</b> structures found in vertebrates and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. The exact signals that induce the growth of feathers on the skin are not known, {{but it has been}} found that the transcription factor cDermo-1 induces the growth of feathers on skin and scales on the leg.|$|E
25|$|Most {{stingrays}} {{have one}} or more barbed stingers (modified from dermal denticles) on the tail, which are used exclusively in self-defense. The stinger may reach a length around , and its underside has two grooves with venom glands. The stinger {{is covered with a}} thin layer of skin, the <b>integumentary</b> sheath, in which the venom is concentrated. A few members of the suborder, such as the manta and porcupine rays, do not have stingers.|$|E
25|$|Most {{aspects of}} human {{physiology}} are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The human body consists of the legs, the torso, the arms, the neck, and the head. An adult human body consists of about 100 trillion (1014) cells. The most commonly defined body systems in humans are the nervous, the cardiovascular, the circulatory, the digestive, the endocrine, the immune, the <b>integumentary,</b> the lymphatic, the musculoskeletal, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary system.|$|E
25|$|Once the old cuticle has {{separated}} from the epidermis, a digesting fluid is secreted into the space between them. However, this fluid remains inactive until {{the upper part of}} the new cuticle has been formed. Then, by crawling movements, the organism pushes forward in the old <b>integumentary</b> shell, which splits down the back allowing the animal to emerge. Often, this initial crack is caused by a combination of movement and increase in blood pressure within the body, forcing an expansion across its exoskeleton, leading to an eventual crack that allows for certain organisms such as spiders to extricate themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} (PNS) is divided into the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. However, it is the somatic nervous system, responsible for body movement and the reception of external stimuli, which allows one to understand how cutaneous innervation is {{made possible by the}} action of specific sensory fibers located on the skin, as well as the distinct pathways they take to the central nervous system. The skin, {{which is part of the}} <b>integumentary</b> system, plays an important role in the somatic nervous system because it contains a range of nerve endings that react to heat and cold, touch, pressure, vibration, and tissue injury.|$|E
25|$|Full-term chicks of most {{bird species}} {{have a small}} sharp, calcified {{projection}} on their beak, which they use to chip {{their way out of}} their egg. Commonly known as an egg tooth, this white spike is generally near the tip of the upper mandible, though some species have one near the tip of their lower mandible instead, and a few species have one on each mandible. Despite its name, the projection is not an actual tooth, as the similarly-named projections of some reptiles are; instead, {{it is part of the}} <b>integumentary</b> system, as are claws and scales. The hatching chick first uses its egg tooth to break the membrane around an air chamber at the wide end of the egg. Then it pecks at the eggshell while turning slowly within the egg, eventually (over a period of hours or days) creating a series of small circular fractures in the shell. Once it has breached the egg's surface, the chick continues to chip at it until it has made a large hole. The weakened egg eventually shatters under the pressure of the bird's movements. The egg tooth is so critical to a successful escape from the egg that chicks of most species will perish unhatched if they fail to develop one. However, there are a few species which do not have egg teeth. Megapode chicks have an egg tooth while still in the egg but lose it before hatching, while kiwi chicks never develop one; chicks of both families escape their eggs by kicking their way out. Most chicks lose their egg teeth within a few days of hatching, though petrels keep theirs for nearly three weeks and marbled murrelets have theirs for up to a month. Generally, the egg tooth drops off, though in songbirds it is reabsorbed.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the body}} was covered in scales. Larger scales were {{arranged}} in irregular patterns, with numerous smaller scales occupying the spaces between them, similarly to skin impressions known from other ceratopsians, such as Chasmosaurus. A series of {{what appear to be}} hollow, tubular bristle-like structures, approximately [...] long, were also preserved, arranged in a row down the dorsal (upper) surface of the tail. These were confirmed by the authors, as well as an independent scientist, to not represent plant material. The bristle-like <b>integumentary</b> structures extend into the skin nearly to the vertebrae, and were likely circular or tubular before being preserved. Under ultraviolet light, they gave off the same fluorescence as scales, providing the possibility they were keratinized. The study stated that, [...] "at present, there is no convincing evidence which shows these structures to be homologous to the structurally different <b>integumentary</b> filaments of theropod dinosaurs". However, they found that all other feather-like integument from the Yixian Formation could be identified as feathers.|$|E
500|$|It {{has yet to}} be {{determined}} why such an <b>integumentary</b> change might have occurred. A precedent for feather loss can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians, in which filamentous structures were lost, and scales reappeared. Although gigantism has been suggested as a mechanism, Phil R. Bell, who co-authored the study, noted that the feathered Yutyrannus overlapped in size with Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus. [...] "The problem here is that we have big tyrannosaurs, some with feathers, some without that live in pretty similar climates. So what's the reason for this difference?

500|$|An {{ongoing debate}} in the paleontological {{community}} surrounds the extent and nature of Tyrannosaurid <b>integumentary</b> covering. Long filamentous structures have been preserved along with skeletal remains of numerous coelurosaurs from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation and other nearby geological formations from Liaoning, China. These filaments have usually been interpreted as [...] "protofeathers," [...] homologous with the branched feathers found in birds and some non-avian theropods, although other hypotheses have been proposed. A skeleton of Dilong was described in 2004 that included the first example of [...] "protofeathers" [...] in a tyrannosauroid. Similarly to down feathers of modern birds, the [...] "protofeathers" [...] found in Dilong were branched but not pennaceous, {{and may have been}} used for insulation.

500|$|Many {{conditions}} {{affect the}} human <b>integumentary</b> system—the organ system covering {{the entire surface}} of the body and composed of skin, hair, nails, and related muscle and glands. [...] The major function of this system is as a barrier against the external environment. [...] The skin weighs an average of four kilograms, covers an area of two square meters, and is made of three distinct layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. [...] The two main types of human skin are: glabrous skin, the hairless skin on the palms and soles (also referred to as the [...] "palmoplantar" [...] surfaces), and hair-bearing skin. [...] Within the latter type, the hairs occur in structures called pilosebaceous units, each with hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and associated arrector pili muscle. [...] In the embryo, the epidermis, hair, and glands form from the ectoderm, which is chemically influenced by the underlying mesoderm that forms the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.|$|E
500|$|Conditions of {{the human}} <b>integumentary</b> system {{constitute}} {{a broad spectrum of}} diseases, also known as dermatoses, as well as many nonpathologic states (like, in certain circumstances, melanonychia and racquet nails). [...] While {{only a small number of}} skin diseases account for most visits to the physician, thousands of skin conditions have been described. [...] Classification of these conditions often presents many nosological challenges, since underlying etiologies and pathogenetics are often not known. [...] Therefore, most current textbooks present a classification based on location (for example, conditions of the mucous membrane), morphology (chronic blistering conditions), etiology (skin conditions resulting from physical factors), and so on. [...] Clinically, the diagnosis of any particular skin condition is made by gathering pertinent information regarding the presenting skin lesion(s), including the location (such as arms, head, legs), symptoms (pruritus, pain), duration (acute or chronic), arrangement (solitary, generalized, annular, linear), morphology (macules, papules, vesicles), and color (red, blue, brown, black, white, yellow). [...] Diagnosis of many conditions often also requires a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated with the clinical presentation and any laboratory data.|$|E
500|$|The <b>integumentary</b> {{system is}} made up of three layers: the {{outermost}} epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis. The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer.

The dermis {{is made up}} of many components, such as bony structures and blood vessels. The hypodermis {{is made up of}} adipose tissue, which stores lipids and provides cushioning and insulation. The thickness of this layer varies widely from species to species; marine mammals require a thick hypodermis (blubber) for insulation, and right whales have the thickest blubber at [...] Although other animals have features such as whiskers, feathers, setae, or cilia that superficially resemble it, no animals other than mammals have hair.

They are considered the most complex <b>integumentary</b> structures found in vertebrates, and, indeed, a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. Feathers are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups. Although feathers cover {{most parts of the}} body of birds, they arise only from certain well-defined [...] on the skin.

2500|$|Tarantula hawks exemplify {{evolutionary}} {{success in}} insect defense. Justin Schmidt, from personal communication with John Alcock, the world’s leading Hemipepsis ustulata expert: “They are aposematic, brightly colored and odored, and have hard, closely fitting, smooth and slippery <b>integumentary</b> sclerites, live long, form defensive warning aggregations, and even have sharp and effective defensive leg spines.” There {{is no question}} they {{are some of the}} best-defended insects on earth. The well-documented descriptions of battles between tarantula hawk and tarantula evidence their defensive strength. In the jaws of {{one of the largest and}} most powerful spiders on earth, the tarantula hawk still almost invariably escapes unharmed. During their violent encounters, one can often hear loud crunching or snapping sounds as the tarantula attempts to crush the wasp in its jaws [...] Not a single wasp death in 200 tarantula encounters were recorded by Petrunkevitch, and only one wasp injury was observed in William’s extensive field studies. Their strong slippery <b>integumentary</b> armor allows the wasp to slip away unharmed.|$|E

In 2014, the ornithischian Kulindadromeus was reported as having structures resembling stage-3 feathers.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{human skin}} is the outer {{covering}} of the body. In humans, {{it is the}} largest organ of the <b>integumentary</b> system. [...] The skin has up to seven layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Human skin {{is similar to that of}} most other mammals. Though nearly all human skin is covered with hair follicles, it can appear hairless. There are two general types of skin, hairy and glabrous skin (hairless). The adjective cutaneous literally means [...] "of the skin" [...] (from Latin cutis, skin).|$|E
2500|$|Other animal coverings, {{such as the}} {{arthropod}} exoskeleton, {{have different}} developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means [...] "of the skin" [...] (from Latin cutis, skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the <b>integumentary</b> system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1990s, {{dozens of}} {{feathered}} dinosaurs {{have been discovered}} in the clade Maniraptora, which includes the clade Avialae and the recent common ancestors of birds, Oviraptorosauria and Deinonychosauria. In 1998, {{the discovery of a}} feathered oviraptorosaurian, Caudipteryx zoui, challenged the notion of feathers as a structure exclusive to Avialae. [...] Buried in the Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China, C. zoui lived during the Early Cretaceous Period. Present on the forelimbs and tails, their <b>integumentary</b> structure has been accepted as pennaceous vaned feathers based on the rachis and herringbone pattern of the barbs. In the clade Deinonychosauria, the continued divergence of feathers is also apparent in the families Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Branched feathers with rachis, barbs, and barbules were discovered in many members including Sinornithosaurus millenii, a dromaeosaurid found in the Yixian formation (124.6 MYA).|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{adipose tissue}} is located {{beneath the skin}} (subcutaneous fat), around {{internal}} organs (visceral fat), in bone marrow (yellow bone marrow), intermuscular (Muscular system) and in the breast tissue. [...] Adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which {{are referred to as}} adipose depots. Apart from adipocytes, which comprise the highest percentage of cells within adipose tissue, other cell types are present, collectively termed stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells. SVF includes preadipocytes, fibroblasts, adipose tissue macrophages, and endothelial cells. Adipose tissue contains many small blood vessels. In the <b>integumentary</b> system, which includes the skin, it accumulates in the deepest level, the subcutaneous layer, providing insulation from heat and cold. [...] Around organs, it provides protective padding. However, its main function is to be a reserve of lipids, which can be oxidised to meet the energy needs of the body and to protect it from excess glucose by storing triglycerides produced by the liver from sugars, although some evidence suggests that most lipid synthesis from carbohydrates occurs in the adipose tissue itself. Adipose depots {{in different parts of the}} body have different biochemical profiles. Under normal conditions, it provides feedback for hunger and diet to the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Skin {{diseases}} are {{very common in}} dogs. [...] Atopy, a chronic allergic condition, is thought to affect up to 10 percent of dogs. [...] Other skin diseases related to allergies include hot spots and pyoderma, both characterized by secondary bacterial infections, food allergy, ear infections, and flea allergy dermatitis. [...] Canine follicular dysplasia is an inherited disorder of the hair follicles resulting in alopecia (baldness). [...] Mange is an infectious skin disease caused by mites. [...] Endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome can also manifest as skin problems like alopecia or recurring bacterial infections. Another class of <b>integumentary</b> malady is hygromas, a swelling typically {{on or near the}} elbow joint. Nutrition may also play a role in skin disease, as deficiencies in certain nutrients may result in scaling, redness, oiling, balding, and/or itching of the skin. Some nutrients that are particularly important to maintain healthy levels of for skin benefits include: vitamin A and B, essential faty acids, zinc, and proteins. Physical elements of certain dog breeds also affect susceptibility of individuals to skin problems. For instance, skin-fold dermatitis is a skin infection commonly found in breeds such as the bulldog, due to their excess amounts of loose skin.|$|E
2500|$|Dermatopathology is a {{subspecialty}} of anatomic pathology {{that focuses}} on the skin {{and the rest of the}} <b>integumentary</b> system as an organ. [...] It is unique, in that there are two paths a physician can take to obtain the specialization. [...] All general pathologists and general dermatologists train in the pathology of the skin, so the term dermatopathologist denotes either of these who has reached a certainly level of accreditation and experience; in the USA, either a general pathologist or a dermatologist can undergo a 1 to 2 year fellowship in the field of dermatopathology. [...] The completion of this fellowship allows one to take a subspecialty board examination, and becomes a board certified dermatopathologist. Dermatologists are able to recognize most skin diseases based on their appearances, anatomic distributions, and behavior. Sometimes, however, those criteria do not lead to a conclusive diagnosis, and a skin biopsy is taken to be examined under the microscope using usual histological tests. In some cases, additional specialized testing needs to be performed on biopsies, including immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and molecular-pathologic analysis. [...] One of the greatest challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist, including cutaneous eruptions ("rashes") and neoplasms. Therefore, dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge in clinical dermatology, and be familiar with several other specialty areas in Medicine.|$|E
