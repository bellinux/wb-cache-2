40|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the global financial crisis, the tax affairs of celebrities began to receive significant critical attention in the UK press. ‘Tax shaming’ has been welcomed as a significant weapon {{in the fight for}} tax justice: it is argued that in lieu of the government action needed to close loopholes in tax law, the threat of public condemnation serves to deter would-be tax avoiders. Focusing on news stories about celebrity tax avoiders, this article complicates this prevailing view of tax shaming. Drawing on cultural studies and cultural economy approaches, I argue that commentators have overlooked the forms of identification that tax shaming stories afford. Through a discussion of the discursive figure of the beleaguered ‘taxpayer’ in neoliberal culture, I propose that celebrity tax shaming consolidates identification with this subject position, deepening anti-tax sentiment. Stories that ostensibly ‘shame’ celebrities also support identification with the figure of the tax avoider, perpetuating fantasies of avoidance, <b>evasion</b> <b>and</b> <b>escape.</b> The article concludes that tax shaming contributes to the formation of emergent taxation imaginaries, animating politically salient conceptions of the ‘taxpayer’ and of avoidance that tend to promote logics of tax efficiency and minimization...|$|E

40|$|O presente artigo apresenta uma reflexão sobre o papel da Cidade na sua relação com o Turismo, quando a mesma não esteja associada a destino de montanha ou mar. Analisa-se a ascensão do turismo de massa, em simultâneo a desqualificação da cidade industrial, que levam a consagrar a viagem como evasão e fuga do urbano, e a busca de espaços tidos como paradisíacos, junto à natureza. Propõe-se, ainda, utilizar Michel Maffesoli, em especial na sua teorização sobre imaginário ou imaginal, como ele também refere, e o conflitual, segundo o mesmo teórico, para com eles analisar a Cidade e o Urbano, a primeira vista enquanto espaço físico concreto e, o segundo, enquanto o imaginal, o complexo das relações socioculturais que alimentam o imaginário de Cidade. Assim como o {{pastoral}} está para o campo, o Urbano estaria para a Cidade. Entre os sujeitos que contribuem para essa construção, papel preponderante é desempenhado pela mídia. No caso do Turismo, a presente análise reporta a contribuição de uma publicação especializada, a Revista Viagem e Turismo, na construção do imaginário de cidade turística. No caso da publicação identifica-se o imaginário de cidade turística associada ao paraíso em destinos identificados pela presença marcante da natureza.  Tourist City and its Imaginary: The Specialized Press This {{article presents}} {{a reflection on}} the role of the City regarding tourism, when it is not associated to a mountain or ocean destination. It is analyzed the mass tourism rise, simultaneously with the industrial city disqualification, which lead to devote the trip as <b>evasion</b> <b>and</b> <b>escape</b> from the urban area, and the search after places said to be paradisiacal, close to the nature. It is also proposed to use Michel Maffesoli, especially in his theory about the imaginary or imaginal, as he also says, and the conflitual, according to the same theory and to use them to examine the City and the Urban, at first as concrete physical space and the second, as the imaginal, the sociocultural relations complex that feeds the city`s imaginary. As the bucolic regards the countryside, the Urban would regard the City. Among those contributing to this construction, dominant role is played by the media. In the tourism case, the following analysis reports the contribution of a specialized publication, the magazine Travel and Tourism, in the tourist city imaginary construction. In the publication it is identified the tourist city imaginary associated to the paradise in destinations identified by the strong presence of the nature...|$|E
