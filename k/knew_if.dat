5|$|Following {{the eighth}} season of The X-Files, David Duchovny {{announced}} that he would be completely leaving the show. As such, the future of the show was up in the air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> creator Chris Carter would return for another season. With this being said, he encouraged {{the other members of the}} crew to continue the series without him. Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter. This new-found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year. Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002; she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season. Due to the changes in the cast, during the ninth season Doggett and Reyes became the series' new leads. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was able to attract an audience. However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{was already}} in Crassus' {{political}} debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey, who was unsuccessfully fighting the Senate for ratification of his eastern settlements and farmland for his veterans. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds since they were consuls together in 70 BC, and Caesar <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> he allied himself with one he would lose {{the support of the}} other, so he endeavoured to reconcile them. Between the three of them, they had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (rule of three men), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, who was elected to the consulship for the following year.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{announcement}} of the sale of Knight Ridder, Brian Tierney, the founder and former CEO of the public relations and advertising firm Tierney Communications, had expressed interest in purchasing the Philadelphia papers. After {{the announcement}} of McClathcy's plan to sell the papers, Tierney began to assemble a group of advisers and investors to purchase the papers with. Tierney formed a group of Philadelphia area investors and businesspeople to form Philadelphia Media Holdings. Almost all of the investors were either former clients of Tierney's or were with him {{on the board of directors}} of The Episcopal Academy. While Tierney found investors, Citizens Financial Group's president Stephen Steinour arranged financing. Working with Tierney a month before they even <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> the Philadelphia papers would be for sale, Steinour arranged US$450 million in financing from Citizens Financial Group's owner, the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E

25|$|In April 2005, Diehl-Armstrong {{confided to}} a state trooper that she had {{information}} about the Wells' case and after meeting with FBI agents, said she would tell them everything she <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> she was transferred from Muncy State Penitentiary to a minimum-security prison in Cambridge Springs. During a series of interviews, Diehl-Armstrong admitted to providing the kitchen timers used for the bomb and said that Rothstein was the mastermind of the plot and that Wells had been {{directly involved in the}} plan. In late 2005, Kenneth Barnes, an ex-television repairman in jail on unrelated drug charges and friend of Diehl-Armstrong, was turned in by his brother-in-law after revealing details of the crime to him. Barnes told investigators that would tell them the whole story in return for a reduced sentence. He told them that Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that she wanted the money to pay Barnes to kill her father, whom she believed was wasting her inheritance.|$|E
25|$|The {{array of}} {{problems}} encountered {{concentrated on the}} electrodynamics of moving bodies. Poincaré swiftly proposed {{the idea that it}} is the ether modifying itself, and not the bodies acquiring mass, which came to contradict the older theories (based on a perfectly immovable ether). Overall, Poincaré shed light on the Zeeman effect, caused by discontinuous emissions of electrons. The problem of discontinuous matter forced the formulation of a minimally-destabilizing model of the atom. In 1913, Niels Bohr presented his atomic model which was based on the concept of electron orbits, and which explained spectroscopy as well as the stability of the atom. But, in 1905, the problem with all attempts to define the behavior of the microscopic world was that no one then <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> they needed to consider a similar model to the one known for the macroscopic objects (the model of classical mechanics), or if they should try to develop an entirely new model to give account of new facts. The latter idea, which was followed with the quantum theory, also implied definitively abandoning the unity already found in prior theories of mechanics.|$|E
25|$|In South America, Argentina was {{the first}} country to produce it, with Marisol Otero as Belle, Juan Rodó as Beast, Diego Jaraz as Gaston, Gustavo Monje as LeFou, Pablo Lizaso as Lumière, Mónica Nuñez as Mrs. Potts, Omar Pini as Cogsworth, Alejandra Radano as Babette and Rodolfo Valss as Maurice. It ran from November 26, 1998, at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires until August 15, 1999, before opening again in 2010. Brazil was the second country to host the musical. Disney had plans {{to bring it to}} the country in 1999, after the success in Argentina, but nobody really <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> it would work. Three years later, in 2002, Beauty and the Beast finally opened in Brazil at Teatro Abril, one of the biggest theaters in the country. It was a huge hit, for more than one and a half years, it was {{presented}} with Kiara Sasso playing Belle and Saulo Vasconcelos playing the Beast. In 2009, a new Belle and a new Beast were cast, Lissah Martins and Ricardo Vieira, as the musical came back to Brazil, Kiara Sasso was playing Maria in The Sound of Music. Beauty and the Beast remained for six months at Teatro Abril. Even though the play was brought back as a way to try to recoup some of the money lost in Brazil's version of Miss Saigon, this second incarnation of Beauty and the Beast failed to create any critical buzz, or to be a box office success.|$|E

25|$|All over France, the maquis {{attempted}} to seize towns in June 1944, expecting the Allies {{to be there}} soon, often with tragic results. For instance, in Saint-Amand-Montrond, the maquis seized the town and took 13 miliciens and their associated women prisoners, including the wife of Francis Bout de l'An, a senior leader of the Milice who intervened to take personal charge of the situation to get his wife back. A joint German-milice force marched on Saint-Amand-Montrond, causing the maquis to retreat and when the Axis forces arrived, eleven people were shot on the spot while a number of hostages were taken. The Milice chief of Orléans and the archbishop of Bourges were able to negotiate an exchange on 23 June 1944, where the Maquis released their female hostages (except for one woman who chose to join the maquis) {{in exchange for the}} Milice releasing their hostages, through the Germans refused to free any of their hostages and instead deported them to the concentration camps. As for the miliciens taken hostage, the maquisards <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> they were freed, they would reveal their hideout and their names as both the miliciens and maquisards had grown up in the same town and knew each other well (men on both sides had once been friends) {{while at the same time}} food was in short supply, making their hostages a drain on their food supplies; leading to the maquisards to hang their hostages (shooting them would make too noise) out in the woods. Bout de l'An decided to seek revenge for his wife's captivity by sending a force of miliciens under Lécussan to round up the surviving Jews of Bourges and buried 36 Jews alive out in the woods, as Bout de l'An believed that resistance was all the work of the Jews.|$|E

500|$|With the {{resignation}} of the RF member for the Salisbury constituency of Arundel, Welensky was given a chance to re-enter the political arena. Clifford Dupont, Deputy Prime Minister, resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose Welensky. Welensky <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> the RF won the byelections it would appear as a mandate for unilateral independence; the campaign, for only two seats, was intense. At public meetings, Welensky was heckled by opponents to ironic cries of 'Communist', 'traitor', and 'coward'. Sharing a television platform with Smith on 3 September, Welensky talked of the economic and political dangers of a UDI, but nonetheless wished Smith luck when he departed for independence talks in London. Welensky had much more antipathy for the British Government than his RF opponents, and was disgusted at their treatment of the Rhodesians during constitutional talks: ...|$|E

500|$|She went to {{the garage}} and saw Fischer's body lying face up on the driveway. She told her {{daughter}} Kathy to call 911, and her father, Buddy, who lived a few minutes away. Buddy dressed {{and headed toward the}} house. He took a shortcut off Texas highways 77 and 83 to reach the house, and recalled going over [...] at some point, and brushing off a few cars along the way by gesturing with his left hand.

[...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> I kept pushing it off, I'd never get it done", he said. He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season.

In the end, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in radio-television communication (with a minor in business) at Michigan. He told Albom that earning his degree made him a better example when speaking about staying in school. [...] Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates. [...] During the graduation, keynote speaker Marian Wright Edelman paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson, who graduated together, and noted that Howard's graduation made him a role model for children.|$|E
500|$|After Singer {{completed}} {{the three major}} productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards {{while growing up in}} New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander's screenplay and signing on to direct, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany's political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler's bodyguards, Rochus Misch, who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg's true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than [...] "old men in rooms, talking". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, [...] "The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller.... I <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> I could keep the audience with [...] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they would go with the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history." ...|$|E

Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E
