5|$|Originally, the {{president}} of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant.

The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who now becomes <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of the governor. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|Under Kentucky's first {{constitution}} (1792), the Speaker of the Kentucky Senate became acting governor {{upon the}} death, resignation, or {{removal of the}} sitting governor from office, until a new election could be held. The 1799 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, who acted as Speaker of the Senate, but was not otherwise considered {{a member of that}} body. The lieutenant governor was to become <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of the sitting governor's death, resignation, or removal from office and was to act in a gubernatorial capacity any time the governor was out of the state. Whenever the lieutenant governor became acting governor, the Senate was to elect one of its members to act as Speaker; that individual then became next in the line of gubernatorial succession. A provision of the 1850 constitution added that, if the governor's term had more than two years remaining {{at the time of his}} death, resignation, or removal from office, a special election would be called to fill the office; the lieutenant governor would be acting <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Marshall {{declined}} his party's {{nomination to}} run for Congress. He did hint to state party leaders {{that he would be}} interested in running for Indiana <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the Indianapolis Star. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to win the nomination.|$|E
