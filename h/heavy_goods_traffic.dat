60|$|And {{it may be}} {{that many}} railways, which are neither capable of {{modification}} into suburban motor tracks, nor of development into luxurious through routes, will find, in spite of the loss of many elements of their old activity, that there is still a profit to be made from a certain section of the <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic,</b> and from cheap excursions. These are forms of work for which railways seem to be particularly adapted, and which the diversion of a great portion of their passenger traffic would enable them to conduct even more efficiently.

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> by road has {{continually}} {{increased over}} many years and owing to population or environmental impact reasons, {{the actual number of}} road tunnels has grown in many countries. It must be remarked that, due to the sharp reduction of vehicle pollutant emissions, the ventilation of road tunnel is more and more determined by the need of controlling smoke in case of fire. The first step of this study focused on full scale test program development. This included an assessment of the tunnel‚Äôs condition, identification of possible modifications, design of the ventilation system to be tested during fires and set-up of the test planning. Full-scale experimental runs were carried out utilizing a two-lane tunnel of the Highway A 7 Genoa-Milan, in order to simulate the evolving scenarios following an accident with fire development. Firstly, experiments were performed with simulated smoke, so to obtain a complete fluid dynamic characterization of the tunnel, under different atmospheric conditions. The following testing was carried out with several fire loads characterized by different calorific value. Following aspects were deeply analyzed: longitudinal and transversal temperature gradients in presence and in absence of fire-extinguishing automatic systems; effects of different ventilation conditions; evolution of the heuristic pollutants during the fire. The second step was addressed laboratory-scale experimental runs: design and construction of the laboratory test facilities; experimental runs, data evaluation and preliminary modelling. Combining the results of full testing and theoretical modelling, practical recommendations are drawn concerning, from one side, general measures relating to the tunnel and the traffic (e. g. ventilation design and operation), on the other side specific measures to reduce the consequence of accidents and implement emergency response management...|$|R

Development projects are underway in Lungern (Bypass Tunnel, opening 2012) and between the Sachseln bypass tunnel and the Zollhouse tunnel (opening mid-2010). In planning is another tunnel, which will link the Giswil tunnel up to Kaiserstuhl.

50|$|In the 19th century, the {{increasing}} level of <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> on the turnpike roads led to complaints. A {{plan for a}} canal from Leicester to join the London to Birmingham canal was mooted but it eventually bypassed the town and a branch canal was cut from Foxton to Harborough with wharves at Gallow Hill, and Great Bowden. Harborough wharf, {{to the north of}} the town, became a distribution centre for coal and corn. A gas company was formed in 1833 to make and distribute gas. John Clarke and Sons of London built a factory for spinning worsted and later making carpets. Other industries developed were a brickworks, brewery, wheelwright/coachworks and the British Glues and Chemicals works by the Canal at Gallow Hill. In the 1830s a union of parishes around Market Harborough was formed to look after the poor and a workhouse was built in 1836 on the site of St Luke's Hospital.

40|$|Delay is an {{important}} factor in the optimization of traffic signals and the determination of the level of service of a signalized intersection. Various models have been developed to estimate delay to traffic at signalized intersections. All the models are based on homogeneous traffic conditions; these models may not estimate the delays satisfactorily under heterogeneous traffic conditions. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the applicability of Signalized Intersection Design Aid (SIDRA) Software which is widely used for estimating delay at signalized intersections in Malaysia. This is because SIDRA considers only two main types of vehicles, i. e. passenger car and <b>heavy</b> <b>good</b> vehicles. <b>Traffic</b> control delays for a range of traffic volumes and compositions were collected at a selected signalized intersection. The associated traffic volumes were used to evaluate the delay estimated by SIDRA software were compared with the corresponding delays measured at selected sites. The results show that the delay estimated by SIDRA software is higher than the observed delay. This implies that the analysis of delay for heterogeneous traffic cannot be based on existing homogeneous traffic delay model...|$|R

The objective is to develop a strategy to detect a critical situation (jackknifing) and trigger a warning message under dangerous conditions such unstable yaw. A new system for articulated vehicles jackknifing detection and prediction is designed. This system uses on one hand, a nominal model of articulated vehicle making it possible to determine the vehicle dynamic state such as the relative yaw angle.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{effects of}} noise rank second {{in terms of}} disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) after annoyance. Although {{research}} {{during the past decade}} has consolidated the available data base, the most recent meta-analysis still shows wide confidence intervals - indicating imprecise information for public health risk assessment. The alpine area of Tyrol in the Austrian part of the Alps has experienced a massive increase in car and <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>traffic</b> (road and rail) during the last 35 years. Over the past 25 years small-, middle-, and large-sized epidemiological health surveys have been conducted - mostly within the framework of environmental health impact assessments. By design, these studies have emphasized a contextually driven environmental stress perspective, where the adverse health effects on account of noise are studied in a broader framework of environmental health, susceptibility, and coping. Furthermore, innovative exposure assessment strategies have been implemented. This article reviews the existing knowledge from these studies over time, and presents the exposure-response curves, with and without interaction assessment, based on standardized re-analyses and discusses it in the light of past and current cardiovascular noise effects research. The findings support relevant moderation by age, gender, and family history in nearly all studies and suggest a strong need for consideration of non-linearity in the exposure-response analyses. On the other hand, air pollution has not played a relevant role as a moderator in the noise-hypertension or the noise-angina pectoris relationship. Finally, different noise modeling procedures can introduce variations in the exposure response curves, with substantive consequences for public health risk assessment of noise exposure...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{relative}} recent move towards inherent safe materials, the relentless drive of consumerism requires increased quantities of dangerous goods to be manufactured, transported, stored and used year on year. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of road transport systems is {{to be considered a}} strategic goal in particular in those countries, like Italy, in which 80 % of goods are transported by this means. <b>Heavy</b> <b>good</b> <b>traffic</b> by road has continually increased over many years and owing to population or environmental impact reasons, the actual number of road tunnels has grown in many countries. It must however be remarked that, due to the sharp reduction of vehicle pollutant emissions, the ventilation of road tunnel is more and more determined by the need of controlling smoke in case of fire. In case of fire in a tunnel, a longitudinal ventilation system is often operated in order to create, upstream of the fire, a smokeless area, essential for evacuation and rescue operations. If the ventilation rate is low, the fire smoke may propagate also upstream of the fire, contrary to the ventilation air flow, a phenomenon known as backlayering. The critical velocity, that is the minimum value capable of avoiding backlayering and thus force smoke to move only downstream, is obviously a fundamentally important value when designing ventilation systems. Therefore, the basic scientific problem is to determine the longitudinal ventilation rate necessary to prevent the combustion products from moving upstream of the fire. Current methods for determination of such value are based on semi-empiric equations, obtained by the Froude‚Äôs number conservation, combined with experimental data. The first step of this research was carried out on a real scale in order to simulate the evolving scenarios following an accident with fire development. Experimental runs were carried out with real fire development, utilizing alternatively different combustion materials and cars, focusing attention on longitudinal and transverse temperature gradients both in presence and in absence of fire-extinguishing automatic systems and longitudinal ventilation equipment. In {{the second phase of the}} research, a laboratory scale tunnel was designed and realized ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù. Several experiments were carried out, considering a longitudinal ventilation system and realizing fires characterized by different heat/smoke flow rates. The asymptotic value of the critical ventilation velocity resulting by mathematical modelling appears in good agreement with those proposed by other authors. Combining the results of full scale and laboratory tests, practical recommendations are drawn concerning, from one side, general measures relating to the tunnel and the traffic (e. g. ventilation design and operation), on the other side specific measures to reduce the consequence of accidents and implement emergency response management...|$|R
