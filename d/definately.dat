We report two brothers and a sister, presenting with atrial fibrillation at young age. Younger brother's atrial fibrillation was diagnosed along with perimyocarditis, however the other siblings presented later on, but had no evidence of organic heart disease. A systematic cardiac evaluation including E. C.

I have also listed some points which indicate a non glacial origin of the pebbly mudstones.

My detailed replies to STAUFFERS and LEES com-ments are listed below: 1. I agree that the time range and the thickness of the pebbly mudstones are not well known, but this does not allow us to estimate these measurements to fit our preferred theories. The time range of Early/ Middle Devonian to Early/Middle Carboniferous (BURTON, 1983) or the whole of the Carboniferous (TANTIWANIT, et al. 1983) has been discussed on the basis of regional arguments and fossil data. MITC~t-ELL et al. (1970) have found rugose coral and the trilo-bite Cyr toymbole (Waribole) per l isensis in their facies,,D,, (pebbly mudstones) and estimated this fauna to be Late Devonian.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to examine {{the production of the}} inflammatory cytokines IL 1, IL 1, IL 6, TNF, and TNF in two tumour cell lines, the MCF- 7 breast cell line and the T- 24 bladder cell line, and in samples of breast, bladder, lung and ovarian tumours. Two methods were used to investigate cytokine production. These were the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) to examine cytokine mRNA production and immuno-staining of frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue sections to demonstrate the presence of the cytokine polypeptide directly. In the PCR experiments, the most frequently found cytokine was IL 6, followed by IL 1. Only a few tumours of any type displayed TNF, and even fewer produced TNF. In the immunostaining experiments performed on frozen sections, IL 1 and IL 6 proteins were detected in sections of tumours which gave positive results with PCR. Cell phenotyping indicated that the IL 1 and IL 6 were probably being synthesised by the tumour cells themselves although there was lymphocyte infiltration in every section examined. In the immuno-histology study performed on the paraffin-embedded sections, a new collection of tumours was used. These tumours were not subjected to parallel PCR due to size of tumour samples being too small. The results obtained from these experiments conflicted with the results observed in the PCR study. IL 1 was detected in all of the breast tumours used for immuno-histology but in none of the breast tumours in the PCR experiments. While the conflict could not <b>definately</b> be resolved, it was thought that the results of the immuno-histology experiments were more accurate as they detected expression of cytokine protein on a cellular scale.

40|$|Much of {{the cloud}} chamber work has been {{directed}} toward obtaining the angular distribution of protons bombarded by deuterons from the 184 -inch cyclotron. The observations have been restricted to those protons arising from neutrons of energy greater than 65 Mev. The cloud chamber used for this work is of 16 -inch diruneter and employs a magnetic field of 14000 gauss. The chamber is filled with hydrogen at a pressure of 1 / 2 atmosphere; the vapor used is water and alchohol. Nearly 800 proton tracks were measured and calculated before {{analysis of the data}} indicated that the measuring procedure should be revised. They gave the angular and energy distributions shown in Figures 1 and 2. The discrepencies between the theoretical and experimental energy distribution of the neutrons shows that serious errors were being made. As a first check of possible sources of error, random parts of the data were remeasured. They indicated that errors in the measurements of the angles were being made that gave a mean deviation of about {+-} 2 {sup o} in the beam angle and {+-} 4 {sup o} in the dip angle. These errors were largest at large scatter angles. In addition, a more serious error occured in the measurements of the curvature. The mean deviation was as large as 15 percent, with many tracks having errors of 50 to 100 percent in the measured curvature. These errors were dUd to the fact that an adequate measuring technique had not been developed, that the original measuring apparatus and projector were difficult to operate, and that the cloud chamber technique had not been perfected. A systematic analysis of the errors and difficulties involved in the experiment made it evident that revisions in the technique were necessary. In view of the inaccuracy of the original measurements {{it is not possible to}} make more than a qualitative analysis of the first 800 tracks. The data showed definitely the existence of exchange forces and point to the conclusion that classical forces are slightly dominate in the proton-neutron reaction at these energies. This is indicated by the excess of high angle scattering, with 246 protons scattered at angles greater than 45 {sup o} and 183 scattered at angles less than 45 {sup o}. It is to be noted that this excess existed despite a selective tendency for the increased errors at large scatter angles to exclude the data from the group having energy greater than 65 Mev. The data taken under revised and improved procedure shows good agreement with theoretical energy distribution as may be seen from Figure 3. The angular distribution given in Table I now shows more <b>definately</b> the asymmetry of the scattering, with 59 protons scattered at angles greater than 45 {sup o} and 38 at angles less than 45 {sup o}. However, the probable statistical errors are still relatively large, and there is still a possibility that errors are introduced from high energy protons knocked on in the forward direction which may not, ionize heavily enough to be observed. This effect is small since the protons now being observed are knocked on in hydrogen at one and one half atmospheres pressure with the resulting much greater ionization...|$|E
