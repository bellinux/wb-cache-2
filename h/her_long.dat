5|$|Aguilera {{announced}} via Twitter on September 12, 2012 {{that the}} album would be titled Lotus. The album artwork {{was shot by}} fashion photographer Enrique Badulescu. Aguilera unveiled the cover on October 5, where she is shown nude with <b>her</b> <b>long,</b> blonde hair covering her nipples, while her vulva is shaded by a white light; she extends her arms emerging from a lotus flower. It received a generally positive response from critics; Tiffany Lee from Yahoo! Music complimented Aguilera's figure, while Sam Lansky from Idolator drew comparisons to the cover of her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002). Lotus was released on November 13, 2012 by RCA Records, but was leaked online on November 5.|$|E
5|$|Akhmatova {{was able}} to meet some of her pre-revolutionary acquaintances in 1965, when she was allowed to travel to Sicily and England, {{in order to receive}} the Taormina prize and an honorary {{doctoral}} degree from Oxford University, accompanied by her lifelong friend and secretary Lydia Chukovskaya. Akhmatova's Requiem in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987. <b>Her</b> <b>long</b> poem The Way of All the Earth or Woman of Kitezh (Kitezhanka) was published in complete form in 1965.|$|E

5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising <b>her</b> <b>long</b> black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|Ariel has a {{distinctive}} appearance, with <b>her</b> <b>long,</b> flowing, bright red hair, blue eyes, green mermaid tail and purple seashell bikini top. In the films and television series, {{she is the}} seventh-born daughter of King Triton and Queen Athena of an underwater kingdom of Merfolk called Atlantica. She is often rebellious, {{and in the first}} film, she longs {{to be a part of}} the human world. She marries Prince Eric, whom she rescued from a shipwreck, and together they have a daughter, Melody.|$|E
5|$|Dilys Cadwaladr, {{the former}} school teacher on Bardsey Island, in 1953 {{became the first}} woman to win the Crown at the National Eisteddfod for <b>her</b> <b>long</b> poem Y Llen; and artist Brenda Chamberlain twice won the Gold Medal for Art at the Eisteddfod; some of the murals she painted can still be seen on the walls of Carreg, her island home from 1947 to 1962. Wildlife artist Kim Atkinson, whose work has been widely {{exhibited}} in Wales and England, spent her childhood on the island and returned to live there in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rise}} of grunge and {{alternative}} rock in the 1990s, her record label relegated her productions only to the European region, where she continued to tour extensively. She remained a successful charting artist in Germany, despite living and producing her albums in the US. When classic heavy metal found again the favour of the public, she returned to tour {{all over the world}} and her popularity as a veteran singer grew considerably, inspiring many new female metal artists. Doro is also known for her duets performed both live and in studio with other singers and musicians of the metal scene, whom she has befriended in <b>her</b> <b>long</b> career.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, Bence has {{received}} many awards acknowledging <b>her</b> <b>long</b> career. In 2006, she was {{honored by the}} Actors Social Work (OSA) and in 2007, she received the inaugural Javolandia Award for lifetime achievement from the Javo Rocha Academy of Theater. She was given a certificate of recognition during the María Guerrero Awards ceremony in 2007 and in 2008 she received the Trinidad Guevara Achievement Award with Jorge Rivera López. In late 2009, a tribute in her honor was held by the Northern Region of the Argentine Society of Writers, in which the Mayor of San Isidro presented a poetry anthology and designated the hall with Bence's name.|$|E
5|$|Later, Ingeborg's husband dies in an accident, and Ingeborg sends {{a letter}} to Kaspar. However, it is accidentally dropped by the postman, and never arrives. When Sigrid Undset dies, both Kaspar and Ingeborg travel to the funeral; they are reunited, and later marry and live in Copenhagen. As Kaspar tells Ingeborg that he loves <b>her</b> <b>long</b> hair, she does not cut it, but when Kaspar trips over it and breaks his thumb, she sends for her hairdresser from Norway. On the way, the hairdresser meets a young man on the train, who was also {{travelling}} to Copenhagen to meet Kaspar, his favourite poet. The two fall in love, and are revealed to be the narrator's parents.|$|E

5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with <b>her</b> <b>long</b> laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with <b>her</b> <b>long,</b> pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|Vasco da Gama was an ironclad which entered {{service with}} the Portuguese Navy in 1876, serving until 1935. She {{was built by}} the Thames Iron Works in London, {{launched}} in 1876, and completed in 1878. She served as the flagship of the Portuguese fleet {{for the majority of}} <b>her</b> <b>long</b> and peaceful career. She was rebuilt and heavily modernized between 1901 and 1903. Long-since obsolete by the 1930s, Vasco da Gama was finally sold for scrapping in 1935.|$|E

5|$|While Miller toured Europe {{and lived}} out their mutual dream of visiting Lord Byron's tomb, Coolbrith was saddled with {{custody of her}} daughter, and the care of members of her own family, so she set up house a in Oakland and {{accepted}} the position of city librarian. Her poetry suffered {{as a result of}} <b>her</b> <b>long</b> work hours, but she mentored a generation of young readers including Jack London and Isadora Duncan. After she served for 19 years, Oakland's library patrons called for reorganization, and Coolbrith was fired. She moved back to San Francisco and was invited by members of the Bohemian Club to be their librarian.|$|E
5|$|While the Hummel–Hudson {{wedding is}} being arranged, Sue {{advances}} her own marriage plans. She is surprised {{when her mother}} arrives in town. Doris (Carol Burnett), a recently retired Nazi hunter who was an absentee parent to Sue and her sister Jean (Robin Trocki), attempts to make amends for <b>her</b> <b>long</b> absence, but is nevertheless so critical of her daughter that Sue calls her a bully and disinvites her during the wedding rehearsal. Doris leaves, and Sue and Jean comfort each other.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of <b>her</b> <b>long</b> history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E
50|$|This sortie (number four), {{took the}} boat to Liberia and the Ivory Coast on the west African coast and at 81 days, it was <b>her</b> <b>longest.</b>|$|R

5|$|In June 1999, Chyna {{became the}} first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament. She was also the first female to be the number one {{contender}} for the WWF Championship, but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August. Later that year, Laurer became a fan favorite again during <b>her</b> <b>long</b> feud with Jeff Jarrett. At Unforgiven, she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett, which she lost. She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match, a Good Housekeeping match, on October 17 at No Mercy, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship. She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. If he had not appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising, and the lineage of the title would have been broken.|$|E
5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to what is essentially the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via <b>her</b> <b>long,</b> golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during <b>her</b> <b>long</b> imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land masses between the Eurasian continents and the North Pole, and confirmed the general character of the north polar region as a deep, ice-covered sea. Although Nansen retired from exploration after this expedition, the methods of travel and survival he developed with Johansen influenced all the polar expeditions, north and south, which followed in the subsequent three decades.|$|E
