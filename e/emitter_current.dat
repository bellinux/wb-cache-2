25|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} voltage at the top of R2 is set by the <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> of the output transistor. That view leads to an entirely passive feedback network made up of R2 and Rf. The variable controlling the feedback is the <b>emitter</b> <b>current,</b> so the feedback is a current-controlled current source (CCCS). We search through the four available two-port networks and find the only one with a CCCS is the g-parameter two-port, shown in Figure 4. The next task is to select the g-parameters so that the two-port of Figure 4 is electrically equivalent to the L-section made up of R2 and Rf. That selection is an algebraic procedure made most simply by looking at two individual cases: the case with V1 = 0, which makes the VCVS {{on the right side of}} the two-port a short-circuit; and the case with I2 = 0. which makes the CCCS on the left side an open circuit. The algebra in these two cases is simple, much easier than solving for all variables at once. The choice of g-parameters that make the two-port and the L-section behave the same way are shown in the table below.|$|E

2500|$|NPN {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of bipolar transistors, {{consisting}} of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the [...] "base") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and <b>emitter</b> <b>current.</b> That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the base of an NPN transistor to its emitter (that is, when the base is high relative to the emitter), as well as a positive potential difference measured from the collector to the emitter, the transistor becomes active. In this [...] "on" [...] state, current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because electron mobility is higher than hole mobility.|$|E
2500|$|Figure3 shows a bipolar {{current mirror}} with emitter {{resistors}} {{to increase its}} output resistance.. That is, the resistors RE cause negative feedback that opposes change in current. In particular, any change in output voltage results in less change in current than without this feedback, which means the output resistance of the mirror has increased. [...] Transistor Q1 is diode connected, {{which is to say}} its collector-base voltage is zero. Figure4 shows the small-signal circuit equivalent to Figure3. Transistor Q1 is represented by its emitter resistance rE ≈ VT/IE (VT = thermal voltage, IE = Q-point <b>emitter</b> <b>current),</b> a simplification made possible because the dependent current source in the hybrid-pi model for Q1 draws the same current as a resistor 1/gm connected across r. The second transistor Q2 is represented by its hybrid-pi model. Table 1 below shows the z-parameter expressions that make the z-equivalent circuit of Figure2 electrically equivalent to the small-signal circuit of Figure4.|$|E
2500|$|This {{portion of}} the op amp cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.|$|E

50|$|In this topology, {{there is}} little {{difference}} between the Jones cell and the translinear multiplier. In both forms, two differential amplifier stages are formed by emitter-coupled transistor pairs (Q1/Q4, Q3/Q5) whose outputs are connected (currents summed) with opposite phases. The emitter junctions of these amplifier stages are fed by the collectors of a third differential pair (Q2/Q6). The output currents of Q2/Q6 become <b>emitter</b> <b>currents</b> for the differential amplifiers. Simplified, the output current of an individual transistor is given by ic=gm vbe. Its transconductance gm is (at T=300 k) about gm=40 IC. Combining these equations gives ic=40 IC vbe,lo. However, IC here is given by vbe,rf gm,rf. Hence ic=40 vbe,lo vbe,rf gm,rf, which is a multiplication of vbe,lo and vbe,rf. Combining the two difference stages output currents yields four-quadrant operation.|$|R
2500|$|The diagram shows a {{schematic}} representation of an NPN transistor connected to two voltage sources. ( [...] The same description applies to a PNP transistor with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.) [...] To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on {{the order of}} 1mA) from C to E, VBE must be above a minimum value {{sometimes referred to as}} the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage is usually about 650mV for silicon BJTs at room temperature but can be different {{depending on the type of}} transistor and its biasing. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, IB. As shown in the diagram, the <b>emitter</b> <b>current,</b> IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE=IB+IC).|$|E

50|$|The way {{feedback}} {{controls the}} bias point is as follows. If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> increases. However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = IeRe, {{which in turn}} reduces the voltage VRb across the base resistor. A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = β IB. Collector current and <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in <b>emitter</b> <b>current</b> with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable.|$|E

30|$|High beam current, and {{therefore}} current density, is desirable. This {{gives rise to}} higher photon flux, and hence shorter detector integration times, in addition to improved signal-to-noise ratios. Combined {{with the use of}} gate control to pulse the X-ray source, high beam currents can be very advantageous to system designers. Recently, micro-fabricated Spindt-like emitters have been used for applications such as static tomography [217]. Here each cathode was formed from approximately 50, 000 tips covering an area of about 1  mm 2. These emitters had a measured current capacity greater than that reported for CNTs, though CNTs will almost certainly exceed this once the technology matures. For current CNT-based sources the emission current density is several orders of magnitude less than that of equivalent area Spindt emitters. Nevertheless, for CNT-based <b>emitters,</b> <b>current</b> densities of up to 1 A/cm 2 have been reported [18], with studies elsewhere suggesting that individual CNTs are capable of conducting current densities corresponding to 5 × 106 A/cm 2 [218], which is significantly larger than any attained by Spindt-like emitters fabricated to date.|$|R
