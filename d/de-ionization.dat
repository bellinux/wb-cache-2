The water is filtered by either a two-stage or three-stage filtration process, involving a carbon filter, and two <b>de-ionization</b> filters, or a carbon filter, a reverse osmosis membrane filter, and a <b>de-ionization</b> resin filter. The filtered water contains a TDS (total dissolved solids) of less than 5 ppm. (parts per million.) The brush is used to agitate the debris off the window, while spraying water, and then the brush is lifted a few inches from the glass to rinse the glass with the pure water jets. Fan jets are used for hydrophobic glass, and [...] "pencil" [...] jets are used for hydrophilic glass. The de-ionized water is lacking in ions, so it will pull solids off the glass and dissolve the solids into the water, aiding in the cleaning process. Because there are no solids dissolved in the water, the windows dry clear without water spots. Water-fed poles vary in length. The longest poles are about 70 feet, and can reach up to six storeys. Water-fed cleaning is also referred to as pure water cleaning. It is common in the UK and becoming common in the US.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Investigate/Study de-charging {{of solar}} wind C, N, O, Mg, Si and S ions and assess fluxes of {{resulting}} ENA in the heliosphere. Methods: The model treats the heavy ions as test particles convected by (and {{in a particular}} case also diffusing through) a hydrodynamically calculated background plasma flow, from 1 AU to the termination shock (TS), to heliosheath (HS) and finally to heliospheric tail (HT). The ions undergo radiative and dielectronic recombinations, charge exchanges, photo- and electron impact ionizations with plasma particles, interstellar neutral atoms (calculated on a Monte-Carlo model) and solar photons. Results: Highly-charged heavy coronal ions flowing with the solar wind undergo successive <b>de-ionizations,</b> mainly in the heliosheath, leading to charge-states much lower than in the supersonic solar wind. If Coulomb scattering is the main ion energy loss mechanism, the end product of these deionizations are fluxes of ENA of ~ 1 keV/nucleon originating in the upwind heliosheath that for C, Mg, Si and S may constitute sources of pickup ions (PUI) significantly exceeding the interstellar supply. Conclusions: Discussed processes result in (i) distinct difference of ion charge q in the supersonic solar wind (approximately q >= +Z/ 2, Z = atomic number) compared {{to that in the}} HS (approximately 0 <= q <= +Z/ 2)), (ii) probable concentration of singly ionized atoms (q = + 1) in the heliosheath towards the heliopause (HP) and in the HT, (iii) possible significant production of ENA in the HS offering natural explanation for production of PUI, and [...] after acceleration at the TS [...] anomalous cosmic rays (ACR) of species (like C, Mg, Si, S) unable to enter the heliospheric cavity from outside because of their total ionization in the local interstellar medium.

40|$|Abstract, Considerable {{progress}} has been made recently on Kerr cells. In this paper the physical ground of this progress is examined. The optical defects of former Kerr cells were essentially due to the electric field distortions in the liquid proceeding from the space charges which attend the electric current. The various conduction regimes and the electric field distribution in these different cases are analysed. It is shown that in the most unfavourable case-unipolar injection, which is the most frequent regime under high voltage-the electric field distortion can be made very low if the conductivity of the liquid is sufficiently reduced. The importance of the ionic purification of the liquid is emphasized and methods for liquid <b>de-ionization</b> and injection decrease are described.

40|$|Capacitive <b>De-Ionization</b> (CDI) is {{becoming}} a suitable alternative for desalination. The low cost of the materials required and its reduced energy consumption can be critical factors for developing this technique. CDI technology {{does not require a}} high-pressure system and the energy storage capability of CDI cells allows it to be reused in other CDI cells, thus minimizing consumption. The goal of the power stage responsible of the energy recovery is transferring the stored energy from one cell to another with the maximum possible efficiency, thus allowing the desalination process to continue. Assuming hysteresis current control is implemented at the DC/DC (direct current) converter, this paper aims to determine the optimum peak current through the inductor in each switching period with a view to maximizing overall efficiency. The geometrical parameters of the desalination cell and the NaCl concentration modify the cell electrical properties. The peak current control of the power stage should be adapted to the cell characteristics so that the efficiency behavior of the whole CDI system can be improved.

40|$|AbstractMolecular {{mechanism}} of the binding of neuropeptide achatin-I (Gly-D-Phe-Ala-Asp) to large unilamellar vesicles of zwitterionic egg-yolk phosphatidylcholine (EPC) was investigated by means of natural-abundance 13 C and high-resolution (of 0. 01 Hz order) 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The binding equilibrium {{was found to be}} sensitive to the ionization state of the N-terminal NH 3 + group in achatin-I; the <b>de-ionization</b> of NH 3 + decreases the bound fraction of the peptide from ∼ 15 % to nearly none. The electrostatic attraction between the N-terminal positive NH 3 + group and the negative PO 4 − group in the EPC headgroup plays an important role in controlling the equilibrium. Analysis of the 13 C chemical shifts (δ) of EPC showed that the binding location of the peptide within the bilayer is the polar region between the glycerol and ester groups. The binding caused upfield changes Δδ of the 13 C resonance for almost all the carbon sites in achatin-I. The changes Δδ for the ionic Asp at the C-terminus are more than five times as large as those for the other residues. The drastic changes for Asp result from the dehydration of the ionic CO 2 − groups, which are strongly hydrated by electrostatic interactions in bulk water. The side-chain conformational equilibria of the aromatic D-Phe and ionic Asp residues were both affected by the binding, and the induced changes in the equilibria appear to reflect the peptide-lipid hydrophobic interactions...|$|E

The present studies of this model apply qualitatively with relatively small and cold sources, but without these assumptions, we {{must take into account}} that: - the source has, at all frequencies, the spectral radiance of a laser at a single frequency, so that the multi-photon absorption of few lines involves the whole continuous spectrum; - a spherical shell containing large column densities of excited atoms emits strongly super-radiant beams selected by competition of modes; - the long paths in excited atoms allow observations which require in the labs the use of ultrashort laser pulses. A necessary, qualitative update watch that: - the whole continuous spectrum of the source pumps the atoms to excited states, so that almost all energy emitted by the source is transferred to a line spectrum; - the main fraction of this line spectrum is emitted by a strong super-radiance in a spherical shell where the temperature becomes cold enough for a notable <b>de-ionization</b> of the atoms; by competition of modes, a dotted ring appears; - inside the ring, a less bright region emits spontaneously lines made extremely broad by parametric transfers of energy between the light beams and thermal radiation; the intensities of these lines decrease down to zero, from increased laboratory frequencies to decreased frequencies.

40|$|Carbon {{has been}} used {{electrochemically}} in various forms for water treatment and the carbon aerogel is one of them. Carbon Aerogels (CA) are used as electrodes due to their high surface capacity and high electrical conductivity. They are also known as Carbon Nanofoams (CNF). CA electrodes attract oppositely charged ions that are nearby. This concept is known as Capacitive <b>De-Ionization</b> (CDI). The use of CA in CDI for water purification is well documented, but not much {{work has been done}} on regeneration of CA electrodes. Once saturated, these electrodes lose their ability to adsorb additional ions and it must be restored by regeneration. If they cannot be regenerated, they would need to be replaced, which would greatly increase the cost of the treatment they are expensive. The goal {{of this study is to}} obtain data to define optimal regeneration conditions and to develop predictive capability by examining desorption behavior of adsorbed ions on CA electrodes. This study focuses on desorption of adsorbed ions and regeneration of CA. Various experiments were conducted to explore the effects on regeneration of CA of shorting of electrodes, change of polarity of electrodes, flow speed of water over CA electrodes, and temperature of regeneration water. The optimal combination of experimental variables was identified and was used for remaining experiments that tested the effect of size, charge and mass of adsorbed ions on regeneration of CA. Also, the effect of thickness of CA and its pore size on regeneration of CA was studied. Results indicated that application of reverse potential for the first few minutes of the total regeneration time provided the greatest regeneration. Longer application of reverse potential did not result in higher regeneration. The regeneration behavior when no potential applied with and without shorting was as expected. Application of reverse potential with variable temperature or variable flow speed of water over CA surfaces provided results that were different from the ones that were obtained with no potential being applied with or without shorting of electrodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{main body}} of this work {{considers}} the design and development of a microfluidic, continuous electrochemical sensor capable of measuring accurate potential differences. The key challenge in creating such a device is {{the implementation of a}} miniaturized reference electrode and salt bridge. The purpose of a salt bridge is to allow ionic conduction between the reference and working electrodes while maintaining a physical separation between the two systems. Macro reference electrode and salt bridge techniques are difficult to implement on a micro scale. Instead of attempting to conform one of these techniques to function in a micro system, new methods were developed that take advantage of the conditions in a continuous microfluidic device. In particular, laminar flow and slow relative diffusion times allow for a reference electrode that does not require a physical salt bridge. Ionic conduction is maintained between neighboring reference and analyte streams while slow mixing effectively separates the two systems. Several different device designs were investigated focusing on the prevention of reference electrode contamination. If the reference electrode is chemically contaminated it will no longer behave as expected and can not be used as a reference point. Contamination at the reference electrode was evaluated while varying flow rates and the geometry of the microfluidic device. Mathematical models were simulated {{in order to understand the}} mass transport in each device design. Based on these simulations, dimensionless groups were found that defined the dominant physics in each system. These dimensionless numbers were then validated experimentally and numerically over a range of device parameters. Subsequently, operation criteria were developed to ensure that the reference electrode remains stable and uncontaminated. By creating a stable reference electrode on chip, any homogeneous electrochemical system that was previously studied on the macro scale can now be studied continuously in a microfluidic device. A secondary portion of this work investigates the role of surface charge with respect to electrodynamics in a microchannel. As the surface area to volume ratio increases, the concentration of charge at a channel wall may begin to approach the electrolyte concentration in the bulk solution. This phenomenon is studied numerically, with and without convection, in particular as it relates to a possible mechanism for overlimiting current. Additionally, a potential <b>de-ionization</b> device is theorized based on this mechanism along with scaling arguments that can be used to aid device design. by EthelMae Victoria Dydek. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Electrostatic {{precipitators}} (ESP) or electrofilters remove flying {{ashes and}} fine particles from the flue gas in thermal power plants, before passing the gas into the chimney. Maximum allowable value of dust is 50 mg/m 3 {{and it requires}} that {{the efficiency of the}} ESPs better than 99 %, which calls for an increase of active surface of the electrodes, hence increasing the filter volume and the weight of steel used for the filter. In previous decades, electrostatic precipitators in thermal power plants were fed by thyristor controlled, single-phase fed devices having a high degree of reliability, but with a relatively low collection efficiency, hence requiring large effective surface of the collection plates and a large weight of steel construction in order to achieve the prescribed emission limits. Collection efficiency and energy efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator can be increased by applying high frequency high voltage power supply (HF HV). Electrical engineering faculty of the University of Belgrade (ETF) has developed technology and HF HV equipment for the ESP power supply. This solution was subjected to extensive experimental investigation at TE Morava from 2008. to 2010. High frequency power supply is proven to reduce emission two times in controlled conditions while increasing energy efficiency of the precipitator, compared to the conventional thyristor controlled 50 Hz supply. Two high frequency high voltage unit AR 70 / 1000 with parameters 70 kV and 1000 mA are installed at TE Morava and thoroughly testes. It was found that the HF HV power supply of the ESP at TE Morava increases collection efficiency so that emission of fine particles and flying ashes are halved, brought down to only 50 % of the emissions encountered with conventional 50 Hz thyristor driven power supplies. On the basis of this study, conclusion is drawn that the equipmentcomprising HF HV supplies are the best solution for new ESP installations, {{as well as for the}} reconstruction of existing facilities. The paper describes the topology of the HF HV power supply, power management and controls, and brings the most importantdetails of the implementation. It is found that the HF HV solution achieves several significant improvements over the conventional thyristor system. It is possible to provide more precise control ofthe ESP parameters such as the output voltages and currents. It isalso possible to make a rapid increase or decrease in voltage andto effectuate a very fast response to load changes. Due to this advantages it is possible to suppress the supply quickly in the caseof sparking, reducing the spark energy and the quantity of ionized gasses produced by the electric arc. Reduction in the spark energy is up to 10 times compared to conventional thyristors solution. This means that the erosion of the electrode system is significantly reduced, and that the quality of the collection plates is preserved for much longer periods. At the same time, lower quantity of ionized gasses produced by the spark contribute to much shorter <b>de-ionization</b> intervals, required to quit sparking and evacuate charged particles in order to reinstate the voltage and proceed with the operation. In addition, HF HV power supply provides a significant reduction in size and weight of the complete ESP installation, hence reducing the tons of steel that has to be built in. Therefore, the HF HV power supply may be the key instrument to reducing the cost of the de-dusting ecological equipment. Besides, size and weight reduction leads to cost savings of installation and maintenance. According to estimates, savings in steel may reach 30 %, contributing to the overall cost savings of roughly 20 %.
