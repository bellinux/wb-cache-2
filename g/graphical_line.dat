40|$|The gothic {{architecture}} {{owes its}} splendor to two main structural elements; the pointed arch and the vault. However, the Gothic vault {{itself is a}} repetition of several pointed arches to create an amazing system for covering the underneath compartment. This vault was subjected to a long debate regarding its structural behavior {{and the way it}} keeps its equilibrium and transmits its thrusts. Also, the rib of the gothic vault imposed many question whatever it had a decorative, structural or constructional role. Different theories were developed but none was analytically confirmed. The aim of this study is not to find answers to the debates, but mainly to develop a practical technique of analyzing the ribbed cross vault following the theories previously developed by the researchers, to compare the results and to rationalize them. Mainly, to undertake a task, that till now, was never accomplished. And to provide a model that can be followed for the analysis of any gothic vault. In order to achieve this task, a general historical and architectural study was carried out regarding the vaults, then the theories of the structural behavior were studied and later the different methods of the structural analysis of the vault were recognized and explained prior to the conducted analysis. Two case studies of Catalan Gothic vaults; the main vault of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Pi and the main vault of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Mar, were chosen to be analysed following the <b>graphical</b> (<b>line</b> of thrust) limit analysis method. Both vaults were discretisized in a geometrical model and different slices were taken for each vault following the main theories of decomposition of the vaults. Then, the defined arches were analysed using a spreadsheet and for each arch the line of thrust was graphically plotted and analysed. The obtained results were various and quite interesting. For most of the analysed arches, {{it was not possible to}} find a line of thrust within the stone voussoirs region and the line was passing either to the sound or light infill layers. It was not possible to find a realistic line of thrust for the cross ribs arches when the loads of the webs and the upper infill were applied to them. Also, the minimum and maximum values of the lateral thrusts for the arches were almost the same. Many conclusions can be derived from this study, regarding the form and geometry of the gothic vaults, the graphical analysis method and the behavior of the vaults. However, the most important is the role of the infill layers in the equilibrium of the vault and the transmission of the lateral thrusts. Also, the cross ribs mostly don‘t have a structural role. Also, the construction of this type of thin vaults required a high level of knowledge and expertise in stabilizing and keeping in the structure equilibrium...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePresence of multi-oriented characters, {{connected}} {{characters with}} <b>graphical</b> <b>lines,</b> intersection of text and symbols with graphical lines/curves etc. are {{very common in}} graphical documents. As a result word spotting in graphical documents is still a challenging task {{that we try to}} solve (partially) in this paper. The proposed approach proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, recognition of isolated components is done using rotation invariant features and an SVM classifier. The characters having good recognition score and match in the query string are first selected for initial spotting. Because of structural complexity of graphical documents as well as of touching components, we may miss some of the query characters during initial spotting in some documents. In that case, based on the position, size and orientation of the recognized characters in the input document image, regions where missing characters may be located (candidate regions) are defined. In the second stage, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used to find those missing characters in the candidate regions for possible spotting. Finally, using the position, size, orientation as well as intercharacter gap information of the recognized components, spotting is validated. Experimental results demonstrate that the method is efficient to locate a query word in multi-oriented and/or touching graphical documents...|$|R

Associated firstly with the mechanics, also he contributed with all areas of physics, such as viscosity, energy etc. Furthermore, he developed the differential and integral calculus with Leibniz, allowing him to advance in their discoveries. From a teaching point of view, the Law of cooling states is an excellent tool since it allows to the students apply their knowledge in mathematics, by a simple way. They could apply their knowledge?s in terms of integrals, <b>graphical</b> <b>lines,</b> potential, etc. to a series of real experimental values obtained by themselves. In the same way, it is intended that the student will be able to fitting the linear curves obtained and determine which is the equation governing the phenomenon. Newton's Law of cooling shows that the rate of change of the temperature of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between its own temperature and the ambient temperature. The most widely used experimentation is monitoring a liquid cooling. But in the second cycle's subject of Materials Engineering and its subsequent conversion to Master Degree, the experience have been adapted to the heating of plastic material in a furnace and the cooling of sheet, so that in addition to its importance in the ”electronic and thermal behavior of materials”, can be accommodated to more applied subjects related to the processing of plastics...|$|R

It aims at nding relevant documents relying on segmentation and recognition of text and graphics components underlying in non-standard layout where commercial OCRs can not be applied due to complexity. This thesis is focused towards text infor- mation extraction approaches in graphical documents and retrieval of such documents using text information. Automatic text recognition in graphical documents (map, engineering drawing, etc.) involves many challenges because text characters are usually printed in multi- oriented and multi-scale way along with di erent graphical objects. Text characters are used to annotate the <b>graphical</b> curve <b>lines</b> and hence, many times they follow curvi-linear paths too. For OCR of such documents, individual text lines and their corresponding words/characters need to be extracted. For recognition of multi-font, multi-scale and multi-oriented characters, we have proposed a feature descriptor for character shape using angular information from con- tour pixels {{to take care of}} the invariance nature. To improve the e ciency of OCR, an approach towards the segmentation of multi-oriented touching strings into individual characters is also discussed. Convex hull based background information is used to segment a touching string into possible primitive segments and later these primitive segments are merged to get optimum segmentation using dynamic programming. To overcome the touching/overlapping problem of text with <b>graphical</b> <b>lines,</b> a character spotting approach using SIFT and skeleton information is included. Afterwards, we propose a novel method to extract individual curvi-linear text lines using the fore- ground and background information of the characters of the text and a water reservoir concept is used to utilize the background information. We have also formulated the methodologies for graphical document retrieval ap- plications using query words and seals. The retrieval approaches are performed using recognition results of individual components in the document. Given a query text, the system extracts positional knowledge from the query word and uses the same to generate hypothetical locations in the document.

The feature used here is invariant to character orientation. Circular ring and convex hull have been used along with angular information of the contour pixels of the character to make the feature rotation invariant.
