2500|$|Clough's time at Forest {{saw him at}} {{odds with}} Justin Fashanu, whose goals and then {{confidence}} dried up as he failed {{to fit in with}} Clough's playing and lifestyle demands after signing for them in 1981. When Clough learned of Fashanu's homosexuality (which was not made public until 1990), he barred Fashanu from training with the side. In his autobiography, Clough recounted a dressing down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going to}} gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs' club?'" [...] It was also in this book that he admitted his one regret was leaving Derby County.|$|E

2500|$|Justin Fashanu, {{the first}} black £1 million footballer, was the first footballer to be openly gay. In his autobiography, Brian Clough recounts a {{dressing}} down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going}} to gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs' club?"' Fashanu committed suicide in 1998 after he was questioned by police when a seventeen-year-old boy accused him of sexual assault, and it has been suggested that the tragedy and hostility that struck his life after publicly coming out persuaded other gay footballers that coming out would not be a good idea. The coroner said the prejudices he experienced, plus the sexual assault charge he was facing at the time of his death, probably overwhelmed him.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, {{the series}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail {{said that the}} show is neither the new M*A*S*H for its lack of [...] "snarky chat about the stupidity of war and governments that encourage war" [...] nor is it Grey's Anatomy-on-the-front-lines as there are no [...] "lurid romantic entanglements". Doyle goes on to say, [...] "It's the horrors {{of war and the}} awfulness of a combat hospital seen emphatically through the prism of TV drama." [...] In concluding his review Doyle said, [...] "In the matter of Afghanistan and military life there, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> gruelling experience, watch the news. Combat Hospital is the entertaining version." ...|$|E

2500|$|Less {{than a year}} later, on October 5, 1954, Seigenthaler {{once again}} made {{national}} news for his efforts in saving a suicidal man from jumping off the Shelby Street Bridge in Nashville. Gene Bradford Williams had called The Tennessean saying he would jump and for the newspaper to [...] "send a reporter and photographer <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> story." [...] After talking to Williams at the bridge for 40 minutes, Seigenthaler watched the man begin to attempt his 100-foot plunge off the bridge railing. Grabbing hold of his collar, Seigenthaler and police saved the man from falling into the Cumberland River. Williams muttered [...] "I'll never forgive you" [...] to Seigenthaler. On April 29, 2014, the bridge was renamed the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Lavalle was a {{frequent}} critic of soccer, including the 1994 FIFA World Cup. [...] Before the event, Lavalle's surveys had claimed that soccer was less popular than sports like college wrestling, log rolling, skeet shooting and dog racing, and that the World Cup organizers had botched the event. [...] Afterwards, the New York and LA Times quoted Lavalle as saying [...] "for World Cup soccer worldwide, the World Cup gets a grade A; for staging of the World Cup in America, it gets a grade A. But {{for the future of}} soccer in America, the grade is incomplete. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> prediction, it seems like the term paper will be turned in and it will get a failing grade. To say that it will ever be on par with hockey or golf or even wrestling is way off the mark." [...] About the launch of Major League Soccer, Lavalle was quoted as saying in 1994 [...] "There is no chance it will survive. [...] Absolutely no chance whatsoever." ...|$|E
