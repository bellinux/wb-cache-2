McCarthy also began investigations into the numerous homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the Soviets.

25|$|Lieberman's {{embrace of}} certain {{conservative}} policies {{and in particular}} his endorsement of John McCain have been cited as factors for <b>his</b> high <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> among Republicans in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance, this however is also cited for <b>his</b> mediocre <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving.|$|R

25|$|Roh got public {{attention}} when {{he participated in}} candidate election of his party. The candidate election itself also got high {{public attention}} because it allowed the vote {{not only from the}} party members, but also the local citizens. At first, <b>his</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rate</b> was 10%, allowing much gap with leading candidate Lee In-Jae, but Roh constantly earned much supporters by his notable speeches, especially in Ulsan, and the result of poll that Roh's <b>approval</b> <b>rate</b> was 41.7%, 1.1% higher than the Lee Hoi-chang, candidate of the opponent party, convinced the voters of his party.|$|R
5|$|The Governor had a 61percent job {{approval}} rating in public polls after his initial fiscal actions in 2003, although <b>his</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> subsequently declined, driven {{in part by}} his frequent out-of-state travel. Romney's approval rating stood at 34percent in November 2006, ranking 48th of the 50 U.S. governors. Dissatisfaction with Romney's administration and the weak condition of the Republican state party were among several factors contributing to Democrat Deval Patrick's 20-point win over Republican Kerry Healey, Romney's lieutenant governor, in the 2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election.|$|E
5|$|The attempt {{had great}} {{influence}} on Reagan's popularity; polls indicated <b>his</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> {{to be around}} 73%. Reagan believed that God had spared his life {{so that he might}} go on to fulfill a greater purpose and, although not a Catholic, meetings with Mother Teresa, Cardinal Terence Cooke, and fellow shooting survivor Pope John Paul II reinforced his belief. Agent Parr came to believe that God had directed his life to save Reagan, and became a pastor.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, <b>his</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E

25|$|Since this {{conspicuous}} failure, Schwarzenegger made a {{turn back}} to the left, criticizing the Bush Administration at many junctures, reviving his environmental agenda, and compromising with the legislature on the traditionally Democratic issue of education spending. <b>His</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> also revived, and he was re-elected in 2006. However, continued paralysis in state government and the inability of the legislature and governor to work out the fundamental funding questions resulted in voter disapproval of both the legislators and the governor, whose approval rating was among the lowest ever recorded pending the election of Jerry Brown in November 2010.|$|E
25|$|When the California {{electricity}} crisis {{slammed the}} state in 2001, Davis was blasted for his slow and ineffective response. <b>His</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> dropped into the 30s and never recovered. When the energy crisis settled down, Davis's administration {{was hit with a}} fund-raising scandal. California had a $95 million contract with Oracle Corporation that was found to be unnecessary and overpriced by the state auditor. Three of Davis's aides were fired or resigned after it was revealed that the governor's technology adviser accepted a $25,000 campaign contribution shortly after the contract was signed. The money was returned, but the scandal fueled close scrutiny of Davis's fundraising for his 2002 re-election bid.|$|E
50|$|Reed was re-elected in a landslide, {{as he was}} in 2002, {{most likely}} due to his {{popularity}} among his constituents (<b>his</b> job <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> is almost 70%) and the fact that Rhode Island is an overwhelmingly Democratic state.

25|$|The Far Right – The National Front, long {{dismissed}} as a fringe party, stunned many when its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, reached {{the second round of}} the 2002 elections. Le Pen's points of focus – law and order and immigration – are now openly taken up by politicians such as Nicolas Sarkozy. Ironically, Le Pen on 12 April criticised Sarkozy for being Hungarian and asked if he should run for the president of Hungary. Le Pen is 79 years old, the same age which Charles de Gaulle was when he stepped down from the presidency in 1969. <b>His</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> in opinion polls markedly increased after France's riots in 2005. As a counterweight, the Left and the cultural elite and athletes (like Lilian Thuram) have risen to oppose Sarkozy's response to the riots.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{approval}} ratings were around 80percent during the Gulf War, {{and he was}} described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his , which hurt <b>his</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating.</b> Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw <b>his</b> <b>approval</b> <b>rating</b> plummet to just slightly over 40percent. Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but {{with the end of}} the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated. Clinton then pointed to his moderate, [...] "New Democrat" [...] record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton. Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a [...] "new beginning".|$|E
500|$|After {{taking office}} in January 2006, Corzine's {{approval}} numbers were very low.

A February 28, 2007, poll from Quinnipiac University showed Corzine at 50% approval with 34% disapproval.
