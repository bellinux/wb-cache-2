25|$|Therefore, for {{the first}} metamaterial, {{the nuts and bolts}} are one split-ring {{resonator}} electromagnetically combined with one (electric) conducting post. These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the split ring, the associated magnetic <b>field</b> <b>pattern</b> from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such as in this case at 2.5 millimeters. Atoms exist on the scale of picometers.|$|E

They have no velocity on their own. To illustrate, imagine that one were to take a magnet and flip it 180 degrees. The result of assuming that these field lines actually have velocity of their own would be that magnetic field lines far away would swing to the other side, potentially faster {{than the speed of}} light, however, that is not what happens.|$|E

25|$|The far <b>field</b> <b>pattern</b> is thus seen {{to consist}} of a {{transverse}} electromagnetic (TEM) wave, with electric and magnetic fields {{at right angles to}} each other and at right angles to the direction of propagation (the direction of r, as we assumed the source to be at the origin). The electric polarization, in the θ direction, is coplanar with the source current (in the Z direction), while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the φ direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly in phase. Both fields fall according to 1/r, with the power thus falling according to 1/r2 as dictated by the inverse square law.|$|E

40|$|In this work, we are {{concerned}} with the inverse scattering by obstacles for the linearized, homogeneous and isotropic elastic model. We study the uniqueness issue of detecting smooth obstacles from the knowledge of elastic far <b>field</b> <b>patterns.</b> We prove that the 'pressure' parts of the far <b>field</b> <b>patterns</b> over all directions of measurements corresponding to all 'pressure' (or all 'shear') incident plane waves are enough to guarantee uniqueness. We also establish that the shear parts of the far <b>field</b> <b>patterns</b> corresponding to all the 'shear' (or all 'pressure') incident waves are also enough. This shows that any of the two difierent types of waves is enough to detect obstacles at a fixed frequency.

40|$|Abstract — Simulating the {{electromagnetic}} <b>field</b> <b>patterns</b> generated by integrated antennas used in mobile phones, for example, {{is fundamental to}} understanding their transmission characteristics and thereby engineering designs that optimise the directional properties of electromagnetic propagation. Modern integrated antennas have complex three-dimensional geometry designed to optimise their performance {{in terms of their}} multi-band and multi-modal attributes. This geometry, coupled with their close proximity to other component of the device (such as the battery and Printed Circuit Board, for example) produce complex <b>field</b> <b>patterns</b> due to the scattering of the electric (and magnetic) field within a spatial domain that is the same order of scale as the wavelength...|$|R

The desired <b>field</b> <b>patterns</b> of the antenna were synthesized using the maximum directivity beam-forming algorithm which enables an optimum radio link to a selected mobile terminal to be created while the signals of other terminals are suppressed by the nulls of the antenna's field distribution. The 60 GHz signals were generated by optically heterodyning the signals of two laser diodes. The field distribution of the antenna was formed by a silica based photonic beam-forming network. The experimentally obtained data confirmed the calculated <b>field</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
30|$|Considering the far <b>field</b> <b>patterns</b> in Fig.  4 and the {{optimization}} model in Eq. (7), {{it can be}} seen that although the constraints of the other electromagnetic performance such as sidelobe levels and cross-polarization are not added in the {{optimization model}}, the simulation result in Fig.  4 shows very satisfactory far <b>field</b> <b>patterns</b> in sidelobes and cross-polarization pattern. This can be explained that the effects of surface error on boresight directivity and the other performance are harmonious; the nonuniform phase distribution will produce a lower directivity and higher sidelobe levels; as the phase distribution across the reflector aperture becomes more uniform, the antenna electromagnetic performance including boresight directivity, sidelobe levels and cross-polarization will become better.|$|R
