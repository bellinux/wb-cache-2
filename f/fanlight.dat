5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple wooden raking cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} corbel brick pendant. A semicircular <b>fanlight,</b> or lunette, {{is located in the}} center of the gable of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may have been based on the <b>fanlight</b> of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was altered in 1890, with two additions of Victorian architecture, the first being the main entrance, above the <b>fanlight,</b> is an arched awning with incised consoles. The other addition was the octagonal cupola {{on the roof}} over the original bell tower which dates from 1830. The exterior of the school has complementary colors. The walls are painted a cream color while the foundation, doors, window trims, and cornices are a chocolate-brown.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large <b>fanlight</b> opened by a round window. On its side were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, one over the other. A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground floor}} front {{elevation}} has an asymmetrical design with four original double timber and glazed casement doors with <b>fanlights</b> {{over to the}} west of the principal access door, and two modern solid timber doors with <b>fanlights</b> to the east. The splayed corner of the building has a modern timber door, while the side elevation to Jane Street has two modern solid timber doors with <b>fanlights</b> over. The west end elevation is of solid brick, while the rear elevation has three door openings and a window.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} has paired sash windows with {{segmental}} arched <b>fanlights</b> and expressed rendered mouldings to each bay, with the centre bay to East Street having {{two sets of}} paired sash windows.

5|$|Norfolk {{was burned}} down during the Revolutionary War. After the Revolution, Norfolk was rebuilt in the Federal style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, {{though they had}} more refined decorations to look like New World homes. Federal homes had {{features}} such as narrow sidelights with an embracing <b>fanlight</b> around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal rowhouses remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass <b>fanlight</b> depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E
5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have {{recessed}} brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance {{with a pair of}} oversized double wood doors beneath a <b>fanlight.</b> The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E
50|$|Two {{concrete}} steps and a recessed concrete paved portico flanked by four Tuscan columns form {{the entrance to}} the building from Mellor Street. Original exterior joinery generally survives to all elevations with original obscure glazing to all <b>fanlights</b> and doors. Windows generally comprise single or paired six-light timber casements with two or four-light <b>fanlights</b> above respectively and timber sills. The bathroom in the south-east corner has a smaller pair of four-light casements. Original doors comprise a six-light French entrance door, a six-light high waist rear door and a four-light high waist female public toilet door, all with four-light <b>fanlights</b> above. Some <b>fanlights</b> have been removed to accommodate air conditioning units with fixed aluminium louvred awnings over and the single casement toilet window on the north-east elevation has been infilled.|$|R
50|$|All {{rooms are}} in largely {{original}} condition, the only changes being to external <b>fanlights</b> to accommodate air conditioners {{and the internal}} fretwork <b>fanlights</b> being covered over. The rooms on the outside corner are larger than the others while the room on the inside corner is totally enclosed but has a central skylight (now covered).|$|R
50|$|Throughout the building, the {{brickwork}} has finely-shaped {{corners and}} the rendered walls have stop-chamfering. Verandahs run {{the length of}} the rear elevations giving access to the rooms and to concrete stairs {{at each end of the}} building. The stairs have decorative iron balustrades and timber handrails. The floors of the circulation areas are polished concrete with a painted margin. The walls are face brick and parts retain original ceilings of sheets and battens in a decorative pattern. The verandah wall retains some original timber, double-hung sash windows with <b>fanlights</b> into the classrooms. Air conditioning units have been wall-mounted on the verandah wall and penetrations have been made by removing <b>fanlights.</b> Some doors into the classrooms are original timber double-leaf doors with <b>fanlights.</b>|$|R
5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane <b>fanlight</b> and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house. The property also had a dairy barn that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
25|$|The last {{house in}} the row, the Vincent and Helen Astor House at 130 East 80th, {{is the only one}} not of brick. It is a five-story, three-bay Neo-Adamesque {{building}} faced in French limestone laid in an ashlar pattern. It shares classical detailing with the two houses to the west. The entrance, two paneled doors surmounted by a <b>fanlight,</b> is sheltered by a small portico supported by Ionic columns. The window above echoes the <b>fanlight</b> with a blind arch, and on either side two-story Ionic pilasters support a full entablature with dentil course and four paterae. Above it a pediment with gently pitched slate roof runs the full width of the house.|$|E
25|$|Within the verandah, four bays are {{organized}} into an ABA rhythm of two paired, central bays flanked by singular bays at the extremes. Each bay is intricately {{articulated in the}} same manner: a circular arch defined by an ornate hood mould with floral and festoon plaster ornament above. Each bay contains wooden, louvered double-doors with ornate leaded glass panels and a stained-glass <b>fanlight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has vertically joined boarding to walls and boarded ceilings. Doors have <b>fanlights</b> and windows are mostly timber sashes.|$|R

The central entrance arch cuts the podium and houses intricately carved hardwood doors and a stained-glass <b>fanlight</b> protected by decorative wrought iron railings. Bays 1 and 3 both consist of paired arches, located above the podium and articulated in an ionic pilaster order. Each arch-window houses folding jalousie shutters.|$|E
25|$|Meantime, I {{had found}} me {{quarters}} in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six {{years ago was}} primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk I could look out of my window through the <b>fanlight</b> of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower {{walked up and down}} with his traffic.|$|E
