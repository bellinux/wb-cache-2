Donning {{the black}} leotard and accessories {{used in the}} music video, Cyrus appeared in a human-sized cage and then performed throughout the stage with many costumed backup dancers; Cyrus' dancing was minimal. Her first performance of the song outside the United States was at the Rock in Rio concert in Lisbon, Portugal on May 29, 2010. Cyrus appeared on June 1, 2010 at the Paris, France nightclub 1515 Club and on June 3, 2010 on Britain's Got Talents semifinals to perform [...] "Can't Be Tamed". On the latter, Cyrus wore hot pants, fishnets and boots as she performed. Midway through the performance, Cyrus grabbed a female backup dancer, dipping her low, and simulated a kiss. The performance was met with negative reactions from the media and caused her to release a statement in which Cyrus promised she did not kiss the backup dancer.

In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>hope</b> so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program. Of Chloe's [...] "heartbroken" [...] reaction to his [...] "death" [...] in spite of the bitter break-up, Hendrickson said, [...] "to open up and show what was going on with her was a great release for me, because that entire time she was remaining strong and stable, and like no one is going to mess with her.

Harry Venning of The Stage praised Davies' script, particularly for taking it seriously and making it scary. He was pleased with Piper's acting and Rose, who proved to be more independent than her predecessors. However, he felt that Eccleston was [...] "the show's biggest disappointment" [...] as he seemed unsuited to a fantasy role. Digital Spy's Dek Hogan stated that production values had increased from the classic series, and praised the acting and characters of Eccleston, Piper, and Clarke. However, he felt that some of the humour— such as the wheelie bin burping after it consumes Mickey— was not as enjoyable as an adult. The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Robin Oliver praised Davies for [...] " [...] an adult approach to one of television's most famous characters" [...] and [...] " [...] the cash-strapped production values of the past to make his new doctor competitive in a high-tech market". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times described the revival as [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "intelligent and well-done". Daily Mail writer Michael Hanlon said that [...] "As a fan <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>hope</b> this new series succeeds. It's lively, well filmed and the special effects are up to scratch. There is humour, a vital ingredient if the new series is to be a success." [...] He also felt that everything necessary for Doctor Who was present in [...] "Rose". However, Stephen Brook of The Guardian said that it was [...] "pitched at its youngest ever audience", and also felt that the episode had an [...] "overdose on humour".|$|E

Reportedly paid Rs.31.5m (£367,500GBP) for her participation, she said to presenter Davina McCall, [...] "I just want every Indian to be extremely proud that I'm in here". As for her participation, she stated: [...] "I have zero expectations. The only thing <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>hope</b> to keep is my self-respect and my dignity."

[...] During her stay on the show, Shetty instructed fellow housemates Carole Malone and Ken Russell in meditation, and flirted with Dirk Benedict but tempers started to fray by Day 7 as a clique formed in the house disapproving of Shilpa's presence. Following a worldwide controversy that publicised her as a target of racist bullying within the house, Shetty won the contest after gaining 63% of the public vote and described the experience as [...] "incredible and overwhelming". She further thanked the public for [...] "a fantastic opportunity to make my country proud".|$|E
