40|$|The {{objective}} of this task was to enhance the capability of the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) by expanding its reach into the high-fidelity multidisciplinary analysis area. This task investigated numerical techniques to convert between cold static to <b>hot</b> <b>running</b> geometry of compressor blades. Numerical calculations of blade deformations were iteratively done with high fidelity flow simulations together with high fidelity structural analysis of the compressor blade. The flow simulations were performed with the Advanced Ducted Propfan Analysis (ADPAC) code, while structural analyses were performed with the ANSYS code. High fidelity analyses were {{used to evaluate the}} effects on performance of: variations in tip clearance, uncertainty in manufacturing tolerance, variable inlet guide vane scheduling, and the effects of rotational speed on the <b>hot</b> <b>running</b> geometry of the compressor blades...|$|R

40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the structure and}} usage of the computer program PLUG, which simulates the behavior of plug flow chemical reactors. More specifically, the code is designed to model the non-dispersive one-dimensional flow of a chemically reacting ideal gas mixture in a conduit of essentially arbitrary geometry. The code makes use of the CHEMKIN and SURFACE CHEMKIN software packages to handle gas-phase and heterogeneous kinetics as well as thermodynamic properties. In addition, the standard implicit code DASSL is used to solve the set of differential/algebraic equations describing the reactor. These equations are briefly discussed here, after which the procedures for <b>running</b> <b>PLUG</b> are described in some detail. Input and output files for a sample problem involving chemical vapor deposition are given...|$|R

50|$|For many working-class people, this housing model {{provided}} {{their first}} experience of private indoor toilets, private bathrooms and <b>hot</b> <b>running</b> water, {{as well as}} gardens and electric lighting. For tenants in England and Wales it also usually provided the first experience of private garden space (usually front and rear).

50|$|The {{service unit}} also {{contained}} {{a number of}} innovations for occupants. The house retained a coal-fire, but it contained a back boiler to create both central heating {{as well as a}} constant supply of hot water. For a country used to the pleasures of the outside lavatory and tin bath, the bathroom included a flushing toilet and man-sized bath with <b>hot</b> <b>running</b> water. In the kitchen were housed such modern luxuries as a built-in oven, refrigerator and baxi water heater: items we now take for granted.|$|R

However, she was cleared on appeal by the IAAF in September 2012, as the local injection which Sumgong had received was permitted under the governing body's rules. Cleared to race, Sumgong again finished behind Cherop at that year's Philadelphia Half Marathon, taking third place.|$|R
