40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{coverage}} and exploration of unknown and mined spaces is investigated using a team of robots. The goal is to propose a strategy capable to minimize the overall exploration and <b>mine</b> <b>disarming</b> time, while avoiding that robots pass many times through the same places. The key {{problem is that the}} robots simultaneously have to explore different regions of the environment and for this reason they should spread among the search areas. However, at the same time, when a mine is discovered, more robots are needed to be engaged in order to <b>disarm</b> the <b>mine.</b> Because {{the problem of}} the unknown lands with the constraint to <b>disarm</b> <b>mine</b> is a NP hard problem, we proposed a combined approach using two bio-inspired meta-heuristic approaches such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Firefly algorithm (FA) to perform the coordination task among robots. We have compared the simulation results considering a common exploration task of the robot spreading and an ACO based robot recruiting(ATS-RR) and Firefly inspired (FTS-RR) strategies to perform the <b>mine</b> <b>disarming</b> task. Performance has been evaluated in terms of both overall exploring time and <b>mine</b> <b>disarming</b> time and in terms of number of accesses distributed in the operative grid area. The results show that the combined approach provides a better tool for both exploration and disarmament...|$|R

As the Canadians fought through Sicily, Italy, then France and Holland, the Engineers reconnoitered the ground over which the armies advanced, crossed rivers, built roads and bridges, located and <b>disarmed</b> <b>mines</b> and booby-traps, built communications networks and constructed field defences.|$|R
50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Crabb was first an army gunner. Then, in 1941, he joined the Royal Navy. The next year he was sent to Gibraltar where he worked in a mine and bomb disposal unit to remove the Italian limpet mines that enemy divers had attached to the hulls of Allied ships. Initially, Crabb's job was to <b>disarm</b> <b>mines</b> that British divers removed, but eventually he decided to learn to dive.|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for the war against Japan, he established the RAE Training Centre at Kapooka, New South Wales and increased {{the size of the}} School of Military Engineering at Liverpool, which trained sappers who <b>disarmed</b> <b>mines,</b> demolished obstacles, provided water supplies and other services to military camps, cut and milled timber, built huts, roads, bridges, railways, airfields and wharves, and operated the army's water-transport vessels. With the reorganisation of Land Headquarters in October 1943, fortifications, works, engineer stores and transport were added to Steele's responsibilities. During 1944 or 1945 he personally designed the heavy lift ship Crusader. On 12 March 1946 he transferred to the Reserve of Officers.|$|R

50|$|For {{the most}} part, early Navy divers were {{swimmers}} and skin divers, with techniques and missions unchanged {{since the days}} of Alexander the Great. During the Civil War Battle of Mobile Bay, swimmers were sent in ahead of Admiral Farragut's ships to locate and <b>disarm</b> Confederate <b>mines</b> that had been planted to block the entrance to the bay.|$|R
25|$|Between 7:30 and 8PM, Collins' convoy {{approached}} Béal na Bláth for {{the second}} time. By then most of the ambush party had dispersed and gone for the day, leaving just five or six men on the scene. Two were <b>disarming</b> a <b>mine</b> in the road, while three on a laneway overlooking them, provided cover. A dray cart, placed across the road, remained {{at the far end}} of the ambush site.|$|R
25|$|In the 1970s, China had {{successfully}} developed non-contact fuses {{such as the}} acoustic fuse, and earlier contact fuse equipped mines were upgraded with non-contact fuses. Also in 1970, Fengxi Machinery Factory and Engineering Technology Equipment Research Institute begun to jointly develop a riverine moored mine that can be remotely controlled fuse. The project was completed in 1974, and the ultrasonic remote control can be either used to arm or <b>disarm</b> the <b>mines,</b> or alternatively, directly detonate the mine.|$|R
50|$|Initially Reed's efforts {{seem to be}} working, but {{an alien}} vessel {{suddenly}} decloaks, and fires warning shots at the ship. Ensign Mayweather assumes manual control and steers the ship carefully out of the minefield. During the maneuvers, however, a jolt accidentally activates another magnetic grappling arm that impales Reed's leg before attaching itself to the spaceship's hull, thus pinning him down. Archer also dons an EVA suit and attempts to <b>disarm</b> the <b>mine</b> under Reed's direction.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of 20/21 September 1940, four {{parachute}} mines fell on Dagenham but only one exploded. Moore, working alongside Chief Petty Officer George Wheeler, examined one of the unexploded bombs with a very damaged fuse ring {{which could not be}} removed. Moore used a borrowed drill to drill either side of the fuse so it broke in half and could be extracted. He was removing the mine's magnetic trigger when Ryan arrived after <b>disarming</b> another <b>mine.</b>|$|R

50|$|Also {{similar to}} the original, the {{characters}} available {{for use by the}} player each occupy a specific class - an exception is the main character Avan who can freely move between classes.Valkyria Chronicles II features new class types and the ability of units to change their class based on a branching tree of upgrades. All five original classes from Valkyria Chronicles reappear, some with slight modification. Scouts, Shocktroopers, Engineers, and Lancers act as the base units that lead to more powerful and specialized promotions. Snipers, rather than being a starting class, {{are a part of the}} Scout's upgrade potential. The final base class is new to the series. The Armored Tech class can <b>disarm</b> <b>mines</b> and carry large shields that can deflect rifle and machine gun fire. Armored soldiers do not carry a firearm, instead wielding a hammer to strike enemies. From these five base unit classes, individual units can use experience earned from completing missions to move into more advanced forms. Advantages garnered from upgrading class range from new weapon types to increased effectiveness against tanks to special abilities. The player has access to a tank. The tank has an increased amount of customization potential, being able to increase its firepower and armor, or be stripped down into a simple armored car.|$|R

5000|$|Of the {{two types}} of pressure-fuze {{available}} for Teller mines, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze was notable for featuring an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze is inserted and the pressure plate (or screw cap) is screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin inside the fuze with an audible [...] "snap". This action arms the anti-handling device.

50|$|It is {{considered}} extremely dangerous to <b>disarm</b> PMN <b>mines</b> {{by removing the}} fuze, unless they have only recently been laid and are in good condition. Even {{if this is the}} case, {{what appears to be a}} standard PMN-1 mine may in fact be the PMN-3 or MC-3 versions, which feature an integral anti-handling device which is specifically designed to kill deminers. In any case it is very easy to boobytrap a standard PMN mine by attaching a pull-fuze to it, or by placing an ML-7 pressure-release antihandling device underneath. Therefore, the standard render-safe procedure for PMN mines is to destroy them in situ using a small explosive charge.|$|R
5|$|On 30 September 1922, Tokiwa {{began her}} {{conversion}} into a minelayer at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. To accommodate her 200–300 mines, her rear 8-inch gun turret removed, {{as were the}} six 6-inch guns on the main deck. In addition, the number of light guns was reduced to two 12-pounders, although two 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. These modifications were completed in March 1924. The ship's stern suffered substantial damage in an accidental explosion in Saiki Bay on 1 August 1927 when fuzed <b>mines</b> were being <b>disarmed.</b> One <b>mine</b> detonated and then several others followed, killing 35 crewmen and wounding 65.

50|$|The British {{experienced}} {{a stroke of}} luck in November 1939 when a German mine was dropped from an aircraft onto the mud flats off Shoeburyness during low tide. Additionally, the land belonged to the army and a base with men and workshops was at hand. Experts were dispatched from HMS Vernon to investigate the mine. They had some idea that the mines could use magnetic sensors, so everyone removed all metal, including their buttons, and made tools of non-magnetic brass. They <b>disarmed</b> the <b>mine</b> and rushed it to labs at HMS Vernon, where scientists discovered {{a new type of}} arming mechanism. A large ferrous object passing through the Earth's magnetic field will concentrate the field through it; the mine's detector was designed to trigger as a ship passed over, when its magnetic field was concentrated as measured by the mine. The mechanism had an adjustable sensitivity, calibrated in milligauss. (As it turned out, the German firing mechanism was overly sensitive, making sweeping easier.) The U.S. began adding delay counters to their magnetic mines in June 1945.|$|R

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, Sampson worked to control {{government}} costs, but endorsed highway progression. A severe drought in 1930 left 86 of Kentucky's counties applying for federal aid. As unemployment in the eastern coal fields climbed to 40 percent, the United Mine Workers made their first inroads in the region. In 1931, mine owners began firing workers who joined the union. Many of these workers gathered in Evarts, Kentucky. The local sheriff added 26 deputies to his staff, helping enforce the blacklisting of these miners and discourage further organization. Union leaders petitioned Sampson to remove the sheriff and the county judge from office. Violent squabbles between striking union miners and local authorities began as early as mid-April 1931. On May 5, 1931, three guards and a miner were killed in a shootout that became known as the Battle of Evarts. Two days later, Sampson called in the National Guard to <b>disarm</b> both the <b>mine</b> guards and the union miners. All of the union's leaders were arrested, and the strike ultimately failed.|$|R
