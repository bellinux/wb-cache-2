5|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>operations</b> in Normandy were {{controlled}} by Montgomery at first, but SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th Army Group and Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Smith {{soon realized that}} he had made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible, and it lacked the necessary communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{operated}} {{in support of}} Army Group Centre, commanded by Fedor von Bock, continuing the close working relationship between the two.

5|$|At {{positions}} west of Hill 881 South {{and north}} of Co Roc Ridge, {{across the border in}} Laos, the North Vietnamese established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its <b>ground</b> <b>operations.</b> The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered <b>ground</b> <b>operations</b> from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and air supply missions.|$|E
5|$|In this period, Gaddafi {{expanded}} his control over northern Chad, building new roads and erecting {{a major new}} airbase, Ouadi Doum, meant to better support air and <b>ground</b> <b>operations</b> beyond the Aouzou Strip. He also brought in considerable reinforcements in 1985, raising Libyan forces {{in the country to}} 7,000 troops, 300 tanks and 60 combat aircraft. While this build-up took place, significant elements of the GUNT passed over to the Habr√© government, as part of the latter's policy of accommodation.|$|E

5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for <b>ground</b> <b>operations.</b> Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, that number had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian <b>ground</b> <b>operations.</b> The RLAF attempted {{to make up for}} the diminishing number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 that number increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E
5|$|In {{early to}} mid-2009, several {{narcotics}} and bomb-making facilities were raided by British forces, supported by Apaches. In April 2009, {{it was reported}} that an Apache had been used to intercept a suicide bombing attack in Helmand province. During the Summer of 2009, British Apaches were an integral component of Operation Panther's Claw, which was aimed at pushing insurgents out of civilian areas in the runup to the 2009 Afghan Elections. During this major offensive, Apaches from the UK routinely flew alongside US Cobra helicopters to provide air support to soldiers of 3rd Battalion Black Watch and the Royal Marines conducting <b>ground</b> <b>operations.</b> During the Summer 2009 operations, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Mansur, and several accomplices were killed in a precision strike launched by an Apache.|$|E

5|$|Reaction in the U.S. Congress to the {{incursion}} {{was also}} swift. Senators Frank F. Church (Democratic Party, Idaho) and John S. Cooper (Republican Party, Kentucky), proposed {{an amendment to}} the Foreign Military Sales Act that would have cut off funding not only for U.S. <b>ground</b> <b>operations</b> and advisors in Cambodia, but would also have ended U.S. air support for Cambodian forces. On 30 June the United States Senate passed the act with the amendment included. The bill was defeated in the House of Representatives after U.S. forces were withdrawn from Cambodia as scheduled. The newly amended act did, however, rescind the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) under which Presidents Johnson and Nixon had conducted military operations for seven years without a declaration of war.|$|E
5|$|The Army is {{organised}} into three main elements which {{report to the}} Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large scale <b>ground</b> <b>operations.</b> It {{does not have any}} combat units permanently assigned to it, though it commands units during training activities and the Land Combat Readiness Centre reports to the divisional headquarters. Most of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their readiness and preparing them for operations. This organisation came into effect during January 2011; before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{complexion}} of the American {{effort was}} altered on 8 March 1965, when 3,500 U.S. Marines came ashore at Da Nang, ostensibly {{to defend the}} southern airfields committed to prosecuting Rolling Thunder. The mission of the ground forces was expanded to combat operations and, from that point onward, the aerial campaign became a secondary operation, overwhelmed by troop deployments and the escalation of <b>ground</b> <b>operations</b> in South Vietnam. Until {{the third week of}} April, Rolling Thunder had enjoyed at least equal status with air missions conducted in the south. After that time, strikes that interfered with requirements for the southern battlefield were either cut back or cancelled.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{departed}} on 1 September to refuel, but did {{not return}} to the Shanghai area. Accompanied by Ry≈´j≈ç, she sailed to the South China coast and began operations against Chinese forces near Canton on 21 September. On that day, H≈çsh≈ç contributed six fighters to escort bombers attacking airfields at Tienho and Paiyun. They claimed six enemy aircraft shot down, but the range proved to be too long. Five of the fighters ran out of fuel and had to ditch in the sea, although the aircrews were rescued. H≈çsh≈ç and Ry≈´j≈ç bombers continued with almost daily attack missions until the end of September. H≈çsh≈ç and Ry≈´j≈ç returned to the Shanghai area on 3 October and H≈çsh≈ç's aircraft were temporarily transferred to Kunda airfield to support <b>ground</b> <b>operations.</b> On 17 October, H≈çsh≈ç transferred all of her aircraft to Ry≈´j≈ç and returned to Japan.|$|E
5|$|With air {{supremacy}} attained, Luftflotte 2 turned to support of <b>ground</b> <b>operations,</b> particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the rapid advance was not possible. When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw {{the full weight}} of his force against them. Now that the Army was convinced of the value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army‚Äìair cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during <b>ground</b> <b>operations.</b> The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
