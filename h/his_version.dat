5|$|This {{movement}} {{was not part}} of Rossini's original version for two pianos and harmonium, but he inserted it in <b>his</b> <b>version</b> for orchestra. He transposed an earlier composition. It became customary to include it even in performances and editions with piano(s).|$|E
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. <b>His</b> <b>version</b> put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E
5|$|In 1704, Keiser, seeking {{refuge from}} his creditors, {{temporarily}} left Hamburg for Weissenfels in Saxony, near {{to his hometown}} Teuchern. He took with him his donkey and his most recent opera composition, Almira, a setting of a libretto by Friedrich Christian Feustking, thus denying this work to the Gänsemarkt—Keiser produced it in Weissenfels in July 1704. In these circumstances the temporary management turned to the 19-year-old Handel and requested a fresh setting of Feustking's libretto. Handel complied; <b>his</b> <b>version</b> was premiered at the Gänsemarkt on 8 January 1705, and ran for 20 performances—a marked success.|$|E

5|$|Japanese theatre styles {{have been}} applied to The Tempest. In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of The Tempest to the UK. It was staged as a {{rehearsal}} of a Noh drama, with a traditional Noh theatre {{at the back of}} the stage, but also using elements which were at odds with Noh conventions. In 1992, Minoru Fujita presented a Bunraku (Japanese puppet) version in Osaka and at the Tokyo Globe.|$|E
5|$|Maes {{stated that}} time proved Rimsky-Korsakov correct {{when it came}} to posterity's re-evaluation of Mussorgsky's work. Mussorgsky's musical style, once {{considered}} unpolished, is now admired for its originality. While Rimsky-Korsakov's arrangement of Night on Bald Mountain is still the version generally performed, Rimsky-Korsakov's other revisions, like <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of Boris Godunov, have been replaced by Mussorgsky's original.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{versions}} of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but in 1973 David H. Ahl released BASIC Computer Games, a book of games written in the BASIC programming language and the first million-selling computer book, which included <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of The Sumer Game. This expanded version of the game, titled Hamurabi, quickly became the more prominent version due to the popularity of both {{the book and the}} programming language. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is also an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E

An alternative rock cover of the song by The Prayers was included on the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation Through the Wilderness.|$|E
5|$|While Ovid's {{retelling of}} the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8. Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In <b>his</b> <b>version,</b> Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version {{of the myth}}, it {{is the basis for}} many later works.|$|E
5|$|With Grisélidis and Cendrillon complete, {{though still}} {{awaiting}} performance, Massenet {{began work on}} Sapho, based on a novel by Daudet about the love of an innocent young man from {{the country for a}} worldly-wise Parisienne. It was given at the Opéra-Comique in November 1897, with great success, though it has been neglected since the composer's death. His next work staged there was Cendrillon, <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of the Cinderella story, which was well received in May 1899.|$|E

50|$|Due to what Caldwell has {{cited in}} {{interviews}} as {{a lower cost}} of use than the original recordings, <b>his</b> <b>versions</b> of big band standards have appeared in several films. Examples include 2002's LakeBoat and 2001's S1m0ne.|$|R

5|$|Abu-Jamal did {{not make}} any public {{statements}} about Faulkner's murder until May 2001. In <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of events, he claimed that {{he was sitting in}} his cab across the street when he heard shouting, then saw a police vehicle, and heard the sound of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer. Abu-Jamal's brother William Cook, who had been stopped by the police officer, did not testify or make any statement until April 29, 2001. At that time {{he said that he had}} not seen who had shot Faulkner.|$|E
5|$|Boyd closely based <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of the Bond {{character}} on Ian Fleming's, and eschewed {{any of the}} film versions. The novel is set in 1969—six years after Fleming's last work was set—and Bond is 45 years old. Boyd was raised in Nigeria and used his experiences {{during the civil war}} to provide the location for the novel. He has been a Bond fan since his youth and, in preparation for writing the novel he read all the Bond stories in chronological order. It took 18 months to write the novel, with some friction between Boyd and the Fleming estate over the portrayal of Bond.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{covered the}} song on his fifteenth studio album Confidencias (2013) and {{features}} American recording artist Christina Aguilera as the guest artist.

5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a major at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of events.|$|E
5|$|Habes al-Majali {{is quoted}} as the only Arab {{commander}} to have defeated the Israelis in 1948 and who restored a little honour to the Arabs. By <b>his</b> <b>version</b> of events, he would even have caught Ariel Sharon {{in the course of}} the battle and it is Colonel Ashton (his British superior from 3rd Brigade) would have forbidden him to use the artillery against the Burma road, action by which he could have prevented its construction. After the war, he was appointed bodyguard of Abdallah and in 1957 Chief-of-Staff of the Jordanian Army. He became Jordanian Minister of Defence in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Lloyd {{generally}} represented <b>his</b> <b>versions</b> of [...] "Reynardine" [...] as [...] "authentic" [...] folksongs (going {{so far as}} {{to claim}} to have collected the song from one [...] "Tom Cook, of Eastbridge, Suffolk"), but this informant has never apparently been encountered by any other collector. Lloyd's claims have led to the current state of confusion; few modern singers know that the [...] "werefox" [...] interpretation of the ballad is not traditional. Lloyd's reworkings are certainly more interesting to the modern listener than the simple and moralistic original ballads, and have gained far greater interest from singers and songwriters; <b>his</b> <b>versions</b> of [...] "Reynardine" [...] have served as inspiration for many additional modern reworkings.|$|R
50|$|Richmond Alexander Lattimore (May 6, 1906 - February 26, 1984) was an American {{poet and}} classicist {{known for his}} {{translations}} of the Greek classics, especially <b>his</b> <b>versions</b> of the Iliad and Odyssey, which are generally considered as among the best English translations available.|$|R
