30|$|At this point, {{it might}} be {{considered}} that migration as a conflictual parameter offers a status quo for the EU-Turkey relationship. However, {{as noted in the}} previous section, a conflictual parameter is a dynamic phenomenon which makes an institutionalization process highly sensitive to exogenous changes. Thus, when the <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flow</b> to the EU broke out due to the Syrian Civil War, the way to comprehend the immigration issue in the EU-Turkey relationship changed as well. The new international setting made the Turkish immigration issue more acceptable by the EU leaders. In particular, the EU leaders accepted the free travel of Turkish citizens across the Schengen zone even without Turkey’s full membership to the EU in return for Turkey’s admission of the Syrian refugees/asylum seekers. For example, Merkel argued that ‘[…] we have to work together more closely with Turkey {{for a number of reasons}} - just think of the civil war in Syria, the fight against Islamic State or the illegal migration’ [70]. Therefore, it could be argued that the migration issue is not only a conflictual parameter causing a drift in the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship but also a dynamic phenomenon which makes the mentioned institutionalization more open to change/uncertainty, and this is analysed in the following section.|$|E
30|$|As a {{response}} to this need, this article aims to contribute {{a new dimension to}} the theoretical discussions on the phenomena: change from an institutionalist perspective. Particularly, the article argues that an institutionalization process contains several parameters which have close connection with both endogenous and exogenous dynamics (also see [23]). Therefore, once one of these parameters evolves into a conflictual phenomenon, it has a potential to cause subtle drifts preventing stability and produce instability in an institutionalization process [24]. To make this elusive theoretical argument clearer, {{it might be a good}} strategy to focus on the European integration process. The European integration process actually contains the mentioned conflictual parameters although there are plenty of studies in the literature which associate ‘European integration’ with ‘stability’ (e.g. see [25 – 33]). To illustrate, the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship has arguably produced more instability but less stability since 1959 when Turkey applied for full membership. Moreover, if instability as a common feature of the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship is analysed further, it might be seen that migration as a conflictual parameter plays a significant role in it. For instance, although a potential Turkish migration flow is historically given as one of the main reasons behind the rejection of Turkey’s full membership to the EU, the <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flow</b> (Syrian asylum seekers) as an exogenous shock forced the EU to agree on a plan giving the Turkish citizens free travel right through the Schengen Area. Thus, the analysis of migration as a conflictual parameter in the institutionalization of the EU-Turkey relationship might provide further theoretical knowledge, which might be used to make the future of the European integration in particular and our knowledge of institutional change in general more explicable.|$|E
30|$|In {{the light}} of this functionalist method, {{especially}} after the 1990 s, Europeanization 1 emerged as a popular concept providing {{a solution to the}} problem of how a solidarity based supranational European Union could be formed (Graziano and Vink, 2012). Particularly, many scholars argued that the Europeanization of the member states is a fact in the integration process (Bache and Jordan, 2006 a, b; Börzel and Risse, 2000; Dover, 2007; Grabbe, 2006; Grigoriadis, 2009; Ladrech, 1994; Lippert et al., 2001; Mitchell, 2012). Therefore, the Europeanization process would replace solidarity with sovereignty and sovereignty as an obsolete concept would not hinder the gradually emerging supranational European political community. Under the influence of this understanding, the strength of the nation-state as the strongest political entity in the world was underestimated, and many reactions originating from the mentioned strength against the supranational institutionalization attempts were regarded as exceptional cases. For example, Britain was defined as an awkward member but the less expected the Brexit. Before the Brexit referendum, Britain was even defined as an EU member under the influence of Europeanization process (Aktipis and Oliver, 2011; Bache and Jordan, 2006 a, b; Bulmer and Burch, 2009; Dover, 2007; Mitchell, 2012; Rosamond, 2003). Euroscepticism was initially viewed as a popular flame; however, it became one of the main building blocks of the European integration process in time, and taking acquiescence of the wider public is no longer guaranteed for the integrationist elites (Flood, 2002; Usherwood and Startin, 2013). In addition to Brexit and the rise of Euroscepticism, the recent irregular migration crisis has also convincingly proved that the nation-state has a strong gravitational power in the European integration process; thus, the European integration is actually reversible contrary to the supranationalist/constructivist assumption (Kaplan, 2017). Particularly, the recent irregular migration crisis is a good indicator showing that ‘de-Europeanization’ might be a case even for the EU’s core policies when national sovereignty/interests of the member states are under threat. To illustrate, Germany, Austria, France, Denmark, and Sweden needed to take unilateral decisions to control their own national borders by suspending the Schengen Agreement as a response to the <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flow</b> in 2015 although the Schengen Agreement plays a crucial role in the institutionalization of ‘solidarity’ centred European Union (Baczynska, 2016; Traynor and Smith, 2016). On the other hand, even though the EU leaders promised Italy and Greece that the EU members should equally share the burden of the irregular migration in the name of ‘solidarity’, this promise has failed to produce meaningful results in practice due to national concerns/pressures (Ardittis, 2016; Nielsen, 2017).|$|E

40|$|Euro-Mediterranean Consortium for Applied Research on International Migration (CARIM) At the {{crossroads}} of Asia, Africa and Europe, Turkey faces <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows,</b> both as a country of destination and of transit: the <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> to the country consist mainly of transit migrants, clandestine immigrant workers, asylum seekers and refugees. In the last decade, the major <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> into Turkey have come from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, while significant numbers have also arrived from Moldova, Romania, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Georgia. Migrants from the former countries are mainly transients heading for Europe or other more developed parts of the world. They stay in Turkey only on a temporary basis. Migrants from the latter group of countries are foreign nationals who intend to work illegally in Turkey, for a limited period of time. Turkey’s position over the 1951 Geneva Convention, excluding non-European asylum seekers, further complicates the situation as non-Europeans account {{for the majority of}} asylum seekers in Turkey. Another feature of migration to Turkey is the national diversity of the immigrants: authorities in Turkey have identified 163 nationalities that have arrived in the country in the last decade. Clearly, Turkey has become a country with multiple roles in irregular migratory movements. Utilising a relatively revealing data set on the apprehending of irregular migrants provided by the security forces together with the findings of several surveys conducted in the country, this paper, first, documents the <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> experience in Turkey over the last 30 years. It also relates the phenomenon of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> in Turkey to the wider context of European international migratory regimes.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{research on}} controlling <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> has been heavily biased toward {{what can be}} defined as an excessive state determinism that obviates the role of non-state institutions and organizations in this sphere of action. Although this state determinism (state-centric approach) has been academically contested by research that has focused on reactive actions and resistance by immigrants to migration control (migrant-centric approach), the state-centric approach has obviated the role that other non-state actors play in the sphere of migration control. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze and define the ways that have been adopted to control irregular immigration to Spain over the past decade by employing an approach that transcends and complements the state-centric/migrant-centric approaches by incorporating non-state actors to the analysis (a polycentric approach). The analysis of the role of non-state organizations in controlling irregular immigration in Spain will be carried out with a focus on what has come to be refered to as “Migration Industry”, a concept that has gained a great deal of attention in migration studies as an analytical perspective that incorporates intermediate actors. Focusing on the analysis of the Spanish case, and on the so called "Control Industry and Rescue Industry", the paper will explore the role of private companies, NGO´s and other non-state actors as agents which facilitate and constrain <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> to Spain and influence the shaping of border and internal control policies and flows.

Casting an eye on the Spanish section of the external EU border, this article investigates how the illegality industry conceptualizes migrants as a source of risk to be managed, visualized and controlled.

As part of the international <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> toward and into the European Union (EU), the Chinese, particularly from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, have played a major role since the 1980 s.

40|$|While {{the control}} of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> {{and the return of}} undocumented {{migrants}} to their countries of origin has been a priority in the European migration policy since the late 2000 s, it has now achieved a new sense of urgency. The EU is faced with a double challenge: to limit <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> while keeping its borders open to people in need of international protection, in line with its traditions as well as with its own international conventions and declarations. Offering asylum to those who are persecuted or are unable to return to their countries of origin includes a set of inter-related challenges. It requires providing access to asylum (notably the information and ability to file a claim), safeguarding the fundamental rights of asylum seekers while their cases are being processed, while also ensuring that the asylum “burden” is shared among member states and that borders remain tightly controlled as regards overall <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows.</b> This policy paper takes a closer look at these challenges and offers recommendations on how to act upon them. The paper starts with an overview of numbers (of immigration flows, stocks, asylum seeking flows and estimates of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration)</b> so as to put the overall issue into perspective (How large are the <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> or asylum seeker flows? How large is the overall migrant population in the EU? What are the trends?).

40|$|The {{analytical}} and statistical services of border management organizations in Central and Eastern European countries have registered and accumulated a vast {{body of knowledge}} on the demographics and mechanisms of illegal migration over the last one-and-a-half decade. This paper attempts to tap this resource by summarising {{the results of a}} yearly survey among border guards of 17 countries. A set of quantitative indicators of illegal migration is developed, presented and interpreted, based on the answers of the border services to a series of quantitative and qualitative questions. This empirical material is used to evaluate the dynamics and pattern of illegal migration in Central and Eastern Europe on the one hand, and to examine the development of border management strategies on the other.

However, while the ethnic affiliation of the post- 1990 s migrants from Bulgaria renders them invisible as irregular migrants within scholarly migrant typologies, the same ethnic affiliation does not necessarily work to their advantage when it comes to their legal and social reception in Turkey. Based on ethnographic fieldwork that prioritizes micro-level analysis from below, the paper demonstrates that the self designated ethnic affiliation of these migrants, counterpoised against their social marginalization as “the Bulgarian” domestics, heightens the paradoxes of belonging and affects migration strategies. ...|$|R

30|$|Since 2015, the {{migration}} crisis {{has gone to}} the centre of both European and national political agendas in a time when MS were still unequally and slowly recovering their economic growth and employment rates. The Mediterranean is a critical area in the transnational circulation of people, since it is the crossroads of different routes starting from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Southwest Asia, which strengthen different South-North and South-South movements emerging from global demographic and economic unbalances (Ferreira, 2016 b, p. 88). In the recent past, the Mediterranean was already at the centre of the European political agenda due to the Arab Springs. At that time, former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the Italian president, Silvio Berlusconi, anticipated a migrant invasion that would require control and would even challenge the Schengen Agreement (Koff & Giraldo, 2015, p. 237). Migration crisis associated with international terrorism has resulted in the sudden closing of borders, as happened recently in France, the development of episodes of xenophobia and increasing populist anti-immigration narratives, revealing the incapacity of the EU and MS to create the space of tolerance and cultural diversity ambitioned in the nineties (Fulbrook & Cesarini, 1996, p. 217). Instead of centring the discussion on human rights, 2015 migration crisis debates were resting on burden-sharing and cross-Mediterranean cooperation (Klug, 2014, p. 51), also putting in evidence the absence of a collective memory of the European forced <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> before and during the WW II (Fauri, 2015). The need for better cooperation does not imply that all MS must become hosting countries. It rather means that every MS should participate in a common strategy, either by hosting immigrants and refugees, or by sparing financial, human, and structural resources. However, there are several contradictory approaches, especially between transit countries such as Italy and Greece, main hosting countries such as Germany, France and Sweden, and countries belonging to the Visegrad group, for example (Ferreira, 2016 b, pp. 91 – 93). Outside the EU, the Syrian conflict and political instability in MENA region do not seem to suggest a decrease in <b>migration</b> and refugee <b>flows</b> during the next years, which makes even more urgent to review the Dublin system (Ferreira, 2016 a, p. 2). Restrictive policies will not stop <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> in the EU and will not increase internal security in ‘EU’rope (Völkel, 2017, p. 93). So, besides border control, agreements with origin and transit countries, {{it is also important to}} create safe routes and easier legal integration options, especially to labour migrants. About asylum-seekers it is needed to speed up the procedures and the coordination between the EU and MS. Lastly, when it concerns refugees, ‘EU’rope must rely on human rights to create a strategy for relocation and burden-sharing.|$|R

40|$|Migration {{studies is}} an {{interdisciplinary}} study within a broader field of development studies {{due to its}} association with debates about development and underdevelopment. <b>Irregular</b> <b>migration</b> {{is one of the}} most significant topics in migration studies and its complex nature has attracted many scholars from around the world. Most literature on <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> has focused on its illegality and the situation of irregular migrants in the destination country and therefore, much of the previous literature on <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> only presents the process as a dangerous and abusive phenomenon for irregular migrants, and depicts brokers and agents as evil and exploitative. Public perception and policy discussions are dominated by myths, rather than facts, about debts and danger. These established myths often overshadow the reality about the impacts of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> as experienced by actual migrants and their local communities. These confused interpretations of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> highlight a need for further research. This thesis examines a case of cross-border <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> from Myanmar to Thailand in order to explore the impacts of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> in a wider field. Its main purpose is to investigate the processes and impacts of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> on families left behind in sending areas. This is achieved by employing a qualitative case study approach to gain deeper understanding of the topic in the local context, using two data collection methods: participant observation and semi-structured interviews. The study hypothesizes that <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> in the Myanmar context conforms less to the “evil” image, than to the patterns of conventional labour migration described by the “New Economics of Labour Migration” theory. The main research questions posed to achieve these aims were: What are the processes of <b>irregular</b> <b>migration?</b> What are its impacts on families left behind? How are these impacts different from the impacts resulting from legal migration? The study draws two main conclusions. First, human smuggling operations in this study’s context are based on the personal contacts, and therefore <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> is often accomplished with the help of friends, relatives or siblings of the migrants themselves and not by hostile, exploitative smugglers. Secondly, departing from the traditional notion that <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> is harmful, the findings from this study suggest that the social and economic impacts resulting from <b>irregular</b> <b>migration</b> are surprisingly similar to the impacts of conventional international migration in many respects...|$|R

In this context, this work represents {{the findings of a}} study that collects impressions and assessments of Spanish and Moroccan experts on illegal immigration between the borders of Southern Europe (Southern Andalucía) and North Africa (Northern Morocco), analyzing their impact on the economies, societies and the policies of the host and home countries. Thus, the conclusions have drawn us closer to different aspects such as the assessment of the phenomenon of immigration, the characteristics of immigrants, development in <b>migration</b> <b>flows</b> and the possible solutions to this difficult situation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, issues related to {{international}} migration are receiving increasing attention from policy makers. This reflects mainly {{the changes in the}} magnitude and composition of <b>migration</b> <b>flows.</b> Net <b>migration</b> into the EU has risen again during the period 1998 to 2003. With an overall level of around 4 per thousand, relative immigration levels into the EU appear to be at present somewhat higher than those into the US (3. 3 per thousand). High <b>irregular</b> <b>migration,</b> with estimates of the relation between regular and irregular immigration running between 1 : 0, 3 and 1 : 1, and high numbers of asylum applicants indicate an increase in migration pressure during the last decade. Major changes in the source and destination of migrants have also taken place: traditional receiving countries have lost prominence while Southern European countries, who were sending countries until fairly recently, have become receiving countries, and some Eastern European Member States are now both sending and receiving migrants.
