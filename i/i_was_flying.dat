500|$|For {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> by Jet propulsion! No engine vibrations. No torque and no lashing sound of the engine propeller. Accompanied by a {{whistling}} sound, my jet shot through the air. Later when asked what it felt like, I said, [...] "It was as though angels were pushing." ...|$|E

60|$|We vanished. In {{five minutes}} {{we were on}} board the ship. To this hour I have no remembrance of how we got on board. My brain swam with intense excitement. I felt as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>flying,</b> not walking, as I ran about the deck and clambered up the rigging.|$|R

500|$|Lyrically, {{it speaks}} about a love {{stronger}} than a gunshot, {{and according to}} Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine it is a [...] "less violent version" [...] of Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "Man Down". Edmonton Journal Sandra Sperounes wrote that on [...] "No Love Allowed" [...] Rihanna plays with the Barbadian accent on {{the same way she}} did on her 2005 debut single [...] "Pon de Replay". According to a reviewer of Billboard, Rihanna's cry to the love police in the song, can be heard in the lines, [...] "Broken heart was the case / go'on and put him away / He's the only one one one / I let get the best of me." [...] BBC Music's Natalie Shaw wrote that some of the song's lyrics like [...] "Like a bullet your love hit me to the core / <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> ‘til you knocked me to the floor", are uncomfortably balanced between true love and awkward acrimony. According to Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly, the up stated lines [...] "doesn’t sound like she has forgiven" [...] Chris Brown for the 2009 domestic violence case.|$|E
500|$|Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons. The dispute was not {{revealed}} to the press at first; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because {{she was tired of}} flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions. It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise, not only because she was tired of the traveling, but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. Maggie Roswell told The Denver Post that [...] "they offered me a $150 raise. I mean, that's lint in Fox's pocket. But Fox wanted to prove a point, I guess. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> myself back and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting. I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back. But now I'm busy doing other things." [...] She further added that [...] "I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don't think the money I asked for was exorbitant. I wasn't asking for what other cast members make. I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel. If they'd flown me in, I'd still be working." [...] At that point, the six main cast members of the show were paid [...] $125,000 per episode. As a result of Maggie Roswell's departure, the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily". Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Maggie Roswell's other characters.|$|E

In a later comment, Richter noted [...] "...It's strange, but, in a way, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> happy he got a good chute. I guess that's the thought that runs through all our minds.

6000|$|I {{had gone}} on quite ahead of my company, and as my mule soberly paced {{downward}} in the almost perpendicular road, <b>I</b> seemed to <b>be</b> poised so high above the enchanting scene that I had somewhat the same sensation as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>flying.</b> <b>I</b> don't wonder that larks seem to get into such a rapture when they are {{high up in the}} air.

2500|$|In November 1952, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> {{down south}} {{with my wife}} Hope, and we left a bit later than usual {{and by the time}} we got over the Hamersley Ranges, the clouds had formed and the ceiling got lower and lower. I got into the Turner River, knowing full well if I {{followed}} it through, I would come out into the Ashburton. [...] On going through a gorge in the Turner River, I noticed that the walls looked to me to be solid iron and was particularly alerted by the rusty looking colour of it, it showed to me to be oxidised iron.|$|E
2500|$|While {{running for}} his Senate seat in 1984, and again while {{running for the}} Democratic presidential {{nomination}} in 1992, Harkin has faced criticism for claiming that he had flown combat missions over North Vietnam. In a 1979-round table discussion with other Congressional military veterans, Harkin said of his service as a navy pilot: [...] "One year was in Vietnam. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> F-4s and F-8s on combat air patrols and photo-reconnaissance support missions". These comments were later published in a 1981 book by David Broder. After subsequent inquiries by Barry Goldwater and The Wall Street Journal, Harkin clarified {{that he had been}} stationed in Japan and sometimes flew recently repaired aircraft on test missions over Vietnam. His service flying F-4s and F-8s was later, while he was stationed at U.S. Naval Base Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|During the Fragile Tour, Wakeman bought {{four books}} {{at an airport}} bookstall in Richmond, Virginia, {{including}} one about Henry VIII and his six wives titled The Private Life of Henry VIII (1964) by Scottish writer Nancy Brysson Morrison. As he read about Anne Boleyn on the subsequent flight to Chicago, a theme he recorded in November 1971 ran through his mind which he wrote on some hand drawn ledger lines and played during the sound check and the subsequent concert. Said Wakeman, [...] "I had been searching for a style to write in and suddenly I found it in writing music about these six ladies...I would concentrate {{on one of the}} wives and then music just came into my head and I would write it down. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying,</b> other times I was on stage, or {{just in front of the}} piano at home ... The six wives theme gave me the thread, the link, I needed to give me a reason for putting these pieces of music together." [...] He explains the album's concept further in its liner notes: [...] "The album is based around my interpretations of the musical characteristics of the wives of Henry VIII. Although the style may not always be in keeping with their individual history, it is my personal conception of their characters in relation to keyboard instruments." [...] Wakeman elaborated and wrote the music as if he was doing a surreal painting, [...] "sketches of how I felt about them at the time".|$|E

I was astonished by a tremendous popping--fabric, wires, everything seemed going pop, pop, pop, like a machine-gun, and then came a flash of intense pain as my arm crumpled up. It was quite impersonal pain. As impersonal as seeing intense colour. SPLINTERS! I remember the word came into my head instantly. I remember that very definitely.|$|E

60|$|This {{would not}} do, {{it was quite}} clear. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> too high, and should never get on, so.

60|$|Helium lies a {{thousand}} miles southwest of Zodanga, and with my compass intact I should have made the trip, barring accidents, in between four and five hours.

Presently a great city showed below me, {{but it was not}} Helium, as that alone of all Barsoomian metropolises consists in two immense circular walled cities about seventy-five miles apart and would have been easily distinguishable from the altitude at which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>flying.</b>|$|E

It was fortunate, indeed, that I came along when I did, Katarina, for had I not heard what Simon said I should have passed on without giving a thought to the matter.

At the palace I flung myself off, rushed up the stairs, brushed aside the lackeys who would have stopped me, and pushed my way into the Emperor's own cabinet.

60|$|To begin with, we {{went out}} to sea before the wind, and the plane would not readily rise.

I watched the widening distance between our floats and the waves. It wasn't by any means a windless day; there was a brisk, fluctuating breeze blowing out of the north over the downs.

6000|$|Bad wind to-day.

Roar, roar, roar, the wind's worse than the noisiest old {{cast-iron}} tin-can Vrenskoy motor. You want to duck your head and get down out of it, and Lord it tires you so--aviation isn't all [...] "brilliant risks" [...] and [...] "daring dives" [...] and that kind of blankety-blank circus business, {{not by a long shot}} it ain't, lots of it is just sticking there and bucking the wind like a taxi driver speeding for a train in a storm.
