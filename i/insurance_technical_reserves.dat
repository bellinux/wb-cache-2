The goal {{of this paper is}} to study financial systems convergence through the lens of household asset allocation. We analyze s and ß convergence of total household financial assets and their main components: deposits, securities other than shares, shares and other equity, <b>insurance</b> <b>technical</b> <b>reserves.</b> The novelty of the paper is to exploit a database containing time series since 1980 for nine OECD countries. Using disposable income as a scale variable, we found convergence of household total financial assets, <b>insurance</b> <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> and shares and other equity. Weaker results are obtained for convergence of household securities other than shares, and currency and deposits. In a nutshell, financial systems show signals of convergence in asset allocation, but national characteristics persist when households invest in securities and deposits. financial systems, alpha and beta convergence...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new {{estimates}} {{of the effect of}} household financial and real wealth on consumption. The analysis refers to eleven OECD countries and takes into account the years from 1997 to 2008. Unlike most of the previous literature, we exploit European quarterly harmonized data on household financial assets and liabilities, which have been taken from the flow of funds. We measure not only the effect of total financial wealth on consumption, but we also consider the impact of a subset of those financial assets (i. e., quoted shares, mutual funds, <b>insurance</b> <b>technical</b> <b>reserves)</b> that are more linked to the Stock Exchange. Furthermore, we implement a recent econometric approach that allows for more flexible assumptions in the non-stationary panel framework under consideration. Our main results show that both net financial and real wealth {{have a positive effect on}} consumption. Overall, the influence of net financial assets is stronger than that of real assets. Using quoted shares, mutual funds and <b>insurance</b> <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> as a measure of financial wealth, we obtain a lower estimate of the marginal propensity to consume, possibly due to the strong concentration of equity instruments in the richest households.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{specific}} features of the exposure to interest rate risk and the hedging strategies of life insurance companies and pension funds, stemming from the long-term nature of their commitments. In particular, the combination of guaranteed returns and numerous contingency clauses may complicate the liability management of life insurers and defined-benefit pension funds, especially given the uneven regulatory environment that is currently undergoing major changes. Admittedly, this problem also exists for other financial institutions, in particular banks, but the latter offer fewer and less diversified long-term guarantees. For life insurance companies and defined-benefit pension funds, interest rate risk is therefore more complex to assess {{and more difficult to}} manage. However, these institutional investors have become major players in the financial arena: in France, life insurers ’ assets total some EUR 900 billion and life insurance products account for almost one-third of the financial investment of households. In the euro area, {{at the end of the}} third quarter of 2004, the liabilities of life insurance companies and pension funds stood at EUR 3, 660 billion. 1 In the United States, life <b>insurance</b> <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> amounted to USD 970 billion at end- 2003 2 and public and private defined-benefit pension funds managed assets worth USD 4, 300 billion 3, in spite of the sharp growth in defined-contribution pension funds and individual pension savings accounts whose risks are borne by the policyholders...|$|E

(bonds, shares and other equity), and technical reserves (pension funds, <b>insurance</b> <b>technical</b> <b>reserves,</b> etc.), concerning financial assets. The latter is to verify {{the reliability of the}} estimate by the comparison of corresponding results with other economic variables. Methods and Results It was applied a regressive model finalized to define the relation between the results of the estimation and other aggregates (employment, added value, income) calculated by the National Institute of Statistics and the above mentioned Tagliacarne Institute. The correlation was generally high and in most cases the statistical tests adopted have confirmed a close interdependence existing between provincial household wealth and respective economic variables. Conclusions Comparing theoretical data derived from the model with actual data, the discrepancies between North and South areas appear considerable. The northern provinces show actual values higher than theoretical ones (especially with regard to financial items), while the southern provinces, generally less developed, present a large proportion of real estate and, on the whole, actual values very low. The conclusion of the research is that it could be utilized for monitoring methods and results derived from the estimate. JEL: C 13, D 31, R 20...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the Portuguese {{insurance}} industry operates {{in a market}} with a much more aggressive structure than a few decades ago. Markets and the economy have become globalised since {{the last decade of}} the 20 th century. Market forces have gradually shifted – power is now mainly on the demand side. In order to meet the new requirements, the {{insurance industry}} must develop a strong strategic ability to respond to constant changes of the new international economic order. One of the basic aspects of this strategic development will focus on the ability to predict the future. We introduce the subject by briefly describing the sector, its organisational structure in the Portuguese market, and challenges arising from the development of the European Union. We then analyse the economic and financial structure of the sector. From this point of view, we aim at the possibility of designing models that could explain the demand for <b>insurance,</b> claims and <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> evolution. Such models, (even if based on the past), would resolve, at least partly, one of the greatest difficulties experienced by insurance companies when estimating the budget. Thus, we examine the existence of variables that explain the previous points, which are capable of forming a basis for designing models that are simple but efficient, and can be used for strategic planning...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the asset {{structure}} and the coverage of gross <b>technical</b> <b>reserves</b> of the <b>Insurance</b> – Reinsurance Company Astra SA, for the period 2003 – 2014.

In 2013 and 2014, the value of total assets was below the value of gross tehnical reserves, which demonstrated Astra’s financial instability, through negative capital and the inability to meet the obligations to policyholders.
