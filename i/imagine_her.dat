She added that Mercedes confiding secrets in Doctor Browning [...] "served only to bring them closer. Usually, half a lager is all it takes to induce such a closeness, so I suppose we can call it progress".|$|E
500|$|By 1966, Cardinale {{was being}} {{cited as the}} most popular film star in Italy, even more than Mastroianni and Loren. Life stated that [...] "the Cardinale appeal {{is a blend of}} solid {{simplicity}} and radiant sensuality. It moves men {{all over the world to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>her</b> both as an exciting mistress and wife." [...] However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with Life, she confessed her fear of being over-glamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further U.S. films lined up, stated: [...] "If I have to give up the money, I give it up. I do not want to become a cliché." ...|$|E
500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>her</b> experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century a more {{negative}} image of Hathaway emerged, following {{the publication of}} Frank Harris's books on Shakespeare's love life, and after the discovery that Anne was already pregnant when the couple married. A trend in literature on Hathaway in this period was to <b>imagine</b> <b>her</b> as a sexually incontinent cradle-snatcher, or, alternatively, a calculating shrew. More recent literature has included more varied representations of her. Historian Katherine Scheil describes Hathaway as a [...] "wife-shaped void" [...] used by modern writers [...] "as a canvas for expressing contemporary woman's struggles — over independence, single motherhood, sexual freedom, unfaithful husbands, woman's education and power-relations between husband and wife." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hunger Games {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 84% approval rating, based on 275 reviews, and a rating average of 7.2 out of 10. The site's consensus states [...] "thrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel". On Metacritic, {{the film has}} a 68 out of 100 score, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on reviews from 49 critics. Many critics praised Jennifer Lawrence for her portrayal as Katniss Everdeen, {{as well as most}} of the main cast. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lawrence embodies Katniss, [...] "just as one might <b>imagine</b> <b>her</b> from the novel". Empire magazine said [...] "Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, there's very little softness about her, more a melancholy determination that good must be done even if that requires bad things." [...] Several critics have reviewed the film favorably and compared it with other young adult fiction adaptations such as Harry Potter and Twilight. Justin Craig of Fox News rated the film as [...] "xcellent" [...] and stated: [...] "Move over Harry Potter. A darker, more mature franchise has come to claim your throne." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday referred to The Hunger Games as being [...] "darker than Harry Potter,' more sophisticated than Twilight." [...] David Sexton of The Evening Standard stated that The Hunger Games [...] "is well cast and pretty well acted, certainly when compared with Harry Potters juvenile leads".|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To <b>imagine</b> <b>her</b> thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
