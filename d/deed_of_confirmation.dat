That the Rajah Bulwant Sing {{died on the}} 23d of August, 1770, and his son, Cheyt Sing, {{succeeding}} to {{his rights}} and pretensions, the Presidency of Calcutta (John Cartier, Esquire, being then President) did instruct Captain Gabriel Harper to procure a confirmation of the succession to his son Cheyt Sing, [...] "as it was of the utmost political import to the Company's affairs; and {{that the young man}} ought not to consider the price to be paid to satisfy the Vizier's jealousy and avarice." [...] And they did further declare as follows: [...] "The strong and inviolable attachment which subsisted betwixt the Company and the father makes us most readily interpose our good offices for the son." [...] And the young Rajah aforesaid having agreed, under the mediation of Captain Harper, to pay near two hundred thousand pounds as a gift to the said Vizier, and to increase his tribute by near thirty thousand pounds annually, a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> was passed by the said Vizier to the said Rajah and his heirs, by which he became a purchaser, for valuable considerations, of his right and inheritance in the zemindary aforesaid. In consequence of this grant, so by him purchased, the Rajah was solemnly invested with the government in the city of Benares, [...] "amidst the acclamations of a numerous people, and to the great satisfaction of all parties." [...] And the said Harper, in his letter of the 8th October, 1770, giving an account of the investiture aforesaid, did express himself in these words: [...] "I will leave the young Rajah and others to acquaint you how I have conducted myself; only thus much let me say, that I have kept a strict eye not to diminish our national honor, disinterestedness, and justice, which I will conclude has had a greater effect in securing to the Company their vast possessions than even the force of arms, however formidable, could do." [...] The President of Calcutta testified his approbation of the said Harper's conduct in the strongest terms, that is, in the following: [...] "Your disinterestedness has been equally distinguishable as your abilities, and both do you the greatest honor." ...|$|E
