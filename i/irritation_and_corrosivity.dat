40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the potential of scale formation <b>and</b> <b>corrosivity</b> of water resources and the network distribution system of Shiraz in Fars province, South Iran. The Langelier saturation index (LSI) was used to assess the scale formation <b>and</b> <b>corrosivity.</b> The index was calculated based on the principle of calcium deposition. This research was done through 118 water resources samples which include wells and surface water and many different points in the network distribution system during late Summer and early fall, 2007. The mean LSI value for all the samples was 0. 417. Although, the results indicated the scaling potential in all water samples, monitoring the corrosion rates was done on a regular basis. Seasonal changes can affect water quality, and therefore the corrosion rates...|$|R

This study was directed to the identification of the properties of electrically insulative adhesives that potentially could cause problems in such an application, and to the development of evaluation tests to quantify these properties and thus form the basis for establishing suitable guidelines and, ultimately, specifications.

Introductory discussion includes enumeration and brief comments on the properties of adhesives considered to be important for the proposed application, a general review of polymeric types of adhesives, and identification of the major types of adhesives commercially available and specifically designed for microelectronic use.
