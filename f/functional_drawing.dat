The purpose of this course is twofold: first, it supports ITC’s Joint- Education Projects (JEPs) currently underway in several developing countries, and secondly, it broadens the target market for our educational services. One of the key aims in teaching programming skills using any programming language is to teach students how to approach computational problem-solving in a structured and logical way. The challenge in doing so is how to develop adequate learning resources on the programming fundamentals, which are both intuitive and <b>functional.</b> <b>Drawing</b> upon several years of experience of teaching programming skills at the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation of the University of Twente (ITC, The Netherlands), we designed a course based on an interactive learning environment, developed for a previous distance education course (Ivánová et al. 2008), but significantly extended to support new content. The programming language taught is Python, which is a general-purpose, open-source computer language well-suited for use in the hybrid context of databases, Geographic Information Systems, image processing, and web applications. It is well-known for its lean syntax, which allows the novice student to devote more time to algorithmic and programming fundamentals. The course is designed around an interactive learning infrastructure. It is built in an environment that seamlessly integrates the Python environment (= program scripting and command line) and the teaching environment (= lecture material, exercise environment, and a textbook). The course material is developed for plug-and-play deployment on a student’s PC, reducing the initial requirements on installation and optimization of the work environment.

40|$|Background: The Skyrme {{energy density}} {{functional}} {{is widely used}} in mean-field calculations of nuclear structure and dynamics. However, its reliance on phenomenology may compromise its isovector properties and its performance for exotic nuclear systems. Purpose: This work investigates the possibility of removing some phenomenology from the density <b>functional</b> by <b>drawing</b> on the high-energy degrees-of-freedom of the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The QMC model has microscopically derived isovector properties and far fewer adjustable parameters. Method: The parameters of the Skyrme interaction are fixed using the energy density functional of the QMC model, to give the Skyrme-QMC (SQMC) parameterisation. Results: Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations of the Sn, Pb and $N= 126 $ chains are reported, in which SQMC performs with an accuracy comparable to modern phenomenological functionals. Conclusions: The isovector terms of the energy density functional are significant for the binding energies of neutron-rich nuclei. The isovector dependence of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction {{must be taken into}} account for calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis abundances. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

With a market driven attitude, seasonal migration has been increasing dramatically with a hope to reduce the poverty.

40|$|Products and {{services}} often provide value {{that goes beyond}} <b>functional</b> utility. <b>Drawing</b> from a compensatory consumption model, which suggests that consumption is a means to regulate self-discrepancies, the current research suggests that consumers are motivated to self-regulate their emotions and this self-regulation can be accomplished via consumption. Specifically, emotional and physiological deviations from a steady state motivate individuals to find balance in order to alleviate those deviations. Three papers provide evidence for this hypothesis. Utilizing an embodied cognition framework for chapter 2 and chapter 3, I demonstrate that individuals are motivated to reduce a perceived lack of interpersonal warmth by substituting physical warmth, and vice versa (chapter 2). Next, I argue that experiencing action regret results in self-conscious emotions (e. g. shame, guilt) associated with physical warmth, which in turn motivates individuals to ameliorate those emotional states via interaction with objects that {{are perceived to be}} physically or psychologically opposite in temperature (chapter 3). Finally, in chapter 4, I argue that sadness can serve as a regulatory mechanism to alleviate loneliness and achieve social connectedness...|$|R
