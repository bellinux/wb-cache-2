5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm. The storm turned to the northeast while moving around the periphery of a high pressure system over Texas, and attained a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) on October 9. Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on October 10, Matthew struck Cocodrie, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> extratropical cyclone, occluding near the time of landfall.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed {{to move out of}} their reserve areas.

5|$|After {{affecting}} the Philippines, Soudelor moved {{into an area}} of low wind shear and with favorable outflow. It became a typhoon on June17, and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying. The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima, where wind gusts reached 204km/h (127mph). It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways and caused mudslides. Early on June18, Soudelor reached peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Subsequently, an increase in shear and {{the passage of a}} trough weakened the typhoon and caused it to turn to the northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June19, and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June24. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1million in damage and two deaths.|$|E

5|$|Around the 14th century, {{the temple}} was {{associated}} with the Vajrasana in India. In the 18th century the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, following the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792, did not allow the Nepalese to visit this temple and <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> exclusive place of worship for the Tibetans. During the Chinese development of Lhasa, the Barkhor Square in front of the temple was encroached. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang temple in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship. Renovation of the Jokhang took place from 1972 to 1980. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{as an extension of the}} Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994). Many Nepalese artists have worked on the temple's design and construction.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside world. In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened {{to the outside world}} in the 1970s, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for major changes in the Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E
5|$|CSG {{was founded}} by Neal Hansen as a {{division}} of First Data in 1982. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.|$|E
