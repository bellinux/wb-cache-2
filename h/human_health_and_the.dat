25|$|Although {{there is}} no single {{definition}} for what constitutes a Green Building, some elements recur in describing the concept. A Green Building can thus be defined as a high-performance building designed, built, operated and disposed of in a resource-efficient manner with the aim to minimize the overall (negative) impact on the built environment, <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> natural environment. Some examples of green building features are choice of site and orientation, efficient use of materials and resources, indoor environmental quality and innovation.|$|E
25|$|An area {{of concern}} is the effect that industrial-scale {{manufacturing}} and use of nanomaterials would have on <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment, as suggested by nanotoxicology research. For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments. Others counter that overregulation would stifle scientific research {{and the development of}} beneficial innovations.

The EPA gradually began restricting its agricultural use in the 1970s due to concerns over its effects on <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. By 2002, its use was limited to seed treatments for just six crops, and in 2007, these last uses were cancelled.|$|E

25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or {{sometimes}} U.S. EPA) is an {{agency of the}} federal government of the United States which was created for the purpose of protecting <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress. President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA and it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the President and approved by Congress. The current Administrator is Scott Pruitt. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the Administrator is normally given cabinet rank.|$|E
25|$|The major {{disadvantage}} to the DSSC {{design is}} the use of the liquid electrolyte, which has temperature stability problems. At low temperatures the electrolyte can freeze, ending power production and potentially leading to physical damage. Higher temperatures cause the liquid to expand, making sealing the panels a serious problem. Another disadvantage is that costly ruthenium (dye), platinum (catalyst) and conducting glass or plastic (contact) are needed to produce a DSSC. A third major drawback is that the electrolyte solution contains volatile organic compounds (or VOC's), solvents which must be carefully sealed as they are hazardous to <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. This, along {{with the fact that the}} solvents permeate plastics, has precluded large-scale outdoor application and integration into flexible structure.|$|E
25|$|The ministers {{emphasised}} {{the need}} to unite {{on the issue of}} Doha round of negotiations. This is supported by increased consultations, by IBSA delegations, in order to strengthen Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA), as well as the establishment of the NAMA-11 whose two main principles are supporting flexibilities for developing countries and balance between NAMA and other areas under negotiation. The Ministers took note of the broader objectives of the European Union proposed Registration, Evaluation and Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Legislation, in respect of the protection of <b>human</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. They expressed their concern for the consequences REACH may have on the developing economies of the South. Such consequences will negatively affect the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries. The ministers urged the EU to give due consideration to these consequences and also ensure that REACH does not become a Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT).|$|E
