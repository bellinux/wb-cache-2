40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the predictions of}} two theories of syntactic processing complexity, de-pendency locality theory (DLT) and surprisal, against the Dundee corpus, which contains the eye-tracking record of 10 participants reading 51, 000 words of news-paper text. Our results show that DLT <b>integration</b> <b>cost</b> is not {{a significant predictor of}} reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully pre-dicts reading times for nouns and verbs. We also find evidence for <b>integration</b> <b>cost</b> effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. Comparing DLT <b>integration</b> <b>cost</b> and surprisal, we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a complete theory will need to in-corporate both aspects of processing complexity.

40|$|This is {{the first}} attempt at characterizing reading {{difficulty}} in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu treebank. We find that word- or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass reading times, regression path dura-tion, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length results in longer fixations, {{and an increase in}} word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence comprehension diffi-culty, <b>integration</b> and storage <b>cost,</b> have an effect on reading difficulty. <b>Integration</b> <b>cost</b> (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and storage cost (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted heads at each point in the sentence. We find that <b>integration</b> <b>cost</b> mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and storage cost affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures.

Assuming CHF 72 billion AuM transferred, Julius Baer’s existing AuM as of 30 June 2012 would increase by approx. 40% to CHF 251 billion and its total client assets to CHF 341 billion, both on a pro forma basis.This acquisition brings Julius Baer a major step forward in its growth strategy and will considerably strengthen its leading position in global private banking by adding substantial scale and additional offices primarily in growth markets, but also in Europe.As part of the transaction, Julius Baer and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) have agreed to enter into a cooperation agreement whereby BofAML will provide certain products and services to Julius Baer, including global equity research. In addition there will be cross-referral of clients between both organisations.The acquisition is expected to be earnings accretive from the third full-year following principal closing, i.e. the first full steady-state year following integration. Irrespective of the AuM transferred between CHF 57 billion and CHF 72 billion, the EPS accretion (1) target in 2015 is approx. 15%.The agreed transaction price is 1.2% of AuM transferred (payable as and when AuM transfer to Julius Baer). Therefore, at CHF 72 billion AuM transferred, Julius Baer would pay approx. CHF 860 million. At that level of AuM transferred, the amount of regulatory capital required to support the incremental risk-weighted assets is expected to amount to approx.
