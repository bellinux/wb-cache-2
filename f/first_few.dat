Southwestern set a record for the most penalty yards gained (109 yards) while Mexico set records for the fewest passing yards, fewest offensive plays, fewest offensive yards, lowest offensive average per play, <b>fewest</b> <b>first</b> downs, and <b>fewest</b> <b>first</b> down passes. Southwestern also set the record for most points scored in the Sun Bowl up to that point.|$|R

5|$|A D-21 {{mounted on}} an M-21 began captive flight-testing on 22 December 1964. Aerodynamic covers were {{initially}} {{placed over the}} D-21's intake and exhaust to reduce drag, but {{had to be removed}} after the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> tests, as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the drone or carrier plane could be devised.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E
5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days of its adult life {{caring for the}} queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence {{is suggested by the}} high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E

5|$|About 25 {{people were}} arrested in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days, {{including}} 196 workers; several hundred others were arrested in the following weeks. Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led {{to the death of}} innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it meets}} the {{definition}} of outer space, the atmospheric density within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it.
