The city {{has more than a}} dozen historic districts, including Fort Omaha <b>Historic</b> <b>District,</b> Gold Coast <b>Historic</b> <b>District,</b> Omaha Quartermaster Depot <b>Historic</b> <b>District,</b> Field Club <b>Historic</b> <b>District,</b> Bemis Park <b>Historic</b> <b>District,</b> and the South Omaha Main Street <b>Historic</b> <b>District.</b> Omaha is notorious for its 1989 demolition of 24 buildings in the Jobbers Canyon <b>Historic</b> <b>District,</b> which represents to date the largest loss of buildings on the National Register. The only original building surviving of that complex is the Nash Block.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Riverside <b>Historic</b> <b>District,</b> Jacksonville's first <b>historic</b> <b>district,</b> {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; it now {{comprises}} 6870 acres and contains 2120 historic buildings. In 1989, the Avondale <b>Historic</b> <b>District</b> was added, and the following year the Jacksonville City Council established the Jacksonville Historic Preservation Commission in order to protect historic structures. Riverside Avondale Preservation has grown into one of the largest such organizations in the country. As a result of this focus on preservation and planning, the American Planning Association named Riverside and Avondale one of the country's top ten neighborhoods in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Local <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> usually {{enjoy the}} {{greatest}} {{level of protection}} legally from any threats that may compromise their historic integrity because many land-use decisions are made at the local level. There are more than 2,300 local <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> in the United States. Local <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> can be administered at the county or the municipal level; both entities are involved in land use decisions.|$|R
5|$|In 1966, the {{waterfront}} area {{was among the}} earliest National Historic Landmarks designated by the Secretary of the Interior. Five years later, in 1971, WHALE succeeded in getting today's <b>historic</b> <b>district</b> designated as the Bedford Landing Waterfront <b>Historic</b> <b>District.</b> The city later enacted zoning regulations to preserve its character.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 200 {{properties}} within the irregular {{boundaries of the}} Sycamore <b>Historic</b> <b>District.</b> Of those, 187 are considered contributing properties to the <b>historic</b> <b>district,</b> and 22 are non-contributing. Of all of the district's homes and buildings 75% fit within the <b>historic</b> <b>district</b> concept. Some of the major structures include several prominent Queen Anne style mansions, the Sycamore library, the DeKalb County Courthouse, and dozens of mid- to late 19th-century houses.|$|E
5|$|As of 1999, {{there have}} been 982 {{properties}} removed from the Register, most often due to being destroyed. Among the properties that were demolished after their listing are the Jobbers Canyon <b>Historic</b> <b>District</b> in Omaha, Nebraska (listed in 1979, demolished in 1989), Palace Amusements in Asbury Park, New Jersey (listed in 2000, demolished in 2004), and seven of the nine buildings included in the University of Connecticut <b>Historic</b> <b>District</b> in Storrs, Connecticut (listed in 1989, demolished in 2017).|$|E

40|$|We {{measure the}} net effect of <b>historic</b> <b>districting</b> on the value of federally {{certified}} historic sites. The impact could be either positive or negative depending on the tension between positive externality effects and the constraints on property rights. Since federally certified historic parcels are not severely encumbered by regulations, we expect positive externality effects to dominate any negative effects of constraining rights. We find that {{the net effect}} of <b>historic</b> <b>districting</b> on land values is significantly positive. We also find that while residential parcels within <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> attract a huge price premium of 131 %, the premium associated with nonresidential parcels within <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> is statistically insignificant. ...|$|R

The East End <b>Historic</b> <b>District</b> {{on both sides of}} Broadway and Market Streets, contains 463 buildings. Other historic districts include Cedar Lawn, Denver Court and Fort Travis.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a <b>historic</b> <b>district,</b> listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a <b>historic</b> <b>district.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to the National Park Service, <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} forms of {{protection}} for historic properties. The city of Charleston, South Carolina is credited with beginning the modern day <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> movement. In 1931 Charleston enacted an ordinance which designated an [...] "Old and Historic District" [...] administered by a Board of Architectural Review. Charleston's early ordinance reflected the strong protection that local <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> often enjoy under local law. It asserted that no alteration could be made to any architectural features which could be viewed by the public from the street. Local <b>historic</b> <b>districts,</b> as in New Orleans and Savannah, Georgia, predate the Register by 10 years or more as well.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, a <b>historic</b> <b>district</b> is a {{group of}} buildings, properties, or sites that have been {{designated}} by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a <b>historic</b> <b>district</b> are normally divided into two categories, contributing and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size: some have hundreds of structures, while others have just a few.|$|E

By calculating and comparing the indexes of each road network (NW 1 and NW 2) forms, we quantitatively describe the effects of the main prefectural roads (more than 4 m in width) and narrow streets (less than 4 m in width) on the spatial characteristics. And it turned out that we could divided the 16 objective <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> into 4 types. Moreover, we qualitatively studied the characteristics of each type of <b>historic</b> <b>districts</b> based on their development background and the structure of road network...|$|R
