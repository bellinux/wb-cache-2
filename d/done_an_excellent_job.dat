25|$|A {{change in}} market {{conditions}} {{also contributed to}} Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had <b>done</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the 1983 season, Eggen {{chose to}} {{prioritize}} his teaching job, and Tommy Cavanagh {{was hired as}} manager. In Norwegian, the terms coach and manager are used interchangeably. Cavanagh had been coach for Manchester United, where he had <b>done</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> at exactly that, but lacked abilities in team selection, tactics and inspiration. He used players in the wrong position, and instructed the ball to be kicked over the midfield, {{making it impossible to}} use the playmaker. He believed in breaking down the players and then building them up, and was unarguably good at the former. By the summer, his style was costing the club players: Eggen transferred to Orkanger in the Fourth Division, while Husby transferred to Brøndby in Denmark. Cavanagh was fired in August, at which time the club was second-last in the league, and Eggen took over as manager {{for the rest of the}} season. The team finished on a seventh place. President Erling Meirik withdrew as a consequence of the hiring, stating that in the future, the club should hire people based on more than their reputation and that they should seek judicial assistance with the contract.|$|E

[...] Volger is a schemer, and had prepared for such an event as the death of Alek's father and nearly always has a plan. [...] He is quite shrewd and trains Alek in fencing and politics, never allowing the young Prince to better him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reasoning}} by {{the majority}} in American Communications Association v. Douds has not been well-received by legal scholars. One historian characterized the decision as combining [...] "guilt by association" [...] with the discredited [...] "bad tendency test". One legal scholar has called Vinson's heavy reliance on the Commerce Clause as [...] "implausible". Douds also seems to have got some facts wrong: The political strikes Vinson relied on for examples in the case were not Communist-led but rather routine labor conflicts. The majority (unwittingly or not) believed in a distinctly American myth about a monolithic Communist Party controlled from overseas, endowed {{with the ability to}} deceive American workers, and capable of bringing the nation to its knees through the use of political strikes. Vinson's balancing test had a decidedly pro-government bias, and the decision appeared to undermine a decade's worth of First Amendment decisions. Vinson's claim that the Taft-Hartley Act did not proscribe belief has been called [...] "sophistry." [...] And the majority's claim that any flaws in its approach can be easily rectified by appealing to the Supreme Court was not only scoffed at by Justice Black but has also been sharply criticized by legal scholars. (To be fair, some legal scholars disagree, and believe the Court has <b>done</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> of protecting First Amendment rights.) ...|$|E
