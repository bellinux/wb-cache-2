50|$|An {{important}} {{problem of}} the industrial revolution was the preservation of flour. Transportation distances and a relatively slow distribution system collided with natural shelf life. The reason for the limited shelf life is the fatty acids of the germ, which react {{from the moment they}} are exposed to oxygen. This occurs when grain is milled; the fatty acids oxidize and flour starts to become rancid.Depending on climate and grain quality, this process takes six to nine months. In the late 19th century, this process was too short for an industrial production and <b>distribution</b> <b>cycle.</b> As vitamins, micronutrients and amino acids were completely or relatively unknown in the late 19th century, removing the germ was an effective solution. Without the germ, flour cannot become rancid. Degermed flour became standard. Degermation started in densely populated areas and took approximately one generation to reach the countryside.Heat-processed flour is flour where the germ is first separated from the endosperm and bran, then processed with steam, dry heat or microwave and blended into flour again.|$|E

Previous results on the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cycle</b> counts by McKay, Wormald, and Wysocka (2004) used the method of switchings, a combinatorial technique for asymp-totic enumeration.

40|$|Random bipartite graphs, random lifts of bipartite protographs, {{and random}} cyclic lifts of bipartite protographs {{are used to}} {{represent}} random low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, randomly constructed protograph-based LDPC codes, and random quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, respectively. In this paper, we study the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cycles</b> of different length in all these three categories of graphs. We prove that for a random bipartite graph, with a given degree distribution, the <b>distributions</b> of <b>cycles</b> of different length tend to independent Poisson distributions, as {{the size of the}} graph tends to infinity. It is well-known that for a random lift of a protograph, the <b>distributions</b> of <b>cycles</b> of different length c tend to independent Poisson distributions with expected value equal to the number of tailless backtrackless closed (tbc) walks of length c in the protograph, as the size of the graph (lifting degree) tends to infinity. Here, we find the number of tbc walks in a bi-regular protograph, and demonstrate that random bi-regular LDPC codes have essentially the same <b>cycle</b> <b>distribution</b> as random protograph-based LDPC codes, as long as the degree distributions are identical. For random QC-LDPC codes, however, we show that the <b>cycle</b> <b>distribution</b> can be quite different from the other two categories. While for the former categories, the expected number of cycles of different length is Θ(1) with respect {{to the size of the}} graph, for the case of QC-LDPC codes, depending on the protograph and the value of c, it can be either Θ(N) or Θ(1), where N is the lifting degree (code length). In addition, we provide numerical results that match our theoretical derivations. Our results also provide a theoretical foundation for empirical results that were reported in the literature but were not well-justified...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the physical-chemical features of aerated compost teas extracted with degassed tap water and two different additives at increasing doses. Total nitrogen in compost teas increased according to rising doses of the additives used. In spite of this, nitrogen and mineral element contributions were limited and supplementary for plant mineral nutrition. Although total heavy metal contents in compost teas were low, the danger due to an increase of their bioavailable forms (ionic and chelated forms, presence in microorganisms) should be taken into account. In addition, the distribution on soil of acid or/and chelating products by compost teas could increase the bioavailability of heavy metals, especially in case of several annual <b>distribution</b> <b>cycles</b> and of medium-long term treatments...|$|R

Characterising the effect of small molecules on cell <b>cycle</b> <b>distribution</b> is important for understanding their mechanism of action especially in oncology drug discovery but also for understanding potential toxicology liabilities.
