40|$|Contained in {{the more}} recent {{literature}} are descriptions of several agents which are unusual pharmacologically in {{that they have been}} shown experimentally to be stimulants of sympathetic ganglia but are not antagonized by moderate doses of hexamethonium or other competitive type ganglion blocking drugs. The ganglion <b>excitant</b> <b>action</b> of several agents in the group appears to be very susceptible to atropine antago-nism. Among the drugs to which such properties have been ascribed are pilocarpine (Trendelen-burg, 1954), neostigmine (Long and Eckstein, 1961) and 4 -(m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy) - 2 -butynyltrimethylammornum chloride, MeN-A...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{derivatives}} of tryptamine and phenethylamine, and certain other compounds, were tested on neurones in the cerebral cortex of cats by iontophoretic release from micro-pipettes. The characteristic action {{of many of}} these compounds was a depression of the neuronal discharge initiated by synaptic activity or by the application of L-glutamate; imidazolylacetic acid, dopamine, ephedrine and ergometrine were particularly effective. Catechol amines, hydroxytryptamines and imidazolylacetic acid had a relatively quick and rapidly reversible action, not unlike that of Î³-aminobutyric acid, whereas ephedrine and derivatives of lysergic acid diethylamide caused a slower and more prolonged depression of the amplitude of spikes, rather like atropine. Several compounds, including 5 -hydroxytryptamine, adrenaline and ergometrine, could also excite the same neurone when larger amounts were applied. A few substances, such as dopa and methylergometrine, had a predominantly <b>excitant</b> <b>action...</b>|$|E
