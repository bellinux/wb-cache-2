50|$|<b>Dacryocystitis</b> is an {{infection}} of the lacrimal sac, secondary to obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct at the junction of lacrimal sac. The term derives from the Greek dákryon (tear), cysta (sac), and -itis (inflammation). It causes pain, redness, and swelling over the inner aspect of the lower eyelid and epiphora. When nasolacrimal duct obstruction is secondary to a congenital barrier it {{is referred to as}} dacrocystocele. It is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common complication is corneal ulceration, frequently in association with S. pneumoniae. The mainstays of treatment are oral antibiotics, warm compresses, and relief of nasolacrimal duct obstruction by dacryocystorhinostomy.|$|E
50|$|Causes of {{epiphora}} are {{any that}} cause either overproduction of tears or decreased drainage of tears, resulting in tearing onto the cheek. This can {{be due to}} ocular irritation and inflammation (including trichiasis and entropion) or an obstructed tear outflow tract which is divided according to its anatomical location (i.e. ectropion, punctal, canalicular or nasolacrimal duct obstruction). The latter is often due to aging (a spontaneous process), conjunctivochalasis, infection (i.e. <b>dacryocystitis),</b> rhinitis, and in neonates or infants, failure of the nasolacrimal duct to open. Another cause could be poor reconstruction of the nasolacrimal duct system after trauma to the area. Cause of trauma could be facial fractures (including nasoethmoid fractures or maxillary Le Fort fractures), and soft tissue trauma involving the nose and/or the eyelid.This condition is often frustrating or irritating. A systematic review studying the usage of punctal plugs for treatment of dry eye reported a few cases of epiphora among participants.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} {{pathogens}} and drug sensitivity of chronic <b>dacryocystitis</b> {{in order to}} provide evidence for clinical drug use. METHODS: Lacrimal secretion of 171 cases with chronic <b>dacryocystitis</b> was sampled for pathogenic bacteria culture identification and drug sensitivity test. Based on the results, the isolation rate of pathogens strains, the pathogens kind of chronic dacryoeystitis, main pathogens of chronic <b>dacryocystitis,</b> and sensitive drug for pathogens were analyzed. RESULTS: The isolation rate of pathogens strains was 76. 61 %(131 cases). The pathogens constituting the chronic <b>dacryocystitis</b> were predominantly gram-positive coccus,the percentage was 72. 52 %(95 cases), among which staphylococcus hominis occupied 27. 48 %(36 cases), staphylococcus epidermidis 16. 79 %(22 cases), streptococcus viridans 12. 98 %(17 cases). The majority of these bacteria were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactam, tobramycin, gentamicin and levofloxacin. For gram-positive coccus, cefoperazone-sulbactam, gentamicin and tobramycin were the most sensitive drug. For gram-negative bacilli, cefoperazone-sulbactam, tobramycin and levofloxacin were most sensitive drug.

Materials and methods: This was a retrospective case series involving six sides of five infants with a dacryocystocele treated at Osaka Kaisei Hospital, Osaka, Japan. The conservative management protocol consisted of the application of warm compresses and massage over the mass, {{with the addition of}} antibiotics when <b>dacryocystitis</b> developed. Patient age at the time of resolution, presence of retrograde outflow of contents of dacryocystoceles from the puncta, and development of <b>dacryocystitis</b> were recorded. Results: The dacryocystocele was unilateral in four patients and bilateral in one patient. A nasal cyst was present in four patients without respiratory distress. The median patient age {{at the time of the}} diagnosis was 7 days (range 2 – 10 days). Conservative management was selected in all patients, and the dacryocystocele was resolved in all patients at a median patient age of 14. 5 days (range 11 – 105 days). Two sides developed <b>dacryocystitis,</b> which resolved in a few days with antibiotic treatment. In those two sides, rupture of the dacryocystoceles to the common canaliculus with retrograde discharge of the contents from the puncta before the <b>dacryocystitis</b> developed was noted.

Only adult patients who had undergone external DCR were included. The evaluation included the following parameters: age, gender, duration of symptoms, patient satisfaction, previous <b>dacryocystitis,</b> complication rates, and surgical outcome. Results. 154 eyes of 146 patients (14. 5 %) could {{be included in the}} study. The average age was 64. 1 ± 29. 7 years. 66. 4 % of patients were females and 33. 6 % were males.

30|$|Microbiologic {{spectrum}} of acute <b>dacryocystitis</b> {{has been studied}} in 23 patients by the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ASOPRS) <b>dacryocystitis</b> group [19], and {{it was found that}} 78.3 % of the isolates were gram-positive and 21.7 % were gram-negative. Among the gram-positive isolates, S. aureus was the most common organism noted, accounting for 50 % of all the gram-positive isolates. Among the gram-negative organisms, there was no preponderance of any organism with equal incidence of isolates of P. aeruginosa, Fusobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The current study, though exclusively looks at lacrimal abscess, concurred with some of the findings of the acute cohort of the ASOPRS <b>dacryocystitis</b> group. Of our patients, 58.9 % showed gram-positive isolates and 30.4 % of the patients had gram-negative isolates. S. aureus accounted for 42.4 % (28 / 66) of all the gram-positive isolates. However, unlike the ASOPRS group, our gram-negative profile was very different with H. influenzae and E. coli, accounting for 32.3 % and 23.5 % of all the gram-negative isolates, respectively (n = 34). Razavi et al.

Probing of lacrimal passage has a good curative effect in 7 - 12 months infants, but a poor curative effect in babies over 12 months.

If conservative treatment fails, dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) appears to be effective. The indications, special clinical history and results will be reviewed. PATIENTS AND METHODS From January 2006 to December 2010, a total of 30 children prospectively {{were involved in the}} study (26 male, 4 female) with persistent <b>dacryocystitis</b> (4 patients) were treated surgically by DCR and were continuously documented. The patients ranged in age from 10 months to 14 years old (mean age 4. 9 years). Included in our study were 16 children (12 male, 4 female) with 4 surgically treated lacrimal ducts. RESULTS The cause of <b>dacryocystitis</b> was congenital obstruction in 13 children and trauma (maxillary fracture) in 1 child, respectively. Of these, 2 children (15...|$|E
