5|$|The {{historian}} Ronald Hutton {{stated that}} the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In {{the middle of that}} century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a letter in the journal English Dance and Song in which she noted that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept the custom alive for the past sixty years. Blake also <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> believed that the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan.

5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her. Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and admitted she did not know how much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E
5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and {{the pets}} as characters, so the Cahills sought {{to expand the}} human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and her husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at a demographic of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater to boys {{of the same age}} and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show is accomplished by film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing of the limitations for music in daytime television a source of pride.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{spent the}} rest of her life in Normandy, often acting as Henry's {{representative}} and presiding over the government of the Duchy. Early on, Matilda and her son issued charters in England and Normandy in their joint names, dealing with the various land claims that had arisen during the wars. Particularly in the initial years of his reign, the King drew on her for advice on policy matters. Matilda was involved in attempts to mediate between Henry and his Chancellor Thomas Becket when the two men fell out in the 1160s. Matilda had originally cautioned against the appointment, but when the Prior of Mont St Jacques asked her for a private interview on Becket's behalf to seek her views, she provided a moderate perspective on the problem. Matilda <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> disagreed with Henry's attempts to codify English customs, which Becket was opposed to, but also condemned poor administration in the English Church and Becket's own headstrong behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 {{episode of}} Xplosion, when she {{interfered}} and helped Wilde defeat Daffney {{to end the}} team's long losing streak. The following week, when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{did not want to}} win by cheating, Sarita claimed that she was a winner and, unlike Wilde, did not need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she had lost her match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne, proclaiming she was sick of losing matches. Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by putting her feet on the ropes for leverage. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. At the July 26 tapings of Impact!, Stock tore her triceps and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. She returned at the September 6 tapings of Xplosion, defeating Daffney.|$|E
5|$|Verena Dietzel, {{creator of}} the fashion label V-Couture, who specializes in {{different}} kinds of corsets, were enlisted to create clothing for the video, {{as well as a}} Grammy Awards performance. Dietzel <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had initially thought Madonna's e-mail as spam, however after confirmation from the singer's assistant stylist, B. Åkerlund, she started working on the designs. Within 48 hours she sewed a new corset, as well as created two new ones, by basing them on the only information provided to her, that of Madonna's bra-size. She had to search on Google for deducing the rest of the singer's proportions. In total four different corsets were shipped off to Madonna. Lebanese designer Shady Zeineldine was also contacted by Åkerlund, who visited the designer's press conference in Los Angeles, and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for the video. After the deal was finalized, he created a custom made matador jacket which Madonna wore in the video. Another dress was a bodysuit, featuring a nude satin-stretch corset covered in three different types of lace, a black chiffon silk top and a satin tie. There was also a red velvet bolero jacket.|$|E

5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and <b>explained</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E
