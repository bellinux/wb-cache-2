40|$|AbstractThe {{experimental}} results and numerical modeling of penetration process of fluoropolymer projectiles in aluminum-based targets are presented. Analysis of mathematical models for interaction of elastoplastic projectile and target without taking additional energy released during interaction of fluoropolymer and aluminum into consideration is carried out. Energy fraction which is spent effectively {{on the increase}} in cavity volume is determined. The experimental and calculated results of penetration by combined and <b>inert</b> <b>projectiles</b> are compared...|$|R
40|$|Jefferson Proving Ground {{estimated}} that 23 million rounds {{have been fired}} there since 1941. Approximately 1. 4 million of those items did not function and were considered duds. Ordnance items including duds are not normally recovered {{after they have been}} fired because of the extreme hazards. Another 6. 9 million rounds were <b>inert</b> <b>projectiles,</b> many with live fuses and spotting charges with explosive potential. Today these rounds are still out there.

50|$|A kinetic {{bombardment}} or a kinetic orbital {{strike is}} the hypothetical act of attacking a planetary surface with an <b>inert</b> <b>projectile,</b> where the destructive force {{comes from the}} kinetic energy of the projectile impacting at very high velocities. The concept originated during the Cold War.|$|E
5000|$|UN 0012 {{defines the}} {{category}} 'Cartridges for weapons, <b>inert</b> <b>projectile</b> or Cartridges, small arms', being [...] "Ammunition {{consisting of a}} cartridge case fitted with a centre or rimfire primer and containing both a propelling charge and solid projectile(s). They {{are designed to be}} fired in weapons of calibre not larger than 19.1 mm. Shotgun cartridges of any calibre are included in this definition." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) was a Soviet ICBM {{program in}} the 1960s that after launch would go into a low Earth orbit and would then de-orbit for an attack. The {{development}} of the FOBS {{was one of the}} first steps taken by the Soviet Union to utilize space for the delivery of nuclear warheads. [...] The primary objective of the FOBS was to bypass the weapon detection systems in the United States. [...] In order to accomplish this, the FOBS was designed to briefly place nuclear warheads into the earth’s orbit. After orbiting for a short period of time, the bombs would deploy and fall to their targets from space. [...] The system shares many similarities with the concept of kinetic bombardment systems, with the exception of the use of a nuclear warhead as opposed to an <b>inert</b> <b>projectile.</b> This weapon system also had no range limit and the orbital flight path would not reveal the target location. This would allow a path to North America over the South Pole, hitting targets from the south, which is the opposite direction from which NORAD early warning systems are oriented.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 18th century, a number of European armies began to {{introduce}} howitzers that were mobile enough to accompany armies in the field. Though usually fired at the relatively high angles of fire used by contemporary siege howitzers, these field howitzers were rarely defined by this capability. Rather, as the field guns of the day were usually restricted to <b>inert</b> <b>projectiles</b> (which relied entirely on momentum for their destructive effects), the field howitzers of the 18th century were chiefly valued for their ability to fire explosive shells. Many, for the sake of simplicity and rapidity of fire, dispensed with adjustable propellant charges.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} Cartridge, 20mm, Dummy, Mk 103 Mod 0 (USN) {{which is}} an inert round. It has an empty primer pocket and holes in the case or a plugged primer pocket. It may be empty or filled with <b>inert</b> material. The <b>projectile</b> is usually brass or bronze plated.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "proof round" [...] is an {{ammunition}} assembly {{designed to}} be used in proof testing; this can use a fixed cartridge, a semi-fixed cartridge, or separately loaded projectile, charge and primer. A [...] "proof shot" [...] is a special projectile used in a proof round or other projectile weapons, electromagnetic guns for example. Small arms proof rounds resemble normal cartridges, though they will typically bear special markings to prevent them from being confused for standard cartridges. Large calibre arms, such as artillery, will in general use an <b>inert</b> solid <b>projectile</b> (the proof shot); although water, sand or iron (powder) filled versions can be found for testing recoil systems.|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{standards}} for artillery shells {{are made by}} machining grooves into <b>inert</b> <b>projectile</b> bodies. Current standards are difficult to design and build and do not realisticly simulate manufacturing defects.

40|$|We have {{reported}} nanopattern formation on carbon thin film and Si(100) surfaces by low energy inert and carbon ion beams. It {{is interesting to}} observe the role of carbon as target as well as projectile for nano patterning. Using carbon thin film as target, nano patterns of carbon are formed by inert (Ar+) and self (C+) ion bombardment, whereas carbon ion beam is used to form well ordered Si nano ripple structure in a cost effective way where implanted carbon {{plays an important role}} to form Si ripple in relatively lower fluence than the <b>inert</b> <b>projectile.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} non-nuclear {{diversion}} of near Earth asteroids have largely ignored {{the use of}} pure kinetic energy impacts, partly due to apparent limits on impact speeds of 10 - 15 km s− 1. Here, I will consider {{the use of a}} near-term solar sail to deliver an <b>inert</b> <b>projectile</b> onto a retrograde solar orbit, thus raising impact speeds to at least 60 km s− 1. Such high-energy orbits increase the energy liberated during impact by a factor of 40 or more, while reducing the required projectile mass by at least 95 %. This considerable reduction in projectile mass allows kilometre-sized asteroids to be diverted with current launch vehicles, near-term technologies and at a cost comparable to a modest deep space mission...|$|E
40|$|Solar sailing can enable fly-by, {{rendezvous}} {{and sample}} return missions to high-energy asteroid and cometary targets. Due {{to the absence}} of reaction mass, solar sailing can deliver significant effective delta-v to reach high eccentricity and/or high inclination targets which are either difficult or impossible to reach using chemical or even solar electric propulsion. Typically, such missions can be delivered using a small, low cost launch vehicle due to the modest payload required and the use of a low mass solar sail assembly. A range of mission applications will be discussed in some detail, including a sample return mission from a high inclination target body, near Earth asteroid 2001 QP 153, selected as a representative high-energy target body to demonstrate the enabling capability of solar sailing for such missions. In addition, fast rendezvous missions to high eccentricity short period comets will be discussed such as Wirtanen and Encke. For sample return mission, the sample can in principle be delivered to the ISS in low Earth orbit rather than aerocaptured. This return mode would allow the structure of highly porous samples to be preserved by avoid the extreme mechanical loads experienced during re-entry. In addition to the effective delivery of payloads to small bodies, solar sails can station-keep at artificial equilibria in their vicinity to provide novel vantage points for imaging and on-orbit science. For example, by hovering at a fixed phase angle relative to the target body, mapping can be conducted by allowing the target body to rotate relative to the static solar sail. Other more exotic possibilities include using the solar sail as a reflector to enhance surface illumination and to illuminate the interior of shaded craters. Finally, the use of solar sail propulsion for near-Earth asteroid hazard mitigation will be discussed. A near-term solar sail will be investigated which can deliver an <b>inert</b> <b>projectile</b> onto a retrograde solar orbit, raising impact speeds to at least 60 km/s. Such high-energy orbits increase the energy liberated during impact by a factor of 40 or more, while reducing the required projectile mass by at least 95 % relative to conventional concepts for kinetic energy impact schemes using prograde orbits. This considerable reduction in projectile mass allows kilometre-sized asteroids to be diverted with current launch vehicles, near-term technologies and at a cost comparable to a modest deep space mission...|$|E
