40|$|The Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> (Essigella californica) was accidentally {{introduced}} into Australia {{from the northern}} hemisphere before being detected in Canberra in 1998. Feeding on some members of Pinaceae, including the commercially important Pinus radiata, the aphid has now spread to almost all pine-growing areas and {{is considered to be}} an important forestry pest. In 2005, a project was commissioned to import the <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> parasitoid, Diaeretus essigellae, into Australia and subject it to host-specificity testing with a view to releasing it as a biological control for E. californica. In 2007, the first wasp pupae arrived at Australian quarantine facilities and emergent adults were used to establish an ongoing Australian culture. Sequencing of 28 S rDNA confirmed the identity of the parasitoid and showed that its closest known relative is Diaeretus leucopterus. No-choice and choice host-specificity testing was conducted using Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> and eight non-target aphid species as potential hosts for D. essigellae. Regardless of the testing procedure, E. californica was the only species that was successfully parasitised. This suggests that D. essigellae is highly specific (at genus or species level) and therefore, is a suitable candidate for release into pine plantations to provide control of Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> in Australia. Based on these data, permission to release the wasp from quarantine was granted in November 2009. Although 24 aphidiine parasitoids have been purposely or accidentally introduced to Australia, this is only the second species to have undergone host-specificity testing and in addition, is the first species released to parasitise a member of the most primitive aphid subfamily, Lachninae. This case study raises interesting questions about the basis for development/analysis of host-specificity testing of putatively highly specific biocontrol agents where close relatives of their targets either do not exist in the environment or are pests themselves.

40|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> Cinara pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang is {{the main}} pine pest in China, it causes pine needles to produce dense dew (honeydew) {{which can lead to}} sooty mold (black {{filamentous}} saprophytic ascomycetes). Although common chemical and physical strategies are used to prevent the disease caused by C. pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang, new strategies based on biological and/or genetic approaches are promising to control and eradicate the disease. However, there is no information about genomics, proteomics or transcriptomics to allow the design of new control strategies for this <b>pine</b> <b>aphid.</b> We used next generation sequencing technology to sequence the transcriptome of C. pinitabulaeformis Zhang et Zhang and built a transcriptome database.

A total of 10, 806 annotated unigenes were analyzed to identify the represented biological pathways, among them 8, 845 unigenes matched with 228 KEGG pathways. In addition, our data describe propagative viruses, nutrition-related genes, detoxification related molecules, olfactory related receptors, stressed-related protein, putative insecticide resistance genes and possible insecticide targets.

2500|$|Aphids {{are in the}} {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the Sternorrhyncha {{division of}} the order Hemiptera. Late 20th-century reclassification within the Hemiptera reduced the old taxon [...] "Homoptera" [...] to two suborders: Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc.) and Auchenorrhyncha (e.g., cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc.) with the suborder Heteroptera containing {{a large group of}} insects known as the true bugs. Early 21st-century reclassifications substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., Eriosomatidae), and many old subfamilies were elevated to family rank.

40|$|Studies on {{assessments}} of the air pollution and deposition caused by geothermal fields on the forest health and presence of pests have been few documented to date. In the geothermal field "Los Humeros", located between {{the borders of the}} states of Puebla and Veracruz, Mexico was realized a forest health monitoring to know the assessment could have these emissions of sulphur (S) and other two chemical elements measured by their concentrations on leaf tissues in the surrounding forests. For it were evaluated the forest healthy and pest insects registered at 20 stands of which were chosen completely at random 40 trees in total/site of the species Pinus montezumae and P. teocotein natural stands and plantations and picked up leaf tissue samples representatives per stand to determine the contents of sulphur (S), boron (B) and arsenic (As) representing each forest stand. The results of the study revealed that the presence of forest pests are not related to the proximity of the sites to emissions from stationary sources of emissions and moreover the amount of these 3 chemical substances monitored do not have none influence on the forest healthy sites condition, except for the Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> Essigella californica Essig, which seems to be directly associated with higher Boron content in the needles (mean= 167. 47 ± 32. 15, and peak 635. 46 ppm) and proximity of emission sources geothermal vents or where it is believed all these chemical elements are carried down by air currents to specific points and deposited in the stands.

40|$|The Monterey <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> (Essigella californica) was {{recently}} found in New Zealand. To examine the seasonal biology {{and impact of}} this insect on Pinus radiata, aphids were sampled using beating and branch bagging methods over two seasons (October to April), from three forest elevations, and from three tree age-classes in Hawke’s Bay forests. Many more aphids were found in 2001 – 02 than in 2000 – 01, with numbers peaking in January in 2001 and April in 2002. Few aphids were found from October to December. More aphids were recorded on trees in the medium and old age classes than in the young age class. There was no consistent pattern in aphid numbers in relation to elevation of forests.

40|$|Forest health {{monitoring}} {{is essential to}} sustainable management of Pinus radiata D. Don plantations. Conventional survey techniques such as aerial sketch mapping are qualitative and subjective, their effectiveness depending on the skill of the surveyor. In contrast, digital remote sensing {{has the potential to}} provide quantitative and objective data on the location, extent, and severity of crown damage at a range of spatial scales. Decision tree analysis can incorporate both categorical and continuous data and is inherently non-parametric. Decision trees were used to model the crown condition of P. radiata plantations in southern New South Wales in three situations involving discoloured leaves, stunted crowns, and transparent crowns associated respectively with the Diplodia pinea (Desm.) Kickx fungus, nitrogen deficiency, and the <b>pine</b> <b>aphid</b> Essigella californica Essig. Spectral indices and fraction images derived from linear spectral mixture analyses of remote sensing scenes were used to classify crowns into either two or three condition classes.

PWD inflicts significant damages in <b>Eurasian</b> <b>pine</b> forests. Symbiotic microorganisms {{have a large}} influence in insect survival. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the bacterial community associated to PWD vectors in Europe and East Asia using a culture-independent approach. Twenty-three Monochamus galloprovincialiswere collected in Portugal (two different locations); twelve Monochamus alternatus were collected in Japan. DNA was extracted from the insects’ tracheas for 16 S rDNA analysis through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and barcoded pyrosequencing. Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales, Vibrionales and Oceanospirilales were present in all samples. Enterobacteriaceae was represented by 52. 2 % of the total number of reads. Twenty-three OTUs were present in all locations. Significant differences existed between the microbiomes of the two insect species while for M. galloprovincialis there were no significant differences between samples from different Portuguese locations.

A possible biological control agent for the <b>pine</b> woolly <b>aphid</b> was found near CAB International's former headquarters. Because of the dramatic speed of progress and impact that the three aphids are having in Southern and Eastern Africa, IIBC has formulated a regional plan to extend research to cover another eight countries in Africa where forestry plantations are being affected {{by one or more}} of the aphids found to be causing so much damage in Malawi. The new venture, with funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), covers Kenya, Tanzania Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Zimbabwe and Zambia. The aim is to establish biological control programmes in each of the countries. The cypress aphid is becoming such a major pest in Kenya's forests that the search for likely predators has moved as far as the Rocky Mountains in America. FAO is funding a survey coordinated by IIBC and is working in conjunction with consultants at the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service. At IIBC in the UK researchers are experimenting with ways of rearm' aphids so they can be used to test the effectiveness of natural enemies.
