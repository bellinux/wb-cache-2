5|$|Tidal <b>flexing</b> kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes {{a source of}} heat. Depending {{on the amount of}} tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the <b>flexing</b> of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant <b>flexing,</b> driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular <b>flexing</b> {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal <b>flexing</b> heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|Tidal heating occurs {{through the}} tidal {{friction}} and tidal <b>flexing</b> processes caused by tidal acceleration: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as {{heat in the}} core of the moon, the internal ocean, and the ice crust.|$|E

5|$|<b>Flexing</b> {{the toes}} and feet and {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from the deep to the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E
5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and <b>flexing,</b> contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than <b>flexing</b> (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E

50|$|Jul 25, 2012, Apache <b>Flex</b> {{community}} releases <b>Flex</b> 4.8.0-incubating and it as a parity release with Adobe <b>Flex</b> 4.6.0. This is {{the first}} release under the incubator of the Apache Software Foundation and represents the initial donation of Adobe <b>Flex</b> 4.6 by Adobe System Inc.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Potomac Falls High School dropped resource, instead {{replacing}} sixth {{period with}} a new system called <b>FLEX.</b> In <b>FLEX,</b> the students first go to either period 7, 2, 3, 4 (respectively) from 10:38-11:19 {{and then they go}} to either period 1, 8, 5, advisory (respectively) from 11:25 to 12:07. The periods to which the students go depend on what <b>FLEX</b> day it is (the periods will always be the same; if they <b>FLEX</b> to seventh, they will <b>flex</b> to first, and if they <b>FLEX</b> to second, they will <b>FLEX</b> to eighth, etc.). During the 2010-2011 school year, the <b>FLEX</b> period was moved to fourth period. This time is occasionally used for assemblies, club meetings, filling out forms, or last minute school work.|$|R
5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal <b>flexing</b> dissipation can generate one {{order of magnitude}} more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicates {{that most of the}} heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E
5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, {{swallowed}} head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck <b>flexing.</b> Unusually, after food has been swallowed, the Gila monster immediately resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, probably {{as a result}} of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. Gila monsters are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal <b>flexing</b> drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal <b>flexing</b> would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

50|$|Adobe {{released}} <b>Flex</b> 4.0 (code named Gumbo) on March 22, 2010. The <b>Flex</b> 4 {{development environment}} is called Adobe Flash Builder, {{formerly known as}} Adobe <b>Flex</b> Builder.|$|R
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any <b>flexing</b> is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After <b>flexing</b> its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, <b>flexing</b> and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E

50|$|Fountain pen nibs were {{originally}} designed similarly to feather quills. <b>Flex</b> nibs {{were much more}} common on pens made before the 1930s. They were typically offered as an option on a manufacturer's pens so that the same model could come with a standard rigid nib or <b>flex.</b> <b>Flex</b> nibs were relatively common in Waterman pens. Model 22 was a popular choice for <b>flex.</b> Other brands, like Sheaffer, sold very few <b>flex</b> nibs. <b>Flex</b> nibs remained relatively common on some European pens into the 1950s, notably on Mont Blanc pens.|$|R
5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal <b>flexing</b> causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5|$|Great Britains {{builders}} recognised {{a number}} of advantages of iron over the traditional wooden hull. Wood was becoming more expensive, while iron was getting cheaper. Iron hulls were not subject to dry rot or woodworm, and they were also lighter in weight and less bulky. The chief advantage of the iron hull was its much greater structural strength. The practical limit {{on the length of}} a wooden-hulled ship is about 300feet, after which hogging—the <b>flexing</b> of the hull as waves pass beneath it—becomes too great. Iron hulls are far less subject to hogging, so that the potential size of an iron-hulled ship is much greater. The ship's designers, led by Brunel, were initially cautious in the adaptation of their plans to iron hulled-technology. With each successive draft however, the ship grew ever larger and bolder in conception. By the fifth draft, the vessel had grown to 3,400tons, over 1,000tons larger than any ship then in existence.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, {{with a layer}} of water {{surrounding}} the mantle of the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal <b>flexing</b> ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E

The ColdFusion MX 7.0.2 release adds updated Flash Remoting to support ActionScript 3, a <b>Flex</b> Data Services event gateway, and the <b>Flex</b> Data Services assembler. <b>Flex</b> Builder 2 also adds extensions for ColdFusion providing {{a set of}} wizards for RAD <b>Flex</b> development. A subset of <b>Flex</b> 1.5 is also embedded into ColdFusion MX 7 middleware platform, {{for use in the}} ColdFusion Flash forms feature. It is possible to use this framework to write rich Internet applications, although its intended purpose is for rich forms only.|$|R

5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited <b>flexing</b> motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with {{a balance of}} roundness and forward movement. Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways {{movement of}} the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians {{are known for their}} agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced collection and turns on the haunches. A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and Anglo-Arabian horses while moving at the trot. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater <b>flexing</b> of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically found in this breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.|$|E
5|$|The slight {{eccentricity}} of Europa's orbit, {{maintained by}} the gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate {{towards and away from}} it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal <b>flexing</b> kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.|$|E
