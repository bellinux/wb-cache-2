5|$|One early wealthy {{resident}} was Chicago businessman J. W. Gates {{who would}} gamble on stocks on Wall Street and play poker at the hotel. He paid up to $50,000 {{a year to}} hire suites at the hotel, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> private entrance and elevator. Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna of Russia was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer {{to stay at the}} hotel in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Apart from basketball, Rodman is {{a retired}} {{part-time}} professional wrestler and actor. He {{was a member of}} the nWo and fought alongside Hulk Hogan at two Bash at the Beach events. In professional wrestling, Rodman was the first ever winner of the Celebrity Championship Wrestling tournament. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> TV show The Rodman World Tour, and had lead roles in the action films Double Team (1997) and Simon Sez (1999). Both films were critically panned, with the former earning Rodman a triple Razzie Award. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of Celebrity Mole.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943 he {{was given}} the job of {{registrar}} in the quarantine section at Birkenau sector BII, which allowed him to speak to deportees selected as slave labour. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> office with a desk, chair and bunk bed. From the window he could see the lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Rome, Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, the Abbot of Abingdon and the king's goldsmith, as his {{successor to the}} bishopric of London, claiming that Pope Leo IX had forbidden the consecration. Almost certainly the grounds were simony, the purchase of ecclesiastical office, as Leo had recently issued proclamations against the practice. In refusing to consecrate Spearhafoc, Robert may have been following his own interests against the wishes of both the king and Godwin, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> candidate, a Norman, in mind. In the end Robert's favoured candidate, William the Norman, was consecrated instead of Spearhafoc. Robert also discovered that some lands belonging to Canterbury had fallen into Godwin's hands, but his efforts to recover them through the shire courts were unsuccessful. Canterbury had lost control of some revenues from the shire of Kent to Godwin during Eadsige's tenure as archbishop, which Robert unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim. These disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between Robert and Godwin, which had begun with Robert's election. Robert's election had disrupted Godwin's patronage powers in Canterbury, and now Robert's efforts to recover lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury challenged the earl's economic rights. Events {{came to a head}} at a council held at Gloucester in September 1051, when Robert accused Earl Godwin of plotting to kill King Edward. Godwin and his family were exiled; afterwards Robert claimed the office of sheriff of Kent, probably on the strength of Eadsige, his predecessor as Archbishop, having held the office.|$|E
5|$|Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul {{modified}} with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge {{pickup in}} Slayer's early days {{and through the}} Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits era. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the pickups were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with {{a second set of}} B.C. Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG 81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of those songs were played in E-flat since about 1984.|$|E

25|$|The investigation, Außenseiter, which {{appeared}} in 1975, was {{considered by many to}} be his main work. In this volume, he deals with the literary portrayal of three groups, which have commonly been discriminated against in history: women, male homosexuals and Jews. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> experiences with belonging to two of these groups - as a Jew and as a homosexual.|$|E
25|$|The state claimed certain {{proportions}} of all crops, stock, etc. The king's messengers could commandeer any subject's property, giving a receipt.

25|$|The prior of Durham ranked {{first among}} the bishop's barons. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> court, and almost {{exclusive}} jurisdiction over his men. There were ten palatinate barons in the 12th century, most importantly the Hyltons of Hylton Castle, the Bulmers of Brancepeth, the Conyers of Sockburne, the Hansards of Evenwood, and the Lumleys of Lumley Castle. The Nevilles owned large estates in the county. John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby rebuilt Raby Castle, their principal seat, in 1377.|$|E

25|$|Most notable in this line-up was Stephen Beckett in {{the lead}} role. Having {{previously}} played significant roles in The Bill and Coronation Street, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> experience of celebrity-driven media attention to draw on, thereby causing some speculation that the character was based on him. Although he was not drawn in specially for his role (he had appeared in Stephen Joseph Theatre productions before), Alan Ayckbourn reportedly said there was an instinct of Charlie that was like him.|$|E
25|$|Rodney {{received}} little schooling, {{and worked as}} a sailor and merchant for some years.

25|$|Bridges' {{attitude}} changed sharply {{after the}} end of World War II.

25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, {{to make sure it was}} all right with her. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.|$|E
25|$|Buxtehude's {{other pieces}} that employ free writing or {{sectional}} structure include works titled toccata, praeambulum, etc. All {{are similar to}} the praeludia in terms of construction and techniques used, except that some of these works do not employ pedal passages or do so in a very basic way (pedal point which lasts during much of the piece, etc.). A well-known piece is BuxWV 146, in the rare key of F-sharp minor; it is believed that this prelude was written by Buxtehude especially for himself and his organ, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> way of tuning the instrument to allow for the tonality rarely used because of meantone temperament.|$|E
