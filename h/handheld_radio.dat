2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a <b>handheld</b> <b>radio</b> to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon {{receiving}} a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. We got in the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E

5000|$|The MBITR was {{developed}} by USSOCOM and Thales Communications in the 1990s and went into production in 2000, to address {{the need for a}} secure multiband <b>handheld</b> <b>radio.</b> [...] It has been more widely deployed with Stryker Combat Teams and with troops deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan. As of August 2007, 100,000 MBITRs have been fielded, over 31,000 of which are in use by the US Army.|$|E
50|$|Commonly the {{definition}} of a PMR446 radio is a transceiver which transmits between 446.0-446.1 MHz and digital dPMR/DMR cover 446.1-446.2 MHz. Until recently, PMR446 <b>radios</b> were <b>handheld</b> <b>radios</b> with fixed antennas (see Technical information). In November 2015, Midland Radio announced the release of the GB1 mobile PMR446 radio for vehicular use.|$|R
50|$|Repeaters provide {{means by}} which VHF or UHF <b>handheld</b> <b>radios</b> can have their {{effective}} range greatly improved. VHF and UHF equipment has a significant size advantage over HF equipment, which typically requires antennas several meters long in length and are as such unsuitable for portable operation, especially in areas of dense bush.|$|R
5000|$|CB was {{the only}} {{practical}} two‑way radio system for the individual consumer, and served several subsets of users such as truck drivers, radio hobbyists, and those in need of short‑range radio communications, such as electricians, plumbers, and carpenters, who needed to communicate between job site and main office. While some users have {{moved on to other}} radio services, CB is still a popular hobby in many countries. The 27 MHz frequencies used by CB, which require a relatively long aerial and tend to propagate poorly indoors, discourage the use of <b>handheld</b> <b>radios.</b> Many users of <b>handheld</b> <b>radios</b> (families, hunters and hikers) have moved on to 49 MHz and the UHF Family Radio Service; those needing a simple radio for professional use (e.g., tradesmen) have moved on to [...] "dot-color" [...] Business Band radios and the VHF Multi-Use Radio Service.|$|R
50|$|Electrically short antennas {{like the}} rubber ducky {{are used in}} {{portable}} <b>handheld</b> <b>radio</b> equipment at VHF and UHF frequencies {{in place of a}} quarter wavelength whip antenna, which is inconveniently long and cumbersome at these frequencies. Many years after its invention in 1958, the rubber ducky antenna became the antenna of choice for many portable radio devices, including walkie-talkies and other portable transceivers, scanners and other devices where safety and robustness take precedence over antenna capabilities.|$|E

50|$|As German forces {{approached}} Warsaw in September 1939, {{both the}} Polish government and general staff escaped the city; however, {{most of the}} foreign diplomatic corps and other foreign nationals remained. Ditleff, acting as the doyen of the corps, tried early to contact German military authorities to arrange an orderly evacuation with a <b>handheld</b> <b>radio.</b> German airplanes tracked the transmission and strafed the car, but eventually {{he was able to}} negotiate a 4-hour cease-fire to arrange the evacuation of 1,200 individuals. They left in a convoy consisting of two trucks and sedans. Ditleff himself drove one car for 48 hours until he fell asleep behind the wheel.|$|E

5000|$|The {{motivation}} to deploy RoIP technology is usually driven {{by one of}} three factors: first, the need to span large geographic areas; second, the desire to provide more reliable, or at least more repairable links in radio systems; and third, to {{support the use of}} many base station users, that is, voice communications from stationary users rather than mobile or <b>handheld</b> <b>radios.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hatzalah uses a fly-car system, {{where members}} are {{assigned}} ad-hoc {{to respond to}} the emergency. The dispatcher requests any units for a particular emergency location. Members who think they will have best response times respond via <b>handheld</b> <b>radios,</b> and the dispatcher confirms the appropriate members. Two members will typically respond directly to the call in their private vehicles. A third member retrieves an ambulance from a base location.|$|R
50|$|Location of radio-tagged animals by {{triangulation}} is {{a widely}} applied research technique for studying the movement of animals. The technique was first used in the early 1960s, when the technology used in radio transmitters and batteries made them small enough to attach to wild animals, and is now widely deployed {{for a variety of}} wildlife studies. Most tracking of wild animals that have been affixed with radio transmitter equipment is done by a field researcher using a <b>handheld</b> <b>radio</b> direction finding device. When the researcher wants to locate a particular animal, the location of the animal can be triangulated by determining the direction to the transmitter from several locations.|$|E

50|$|The flight {{recorder}}s, {{either the}} {{cockpit voice recorder}} or the flight data recorder, from the ATR 42, didn't provide any data as there were no electrical power {{at the time of}} the accident. Therefore, the NTSC could only retrieve the flight recorders from the Boeing 737, which was supported with AC electrical power at the time. The NTSC stated that because the towed ATR 42 didn't have electrical power, none of the lights inside and outside the aircraft were on. Radio communication was also off, therefore the ground crew of the towed ATR 42 could only communicate to the Tower through the <b>handheld</b> <b>radio</b> communication.|$|E
50|$|Cadets {{are taught}} Radio Telecommunications skills in {{accordance}} with the Australian Army's Ratel training. Cadets are taught the use of communications equipment such as the army raven radios (a low band VHF set), or simple UHF <b>Handheld</b> <b>radios,</b> and the proper processes that apply to communications in the Army. Cadets are also taught the maintenance of their radio equipment. As of late, the RAVEN series of radios are becoming more common for use in cadets.|$|R
25|$|<b>Handheld</b> <b>radios</b> contain all the {{necessary}} equipment for radiocommunications with another station. A typical radio used as a handheld station integrates a transceiver with an antenna and a battery in one handheld package. Most handheld transceivers used in amateur radio are designed for operation on the VHF or UHF amateur radio bands and most often are capable of only FM voice communications transmissions. To conserve battery power, they have limited transmitter power, often below 1W, to cover a local range of typically a few km or miles.|$|R
