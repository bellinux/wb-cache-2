5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay {{and decides to}} stick around after he thinks it is a {{familiar}} setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about whilst growing up.|$|E
25|$|For UK foster parents, {{the trauma}} of losing the {{children}} they had looked after and grown to love could be just as bad. Some children and families kept contact and many held fond memories and grateful thanks {{for the people of}} the north who showed so much kindness. The Mayor of Bolton had threatened the islands with another invasion after liberation, as so many Lancashire holidaymakers would want to see the islands they had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about.|$|E
500|$|On October 22, {{after the}} work of the Commission had ended, Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which, {{according}} to Alia, was used [...] "to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November." [...] He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member Yekaterina Furtseva and Kapo, in which the former asked, [...] "Are you Hysni Kapo?! I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about you..." [...] Kapo replied, [...] "For good or bad?" [...] to which Furtseva stated, [...] "You have attacked the Soviet Union, but you are heading for trouble on that course," [...] getting [...] "the reply she deserved" [...] from Kapo, with Alia further writing that [...] "her mission was just to transmit the signal. Throughout the whole dinner she did not speak to us again." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrell's four voyages {{finally ended}} on [...] 1831, with {{his return to}} New York. He then wrote his Narrative of Four Voyages, which was {{published}} the following year. He attempted to resume his seafaring career, seeking employment with the London-based shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but his reputation had preceded {{him and he was}} rejected. Charles Enderby stated publicly that [...] "he had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of him that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him." [...] Morrell also sought to join Dumont D'Urville's expedition to the Weddell Sea in 1837, but his services were again declined. He reportedly died in 1839, [...] and is commemorated by Morrell Island, 59°27'S, 27°19'W, [...] an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub-group of the South Sandwich Islands. Robert Johnson, who coined the name New South Greenland, disappeared with his ship in 1826, while investigating the Antarctic waters in the vicinity [...] of what would later be known as the Ross Sea.|$|E
500|$|Though the Ministry of Transport {{was adamant}} that the {{services}} {{should not be}} destinations in their own right, they did acquire {{a reputation for being}} a popular place for motorists to visit. During the 1960s, the services were a regular stopping venue for bands such as Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles stopped at Watford Gap while travelling from Liverpool to gigs in the south in the early stage of their career. Jimi Hendrix <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about [...] "Blue Boar", as the services were then popularly known, that {{he thought it was a}} London nightclub. Gerry Marsden, leader of the Pacemakers regularly visited the services when touring, saying it was good for [...] "a quick stop and a quick nosh." [...] The Floyd's Nick Mason recalls Hendrix stopping off at the services at 2am, while The Zombies' Chris White thought the services were [...] "the feeding trough of the beat boom". Harper claimed [...] "everybody would meet at Watford Gap because it was the one place after a show where you were guaranteed a bit of a sit-down at 2am".|$|E
500|$|In London {{early in}} 1837, Morrell {{attempted}} to convert {{some of the}} purloined cargo into cash, but word of his activities had spread, and the proceeds were immediately confiscated by agents acting for Margaret Oakleys insurers. His reputation as a probable fraud prevented him from finding new employment; he sought work with the shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but Charles Enderby said that [...] "he had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of [...] {{that he did not}} think fit to enter into any engagement with him." [...] Thwarted in London, Morrell turned his attention to France. He had heard that d'Urville was organising an expedition to the Antarctic, and on June 20, 1837, wrote to the French Geographical Society in Paris to offer his services: [...] "I will engage to place the Proud Banner of France ten degrees nearer the Pole than any other Banner has ever been planted, providing I can obtain the command of a Small schooner ...properly manned and equipped". His offer was declined; Morrell was by now regarded as a fraud in France as well as in Britain and America.|$|E

500|$|Wayne Pommen, the first-choice Cambridge bow, {{was injured}} {{two days before}} the race, {{fracturing}} his wrist following a full-speed collision with the harbourmaster's launch during a practice start. [...] Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head but did not require medical attention. Cambridge number seven James Livingston said: [...] "For a couple of seconds I thought I was going to die. [...] We were going flat out {{and all of a sudden}} I heard Jim's voice. [...] I've never <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fear in anybody's voice before." [...] Pommen was circumspect: [...] "A few of us were feeling quite lucky last night... at the same time, it was very frustrating and disappointing... but there was no point sulking in the corner." [...] Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired. [...] Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith, brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew. [...] Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line-up of a crew been made. Along with James and David Livingston, this was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another.|$|E

Her husband only briefly appears in the manga, but in both the manga and the anime, he finds the Yokai Academy application. Kasumi is voiced by Haruhi Terada in the Japanese anime and by Maeghan Albach in the English dub.|$|E
2500|$|In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as {{megalomaniac}} who {{is after}} more than just Scottish Independence. Westminster's youngest MP, Mhairi Black assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: [...] "I like her a lot and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit. Ullman had impersonated Willcox back in the early 1980s. Sturgeon took to Twitter to comment on the impersonation: [...] "Great to see my fav Scottish designers @TottyRocksLtd featuring on @TraceyUllmanTV last night)" [...] Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying [...] "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. [...] "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about it. I thought it was really funny." [...] When asked if she should her in all the [...] "Brexit drama", Sturgeon responded: [...] "I definitely think she should! She's got the outfit and everything!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'O, {{if it had}} {{but come}} a little sooner!' moaned John within him. He replied {{as soon as he}} could regain self-command, 'I am glad Bob is in the navy at last--he is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more fitted for that than the merchant-service--so brave by nature, ready for any daring deed. I have <b>heard</b> ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more about his doings on board the Victory. Captain Hardy took special notice that when he--' ...|$|R

60|$|In a {{very short}} time after the face of the Jungfrau came fully into view, the {{attention}} of all the company that were looking at the scene was arrested by the commencement of another peal of the same thundering sound that Mr. George and Rollo had <b>heard</b> with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> wonder in coming up the mountain. A great many exclamations immediately broke out from the party.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>heard</b> quite <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in {{the hotel}} where I board. It is Long Jim and his partner who have done the job of which both you and I are accused.

500|$|When Debs was {{released}} from the Atlanta Penitentiary, the other prisoners sent him off with [...] "a roar of cheers" [...] and a crowd of 50,000 greeted his return to Terre Haute to the accompaniment of band music. En route home, Debs was warmly received at the White House by Harding, who greeted him by saying: [...] "Well, I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> damned <b>much</b> about you, Mr. Debs, that I am now glad to meet you personally." ...|$|R
60|$|The men {{had been}} staunch enough in their devotion and loyalty {{as long as they}} were in no danger of being {{overtaken}} by the Russian and his party. They had <b>heard,</b> however, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the atrocious disposition of Rokoff that they had grown to hold him in mortal terror, and now that they knew he was close upon them their timid hearts would fortify them no longer, and as quickly as possible they deserted the three whites.|$|R

60|$|Unable to bear it any longer, {{he walked}} towards Wapping, bought a Southwester, {{examined}} {{the lists of}} shipping, and entered into conversation {{with one or two}} sailors about the vessels making up their crews; intending to go down after dark, to meet the skipper of a craft bound for Lisbon, who, he <b>heard,</b> was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in want of a mate as perhaps to overlook the lack of testimonials, and at any rate take him on board on Sunday.|$|R

60|$|The {{children}} {{liked it}} because it was very exciting, {{and at the same time}} it had no moral, so that when it was all over, they could feel that they had not been excited just for the moral.
