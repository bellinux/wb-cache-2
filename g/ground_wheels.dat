Parametric {{equations}} were used to describe the motion of path followed by the weeding tines. The effective performance of soil working tool was related to the kinematic parameter of the soil working tools, the forward travel distance and speed of the rotary tines and working action of components of weeding tool. The design parameters for appropriate soil working tools and implements were established. The weeder consists of a 5 hp-petrol engine, three <b>ground</b> <b>wheels</b> (pneumatic), tool assembly, frame and handle. The construction of the powered rotary weeder was done in the workshop of the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria.

40|$|Application of {{electronics}} in {{the automotive industry}} is extensively spreading. Electric power steering is hereby an exciting improvement to steering systems since the introduction of hydraulic power steering systems, which was first introduced as early as 1970 s. Drivers desire hydraulic power steering behaviour because of its natural feel while providing assistance, but it has many disadvantages such as component lifecycle, oil leaks and power consumption. The use of electronic power steering provides the opportunity to remove such problems associated to hydraulic power steering and introduce benefits in terms of adaptability, comfort and safety. Since today's vehicles are making use of the by-wire technology for most components in the car, the additional electronic power steering {{will make it possible}} to have a full range of automated driving aids. Even though electric power steering comes with many advantages, there are still some disadvantages which are mentioned in numerous articles. These problems are mostly described as a lack in steering feel. More precisely it's described as if the front wheels are disconnected from the <b>ground</b> <b>wheels.</b> Many studies show different algorithms to minimise this, however {{it can be seen that}} even in the most successful products there is some complaint about this. An important tool to analyse this problem is the use of driving simulators. The implementation of a steering model that maintains high fidelity dynamics will bring many advantages. At the moment steering systems are developed by vehicle testing which is considered expensive and time consuming. The study of steering models will give more insight for the development in steering systems and the implementation in a HIL-simulator will ease the process of steering system development. This thesis will show the implementation of a steering model in a high fidelity steering simulator and it will propose a different method for solving the problem of steering feel loss. Finally it will conclude with driver in the loop experiments to show and evaluate the proposed method. Delft Center for Systems and ControlMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|All {{vehicles}} {{require a}} suspension system {{in order to}} provide comfort for their passengers and make the car stable and controllable in all its attitudes with respect to the road surface. The evolution of technology has led many car manufacturing companies to develop their suspension systems in innovative materials, one of the most exploited of which is aluminium. Over the years, its structural strength and workability, combined with its rather competitive cost and above all limited weight, have reached such a level that it {{has become one of the}} most intensely used materials. In fact, it is well known that weight affects the fuel consumption of cars; the lower the weight, the better the consumption and therefore the lower the pollutant emissions, today a priority element because of increasingly stricter norms on this subject. This reason further encouraged the choice of aluminium in the entire complex of the elements between the wheels and the body to which suspension systems belong. By way of an example, the new model of the Audi A 4 uses a front suspension system with independent aluminium arms which makes it possible to reduce the value of the car’s non-suspended weight by 8. 5 kg. Similarly, vehicles like the S class Mercedes-Benz, the BMW X 7, the Volkswagen Phaeton, the Ferrari 360, the Audi A 6 /A 8, and the Maserati GT use aluminium in many of their components, especially in the suspension systems. The current C class Mercedes-Benz uses single aluminium arms in the structure of the MacPherson suspension system. In the case of suspension systems, as well as helping to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle, the use of light alloys improves its handling and dynamic behaviour. Today this is a highly significant aspect since, in the design phase of a motor vehicle, the priority is not so much to produce a car that allows the driver to “go fast” as to achieve a remarkably easy drive (for example, drivers highly appreciate the fact that they have to effect a minimum number of corrections when they drive through a bend). Reducing the weight of these elements implies a reduction of non-suspended weights, in other words of the parts in direct contact with the <b>ground</b> (<b>wheels,</b> tyres, brakes and components of the suspension system); as we know, these are the ones which have the greatest effect on the vehicle’s road holding. The development of suspension systems in aluminium also helps to limit the vehicle’s moment of inertia with respect to the vertical axis, the one which has the greatest effect on the vehicle’s dynamic behaviour when it changes its trajectory. Suspension systems are ‘peripheral’ masses, so even a slight change to them makes a great contribution towards limiting this parameter. A highly evident example of this is to be found in Formula 1 cars, whose suspension systems are extremely small-sized. In mass-produced vehicles, such extreme configurations are never achieved because during the sizing process extremely restrictive safety criteria have to be respected for all the components of the front axle, the steering system and the rear axle, which ensure that no fractures ever occur for the entire lifecycle of the vehicle, even in extreme or overloaded conditions. Another advantage of using aluminium in suspension systems derives from the material’s high level of ductility which makes it possible to achieve all sorts of shapes: this is an extremely important aspect if the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the suspension system call for the presence of leverages with complex geometries which would be difficult to achieve using machining operations on steel or cast irons. Special emphasis is placed on aluminium’s better crash properties compared with steel (to the advantage of passenger safety) and its excellent behaviour towards corrosion (so that pieces no longer need to be surface treated) ...|$|E

Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) with particle filtering is a popular method for localizing robots with laser range finders.

40|$|To {{increase}} the productivity {{per unit area}} of small land holdings and considering the economic condition of Indian farmers, it is quite necessary to have suitable agricultural implements which farmers can use and also allow them to use for custom hiring. Weeding is an important agricultural unit operation. Delay and negligence in weeding operation affect the crop yield up to 30 to 60 per cent. With regard this, a manually operated weeder was developed and tested ergonomically. Various parameters such as speed of travel, time of operation, field capacity, weeding efficiency and horse power requirement were considered during the testing. The <b>ground</b> <b>wheel</b> of weeder (390 mm Ф) was fabricated from mild steel flat of 52 x 3 mm. The weeding blades were made from steel flat to impart enough strength to sustain the prevailing forces acting on it. V-shape support made of mild steel was directly welded to the handle to join the <b>ground</b> <b>wheel</b> with the main frame. The arrangement was also made to adjust the height and angle of the handle as per the need and posture of the operator. The weeding efficiency of the developed weeder was satisfactory and {{it was easy to}} operate. The developed weeder could work up to 30 mm depth with field capacity of 0. 048 ha/hr and higher weeding efficiency was obtained up to 92. 5 %. During weeding operation, the peak heart rate of the subjects was found to range from 142 to 150 beats per min. In case of heavy work and dense grass infested field, the rest pause of 14 min was required by the subjects to come to the normal heart rate. The overall performance of the weeder was promising...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{reproduce}} driving techniques to mimic expert race drivers and obtain the open-loop control signals {{that may be}} used by auto-pilot agents driving autonomous <b>ground</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicles. Race drivers operate their vehicles at the limits of the acceleration envelope. An accurate characterization of the acceleration capacity of the vehicle is required. Understanding and reproduction of such complex maneuvers also require a physics-based mathematical description of the vehicle dynamics. While most of the modeling issues of ground-vehicles/automobiles are already well established in the literature, lack of understanding of the physics associated with friction generation results in ad-hoc approaches to tire friction modeling. In this work we revisit this aspect of the overall vehicle modeling and develop a tire friction model that provides physical interpretation of the tire forces. The new model is free of those singularities at low vehicle speed and wheel angular rate that are inherent in the widely used empirical static models. In addition, the dynamic nature of the tire model proposed herein allows the study of dynamic effects such as transients and hysteresis. The trajectory-planning problem for an autonomous <b>ground</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicle is formulated in an optimal control framework aiming to minimize the time of travel and maximize the use of the available acceleration capacity. The first approach to solve the optimal control problem is using numerical techniques. Numerical optimization allows incorporation of a vehicle model of high fidelity and generates realistic solutions. Such an optimization scheme provides an ideal platform to study the limit operation of the vehicle, which would not be possible via straightforward simulation. In this work we emphasize the importance of online applicability of the proposed methodologies. This underlines the need for optimal solutions that require little computational cost and are able to incorporate real, unpredictable environments. A semi-analytic methodology is developed to generate the optimal velocity profile for minimum time travel along a prescribed path. The semi-analytic nature ensures minimal computational cost while a receding horizon implementation allows application of the methodology in uncertain environments. Extensions to increase fidelity of the vehicle model are finally provided. Ph. D.
