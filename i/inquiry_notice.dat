50|$|In 2010, in Merck & Co. v.

In this particular case, shareholders sued Merck after the value of $10 billion Vioxx tanked due to concerns about dangerous side effects arguing that Merck withheld information about the dangers of the drug. Merck asserted a statute of limitations defense, which would have ended before the shareholders had knowledge of all the requisite elements of fraud, but Frederick argued that the statute of limitations should not begin until the plaintiff has enough facts to survive a motion to dismiss.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. “Section 4 in the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (the PAJA) {{is a great}} {{achievement}} for South African administrative law, and its very presence in the PAJA {{is likely to have}} a positive effect on the rate and quality of participation in administrative decision-making. Despite the accuracy of this statement, how costly is public participation to efficient administrative action? In terms of section 4 of the PAJA, in cases where an administrative action materially and adversely affects the rights of the public, to give effect to the right to procedurally fair administrative action, an administrator, must decide whether to hold a public <b>inquiry,</b> follow a <b>notice</b> and comment procedure, follow both a public <b>inquiry</b> and <b>notice</b> and comment procedure, or where an administrator is empowered by any empowering provision, follow a procedure which is fair but different or to follow any procedure that gives effect to section 3 of the PAJA. However, if reasonable and justifiable in the circumstances, an administrator may depart from the requirement to involve the public in the administrative decision. In determining whether a departure from the public participation procedure is reasonable and justifiable, several factors must be taken in account; one such factor is the need to promote an efficient administration and good governance. To what degree should the public accept this departure? The PAJA’s preamble sets out its purpose, which is to promote an efficient administration and good governance, and create a culture of accountability, openness and transparency in the public administration. It can thus be said that an efficient administration is an important aspect of just administrative action. This paper considers the instances where public bodies departed from the requirements of section 4 of the PAJA through a proper assessment of case law and case studies. It considers practical examples of administrative action by South African public entities and instances where the public participation process affected the efficiency of the administrator and the consequences thereof. This paper seeks to answer the question ‘Why is creating a culture of transparency and public participation so important to lawful, reasonable and procedural fair administrative action?...|$|R
50|$|Monks {{is forced}} by Mr. Brownlow to divulge his secrets: {{his real name}} is Edward Leeford, and he is Oliver's {{paternal}} half-brother and, although he is legitimate, he was born of a loveless marriage. Oliver's mother, Agnes, became their father's true love after Monks witnessed his parents' divorce. Mr. Brownlow has a picture of Agnes and began making <b>inquiries</b> when he <b>noticed</b> a marked resemblance between her and Oliver. Monks has spent many years searching for his father's child - not to befriend him, but to destroy him (see Henry Fielding's Tom Jones for similar circumstances). Brownlow asks Oliver to give half his inheritance (which proves to be meagre) to Monks {{because he wants to}} give him a second chance; and Oliver, being prone to giving second chances, is more than happy to comply. Monks later moves to America, where he squanders his money, reverts to crime, and ultimately dies in prison. Fagin is arrested and condemned to the gallows. On the eve of his hanging, in an emotional scene, Oliver, accompanied by Mr. Brownlow, goes to visit the old reprobate in Newgate Prison, where Fagin's terror at being hanged has caused him to lose himself in daydreams and develop a fever.|$|R
40|$|The NSW Law Reform Commission Report 132 Penalty Notices {{reviews and}} makes {{recommendations}} {{in relation to}} the penalty notice system in NSW. Penalty notices are imposed most often for minor offences, but the topic is nevertheless an important one. People {{are far more likely to}} have contact with the justice system through a penalty notice than through a court. In 2009 / 10, 2. 83 million penalty notices were issued in NSW, with a total value of more than $ 491 million dollars. In comparison, in 2009 the NSW Local Court imposed 116, 915 penalties, of which 53, 543 were fines. If, as appears likely, people make judgments about the justice system on the basis of experience with penalty notices, the fairness, consistency, and transparency of the penalty notice system is important, not only to those who receive a penalty notice, but potentially to the reputation of the justice system more broadly. The efficiencies associated with issuing and enforcing penalty notices act as an inducement to extend the number of offences dealt with in this way. NSW has over 7, 000 penalty notice offences under some 110 different statutes. The number of penalty notice offences is growing steadily and the seriousness of the offences is increasing. Most recently, penalty notices in the form of Criminal Infringement Notices (CINs) are being issued for minor criminal offences that have traditionally been dealt with by courts. Penalty notices were introduced, and have expanded in scope, because of their significant advantages, especially their cost benefits. They save time and money for the agencies that issue them, for courts that avoid lengthy lists of minor offences, and for recipients who do not have to take time off work to attend court or pay court or legal costs. The penalty is immediate and certain and is usually significantly lower than the maximum penalty available for the offence, were it to be dealt with by a court. Penalty notice recipients also avoid having a conviction recorded. However penalty notices also have disadvantages. One of these is their tendency to proliferate in ways that are not always consistent and fair. The inconsistencies in the present system, dealt with in Part Two of this report, are severe enough to threaten the reputation of the penalty notice system. They have lead to suggestions, reported to this <b>inquiry,</b> that penalty <b>notice</b> offences may be created, and penalty levels set, for improper reasons such as revenue raising...|$|R

40|$|This Comment will {{trace the}} history of Merck, {{culminating}} in the Supreme Court’s extension of {{the statute of limitations}} periods for private security fraud suits, and discuss the impact this holding will have on future security fraud litigation, both for investor-plaintiffs and issuer-defendants. Part I will examine the facts and procedural history of Merck, which began in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and ultimately reached the Supreme Court of the United States. This procedural background will illuminate the various interpretations existing prior to Merck regarding the events that trigger the statute of limitations period. Part II identifies the core regulations decidedly interpreted by the Supreme Court in Merck, their application to security fraud suits, and the extent of the existing circuit split. Part III extricates the essential holdings of Merck, namely the discovery requirement of scienter as a fact constituting a violation, and the rejection of <b>inquiry</b> <b>notice</b> as “discovery” so as to trigger the statute of limitations. Finally, Part IV advances several potential implications for the decision, including increased numbers of private security fraud suits and difficulty for corporations in assessing risk for purposes of D 2 ̆ 6 O liability insurance...|$|E
40|$|It is {{black-letter}} {{law that}} in order to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment, the rendering court must have had personal jurisdiction over the defendant. While the principle is clear, it is an open question as to whose law governs the question of personal jurisdiction: that of the rendering court or that of the recognizing court. In other words, is the foreign court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction over the defendant governed by foreign law (the law of F 1), domestic law (the law of F 2), or some combination thereof? While courts have taken a number of different approaches, it seems that many courts regard foreign law as relevant {{to the question of whether}} the foreign court possessed personal jurisdiction over the defendant. In this Article, I argue that U. S. courts should not be looking to foreign law (in whole or in part) to determine whether a foreign court had jurisdiction over the defendant in the original action. I present five arguments in support of this contention: (1) there is no statutory authority pointing to the application of foreign law; (2) U. S. courts are not well-positioned to apply foreign jurisdictional law; (3) re-examining assertions of jurisdiction under foreign law violates international comity, (4) an examination of foreign law is usually unnecessary because jurisdiction is also assessed according to U. S. standards; and (5) U. S. courts do not do a good job applying foreign jurisdictional law. Instead, I argue that courts should apply American law to assess whether a foreign court was jurisdictionally competent. This, in turn, raises the question: What is 2 ̆ 2 American 2 ̆ 2 law? I maintain that courts should apply broad federal standards of jurisdiction, and not state-based ones, to determine whether the rendering court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant. This Article also looks closely at two particular areas of jurisdiction law that are particularly complicated as they relate to the choice of law issue: submission and notice. With respect to submission, U. S. courts seem to be unclear as to whose law applies in assessing whether a defendant in a foreign action submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. In particular, many U. S. courts defer to the foreign court 2 ̆ 7 s interpretations as to whether the acts of the defendant constituted submission. With respect to notice, there is a lack of clarity as to how notice relates to personal jurisdiction in the context of the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. Here too, there is confusion as to whose law of notice applies in assessing whether a defendant received adequate notice of the proceeding. Consistent with the argument above, this Article takes the position that U. S. standards, and not foreign ones, should ultimately guide the submission and <b>notice</b> <b>inquiries</b> in the recognition context. Finally, because much of the law in this area is codified in either the 1962 Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act or the 2005 Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act, I propose concrete changes to the language of the uniform acts that would address the choice of law problem in the recognition of foreign judgments and would clarify the intersection between notice and personal jurisdiction in the uniform acts...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} cases {{demonstrate the}} need for standardized treatment of the IRS {{in relation to a}} state’s recording requirements, especially when dealing with an unrecorded divorce decree. While state law defines what interest a taxpayer retains after such conveyance, this Note suggests that future courts should adopt the majority approach when determining what interest the IRS acquires after issuance of a § 6321 tax lien on a taxpayer’s real property. This Note begins, in Part II, by discussing the major cases in the circuit courts that have led to this dispute, along with the recent IRS General Counsel Memorandum which has reignited the conflict. Then in section III. A, this Note demonstrates that a § 6321 tax lien should only attach to the interests of the taxpayer and not to the interests of the taxpayer’s creditors. In section III. B, this Note analyzes the application and purpose of state recording acts when integrated with a federal tax lien. Next, in section III. C, this Note argues against a court’s treatment of the IRS as a creditor without notice. That section further discusses a possible undeveloped argument that a docketed divorce decree dividing interest in property should qualify as constructive or <b>inquiry</b> <b>notice</b> upon the IRS when a tax lien arises. The Note concludes, in section III. D, with suggestions of judicial and legislative solutions to standardize the treatment of the IRS in tax lien proceedings with regards to conveyances contained in unrecorded divorce decrees...|$|E
