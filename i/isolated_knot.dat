40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty strains of Pseudomonas syringae subsp. savastanoi from Olea europaea, Olea europaea var. sylvestris, Nerium oleander, Fraxinus angustifolia and Retama sphaerocarpa, and four type strains of other pathovars were studied, {{investigating}} 102 phenotypic traits, among which we include biochemical characteristics, assimilation of different carbon sources, sensitivity or resistance to antibiotics and indoleacetic acid (IAA) production. Results were analysed with an affinity dendrogram via the Jaccard coefficient. They indicate an influence of environmental factors on {{the formation of the}} 15 phenons obtained, since <b>isolated</b> (<b>knot)</b> strains from the same species but different geographical areas are segregated. Segregation, also detected in strains from different hosts within the same area, added to the pathogenicity test helps to characterise these strains as different pathovars.

40|$|We present {{narrowband}} {{images of}} the Kepler supernova remnant obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The images, with an angular resolution of 0. 05 " reveal {{the structure of the}} emitting gas in unprecedented detail. Radiative and nonradiative shocks are found in close proximity, unresolvable in gro~md-based spectra, indicating that the pre-shock medium is highly clumped. The ionization structure, traced by differences in the [0 111] to [N 11] flux ratio, varies on subarcsecond scales. The variation is due to 110 th differences in shock velocity as well as gradients in the evolutionary stage of the shocks. A pro~llinent complex of knots protruding beyond the boundary of the ren~nallt in the northwest is found to consist of bright radiative knots, collected by arcuate nonradiative filaments. Based on the coincidence of the optical emission with a bright <b>isolated</b> <b>knot</b> of X-ray emission, we infer that this feature is due to a Rayleigh-Taylor finger that formed at the contact discontinuity and overtook the primary blast wave...|$|E

The radio image, which includes large-scale emission, shows a clumpy shell of emission with moderate central brightness.

From the IR data, evidence is found of the remnant's expansion into a strong density gradient (distinct from the more gentle gradient of the Galactic plane). A strong <b>isolated</b> <b>knot</b> of enhanced X-ray and radio emission is a region of enhanced infrared emission as well.

The major drawbacks of the previous method mostly depends on the variety {{of the distribution of}} knots and their geometric shapes. Our aim is to extend the robustness by performing the accumulation process of Z-Motion differently and by suppressing the whorl distribution constraint. This is achieved both through a polar Z-Motion accumulation and an aggregation process of connected components related to maxima localization in the accumulation space.

As finite-energy physical fields they represent initial states for fields such as the magnetic field in a plasma, or the vorticity field in a fluid. We give a systematic procedure for calculating the vector potential, starting from complex scalar functions with knotted zero filaments, thus enabling an explicit computation of the helicity of these knotted fields. The construction {{can be used to}} generate <b>isolated</b> <b>knotted</b> flux tubes, filled by knots encoded in the lines of the vector field.

The presence of both Si and Fe, with abundance ratios that vary from knot to knot, indicates that these came from the transition region between the Si- and Fe-rich zones in the exploded star, possibly as a result of energy input to the ejecta at late times due to the radioactive decay of 56 Ni and 56 Co. Two cases for the continuum emission from the global spectrum were modeled: one where the continuum is dominated by hydrogen thermal bremsstrahlung radiation; another where the continuum arises from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The former case requires a relatively large value for the ambient density (~ 1 cm^- 3). Another estimate of the ambient density comes from using the shell structure of the remnant in the context of dynamical models. This requires a much lower value for the density (< 0. 05 cm^- 3) which is more consistent with other evidence known about 0509 - 67. 5. We therefore conclude that the bulk of the continuum emission from 0509 - 67. 5 has a non-thermal origin.

We aim at understanding the physical origin of the X-ray and optical emission in FilD, at understanding the role of the different physical processes at work, and at obtaining a key for the interpretation of future X-ray observations of SNRs. Methods. To this end we have pursued an accurate “forward ” modeling of the interaction of the Vela SNR shock with an ISM cloud. We perform hydrodynamic simulations and we directly compare the observables synthesized from the simulations with the data. Results. We explore four different model setups, choosing the values of the physical parameters on the basis of our preliminary analysis of the X-ray data. We synthesize X-ray emission maps and spectra filtered through the XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS instrumental response. The impact of a shock front at 6 million Kelvin on an elliptical cloud 30 times denser than the ambient medium describes well the shock-cloud interaction processes in the Vela FilD region in terms of spectral properties and morphology of the X-ray and optical emission. Conclusions. The bulk of the X-ray emission in the FilD knot originates in the cloud material heated by the transmitted shock front, but significant X-ray emission is also associated to the cloud material, which evaporates, as an effect of thermal conduction, in the intercloud medium.

40|$|An {{exciting}} area {{of research}} in star formation is tlie study of outflows driven by mass loss from Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). This mass loss can {{be as much as}} 102 ̆ 2 ^ MQ yr 1 with wind velocities of the order 300 km s 2 ̆ 7 ^. The nature of the wind that drives this Tnass loss is still uncertain. Evidence that a YSO is undergoing mass loss is provided through the effect the stellar wind has on the surrounding medium. Phenomena such as bipolar molecular outflows, masers and the Herbig-Haro (HH) objects are all indicators of a YSO undergoing mass loss. Visible observations have identified the following morphological features to be present in most outflows: • An embedded YSO which drives the outflow; • A collimated jet and counter jet; • A section where the jet disappears, but <b>isolated</b> emission <b>knots</b> remain; • A working surface (bow shock) with associated HH Object(s). Imaging at optical wavelengths has shown that the HH objects and HH jets are regions of shock-excited gas emitting in Ha and forbidden excitation lines such as [O I] (U 6300, 6363) and [S II] (U 6716, 6731). Therefore the different shock structures of the HH complex can be distinguished by comparing images at optical emission lines with differing excitation parameters ie: [S II] (2 ̆ 2 u 100 km s 2 ̆ 2 ^). Due to heavy extinction from star forming clouds, many YSOs are obscured at optical wavelengths. Near-infrared images often provide the first identification of the driving source of the outflow as the optical extinction becomes less important at longer wavelengths. HH objects/jets are associated with both low-luminosity (Lbol - 1 - 100 Lq) T Tauri stars and high-luminosity YSOs (Lbol Lq) such as IRAS sources. The visibility of the source depends the amount of obscuration, the orientation of the flow and circumstellar disk. Digitised images from the ESO/SERC southern sky survey plates are presented, and when combined with [S II], Ha and H 2 images from the literature, are useful for identifying features within the outflow complex, and identifying the driving YSO. This will be beneficial when looking for new HH objects from the ESO/SERC plates in areas of known star formation...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} the ROSAT {{high-resolution}} imager and optical emission line data to study {{the structure of a}} bright optical knot on the southeastern rim of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. This knot has been identified as an encounter between the blast wave and a small <b>isolated</b> cloud. The <b>knot</b> appears in projection just behind the blast wave, which is traced by Balmer line filaments which bound the X-ray emission. The knot is a prominent X-ray feature, consisting of a numerb of filaments which are correlated with the optical line emission. These data permit a detailed view of the blast wave interaction. By combining the optical and X-ray data it is possible to trace the blast wave as a continuous surface from its southern edge around the western side of the cloud that then continues on to the north. The southeastern knot is an indentation {{on the surface of the}} blast wave. Thus the southeastern knot is not a small cloud that has been overrun by the blast wave, but the tip of a larger cloud. Bright X-ray emission is associated with bright radiative filaments. The location of this emission, upstream of the radiative shocks, implies that the enhanced X-rays come from a reverse shock. The presence of a reverse shock is further evidence that the southeastern knot represents an early stage of a blast wave encountering a large cloud. A consistent picture of the Cygnus Loop as an explosion within a preexisting cavity is emerging. These observations agree with that picture...|$|R
