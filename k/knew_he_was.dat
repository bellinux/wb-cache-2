5|$|Although Ruth <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> nearly {{finished}} as a player, he {{desired to}} remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated {{that he was not}} yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.|$|E
5|$|Laing, who {{was charged}} with maleficium, confessed she had made spells with buckets of water and burning coals as well as {{stabbing}} needles into a wax model of her intended victim. She met the Devil {{in the form of}} a black dog on Ceres Moor and made a bargain with him; she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the Devil as he had the ability to change shape and had undergone a transformation in front of her. Initially she offered him her daughter then her granddaughter who was six years old. The four other women were named as co-conspirators in her confession.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Archer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Nigel Havers. The character was created and introduced as a love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). Executive producer Kim Crowther revealed the team wanted {{an actor who}} was slightly younger than Audrey and who was very charming. Various actors were considered for the part, but the casting director suggested Havers as she <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{a big fan of}} the show. The actor said he could not turn down a chance to appear in Coronation Street as his character had an interesting story arc. Havers was contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut as Lewis in the episode broadcast on 18 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern â€“ he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, Falcons owner Arthur Blank {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick's signing bonus. He said the team had no {{immediate}} plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues. It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of his $37 million bonus. The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons' contention that Vick <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.|$|E

5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E
5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey told her he went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{conversion}} was not immediate, but {{he contacted}} Polly's family and announced his intentions to marry her. Her parents were hesitant {{as he was}} known to be unreliable and impetuous. They <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> profane, but they allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake. He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries. Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in Africa now as a captain procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, and subsequently transported them to North America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her {{at the beginning of each}} trip. After three shipping experiences in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery when, at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.|$|E

Concerned by Stacey telling people her secrets, {{he wonders if}} she has ceased taking medication for her bipolar disorder. He tells her {{that she needs to}} keep the truth about Lily's father {{and the fact that she}} killed Peggy's husband Archie (Larry Lamb) several months previously to herself. Phil tries to convince various people to let him out as he is suffering withdrawal symptoms, but nobody will. Janine awakens in Richard's flat and gets dressed, though they did not have sex. She returns home and tells Pat that she feels guilty, and Pat tells her not to inform Ryan. Janine fears that she is not good enough for Ryan, but he reassures her and they marry. Stacey attends their wedding reception in The Queen Victoria, leaving Lily in a bedroom upstairs. She is surprised by a photograph of Peggy and Archie, and is frightened to hear Phil making noises in the living room. Stacey tells Peggy that she thinks Archie is alive and locked upstairs. Peggy assures Stacey that Archie is dead, telling her that Bradley killed him, as he was posthumously found guilty of the murder. Stacey then confesses that she killed Archie.|$|E
