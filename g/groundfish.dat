40|$|Adjacent to Chile’s {{long and}} narrow {{continental}} shelf, the Patagonian Inner Sea (PES) {{is among the}} largest and most complex estuarine systems in the world. The PES harbours high concentrations of juveniles and adults of important <b>groundfishes,</b> which spawn within or in near proximity to it.

We used otolith stable isotopes to evaluate the relative contribution of several PES and continental shelf regions to recruitment of Patagonian gren-adier, one of the most abundant <b>groundfishes</b> in the area. Seawater chemistry confirmed that d 13 C and d 18 O differentiated these nursery and feeding regions. Estimated recruitments from PES nurseries to adult feeding regions were important (10 – 35 %), but lower than dom-inant contributions from shelf nurseries (64 – 85 %). Stable isotope differences within otoliths indicated, however, that most adults had previously used PES habitats as subadults.

40|$|We compare {{results of}} bottom trawl surveys off Washington, Oregon, and California in 1977, 1980, 1983, and 1986 to discern trends in {{population}} abundance, distribution, and biology. Catch {{per unit of}} effort, area-swept biomass estimates, and age and length compositions for 12 commercially important west coast <b>groundfishes</b> are presented to illustrate trends over the lO-year period. We discuss the precision, accuracy, and statistical significance of observed trends in abundance estimates. The influence of water temperature {{on the distribution of}} <b>groundfishes</b> is also briefly examined. Abundance estimates of canary rockfish, Sebastes pinniger, and yellowtail rockfish, S. Jlavidus, declined during the study period; greater declines were observed in Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus, lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, and arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias. Biomass estimates of Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and English, rex, and Dover soles (Pleuronectes vetulus, Errex zachirus, and Microstomus pacificus) increased, while bocaccio, S. paucispinis, and chilipepper, S. goodei, were stable. Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, biomass estimates increased markedly from 1977 to 1980 and declined moderately thereafter. Precision was lowest for rockfishes, lingcod, and sablefish; it was highest for flatfishes because they were uniformly distributed. The accuracy of survey estimates could be gauged only for yellowtail and canary rockfish and sablefish. All fishery-based analyses produced much larger estimates of abundance than bottom trawl surveys-indicative of the true catchability of survey trawls. Population trends from all analyses compared well except in canary rockfish, the species that presents the greatest challenge to obtaining reasonable precision and one that casts doubts on the usefulness of bottom trawl surveys for estimating its abundance.

INPFC nations worked to ensure the maximum sustained productivity of fishery resources in the North Pacific Ocean while encouraging conservation and contributed to the understanding of anadromous fish species, <b>groundfishes,</b> crabs, and marine mammals in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea by publishing scientific bulletins, annual fisheries statistics, and annual reports.|$|R
500|$|In {{the western}} North Atlantic, {{porbeagles}} feed mainly on pelagic fishes and squid in spring, and on <b>groundfishes</b> in the fall; this pattern {{corresponds to the}} spring-fall migration of these sharks from deeper to shallower waters, and the most available prey types in those respective habitats. Therefore, the porbeagle {{seems to be an}} opportunistic predator without strong diet specificity. During spring and summer in the Celtic Sea and on the outer Nova Scotian Shelf, porbeagles congregate at tidally induced thermal fronts to feed on fish that have been drawn by high concentrations of zooplankton. Hunting porbeagles regularly dive from the surface {{all the way to the}} bottom, cycling back every few hours; this vertical movement may aid in the detection of olfactory cues.

The expected increase in abundance was observed for only 3 of 14 species after this closure, and catch rates of most (10) of the abundant species declined through time. Many of these changes were stepwise (abrupt) rather than gradual, and many stocks exhibited changes in catch rate during the 3 -year period from 1997 through 2000. No detectable change was recorded for either temperature or surface salinity over the entire sampling period.

40|$|All {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} platforms have finite economic life spans. One of the decommissioning options for these platforms is complete removal, requiring the use of explosives to dislodge the support structure from below the seafloor. Off California, this decommissioning option would kill large numbers of platform-associated and commercially important <b>groundfishes</b> that inhabit the bases of the platforms, and may potentially affect regional fish populations. Capturing and translocating fishes before removing a platform might mitigate the effects of platform removal. In this study, we acoustically tagged 79 rockfishes and lingcod from three oil platforms in the east Santa Barbara Channel and translocated them to a natural reef inside a state marine reserve at Anacapa Island to determine whether individuals would home back to their platforms of capture, or take up residency at their new location. Movements between natural and platform habitats were monitored over a two-year period. Twenty-five percent of all tagged fishes translocated to a natural reef returned to their home platforms relatively quickly, traveling distances from 11 km to ≥ 18 km, in 10. 5 h to 17 d.

In addition, high-definition videos were taken from these tows. From the beam trawl sampling {{there were no significant differences}} found in fish assemblages, dissolved oxygen, or temperature based on line, but there was a significant difference in communities and temperature based on depth.

40|$|We {{examined}} the habitat of juvenile haddock {{on the eastern}} Scotian Shelf (off Nova Scotia, Canada) in relation to grab-sampled benthic macrofaunal invertebrate species assemblages {{in order to determine}} whether there were significant differences in benthic macrofauna between areas of historically persistent high and low juvenile haddock abundance. Our analyses were conducted over two spatial scales in each of two years: among banks (Emerald, Western and Sable Island), approximately 60 km distant from each other, and between areas of high and low juvenile haddock abundance at distances of 10 to 30 km-all in an area that had not experienced <b>groundfishing</b> in the decade prior to sampling. We also examined fine-scale (10 s of metres) within-site variability in the macrofauna and used surficial sediment characteristics, along with hydrographic variables, to identify environmental correlates. PERMANOVA identified statistically significant differences in biomass, density and composition of the benthos associated with juvenile haddock abundance; however it was difficult to determine whether the results had biological relevance. Post hoc tests showed that these differences occurred only on Sable Island Bank where both fish and benthos may have been independently responding to sediment type which was most different there (100 % sand in the area of low haddock abundance vs. 22 % gravel in the area of high haddock abundance). In total, 383 benthic taxa representing 13 phyla were identified. Annelida was the most specious phylum (36. 29 % of taxa, representing 33 families), followed by Arthropoda (with Crustaceans, mostly Amphipoda, accounting for 25. 07 % {{of the total number of}} taxa).

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Skates (Rajiformes: Rajoidei) are an {{extremely}} {{diverse group of}} cartilaginous, marine fishes that are common mesopredators in benthic communities. Population declines, shifts in assemblage structure, and ecological interactions with exploited <b>groundfishes</b> have focused increased scientific and management attention on skates. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to address a knowledge gap in the ecology of eastern North Pacific (ENP) skates, and thereby inform the development of improved monitoring and management strategies for exploited skate stocks off the U. S. West Coast and in the Gulf of Alaska. Chapter 1 investigated spatial associations of ENP skates in continental shelf and upper continental slope waters of each study region. Chapter 2 focused on the other aspect of the traditional niche by examining trophic relationships within each skate assemblage and among distant populations of big and longnose skates. The goal of this chapter was to address the paradox of ecological redundancy in skates (i. e., skates occupy similar habitats and eat similar prey). Chapter 3 utilized an improved understanding of ENP skate ecology to establish baseline information for the development of fisheries management strategies. Space appears to be more important than food in structuring ENP skate assemblages. Spatial segregation among sympatric skate species and their life stages was demonstrated off central California and in the western Gulf of Alaska. In contrast, ENP skate assemblages displayed a high degree of trophic redundancy, with the timing and location of collection trawls explaining the great majority of dietary variation. Species-level and length-based differences were highly significant, but explained a relatively minor portion of the observed dietary variability, especially in the western Gulf of Alaska. Big and longnose skates had different predatory roles in each region, with a greater reliance on decapods in the Gulf and fishes off California. Distribution and abundance patterns of U. S. West Coast skate species and their life stages were modeled and can be used to characterize essential fish habitat. Updates to a Gulf of Alaska food web model indicated that skates (especially big skate) are major predators of Tanner crab and may considerably influence regional trophodynamics...|$|R
40|$|On July 20, 2011 the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR), Norman Olsen, {{submitted}} {{his letter}} of resignation to Governor Paul LePage. Olsen {{then went on to}} release a public statement, claiming that the “[LePage] administration is more interested in pacifying special interest groups than in responsibly managing Maine’s marine resources {{for the benefit of the}} entire state. ” To what “special interests” was the Commissioner referring? And what exactly was the catalyst for his abrupt and decidedly public split from the Governor who, only months earlier, nominated him to a prestigious and important position in state government? The answer, it seems, related to Olsen’s vocal support for new regulations permitting lobster bycatch in Maine. Bycatch, put simply, occurs when living creatures (in this case, lobsters) are caught unintentionally by fishing gear designed to catch a completely different form of marine life. The occurrence is largely unavoidable, and is a problem particularly prevalent among <b>groundfishing</b> vessels that trawl the bottom of the ocean with large nets. Usually, bycatch is discarded (thrown back into the sea), either because the fishing vessel has no use for it, or, as is the case in Maine, because discarding is required. In Maine, the prospect of allowing lobster bycatch to be kept and sold within state lines, even subject to tight regulation, is fervently opposed by the lobster industry. When Commissioner Olsen laid out a proposal to allow lobster bycatch to be kept by fishermen without lobster licenses in limited circumstances, he was met with immediate opposition. “[Olsen’s plan to allow lobster bycatch] caused a terrible uproar” according to Downeast Lobstermen’s Association (DELA) Executive Director Sheila Dassat. DELA “fought... the issue... adamantly. ” Shortly after Olsen’s resignation, it became clear to many political analysts that the primary reason for Olsen’s abrupt departure and vocal split from the LePage Administration had a lot to do with his support for regulations allowing lobster bycatch to be kept and sold by groundfishermen in Maine. Indeed, it seems fairly obvious that the “special interests” Olsen referred to in his post-resignation statement were in fact one of the most powerful interest groups in Maine: lobstermen. The story of Norm Olsen’s resignation crystallizes what is, and has been, a divisive issue in Maine for quite some time: Should lobster bycatch be sold by Maine groundfishermen under any circumstances whatsoever? This Comment will purposefully explore that question. Part I will provide a brief history of the lobster industry in Maine, from its origins dating back before the industrial revolution to its current form. This is a necessary first step in the analysis of the above question, because only by understanding the history can one fully understand the deeply held, and historically based, belief of Maine’s lobstermen that they should have the exclusive right to land lobsters at Maine ports. To help illustrate this point, this Comment will provide an overview of some notable recent events involving lobstermen in Maine fighting with one another (often violently) over territory. Part of this analysis is drawn from James Acheson’s now famous book, The Lobster Gangs of Maine, which explores the culture of lobstermen in Maine and sheds light on the deeply rooted belief of many lobstermen that their right to lobster in a certain area is handed down to them based on tradition and the fact that their family has fished a certain territory for generations. Part I of this Comment will also explore the current regulatory regime regarding lobster licensing and lobster fishing in Maine. This analysis will illustrate the point that the history and culture of Maine’s lobster industry has created a proverbial family heirloom: a right passed down from one generation to the next, creating a culture hostile to any outside competition and interference. This information is essential to provide a context to how and why the current Maine lobster industry is so vehemently opposed to allowing lobster bycatch. Part II of this Comment will first explore the arguments put forth by those in favor of allowing lobster bycatch under limited circumstances in Maine, and then discuss the reasoning of those who say allowing limited lobster bycatch in Maine is an economic necessity. Additionally, this section will explore the fact that limited lobster bycatch has been implemented in other jurisdictions (in particular, Massachusetts). 15 This analysis will focus not only how the allowance of limited lobster bycatch has affected the lobster and <b>groundfishing</b> industries in those jurisdictions, but also how it has directly affected the same industries here in Maine. Finally, this Comment will aim to synthesize all of this information into a proposal for slowly and properly introducing regulations that allow for the sale of lobster bycatch in Maine under limited circumstances. This proposal will take into account the history and tradition of the Maine lobster industry, but will also acknowledge the need for Maine to keep up with the modern trend in other jurisdictions, especially in today’s increasingly globalized and interconnected economy...|$|R

25|$|The {{moratorium}} in 1992 {{marked the}} largest industrial closure in Canadian history. In Newfoundland alone, over 22,000 fishers and plant workers from over 400 coastal communities became unemployed. In response to dire warnings {{of social and}} economic consequences, the federal government intervened, initially providing income assistance through the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program, and later through the Atlantic <b>Groundfish</b> Strategy, which included money specifically for the retraining of those workers displaced by the closing of the fishery. Newfoundland has since experienced a dramatic environmental, industrial, economic, and social restructuring, including considerable outmigration, but also increased economic diversification, an increased emphasis on education, and the emergence of a thriving invertebrates fishing industry (as the predatory <b>groundfish</b> population declined, snow crab and northern shrimp proliferated, providing the basis for a new industry that is roughly equivalent in economic value as the cod fishery it replaced). Newfoundland's experience with the cod fishery is certainly an interesting one: the dramatic collapse of a natural resource that sustained and defined a people for over 500 years offers lessons to communities everywhere that have within their jurisdiction the maintenance of an ecosystem and its resources and illustrates clearly the importance of taking seriously the health and vitality of the Earth's natural systems.|$|E
