40|$|<b>Digital</b> {{documentation}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> {{is a very}} important issue that is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community. The availability of accurate 3 D models of historical buildings is crucial to preserve our <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> because it allows us to reconstruct them in case of fortuitous collapse or intentional demolition or damage. In this paper, we present a new approach for the <b>digital</b> {{documentation of}} <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> Our approach is based on a hybridization of different techniques for data capture and processing and image analysis, with the aim of obtaining 3 D models from images and the texturing of these models. In particular, we rely on convergent photogrammetry as way to acquire information about the real objects for generation of 3 D models. We also apply computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques for further processing of all acquired data. As a result, we have developed a new way to obtain <b>digital</b> documentation of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> from data by using accurate reverse engineering techniques. Our methodology has been successfully applied to the digital documentation of a famous historical building in the city of Santander: the Royal Palace of Magdalena, the conference venue of this conference Cyberworlds' 2014...|$|R

40|$|This paper extends {{on recent}} {{research}} in <b>digital</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> by arguing for an enhanced engagement with post-processual archaeology. While recent digital heritage projects have demonstrated an {{effective use of}} high end user interaction with elements adapted from computer games and interactive new media systems, the dominant trend in digital heritage remains highly dependent on deterministic and functionalist views of the past. This paper explores new research developments in interpretative or post-processual archaeology and their applicability to an interpretative <b>digital</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage.</b> An interpretative <b>digital</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> privileges interpretation over information and affective experience over representation.

40|$|The <b>digital</b> {{documentation}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is receiving much {{attention in the}} last few years and 3 D modeling of objects or sites is one of the main research topics in this field. Many improvements have been done in the generation of <b>digital</b> models of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage,</b> concerning range sensors and image based modeling. But there are still a lot of open questions and problems in deciding which technique should be employed in which situation. While in the past years, when high level of detail was required, range sensors were usually preferred to image data, nowadays, due to the considerable algorithm improvements and increase of automation in the image-based modeling process, the digitization of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> based on close-range photogrammetry covers a more and more important role. Furthermore, new sensors, working outside the visible spectrum, are nowadays available for <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> documentation and preservation. Therefore the integration of all these digital information would leave to much more detailed, interesting and valuable results.

40|$|Producción CientíficaThe <b>digital</b> {{documentation}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> (CH) often requires interpretation and classification {{of a huge}} amount of images. The INCEPTION European project focuses on the development of tools and methodologies for obtaining 3 D models of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> assets, enriched by semantic information and integration of both parts on a new H-BIM (Heritage - Building Information Modeling) platform. In this sense, the availability of automated techniques that allow the interpretation of photos and the search using semantic terms would greatly facilitate the work to develop the project. In this article the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for analyzing images of <b>cultural</b> <b>heritage</b> is assessed.
