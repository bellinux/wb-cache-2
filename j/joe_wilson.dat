25|$|BLITZER: So, {{when you}} told Robert Novak that <b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson,</b> the former U.S. ambassador's wife, worked at the CIA, and she was {{involved}} somehow in getting him this trip to Africa {{to look for the}} enriched uranium, if there were enriched uranium going to Iraq, you simply assumed that she was not a clandestine officer of the CIA.|$|E

According to prosecutors, given the level of interest coming from the Vice President's office regarding <b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson,</b> {{it was impossible for}} Libby to have forgotten during his FBI interviews and grand jury testimony that he already knew that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.|$|E

25|$|The Vice President {{advised that}} it was {{conceivable}} {{that he may have}} had discussions about <b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson</b> during the week of 7/6/03 because the Tenet statement covered the bulk of the Wilson matter, namely that the CIA had dispatched Wilson to Niger on its own without direction from the Vice President; Wilson's report had confirmed there had been an approach by Iraq to Niger at one time; and the results of Wilson's trip were not briefed to the Vice President.|$|E
25|$|In South Carolina in 2008, the Democratic {{candidate}} for United States Senator was Bob Conley, a traditional Catholic, {{and a former}} activist for the Presidential candidacy of Ron Paul. Conley failed in his bid to defeat Republican Lindsey Graham, receiving 42.4 percent of the vote. Conley was the only Paul supporter to be a Senate {{candidate for}} either main party in 2008.

25|$|In Fury (1936), the German {{expatriate}} Fritz Lang {{depicts a}} lynch mob burning down a jail in which <b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson</b> (played by Spencer Tracy) was held {{as a suspect}} in a kidnapping, a crime for which Wilson was soon after cleared. Lang had left Germany after the Nazis came to power. The story {{was based on a}} 1933 lynching in San Jose, California. This had been recorded on newsreel footage and was an event in which Governor of California James Rolph refused to intervene.|$|E
25|$|The vice {{president}} believed {{he read the}} Robert Novak column in the newspaper on {{the day it was}} published, 7/14/03. He cannot recall discussing it or any of its contents with anyone {{at the time it was}} published. He did not pay any particular attention to Novak's disclosure of the identity of Valerie Wilson, and he does not know how Novak might have received such information. He emphasized it did not appear to him to be an important or even relevant fact in the <b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson</b> controversy.|$|E

Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis and it is difficult to reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send <b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson</b> – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

500|$|<b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson</b> {{was educated}} at Launceston Grammar School. A talented junior sportsman, he {{regularly}} represented {{the school in}} football and cricket. He is first recorded playing football for the school's firsts in 1885, which is {{around the same time}} he first played for Launceston Football Club's seconds. The following summer he played cricket for his school and the Our Boys Cricket Club first XI. In one match for Our Boys, his batting was described by the Launceston Examiner as [...] "the feature of the game". In March 1886, Wilson dominated a match between his school and Horton College—he made 154 runs in his team's first innings, at the time the second highest individual score ever recorded at the Launceston Cricket Ground, and then took 17 wickets, including a hat-trick, for only 28 runs in Horton's two innings. At the conclusion of the cricket season, Wilson won two trophies from the Our Boys club—for highest individual score and highest batting average.|$|E
500|$|A Billboard {{magazine}} review said Phantasmagoria [...] "lives up to {{the advanced}} billing" [...] and [...] "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex". USA Today writer <b>Joe</b> <b>Wilson</b> gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and [...] "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot", but also said he had to adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E
