25|$|In August 1960, Borussia Mönchengladbach {{defeated}} 1. FC Köln in the West German Cup. Weeks later, {{the club}} won the DFB-Pokal, clinching their first national honours after defeating Karlsruher SC 3–2 in the final. The following year, the club {{took on the}} now-familiar name Borussia VfL Mönchengladbach after the city of München-Gladbach became Mönchengladbach. However, further honours would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> decade. Borussia's results in the ten {{years leading up to}} the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963 were not strong enough to earn them admission into the ranks of the nation's new top flight professional league, and so the club played in the second tier, the Regionalliga West.|$|E
25|$|Anne Lee's {{family was}} often {{supported}} by a relative, William Henry Fitzhugh, who owned the Oronoco Street house and allowed the Lees to stay {{at his home in}} Fairfax County, Ravensworth. When Robert was 17 in 1824, Fitzhugh wrote to the Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, urging that Robert be given an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Fitzhugh wrote little of Robert's academic prowess, dwelling much on the prominence of his family, and erroneously stated the boy was 18. Instead of mailing the letter, Fitzhugh had young Robert deliver it. In March 1824, Robert Lee received his appointment to West Point, but due to the large number of cadets admitted, Lee would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> year to begin his studies there.|$|E

500|$|On November 4 it was {{confirmed}} that Lesnar {{was suffering from}} mononucleosis and that his bout with Carwin would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> bit longer and the fight for Lesnar's heavyweight championship was cancelled. On November 14 at the UFC 105 post-fight conference, Dana White stated, [...] "'s not well and he's not going to be getting well anytime soon" [...] and that an interim title match might need to be set up. In addition to mononucleosis, it was revealed that he was suffering from a serious case of diverticulitis, an intestinal disorder, which required surgery. After further diagnosis, Lesnar underwent surgery on November 16 to close a perforation in his intestine that had been leaking fecal matter into his abdomen, causing pain, abscesses and overtaxing his immune system to the point that he contracted mononucleosis. From the level of damage to Lesnar's system, the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing for around a year.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} lack of Master Chief as a main character, similar to the {{response}} to The Halo Graphic Novel; Schedeen said that [...] "Master Chief is barely a guest star in his own book", {{and that he was}} reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series. Schedeen felt that {{there was a lack of}} connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief's adventures, which was never satisfactorily resolved. The comic's focus on Ruwan and Myra's subplot was also seen as a major fault: Comics Bulletin's Geoff Collins, in a review of the second issue, said that [...] "as a comic book fan I’m interested , but the Halo fans I know could [...] care less about them. And the story in this issue centers around them." [...] Schedeen was surprised to find that he only began to care about them in the final issue. The many delays in publishing were a frequent point of frustration as well. Schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming Halo books [...] "will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes Halo fun. At the very least, let's hope we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> year between issues anymore".|$|E
2500|$|Although Bates {{said that}} [...] "she might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> {{few years before}} she gets another chance [...] ", Colvin became a regular member of England's {{international}} teams. By August 2007, she had two Test matches and eleven One Day Internationals to her credit. In the Women's Quadrangular Series in India in 2006, Colvin took three wickets for 47 against New Zealand, and then 3 for 50 in the 3rd–4th playoff to secure the England team 3rd place.|$|E

2500|$|In President Teddy Roosevelt's 1905 Inaugural Parade Geronimo rode horseback down Pennsylvania Avenue {{with five}} real Indian chiefs, who wore full {{headgear}} and painted faces. The intent, one newspaper stated, {{was to show}} Americans “that they have buried the hatchet forever.” They created a sensation and brought the crowds along the parade route to their feet. [...] Later that same week Geronimo met with the President and made a moving request for the Chiricahuas at [...] Fort Sill to be relieved of their status as prisoners of war, and {{allowed to return to}} their homeland in Arizona. President Roosevelt refused, referring to the continuing animosity in Arizona for the deaths of civilian men, women, and children associated with Geronimo's raids during the prolonged Apache Wars. Through an interpreter, Roosevelt told Geronimo that the Indian had a “bad heart.” [...] “You killed many of my people; you burned villages…and were not good Indians.” [...] The president would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> while “and see how you and your people act” on their reservation.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj {{were named}} ODI captain and vice-captain respectively, {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Rahul Dravid. Yuvraj scored 121 at Hyderabad in a losing cause in the third of the seven ODIs against Australia, but accumulated only 71 in the other six matches of the series. He enjoyed a return to form in India's home ODI series against Pakistan in November 2007. He scored four half-centuries in five matches, averaging 68, and was named player of the series as India won the series 3–2. He was also fined for showing dissent in the final match in Jaipur. Although Yuvraj was included in Indian squad for the subsequent Test series against Pakistan, Test captain Anil Kumble said that Yuvraj [...] "will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little bit more to become a regular member in the Test squad." [...] He did not feature in the playing eleven {{in the first two}} matches, but was picked in the third Test at Bangalore to replace an injured Sachin Tendulkar. Batting first, India was 61/4 before Yuvraj and Sourav Ganguly shared a 300-run fifth-wicket partnership, and Yuvraj recorded his highest Test score of 169 off 203 balls [...] and Ganguly went on to score 239 which was his highest score in tests.|$|E
