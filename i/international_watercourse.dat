According to Stephen McCaffrey of the McGeorge School of Law, this is [...] "the most controversial provision" [...] of the Convention, with conflict stemming {{from the fact that}} a state may have legitimate uses for a watercourse in its nation that can negatively impact other nations. He offers the following example:Suppose ... upstream State A has not significantly developed its water resources because of its mountainous terrain. The topography of the downstream states on the watercourse, B and C, is flatter, and they have used the watercourse extensively for irrigation for centuries, if not millennia. State A now wishes to develop its water resources for hydroelectric and agricultural purposes. States B and C cry foul, on the ground that this would significantly harm their established uses.McCaffrey indicates that controversy here stemmed from the UN's adaptation of text by the ILC with the intention of strengthening the obligation to do no harm, as the ILC's language more heavily emphasized the [...] "equitable utilization", or balance of the various needs of the states.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In 1999, the U. S. and Canada {{agreed to}} an {{extension}} of the sale of Canada’s downstream power benefits in the U.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present the issue of the freedom of {{navigation}} on international rivers in the context of the Oder case brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1929 - a case of utmost importance for the development of the law of international watercourses and the contemporary international law applicable to water resources. The author analyses the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles which declared the Oder to be an international river and put it under the jurisdiction of an international commission. The territorial jurisdiction of the International Commission of the River Oder was disputed between Poland and Germany, leading to the aforementioned proceedings before the PCIJ. The author presents the arguments put forward by both parties, the legal context of the case – in particular the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and of the Barcelona Convention - and analyses the Court’s judgment.

40|$|The book summarises {{the history}} of the human right to water and {{examines}} its main content and the obligations that derive from this right. The main purpose of the recognition of the human right to water is to guarantee to everyone access to sufficient, safe and affordable drinking water to satisfy personal and domestic uses. This book discusses whether the human right to water is recognised as a derivative right or as an independent right at three levels – universal, regional and domestic - where human rights are acknowledged and enforced. For national law a case study approach has been used with focus on Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia. Additionally, the human right to water is examined in a transboundary water context, where the use and management of an <b>international</b> <b>watercourse</b> in one riparian state can directly or indirectly affect the human right to water in another riparian state. For this reason, this book analyses whether the core principles of international water law contribute to the realisation of the extraterritorial application of the right to water...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Washington State UniversityInternational water law, an {{outgrowth}} of international law, is a conglomeration of tenets from international conventions and treaties that recognize rules codified by contesting states, customary law, judicial decisions, and writings of qualified legal practitioners. A set of water management principles (WMPs) are presented, which {{form the basis for}} the development of a model transboundary agreement (TBA), or template treaty, for international river basins. The relevant tenets of international water law, which support the selection of the WMPs, are identified and analyzed. This study is undertaken because the world community has not yet agreed upon a universally applicable treaty to manage the uses and protection of shared water resources. The set of WMPs are largely adopted from The International Law Association's 1966 Helsinki Rules, the United Nation 1997 Convention on Non-navigable Watercourses, and existing TBAs. These include the concept of equitable and reasonable utilization as the guiding principle of <b>international</b> <b>watercourse</b> management. A few existing concepts refined by the author are presented (e. g., the establishment of emergency contingency plans; the mapping and monitoring of all water wells within a basin), as are relatively recent concepts that have not typically been incorporated into most existing TBAs (e. g., acceptance of aquifers [groundwater] as a resource often situated primarily below basins, and the need to conjunctively manage this resource along with surface water). Chapter One addresses WMPs, Chapter Two presents the template treaty, Chapter Three presents a proposed TBA for the Pilcomayo River Basin (PRB) of Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay ("proposed PRB treaty"), and Chapter Four discusses plans for promoting the template treaty and the proposed PRB treaty.

40|$|The {{conflicts}} between {{environmental protection and}} the need to promote developmental growth are becoming increasingly imperative. The concept of sustainable development was created to reconcile the above conflict between these two extremes {{in order to ensure that}} an adequate quantity of natural resources and a good quality of environment are preserved for longer term purposes and for the uses of future generations. This study examines the development of this concept at international level and its impacts upon international law governing the use of international watercourses in particular. The Mekong River Basin is analysed as a case study in order to illustrate that this concept has given rise to development of the legal framework of this region. To examine these issues, this study is divided into five chapters. It begins by dealing with development of the concept of sustainable development at international level and issues arising from the law in the field of sustainable development after Rio. Chapter 2 focuses on the impact of this concept upon international watercourses law. Chapter 3 emphasises the significance of the effects of sustainable development upon the legal framework of the Mekong River Basin as indicated in the 1995 Mekong Agreement. Mechanisms adopted in this instrument to implement the above concept are also analysed. Chapter 4 illustrates problems and prospects regarding implementation of the concept of sustainable development and operation of the 1995 Mekong Agreement. Chapter 5 presents a conclusion of the study. This thesis shows that sustainable development is a difficult concept to define and implement. The Mekong Agreement makes an attempt, a laudable one, to implement certain aspects of it in relation to an <b>international</b> <b>watercourse.</b> Some aspects are successfully implemented but some are not. The Mekong Agreement is an important treaty from environmental, sustainable development and water resources points of view...|$|E
40|$|A Professional Project Report {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Water Resources, University of New Mexico. The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), in its current form, was created in 1944 by the Treaty Regarding Utilization of Waters of Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande. The IBWC was given the authority to manage surface water along the US-Mexico border. Recent changes along the border have exposed a number of weaknesses in both the 1944 Water Treaty and the IBWC, {{making it difficult to}} resolve disputes. The challenges of administering the 1944 Water Treaty have escalated as population continues to grow, environmental concerns increase, water quality is jeopardized by sanitation inadequacies, groundwater resources are depleted, and the region deals with drought. Recent drought and Mexico's water debt have revealed vague language in the 1944 Water Treaty and its subsequent Minutes. Most critics suggest that the current mandate, structure, and jurisdiction of the IBWC are not adequate to handle the complexities involved with water management on the border. Some critics of the IBWC suggest resolution could occur with a new Minute, and the Minute system of the 1944 Water Treaty is seen by critics and supporters alike as an avenue through which treaty reform and extensions can be legally made. An analysis of the Minute system, and of the limitations of the institutional and political structures surrounding the IBWC, was conducted to determine if it is indeed an adequate reform mechanism. Even though the Minute system may be able to make treaty-compatible reforms, other factors limit their success or even the possibility of their creation. The Berlin Rules, the most recent and comprehensive set of customary international water law written by the International Law Association, provide sufficient guidelines for changes the IBWC can take. The IBWC can modernize itself through its Minute system by utilizing the Berlin Rules and its principles that are necessary for achieving sound binational management of an <b>international</b> <b>watercourse...</b>|$|E

40|$|Today, {{three factors}} {{relating}} to fresh water sources are universally recognized: first, fresh {{water is a}} finite and shrinking resource, essential to sustain life, development, and the environment; second, the effective development and management of fresh water resources requires the participation and cooperation of all users, planners, and policy makers; and third, fresh water has an economic value in all its compelling uses and should, therefore, be recognized as an economic good. More than two decades ago, recognizing that many nations share <b>international</b> <b>watercourses,</b> {{members of the international}} community felt that an agreement was needed to codify the rules regulating <b>international</b> <b>watercourses,</b> to minimize environmental damage, and to ensure each state an equitable share in the use of such <b>watercourses.</b> The <b>international</b> community also recognized that because any such international agreement would require the harmonization of a variety of concepts, principles, and interests, and would involve addressing a host of political, legal, economic, and geographic factors implicating vital state interests, an umbrella agreement for regulating <b>international</b> <b>watercourses</b> was needed. The international community envisaged that such an umbrella agreement would set out general rules applicable to all <b>international</b> <b>watercourses</b> and would be complimented by other, more specific, local agreements. The duty to cooperate and notify other riparian states about planned measures for shared watercourses and the obligation not to cause significant harm to other states 2 ̆ 7 watercourses were among the cornerstone articles of customary law for the envisaged umbrella agreement.

40|$|Protection of <b>International</b> <b>Watercourses</b> The {{purpose of}} the Thesis is to analyze the present degree of the {{protection}} of <b>international</b> <b>watercourses</b> and to describe three main levels: international law, European law and Czech law. Although the issue of environmental protection and sustainable use of <b>international</b> <b>watercourses</b> {{is considered to be}} one of the most significant problems of the present society, the topic has been rather neglected by Czech scholars. Analytical, logical and historical methods were primarily applied in the study. The thesis is composed of four chapters, which are furthermore divided into sections and subsections. The term "international watercourses" usually designates rivers, lakes and groundwater sources shared by two or more states. Chapter one deals with international customary law (especially equitable utilization and no harm principle), international treaty law (global and regional cooperation as well as non- binding documents) and selected major cases important for the evolution of protection of water. In the past, international water law concerned mostly with allocating water supply between riparian states.

40|$|Implementing {{the goal}} of {{sustainable}} development has long been heralded as {{the means by which}} the needs of both present and future generations can be met. However, finding a long-term balance between economic, social and environmental interests, the basic tenet of sustainable development, has proved largely illusive in practice. This thesis shows that, while a number of “legal frameworks for sustainable development” have been proposed at the international level, they fail to fully capture the essence of sustainable development and international law’s capacity to support its implementation. Through a study of the law of <b>international</b> <b>watercourses</b> the thesis shows that a sophisticated legal mechanism, comprised of key substantive and procedural rights and obligations between States, exists to reconcile competing economic, social and environmental interests. Moreover, the thesis illustrates how the basic approach taken by the law of <b>international</b> <b>watercourses</b> {{can be used as a}} model for further developing international law in the field of sustainable development. The thesis is divided into four sections. The first section includes an overview of the topic area and an understanding of international law.

A detailed analysis of how the law of <b>international</b> <b>watercourses</b> seeks to reconcile competing economic, social and environmental interests is carried out in section three.

This paper builds upon the dispute resolution framework put forward in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of <b>International</b> <b>Watercourses</b> and state practice to develop a dispute resolution framework which will bring more efficient results for riparian states. This process emphasises the important role that fact finding can have in this context. Using this investigative process at an early stage in the dispute resolution process helps to reduce the areas of conflict between the states and provides a platform to encourage negotiations. The framework outlined also allows for recourse to negotiations, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or arbitration if a resolution cannot be found. Recourse to the ICJ and arbitral tribunals has been left to the final stage of the framework to reflect state practice in the area. If this style of dispute resolution framework is adopted by states it should allow for disputes to be resolved efficiently. In turn this is likely to increase the awareness and support for fact finding as an alternative means of dispute resolution in international relations more broadly...|$|R
