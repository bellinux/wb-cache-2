Engines would often {{be installed in}} a dedicated 'engine house', which was usually an outbuilding separate from the main house to reduce the interference from the engine noise.

Wealthy households could afford to employ a dedicated engineer to maintain the equipment, but as the demand for electricity spread to smaller homes, manufacturers produced engines that required less maintenance and that did not need specialist training to operate.|$|R

Here, {{we present a}} proposal for consensus guidelines on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) -related disorders (CFTR-RDs), reached after expert discussion and two <b>dedicated</b> <b>workshops.</b> A CFTR-RD may be defined as “a clinical entity associated with CFTR dysfunction that does not fulfil diagnostic criteria for CF”. The utility of sweat testing, mutation analysis, nasal potential difference, and/or intestinal current measurement for the differential diagnosis of CF and CFTR-RD is discussed. Algorithms which use genetic and functional diagnostic tests to distinguish CF and CFTR-RDs are presented. According to present knowledge, congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), acute recurrent or chronic pancreatitis and disseminated bronchiectasis, all with CFTR dysfunction, are CFTR-RDs...|$|R
40|$|Many new {{symmetry}} detection algorithms {{have been}} recently developed, {{thanks to an}} interest revival on computational symmetry for computer graphics and computer vision applications. Notably, in 2013 the IEEE CVPR Conference organized a <b>dedicated</b> <b>workshop</b> and an accompanying symmetry detection competition. In this paper we propose an approach for symmetric object detection that is based both on the computation of a symmetry measure for each pixel and on saliency. The symmetry value is obtained as the energy balance of the even-odd decomposition of a patch w. r. t. each possible axis. The candidate symmetry axes are then identified through the localization of peaks along the direction perpendicular to each considered axis orientation. These found candidate axes are finally evaluated through a confidence measure that also allow removing redundant detected symmetries. The obtained results within the framework adopted in the aforementioned competition show significant performance improvement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{the progress of}} the action plan for improvement of the ICT usage at the Helen Parkhurst Dal-ton School for secondary education. At the start of the action period in 2007 the ICT-usage in education was assessed through an review performed by a group of European inspectors. This assessment formed the basis for a continuous development in the school for promoting and improving the usage of ICT. This was done by addressing the observed weaknesses with special measures, and continuing the action plans which were already put in place. For four main points of criticism the following me-asures were taken: The coherence in the ICT use was improved by appointing school wide operating coordinators. The use of ICT in teaching was encouraged by offering a variety of teacher training and <b>dedicated</b> <b>workshops.</b> The measurement of gains in learner achievement through ICT use was addressed by...|$|R
