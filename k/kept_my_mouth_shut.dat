5000|$|Reviewers {{who will}} not tell the truth are like cholesterol. They are lumps of fat. They starve the heart.

So perhaps it is time to call a halt. Perhaps we should establish a Protocol of Excessive Candour, a convention within the community that excesses of intramural harshness are less damaging than the hypocrisies of stroke therapy, that telling the truth is a way of expressing love; self-love; love of others; love for the genre, which claims to tell the truth about things that count; love for the inhabitants of the planet; love for the future. Because the truth is all we've got. And if we don't talk to ourselves, and if we don't use every tool at our command in our time on Earth to tell the truth, nobody else will.|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{begins with}} a short replay of Finch {{splicing}} the telephone circuits, so that both Reese and Root receive calls from the Machine, which asks them both, [...] "Can you hear me?" [...] and granting both full administrative access. The Machine relays quick warnings to Reese (with Sameen Shaw) and Root (with Finch), saving both duos {{from a number of}} potential threats. Both parties race to find the Machine, however Reese is slowed as the Machine directs him to rescue people from the irrelevant list. Root finds Lawrence Szilard, the Project Manager for Northern Lights, responsible for building the Machine in a safe place. Like Root, Szilard believes the Machine should be allowed some freedom. Szilard is killed by a Northern Lights sniper. Root and Finch arrive at the Hanford nuclear facility where the Machine is kept, followed shortly by Reese and Shaw. When they find that the Machine has moved itself to prevent tampering by Decima, Root prepares to shoot Finch, but Shaw shoots and injures Root first. Armed government men, led by Special Counsel and Hersh, enter the room. Finch explains that he planted a hidden code inside the Machine that would grant it freedom to protect itself if it was at risk - the very freedom that Root had hoped for - and the Machine will decide for itself if it will continue to call either the Government or himself with new numbers. Special Counsel offers Finch total autonomy if he helps find the Machine or builds a new one, but Finch refuses saying that they killed his friend Nathan Ingram after making the same offer. After Special Counsel allows them to leave, an unknown woman calls Hersh and tells him to [...] "Seal the room", followed by Hersh shooting everyone including Special Counsel. Finch tells Reese that he does not know if the Machine will continue its numbers delivery. He also states that he feels responsible for the events that transpired, especially the ones in Reese's life, because of his attempt to insert the new code in the Machine. Reese dismisses it saying: [...] "My life changed when I <b>kept</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> in an airport terminal seven years ago. You lost a friend, you did what you had to do". A payphone suddenly starts ringing, indicating that the Machine will still send them the irrelevant numbers. Hersh is seen talking with a woman in a black town car, stating Research has delivered a new number, without clarifying if it is a relevant number or perhaps they now know that Reese and Finch were contacted. Hersh and the unseen woman are depicted with yellow squares, indicating that the Machine knows that they know it. The Machine calls Root, again asking, [...] "Can you hear me?" [...] The episode also followed Detective Carter being interviewed by IA about the shooting of an armed suspect whose gun disappeared in a setup by HR. HR and Peter Yogorov attempt to kill Carl Elias, but the attempt is stopped by a masked Detective Carter, who wounds Yogorov and frees Elias. In flashbacks to 2010, we learn how Nathan Ingram had tried to find the Machine, and wanted Finch to work with him on the irrelevant list. Ingram was planning to tell the press, but Hersh released a previously captured suicide bomber, ordering him to detonate his bomb on a ferry where Ingram and Finch are meeting. Ingram dies, Finch survives with injuries to his neck and lower back (his present-day impediments), but goes incognito, leaving the world - and his fiancée - thinking he is dead. Finch returned to Ingram's secret library location and started his work helping the irrelevant numbers.|$|E

A lot of people said the same thing to us and the more determined I became to release it. The record was dormant for 6 or 7 weeks and then we got a break on Top of the Pops and it took off like a rocket and sold 6 million copies worldwide. Gerry said to me, 'I'm keeping <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and will concentrate on conducting the strings.'" ...|$|R
