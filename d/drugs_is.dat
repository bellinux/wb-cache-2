5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a {{conservative}} Ohio judge, is appointed {{to head the}} President's Office of National Drug Control Policy, taking on the title drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on <b>Drugs</b> <b>is</b> unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle {{to deal with the}} problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect {{does not begin}} immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E

50|$|Street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} abused <b>drugs</b> that <b>are</b> bought illegally {{and have}} many nicknames. Examples of street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> heroin, marijuana and its psychoactive ingredient of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cocaine.|$|R
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E
25|$|Designing {{safe and}} {{effective}} antiviral <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> difficult, because viruses use the host's cells to replicate. This {{makes it difficult to}} find targets for the drug that would interfere with the virus without also harming the host organism's cells. Moreover, the major difficulty in developing vaccines and anti-viral <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> due to viral variation.|$|E

50|$|Preventive <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> used {{to reduce}} the frequency, duration, and {{severity}} of migraine attacks. Because of frequent unpleasant and sometimes debilitating side effects, preventive <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> only prescribed for those migraineurs whose {{quality of life is}} significantly adversely affected. The most commonly prescribed drugs for migraine prevention are beta-blockers, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. The <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> started at a low dose, which is gradually increased until therapeutic effects develop, the ceiling dose for the chosen <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> reached, or side effects become intolerable.|$|R

5000|$|Club drugs, {{also called}} rave drugs, or party <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a loosely defined {{category}} of recreational <b>drugs</b> which <b>are</b> associated with discothèques in the 1970s and nightclubs, dance clubs, electronic dance music parties, and raves in the 1980s to the 2010s. Unlike many other categories, such as opiates, which are established according to pharmaceutical or chemical properties, club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a [...] "category of convenience", in which <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> included {{due to the}} locations they are consumed and/or where the user goes while {{under the influence of}} the <b>drugs.</b> Club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> generally used by teens and young adults. This group of <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> also called [...] "designer drugs", as most are synthesized in chemical lab (e.g., MDMA, ketamine, LSD) rather than being sourced from plants (as with marijuana, which comes from the cannabis plant).|$|R
50|$|Not all club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{addictive}} (e.g. nitrous oxide). However, some club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> addictive. Amphetamine heavily used in recreational fashion pose {{a serious}} risk of addiction.|$|R
25|$|Opioids are {{indicated}} for {{the relief of}} mild to severe pain, but are usually reserved for moderate to severe pain. The weak opioid codeine, in low doses and combined {{with one or more}} other <b>drugs,</b> <b>is</b> commonly available without a prescription.|$|E
25|$|The 5-nitroimidazole drugs (metronidazole and tinidazole) are the {{mainstay}} of treatment for infection with Trichomonas vaginalis. Treatment for both the infected patient and the patient's sexual partner is recommended, even if asymptomatic.

25|$|The {{ingestion}} of goitrogen <b>drugs</b> <b>is,</b> much like potassium iodide also {{not without its}} dangers, such as hypothyroidism. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine bioaccumulation in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Drug</b> {{harmfulness}} <b>is</b> {{the degree}} to which a psychoactive <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> harmful to a user and is measured in various ways, such as by addictiveness and the potential for physical harm. More harmful <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "hard drugs" [...] and less harmful <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "soft drugs". The term [...] "soft drug" [...] is considered controversial by its critics as it may imply that soft drugs cause no or insignificant harm.|$|R

This technology may allow treatments to be catered to the individual and the certain genetic predispositions they may have (such as personalized chemotherapy).|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} compounds {{may also}} induce or inhibit CYP activity. For example, bioactive compounds found in grapefruit juice {{and some other}} fruit juices, including bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, and paradicin-A, {{have been found to}} inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of certain medications, leading to increased bioavailability and, thus, the strong possibility of overdosing. Because of this risk, avoiding grapefruit juice and fresh grapefruits entirely while on <b>drugs</b> <b>is</b> usually advised.|$|E
