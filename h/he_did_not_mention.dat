5|$|Tafforet was {{familiar}} with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is thought that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ruth Brandon in {{an article}} for the New Scientist noted that William Huggins, Serjeant Cox, Crooke's wife and daughter, his {{laboratory}} assistant, and a Mrs Humphrey were all present during the Crookes experiments with Home. However, Barry Wiley has written that when Crookes published his report on the experiments in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1871 <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> all {{the names of the}} observers present in the room. Wiley has stated that four females were present during the experiments as was Crookes' brother and the original report by Crookes did not refer to any spirits but many years later in 1889 he revealed in his Notes of séances with D. D. Home the names of the observers and claimed Home was in communication with spirits.|$|E

5000|$|Bhai Gurdas, who has listed all Guru Nanak's {{prominent}} disciples {{whose names}} were handed down, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{the name of}} Bhai Bala Sandhu. (This may be an oversight, for <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Rai Bular either.) ...|$|R
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|With that, the Yuan dynasty, {{established}} by Genghis Khan's grandson Khublai Khan, {{became the first}} foreign dynasty to rule all of China. Despite being {{the head of the}} Mongol Empire, Khublai Khan's rule over China was not free from the threat of the steppe nomads. The Yuan dynasty faced challenges from rival claimants to the title of Great Khan and from rebellious Mongols in the north. Khublai Khan dealt with such threats by using both military blockades and economic sanctions. Although he established garrisons along the steppe frontier from the Juyan Lake Basin in the far west to Yingchang in the east, Khublai Khan and the Yuan emperors after him did not add to the Great Wall (except for the ornate Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass). When the Venetian traveller Marco Polo wrote of his experiences in China during the reign of Khublai Khan, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> a Great Wall.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> {{having seen}} the ghost to anybody, for fear of {{frightening}} them--some people are so nervous about ghosts,--but determines {{to wait for the}} next night, and see if the apparition appears again.|$|R
50|$|Hoefer {{reports that}} those 34 cities existed {{during the period}} of the life of Ptolemy, the Assyria of the Seleucides and of the Arsacides, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> ancient cities which were in ruins since long.|$|R
50|$|About 30 prisoners {{managed to}} escape from the camps in Saltdal in the course of three years. Jovanović says that 23 men escaped from the Botn camp, but <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> how many of those were successful.|$|R
25|$|On 3 January 1925, Mussolini made a truculent {{speech before}} the Chamber {{in which he}} took {{responsibility}} for squadristi violence (though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the assassination of Matteotti).|$|E
25|$|Jan Evangelista Purkyně or Purkinje (1787–1869), a Czech {{physiologist}} {{and professor}} of anatomy at the University of Breslau, published a thesis in 1823 discussing 9 fingerprint patterns, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> any possibility of using fingerprints to identify people.|$|E
25|$|His {{paraphrase}} of Cicero {{was included}} {{at the suggestion}} of Harry V. Jaffa, though the speech was primarily written by Karl Hess. Because of President Johnson's popularity, Goldwater refrained from attacking the president directly. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Johnson by name at all in his convention speech.|$|E
50|$|A 'greatly shocked' Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, {{the then}} {{president}} of Azad Kashmir, who visited the place during the event, painfully confirmed that Hindus were 'disposed of' in Mirpur in November 1947, although <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> any figures.|$|R
50|$|Pre-dating Heron's writings, {{a device}} called an aeolipile was {{described}} in the 1st century BC by Vitruvi in his treatise De architectura; however, it is unclear {{if it is the}} same device or a predecessor, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> rotating parts.|$|R
50|$|His {{autobiography}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> identify {{his parents}} or siblings by name. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> that <b>he</b> {{is married and}} has children until a point in his autobiography that is long after his actual marriage {{and the birth of}} his children would have taken place.|$|R
25|$|On 6 March 1884, The Times {{printed a}} {{rebuttal}} by Sir H.V. Goold. This {{reply to the}} Royal Society of Arts set out {{the aims of the}} Society and declared that many of its members were also members of the Society of Arts (although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> that they wanted their money back).|$|E
25|$|Suzuki {{mentioned}} to So-on {{during this period}} {{that he might be}} interested in going to America to teach Zen Buddhism. So-on was adamantly opposed to the idea. Suzuki realized that his teacher felt very close to him and that he would take such a departure as an insult. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> it to him again.|$|E
25|$|Since resigning the {{chairmanship}} of the KMT, Lee has campaigned actively on behalf of the pro-Japanese colonization of Taiwan pan-green coalition candidates and opposed candidates of his former party who took pro-Chinese unification positions since the 2004 presidential elections. He has stated a number of political positions and ideas which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> while he was President, but which he appeared to have privately maintained. Lee was expelled from KMT on 21 September 2001.|$|E
50|$|Richard Miller names {{two types}} of soprano coloratura voices (the coloratura and the {{dramatic}} coloratura) {{as well as a}} mezzo-soprano coloratura voice, and although <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the coloratura contralto, he includes mention of specific works requiring coloratura technique for the contralto voice.|$|R
50|$|Cassie is briefly {{referred}} to by Doug in series 6 when he mentions to Liv that he once danced for a girl to help her get through an exam, referring to Cassie's centric episode in the second series. However <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> her by name.|$|R
50|$|Thucydides {{reports that}} the request met with some success, and the helots got {{supplies}} through to the besieged island. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> whether or <b>not</b> the Spartans kept their word; {{it is possible that}} some of the helots later executed were part of the Sphacterian volunteers.|$|R
25|$|At the {{suggestion}} of Beaumont Newhall, Weston decided {{to apply for a}} Guggenheim Foundation grant (now known as a Guggenheim Fellowship). He wrote a two-sentence description about his work, assembled thirty-five of his favorites prints, and sent it in. Afterward Dorothea Lange and her husband suggested that the application was too brief to be seriously considered, and Weston resubmitted it with a four-page letter and work plan. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> that Wilson had written the new application for him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} season, Preston's long-time rival and love-to-hate medic Dr. Erica Hahn {{replaced}} {{him as the}} head of cardiothoracic surgery. Before taking over the position she had tremendous respect for Burke although she would have never admitted it to his face. Hahn disliked Cristina Yang because of her relationships with Dr. Burke and Colin Marlow. During his employment at a new hospital, he is made the recipient of 2008's Harper Avery, a highly prestigious medical award. Cristina is later hurt that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> her in his article, even though Cristina helped Burke with his recovery from an injury.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{president}} of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Angel Villar, announced in July 2008 that it was Spain's intention to submit an individual World Cup bid, and that positive contacts had already taken place with the government, through the secretary of sports, Jaime Lissavetzky. No specifications were made then regarding a joint bid with Portugal. On 23 November 2008, after his re-election for the RFEF presidency, Villar pledged that one of the fundamental objectives of his term was to bring a World Cup to Spain. While <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> whether Spain would present a joint bid with Portugal, he did not rule it out when asked about it.|$|E
5000|$|The author {{describes}} the Toccos as fair governors, {{who care for}} the rights of their people. It is remarkable, that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the Latin descent of the noble family. He appears to cultivate a sense of early Greek nationalism and to hate the Albanians.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Does</b> <b>Not</b> Provide Solution To The Problem Of Unemployment: Boeke’s dualism centers more on socio—cultural aspects {{rather on}} economic. He only says that {{government}} {{is not in a}} position to remove unemployment. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the situation of under employment. Therefore, his theory is full of shortcomings.|$|R
50|$|Morgan's {{standard}} of {{higher or lower}} is not clearly expressed. By higher he appears to mean whatever contributes better to control over the environment, victory over competitors, and spread of population. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, but Darwin referred to Morgan's work in his own.|$|R
25|$|Popov {{reported}} to Maxwell at Cold Bay in late August 1945 that LCI(L)s transferred under Project Hula {{played an important}} role in the Soviet assault on the Kuril Islands just ten days after arriving at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and that other Project Hula ships had taken part in Soviet operations against the Japanese in northern Korea and on southern Sakhalin Island. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> losses. Five ships transferred in Project Hula, all former LCI(L)s – DS-1 (ex-), DS-5 (ex-), DS-9 (ex-), DS-43 (ex-), and DS-47 (ex-) – were lost in combat during the operations, all of them sunk by Japanese coastal artillery on 18 August 1945 during the Soviet landings on Shumshu.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{preoccupation with}} the stage, and later with his {{official}} duties, Schubert found time during these years for {{a significant amount of}} composition. He completed the Mass in A-flat major (D. 678) and, in 1822, embarked suddenly on a work which more decisively than almost any other in those years showed his maturing personal vision, the Symphony in B minor Unfinished (D. 759). The reason he left it unfinished—after two movements and sketches some way into a third—remains an enigma, and it is also remarkable that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> it to any of his friends, even though, as Brian Newbould notes, he must have felt thrilled by what he was achieving. The event has been debated endlessly without resolution.|$|E
500|$|On June 23, 2008, Cuba’s daily newspaper, Granma, {{published}} a lengthy prologue, written by Fidel Castro, {{to the book}} Fidel, Bolivia y algo más, which had been re-issued fifteen years after its initial publication. [...] In a prologue to this new edition of a book commemorating his visit to Bolivia in 1993, Fidel Castro {{took the opportunity to}} quote a long excerpt from Sánchez's blog and, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> her name, expressed his disappointment that there are young persons in Cuba today who think as she does. Castro describes Sánchez's statements as a generalization used as a slogan.|$|E
50|$|In the Argonautica,Apollonius of Rhodes {{mentions}} {{the settlement of}} Cytorus and related places in describing the voyage of the Argo. Unlike Strabo, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Cytorus as a son of Phryxus. Apollonius does apparently place Cytorus where Gideros Bay is today, between the Bartın River {{and the city of}} Sinop.|$|R
5000|$|It {{seems that}} Xenophon's {{portrayal}} {{of her in}} his Symposium {{has been the most}} influential: Diogenes Laërtius, for example, seems to quote the Symposium passage, though <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Xenophon by name, and the term [...] "Xanthippe" [...] has now come to mean any nagging scolding person, especially a shrewish wife.|$|R
50|$|Maogamalcha was a {{place in}} Mesopotamia, {{attacked}} and taken by the Roman Emperor Julian (Ammianus Marcellinus xxiv. 4.). It {{appears to have been}} strongly fortified and well defended.
