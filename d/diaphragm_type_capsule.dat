40|$|The {{construction}} of water management and navigation structures often requires temporary works to exclude water to facilitate {{construction in the}} dry or at least under a lower water level within the construction area. The use of cellular cofferdams for both temporary and permanent earth/water retaining works is very common. A number of theories are presented that describe the failure mechanisms involved. These failure mechanisms were identified from model studies on circular type cofferdams are applied independent of cofferdam geometry. It is common to use <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdams. To asses the validity of common failure mechanisms associated with cellular cofferdams when applied to <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdams, a series of numerical modelling analyses were conducted. These were validated using field monitoring results of a large scale <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdam constructed at St. Germans, Norfolk, UK. A series of plane strain analyses of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdam were conducted using the geometry from a critical section of cofferdam. These analyses identified the lowest factor of safety based on the drained strength of the clay on which the cofferdam was constructed. The water level within the river was increased to accommodate flooding and soil strength was reduced to identify the general failure mechanism. The structural forces were calculated using both 2 D and 3 D models for a larger width section (13 m wide) to allow comparison with wall bending moments and displacements measured in field. The 3 D analyses used actual tie spacing and membrane effects whilst reducing the lateral stiffness of the wall to accommodate the stiffness reduction due to variation in the interlock forces. To measure the bending moment in sheet piles, resistance type strain gauges were installed on a 13 m wide section of cofferdam. The cell deflection, river and cell water levels were also monitored to identify tidal river effect {{and the influence of}} cell water level on performance. Comparison of field and numerical results highlighted a number of important design and construction detail related to <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cellular cofferdams.

Here an analysis is carried out by varying the dimensions of two different diaphragm geometries, namely conventional square <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and cross-sectional beam <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The analysis is done using finite element method (FEM) technique in ANSYS software and by comparing the results, the better <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> is chosen for the required pressure range of the application for flash flood level measurement.

40|$|Kingella kingae is an {{encapsulated}} gram-negative organism that is {{a common}} cause of osteoarticular infections in young children. In earlier work, we identified a glycosyltransferase gene called csaA that is necessary for synthesis of the [3) -β-GalpNAc-(1 → 5) -β-Kdop-(2 →] polysaccharide <b>capsule</b> (<b>type</b> a) in K. kingae strain 269 - 492. In the current study, we analyzed a large collection of invasive and carrier isolates from Israel and found that csaA was present in only 47 % of the isolates. Further examination of this collection using primers based on the sequence that flanks csaA revealed three additional gene clusters (designated the csb, csc, and csd loci), all encoding predicted glycosyltransferases. The csb locus contains the csbA, csbB, and csbC genes and {{is associated with a}} capsule {{that is a}} polymer of [6) -α-GlcpNAc-(1 → 5) -β-(8 -OAc) Kdop-(2 →] (type b). The csc locus contains the cscA, cscB, and cscC genes and is associated with a capsule that is a polymer of [3) -β-Ribf-(1 → 2) -β-Ribf-(1 → 2) -β-Ribf-(1 → 4) -β-Kdop-(2 →] (type c). The csd locus contains the csdA, csdB, and csdC genes and is associated with a capsule that is a polymer of [P-(O→ 3) [β-Galp-(1 → 4) ]-β-GlcpNAc-(1 → 3) -α-GlcpNAc- 1 -] (type d). Introduction of the csa, csb, csc, and csd loci into strain KK 01 Δcsa, a strain 269 - 492 derivative that lacks the native csaA gene, was sufficient to produce the <b>type</b> a <b>capsule,</b> <b>type</b> b <b>capsule,</b> <b>type</b> c <b>capsule,</b> and <b>type</b> d <b>capsule,</b> respectively, indicating that these loci are solely responsible for determining <b>capsule</b> <b>type</b> in K. kingae. Further analysis demonstrated that 96 % of the invasive isolates express either the type a or <b>type</b> b <b>capsule</b> and that a disproportionate percentage of carrier isolates express the type c or <b>type</b> d <b>capsule.</b> These results establish that there are at least four structurally distinct K. kingae <b>capsule</b> <b>types</b> and suggest that <b>capsule</b> <b>type</b> {{plays an important role in}} promoting K. kingae invasive disease...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{pressure}} plays a {{vital role}} in automotive safety applications. This paper reports on the deformation analysis of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> pressure sensor. There are two kinds of <b>diaphragms,</b> square <b>type</b> and circular type have been considered for the analysis. In this sense, diaphragms with equivalent cross sectional area have been selected for the simplicity. The proposed diaphragms has been simulated to get maximum deformation for an input pressure by using COMSOL and it is compared with the theoretical analysis. In addition, stress analysis along the mid line of the square type and circular type membranes also has been obtained by using FEM simulation. Based on the deformation, circular <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is preferable than square type. Even though, the design layout costs more in fabricating circular diaphragms which indeed increases the cost of the sensor and the fabrication costs are higher compared to the square shaped diaphragm...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} role of capsular serotypes in the {{virulence}} of Streptococcus pneumoniae, we have constructed isogenic derivatives differing only in the <b>type</b> of <b>capsule</b> expressed. Strains of types 2, 5, and 6 B were converted to type 3 by transformation and selection for an erythromycin resistance marker linked to the <b>type</b> 3 <b>capsule</b> locus. Characterization studies revealed that these type 3 derivatives were indistinguishable from the type 2, type 5, and type 6 B parental strains in terms of restriction enzyme fragment pattern and expression of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA). Expression of the <b>type</b> 3 <b>capsule</b> did not alter the mouse virulence of the similarly virulent type 2 strain. However, alteration of <b>capsule</b> <b>type</b> {{had a profound effect}} on the virulence of the type 5 and type 6 B derivatives. The highly virulent type 5 strain was essentially avirulent when expressing the <b>type</b> 3 <b>capsule.</b> Conversely, the 50 % lethal dose of the relatively avirulent type 6 B strain was reduced > 100 -fold when the <b>type</b> 3 <b>capsule</b> was expressed. Thus, the serotype of capsule expressed has a major effect on virulence, and this effect is dependent upon the genetic background of the recipient strain...|$|R

50|$|The capsule is {{considered}} a virulence factor because it enhances the ability of bacteria to cause disease (e.g. prevents phagocytosis).

40|$|The Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) {{are major}} {{determinants}} of virulence that are antigenically variable {{and capable of}} eliciting protective immune responses. By genetically switching the pspA genes of the <b>capsule</b> <b>type</b> 2 strain D 39 and the <b>capsule</b> <b>type</b> 3 strain WU 2, we showed that the different abilities of antibody to PspA to protect against these strains {{was not related to}} the PspA type expressed. Similarly, the level of specific antibody binding to PspA, other surface antigens, and surface-localized C 3 b did not depend on the PspA type but instead was correlated with the <b>capsule</b> <b>type.</b> The type 3 strain WU 2 and an isogenic derivative of D 39 that expresses the <b>type</b> 3 <b>capsule</b> bound nearly identical amounts of antibody to PspA and other surface antigens, and these amounts were less than one-half the amount observed with the type 2 parent strain D 39. Expression of the <b>type</b> 3 <b>capsule</b> in D 39 also reduced the amount of C 3 b deposited and its accessibility to antibody, resulting in a level intermediate between the levels observed with WU 2 and D 39. Despite these effects, the <b>capsule</b> <b>type</b> was not the determining factor in anti-PspA-mediated protection, as both D 39 and its derivative expressing the <b>type</b> 3 <b>capsule</b> were more resistant to protection than WU 2. The specific combination of PspA and <b>capsule</b> <b>type</b> also did not determine the level of protection. The capsule structure is thus a major determinant in accessibility of surface antigens to antibody, but certain strains appear to express other factors that can influence antibody-mediated protection...|$|R
