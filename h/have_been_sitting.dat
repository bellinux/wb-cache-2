25|$|Vicki and I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> weeping {{into our}} coffees {{for the last}} couple of years. We have looked at all our hard work and thought: 'My God, what's happening?' This is not a place for show ponies, it's a time for {{carefully}} thought through strategic thinking.|$|E
25|$|Collier Motors sits {{frozen in}} time. Although the lot is {{overgrown}} with weeds, Collier continues to sell whole cars and parts, {{although many of}} them are in poor shape as they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> on the lot since the early 1980s. They include 1970s and 1980-model AMCs, such as Gremlins, Pacers, Matadors, Javelins, Eagles, and Concords. Many retain their original window stickers. Everything is for sale, but an appointment is needed.|$|E
2500|$|After the 6 September show, with Stéphane, Yanic and Forest {{now gone}} and Bart unable to walk, rumors began to surface on the {{internet}} about Quo Vadis being disbanded entirely. However, on 15 September Bart posted a video on YouTube confirming the departures and dismissing the rumors about the break-up, adding that [...] "a new line-up is in place and we actually have some shows scheduled in October and November... I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> on literally two albums worth of material {{for the past two}} years that we were not able to finish for various reasons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baron Axel Carpelan, {{who gave}} Sibelius' {{well-known}} tone poem Finlandia its name, {{wrote to the}} composer shortly after its successful premiere: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> at home for quite a while, Mr. Sibelius, {{it is high time}} for you to travel. You will spend the late autumn and the winter in Italy, a country where one learns cantabile, balance and harmony, plasticity and symmetry of lines, a country where everything is beautiful – even the ugly. You remember what Italy meant for Tchaikovsky’s development and for Richard Strauss." [...] Although Baron Carpelan was penniless, he raised sufficient funds for Sibelius to stay in a mountain villa near Rapallo, Italy. Here, Sibelius jotted down the first notes to his second symphony.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 April 2002, Chairman Cass Ballenger and Congressman Bill Delahunt of the United States {{also met}} with Venezuelan media heads of Venevisión, Globovisión, Unión Radio, El Nacional, Últimas Noticias and El Mundo, telling them that [...] "the U.S. was opposed to any {{disruption}} of constitutional government and would condemn any coup, open or disguised, aimed at ousting Chavez". At a meeting soon after the coup between United States ambassador to Venezuela Charles Shapiro and then Venezuelan Vice President José Vicente Rangel at the Vice President's home, Rangel also stated to Shapiro that [...] "no one in the upper echelons of the Venezuelan government really believed that the United States {{was involved in the}} attempted overthrow" [...] and that if the Venezuelan government did believe so, [...] "the two men wouldn’t <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> in Rangel’s house".|$|E
2500|$|Citing {{dissatisfaction with}} the {{aesthetics}} of modern digital displays and a nostalgic fondness for the styling of obsolete technology, significant numbers of electronics enthusiasts {{in recent years have}} shown interest in reviving Nixies. Unsold tubes that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> in warehouses for decades are being brought out and used, the most common application being in homemade digital clocks. This is somewhat ironic, since during their heyday, Nixies were generally considered too expensive for use in mass-market consumer goods such as clocks. This recent surge in demand has caused prices to rise significantly, particularly for large tubes. The largest Nixie tubes known to {{be in the hands of}} collectors, the Rodan CD47/GR-414 (220mm [...] tall), have been sold for hundreds of dollars each, but said Nixies are extremely rare. Prices for other large Nixies displaying digits over 25mm (1in) tall have risen by double, triple or more between 1998 and 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Ives {{was born}} in Danbury, Connecticut in 1874, the son of George Ives, a U.S. Army bandleader in the American Civil War, and his wife, Mary Parmelee. A strong {{influence}} of his may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> in the Danbury town square, listening to George's marching band and other bands on other sides of the square simultaneously. George's unique music lessons were also a strong influence on him; George took an open-minded approach to musical theory, encouraging him to experiment in bitonal and polytonal harmonizations. It was from him that Ives also learned the music of Stephen Foster. He became a church organist {{at the age of}} 14 and wrote various hymns and songs for church services, including his Variations on [...] "America", which he wrote for a Fourth of July concert in Brewster, New York. It is considered challenging even by modern concert organists, but he famously spoke of it as being [...] "as much fun as playing baseball", a commentary on his own organ technique at that age.|$|E
2500|$|Gloria in Excelsis. Toward {{the end of}} the Kyrie, {{the sacred}} ministers walk (still staying in a line) {{to the center of the}} altar. If they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting,</b> all rise, save the celebrant, who waits until his biretta has been {{collected}} by the deacon. The three sacred ministers genuflect at the foot of the altar steps, then ascend and form a line. (The deacon and subdeacon usually lift the ends of the celebrant's alb whenever they ascend the steps together, and place their closest hand under his elbows when they descend together.) The celebrant intones, i.e. sings the first few words of, the Gloria, after which the choir sings the rest and the deacon and subdeacon ascend the steps to stand at either side of the celebrant, while he says in a low voice the remainder of the Gloria independently of the choir. When they are finished they remain in this position until the singing is nearly done or, if it is a long musical setting, they may go down and sit (first genuflecting), as mentioned above at the Kyrie. (Note: The Gloria is omitted from Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide, as well as from ferias outside Christmastide, Epiphanytide, and Paschaltide.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Radiocarbon dating has {{suggested}} that some artifacts at Carlston Annis date back to 5424 BC, although most artifacts dated between 3200 and 1400 BC. [...] Most of its projectile points clearly dated from the Archaic period, although one Adena and occasional Mississippian points were found; they seemingly were left by later peoples, just like the pottery pieces. [...] Two projectile points that were found underneath the mound were fluted points from the Paleoindian period; they are believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> on the riverside before the shell mound was started. [...] Like several other shell mound sites in Kentucky, Carlston Annis produced pieces of three stone pipes and of a single stone cup; these objects may have been religious artifacts used by shamans in attempts to heal diseases. [...] Kentucky's larger riverine Archaic sites vary widely {{in the amount of}} shell refuse that they have yielded; the much larger amount of shell refuse at sites such as Carlston-Annis and Indian Knoll is seemingly due to the presence of nearby bivalve beds. [...] The numbers and types of non-human bones at the mound were typical of Archaic shell middens in the region, as was the number of antler pieces, although tools made of human bone were unusually numerous. [...] At least three different processes were used to produce fishhooks from bones: some had been made from deer toes; some from bird bones of all sizes, a technique common at Kentucky shell middens; and a few by drilling large bones. [...] Carlston Annis was the first Kentucky shell midden at which fishhooks made by this technique were found, although evidence of this technique is plentiful at the later Fort Ancient-period Madisonville Site near Cincinnati. Numerous animal bones appear to have been used as ceremonial [...] "medicine bags," [...] which in later centuries were often made by skinning an animal without removing some of the bones.|$|E
