50|$|One of the {{problems}} with clinical phototherapy is the difficulty many patients have gaining access to a facility. Indoor tanning resources are almost ubiquitous today and could be considered as a means for patients to get UV exposure when dermatologist provided phototherapy is not available. Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to <b>erythemogenic</b> doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} and theories implicating {{long-wave ultraviolet radiation}} (320 - 400 nm) as the stimulus for various phenomena in human skin have prompted us to investigate the <b>erythemogenic</b> properties of middle (UV-B) and long (UV-A) wave ultraviolet light combinations. The backs of fair-skinned human volunteers were irradiated with varying doses of UV-A and UV-B to determine the minimal perceptible erythema (MPE) dose {{in each of these}} wavelength regions. The subjects then received overlapping suberythemal doses of UV-A and UV-B in each of several sites. When UV-A was held constant and UV-B was varied, the observed breakpoint dose (energy at which MPE was seen in doubly irradiated sites) quantitatively demonstrated an additive phenomenon. When combined energies approach threshold erythema values, the known <b>erythemogenic</b> properties of high-dose UV-A are additive to the subclinical or visible erythema induced by UV-B...|$|E

In these experiments, the animals were immunized by injection of dinitrophenyl-bovine gamma-globulin (DNP-BGG) in complete Freund's adjuvant and delayed hypersensitivity responses were provoked by intradermal injections of DNP-BGG, DNP and BGG on the flanks. Exposure to <b>erythemogenic</b> doses of either PUVA or UVB radiation for 7 days prior to immunization and for the 7 days between immunization and challenge (total period of radiation: 14 days) produced inhibition of responses to each of the test substances. In addition, treatment with <b>erythemogenic</b> doses of PUVA either for 7 days prior to immunization or during the interval between immunization and challenge with DNP-BGG, inhibited the delayed hypersensitivity responses at the site of irradiation and at a nonexposed site. These findings suggest that in vivo exposure to nonionizing radiation leads to both local and systemic alteration of certain immune responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} exposure to an additive dose of long ultraviolet (UVA) radiation on the <b>erythemogenic</b> and therapeutic effects of middle ultraviolet (UVB) irradiation {{was investigated in}} 8 patients with psoriasis. The surface of the backs of these patients was divided into 2 parts, 1 of which received only UVB irradiation 4 {{times a week and}} the other UVA + UVB. UVB was provided by Philips TL- 12 lamps and UVA by glass-filtered Philips TL- 09 lamps. UVA was held constantly at 10 J/cm 2, whereas UVB was increased. The <b>erythemogenic</b> effects of UVA + UVB and UVB alone were evaluated by 4 tests during the treatment to determine the minimal erythema dose (MED). Test I (at the start of the therapy) showed a photoaugmentative effect which was no longer apparent in test III (third week). Test III showed a reversal of the ratios of the MEDs of the sites irradiated with UVA + UVB and UVB (MED A+B/MED B). This is ascribed to the marked pigmentation which appeared after repeated irradiation with the UVA + UVB combination.

In general, threshold doses for erythema and pigmentation were higher when UVA was administered at the lowest irradiance (5 mW/cm 2) than at the highest (50 mW/cm 2). Erythema was maximal immediately after exposure to UVA. The most intense responses (erythema with edema, or intense pigmentation) were induced more frequently by the highest irradiance. Components of both the erythema and the pigment response to UVA are therefore irradiance-dependent.

Wavelengths of 254, 280, and 290 nm were <b>erythemogenic</b> but not therapeutic even at 10 to 50 times the minimal erythema dose. At the other wavelengths studied, the 2 action spectra were similar. In general, fixed daily doses cleared at lower cumulative dose than did incrementally increased daily doses.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{presence of}} methylpsoralens as undesired inquinants in synthetic methylangelicins has been avoided through a synthetic pathway starting from umbelliferones carrying a methyl {{group in the}} 6 -position. The new 6 -methylangelicins show a high affinity toward DNA, forming in the dark a molecular complex; the complexed angelicins under UV-A irradiation photobind effectively to the macromolecule, forming only monoadducts. The new compounds show an evident antiproliferative activity by inhibiting DNA synthesis on Ehrlich cells; great differences, however, can be seen between the various compounds. All the compounds are lacking of skin <b>erythemogenic</b> activity. Some of the new 6 -methylangelicins, evaluated in terms of mutagenic activity, demonstrate to be less effective than 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP), used for a comparison. On the basis of antiproliferative activity, lack of skin phototoxicity, and low mutagenicity, two compounds have been chosen for clinical evaluation.

40|$|To measure <b>erythemogenic</b> UV {{radiation}} in Iceland. Material and methods: <b>Erythemogenic</b> UV radiation {{was measured}} {{during the period}} from April through September 2010. We used a UV sensor that measures the Erythema Action Spectrum as has been defined by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) as the standard representation of the average skin response to UVB and UVA. The sensor was located in Skorradalur, Iceland (64, 533287 N; - 21, 526338 W; altitude 63 m.). The location of the sensor was carefully chosen to ensure that it was never in the shade. The maximum UV-index measured was higher than three 21 days in May, 26 days in June, 26 days in July and 23 days in August. The highest value recorded was 7, 3 on June 18 th, at 13 : 25. UV index was measured as 5 or higher on 16 days in June. The highest erythema weighted daily dose was measured to 19, 2 SED in April, 27, 1 SED in May, 32, 2 SED in June, 30 SED in July, 23, 5 SED in August and 11, 6 SED in September. These are the first results from measurements of UV-index and standard erythema dose (SED) in Iceland. The data shows that on a sunny day the UV-index can be relatively high. When the standard erythema dose was considered, high values were obtained during the summer months, with values up to six times what can cause sunburn.

40|$|The acute {{response}} of human skin to UVB radiation {{has not been}} fully characterized. We sought to define the cutaneous response at 24 hours following narrowband UVB (NB-UVB, 312 -nm peak), a therapeutically relevant source of UVB, using transcriptional profiling, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. There were 1, 522 unique differentially regulated genes, including upregulated genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (S 100 A 7, S 100 A 12, human beta-defensin 2, and elafin), as well as neutrophil and monocyte/dendritic cell (DC) chemoattractants (IL- 8, CXCL 1, CCL 20, CCL 2). Ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated activation of innate defense and early adaptive immune pathways. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased epidermal staining for AMPs (S 100 A 7, S 100 A 12, human beta-defensin 2, and elafin). Inflammatory myeloid CD 11 c+BDCA 1 − DCs were increased in irradiated skin, which were immature as shown by minimal colocalization with DC-LAMP, and coexpressed inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF–related apoptosis-inducing ligand in irradiated skin. There were increased BDCA 3 + DCs, a cross-presenting DC subtype with immunosuppressive functions, and these cells have not been previously characterized {{as part of the}} response to UVB. These results show that the acute {{response of}} human skin to <b>erythemogenic</b> doses of NB-UVB includes activation of innate defense mechanisms, as well as early infiltration of multiple subtypes of inflammatory DCs, which could serve as a link between innate and adaptive immunity...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antiproliferative}} activity and in vivo phototoxicity of some methyl derivatives of 5 -methoxypsoralen and 5 -methoxyangelicin, i. e. 4, 4 '-dimethyl- 5 -methoxyangelicin (compound I), 3, 4 '-dimethyl- 5 -methoxyangelicin (compound II), 4, 4 '-dimethyl- 5 -methoxypsoralen (compound III); and 3, 4 '-dimethyl- 5 -methoxypsoralen (compound IV), have been investigated. The {{effects of the}} compounds were evaluated in vitro on HL 60 and A 431 cells, using 5 -methoxypsoralen as the reference compound. In both cell lines compound I, II and III showed better antiproliferative activity than compound IV and 5 -methoxypsoralen. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that all the compounds induced the formation of blebs and blisters on a A 431 cell surface. Significant variations in the nuclear area strictly related to the toxicity of the compounds have been shown in both cell lines. Skin irritancy in vivo was evaluated by mean of histopathological responses on guinea-pig skin. For each compound a damage index was determined by morphometrical analysis of empty spaces in the epidermis. Histopathology revealed skin phototoxicity of compounds which lacked <b>erythemogenic</b> activity by visual scoring. By coupling cytotoxicity data in vitro to skin sensitization ones in vivo, compound I proved a promising candidate for use in clinical trials since due to a high inhibitory effect on the growth of human cell lines coupled to low skin phototoxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} sun {{exposure}} and skin cancer is well established, but {{the mechanism of}} photocarcinogenesis is still incompletely understood. In vitro experimentation has shown that induction of the c-fos proto-oncogene occurs in cultured human keratinocytes after ultraviolet exposure, and c-Ha-ras mutations are commonly present in human skin neoplasms removed from chronically sun-exposed sites. In the present study, the effect of UV irradiation on the expression of these two proto-oncogenes was examined. The sun-protected volar forearm of six subjects was exposed to a standardized <b>erythemogenic</b> dose of solar-simulated light, and punch biopsies were obtained after 1 h and 24 h from the irradiated area and a nearby shielded area. Expression of c-fos, determined by in situ hybridization of histologic cross-sections, was detected in the basal and lower epidermal layers in all biopsies. However, at 1 h there was a marked increase that returned to baseline by 24 h. c-Ha-ras mRNA could not be detected by riboprobe hybridization {{in any of the}} biopsy specimens. Our data demonstrate transient induction of c-fos but not c-Ha-ras expression, at least at the timepoints studied, following a modest UV exposure in normal skin. This phenomenon may lead to the subsequent constitutive over-ex- pression and super-inducibility of c-fos observed in cultured keratinocytes derived from photodamaged skin and may facilitate the development of skin cancer...|$|E
40|$|Suberythemogenic {{exposure}} of human skin treated with aqueous 8 -MOP to radiation greater than 380 nm prolongs photosensitization to subsequent UVA from 6 to 24 – 72 h. One hypothesis for prolonged photosensitization is that greater than 380 nm irradiation forms 8 -MOP-DNA mono-adducts, which are removed {{more slowly than}} free 8 -MOP {{and serve as a}} substrate for crosslinking by further UVA exposure. Sufficient DNA crosslinking results in erythema. We have examined this hypothesis by measuring the action spectrum for induction of prolonged photosensitization. Skin of normal volunteers was treated with aqueous 8 -MOP (0. 003 %) and immediately received suberythemogenic monochromatic exposures between 334 and 430 nm. twenty-four hours later, the presence of prolonged sensitization was tested by small exposures of UVA. Erythema was evaluated 3 and 5 d later, and an action spectrum for prolonged sensitization was determined. The minimum phototoxic dose (MPD) was also determined at each wavelength. The action spectrum for prolonged photosensitization declined gradually between 334 and 425 nm. The action spectrum for delayed erythema induced by a single {{exposure of}} 8 -MOP-treated skin declined rapidly from 334 – 390 nm. These findings are consistent with prolonged binding of 8 -MOP in the skin by an initial exposure, possibly as 8 -MOP-DNA monoadducts, allowing the second exposure to induce an <b>erythemogenic</b> event, possibly crosslinking of DNA...|$|E
40|$|Non {{ionizing}} radiations with wavelengths {{ranging from}} 340 to 400 nm (UVA 1 waveband) have peculiar photophysical, photobiological and phototherapeutical effects. UVA 1 penetrates {{deeply into the}} skin and modulates the biological and immunological activity of both dermal and epidermal circulating as well as resident cells. Unlike UVB (260 - 320 nm) and UVA 2 (320 - 340 nm), UVA 1 photobiological effects are mediated exclusively by oxidative photochemical processes leading {{to the formation of}} singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). The main targets of ROS are cell membranes and cytoplasmic organelles, particularly mitochondria, that are rich of structural molecules with several double bonds, e. g. lipids and aminoacids. UVA 1 phototerapy proved to be an effective and well tolerated therapeutic option in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, localized scleroderma, mastocytosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, mycosis fungoides, chronic graft versus host disease {{and a growing number of}} other skin diseases, characterized by dermo-epidermal infiltrates of normal as well as neoplastic lymphocytes, mastocytes and/or eosinophils as well as alterated metabolism of collagen. There is no general agreement on the optimal treatment protocol. UVA 1 is delivered at fixed doses without progressive dose adjustments. However, protocols differ in the UVA 1 dosage, the number of weekly exposures, and total number of exposures. UVA 1 therapy is always well tolerated and episodes of <b>erythemogenic</b> reaction are rare. Long term adverse effects are unknown but the hazard of skin carcinogenicity seems negligible because UVA 1 does not damage directly DNA...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine whether}} it is {{possible}} to evaluate the degree of ultraviolet B (UVB) – induced inflammation by measuring the degree of hyperpigmentation, we investigated the relationship between UVB-induced erythema and the subsequent pigmentation quantitatively. At 24 h and 7 d after irradiation with <b>erythemogenic</b> doses of UVB to the backs of l 6 Japanese subjects, the degree of induced erythema (Δerythema index) and that of pigmentation (Δmelanin index) were examined by an image analytic method using a videomicroscope interfaced with a computer. The relationship between two indices was linear in each subject, and the correlation coefficient was 0. 83 when evaluated using whole data. The slope of the regression line for the Δmelanin index against Δerythema index tended to become steeper as non-irradiated skin color became darker (r = 0. 63), suggesting that more efficient melanogenesis takes place after the same level of inflammation in the subject with darker skin. Both erythema and hyperpigmentation were suppressed significantly and in a parallel manner by corticosteroids and indomethacin applied topically immediately after UVB irradiation. These results imply that the post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation correlates closely with the severity of the prior inflammation and that chemical mediators released in the inflammatory process have considerable influence on the melanogenesis. We conclude that the measurement of UVB-induced hyperpigmentation can be utilized for the assessment of topical anti-inflammatory agents, unless these have direct actions on the tyrosinase activity of melanocytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of human skin pigmentation must address both the initial {{evolution of}} intense epidermal pigmentation in hominins, and its subsequent dilution in modern humans. While many authorities believe that epidermal pigmentation evolved {{to protect against}} either ultraviolet B (UV-B) irradiation-induced mutagenesis or folic acid photolysis, we hypothesize that pigmentation augmented the epidermal barriers by shifting the UV-B dose-response curve from toxic to beneficial. Whereas <b>erythemogenic</b> UV-B doses produce apoptosis and cell death, suberythemogenic doses benefit permeability and antimicrobial function. Heavily melanized melanocytes acidify the outer epidermis and emit paracrine signals that augment barrier competence. Modern humans, residing in the cooler, wetter climes of south-central Europe and Asia, initially retained substantial pigmentation. While their outdoor lifestyles still permitted sufficient cutaneous vitamin D 3 (VD 3) synthesis, their marginal nutritional status, coupled with cold-induced caloric needs, selected for moderate pigment reductions that diverted limited nutritional resources towards more urgent priorities (=metabolic conservation). The further pigment-dilution that evolved as humans reached north-central Europe (i. e., northern France, Germany), likely facilitated cutaneous VD 3 synthesis, while also supporting ongoing, nutritional requirements. But at still higher European latitudes where little UV-B breaches the atmosphere (i. e., present-day UK, Scandinavia, Baltic States), pigment dilution alone could not suffice. There, other nonpigment-related mutations evolved to facilitate VD 3 production; for example, in the epidermal protein, filaggrin, resulting in reduced levels of its distal metabolite, trans-urocanic acid, a potent UV-B chromophore. Thus, changes in human pigmentation reflect a complex interplay between latitude, climate, diet, lifestyle, and shifting metabolic priorities...|$|E
40|$|The UV-index is an {{international}} standard measurement {{of the strength of}} <b>erythemogenic</b> ultraviolet radiation. It is often published in the media and then refers to the highest expected UV radiation for that day. The highest UV-index value measured in Iceland is seven. Although this is similar to the maximum values from southern Scandinavia, the average UV-index is lower in Iceland compared to other Nordic countries. Around solar noon the UV index is roughly equivalent to the Standard Erythema Dose (SED). During a bright summer day in Iceland the number of Standard Erythema doses can go as high as 32, but is on average in June around twenty. The typical Icelander gets red after 4 - 6 SED and it is obvious that during solar noon it is easy to sunburn in Iceland if you stay outside without sun protection.

40|$|Red hair, {{fair skin}} {{and the lack of}} tanning ability are {{generally}} recognized as risk factors for melanoma and other skin cancers under conditions of prolonged solar exposure. These pigmentary traits are associated with some loss of function mutations at the melanocortin- 1 receptor which cause the melanocyte to produce red photosensitizing pheomelanin in preference to the default pigment, the dark eumelanin. At present evaluation of UV susceptibility relies exclusively on determination of the phenotype and phototype. Yet, not all phenotypically similar red haired individuals exhibit the same <b>erythemogenic</b> responses and tanning capacities, suggesting that the type and levels of pheomelanin may profoundly affect the individual response to UV radiation. Identification of specific markers of pheomelanin pigments and determination of possible relationships with skin phototypes and UV susceptibility appear therefore attractive goals. Recently we developed new procedures for analysis of pheomelanin based on identification and quantitation of specific structural markers obtained by chemical degradation of hair. The levels of these structural markers, viz. 1, 3 -thiazole- 2, 4, 5 -tricarboxylic acid (TTCA) and 6 -(2 -amino- 2 -carboxyethyl) - 2 -carboxy- 4 -hydroxybenzothiazole (BTCA) were determined in groups of red hair individuals. Whereas the majority of the red hair samples afforded TTCA in variable yields, only a restricted number of samples gave BTCA. Herein, we report new data from a larger group of red haired individuals (n= 22). As a rule, the lowest MED and 5 -days delayed pigmentation values were associated with BTCA-positive individuals while TTCA-positive subjects gave higher MED values (mean value 67. 5 mJ cm- 2, p< 0. 001). Overall, these results hint at pheomelanin marker quantitation, in combination with genetic analysis and photobiogical parameters, as potential means for routine prediction of high risk individuals. A possible association of oxidative stress conditions with pheomelanic pigmentation will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{radiation}} causes immunosuppression {{that contributes}} to skin cancer growth. Photoprotective strategies initially focused on the more <b>erythemogenic</b> ultraviolet B. More recently, the relationship of ultraviolet A and skin cancer has received increased attention. We hypothesized that if ultraviolet A contributes significantly to human ultraviolet-induced immune suppression, then increased ultraviolet A filtration by a sunscreen would better protect the immune system during ultraviolet exposure. Two hundred and eleven volunteers were randomized into study groups and received solar-simulated radiation, ranging from 0 to 2 minimum erythema dose, on gluteal skin, with or without sunscreen, 48 h prior to sensitization with dinitrochlorobenzene. Contact hypersensitivity response was evaluated by measuring the increase in skin fold thickness of five graded dinitrochlorobenzene challenge sites on the arm, 2 wk after sensitization. Clinical scoring using the North American Contact Dermatitis Group method was also performed. Solar-simulated radiation dose–response curves were generated and immune protection factor was calculated using a nonlinear regression model. Significance of immune protection between study groups was determined with the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon exact test. The sunscreen with high ultraviolet A absorption (ultraviolet A protection factor of 10, based on the in vivo persistent pigment darkening method) and a labeled sun protection factor of 15 demonstrated better immune protection than the product that had a low ultraviolet A absorption (ultraviolet A protection factor of 2) and a labeled sun protection factor of 15. Nonlinear regression analysis based on skin fold thickness increase revealed that the high ultraviolet A protection factor sunscreen had an immune protection factor of 50, {{more than three times}} its sun protection factor, whereas the low ultraviolet A protection factor sunscreen had an immune protection factor of 15, which was equal to its labeled sun protection factor. This study demonstrates that ultraviolet A contributes greatly to human immune suppression and that a broad-spectrum sunscreen with high ultraviolet A filtering capacity results in immune protection that exceeds erythema protection. These results show that high ultraviolet A protection is required to protect against ultraviolet-induced damage to cutaneous immunity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhole-body UV-B {{phototherapy}} {{has been}} used for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and has systemic immunosuppressive and tolerogenic effects. We hypothesized that whole-body UV-B therapy would improve donor engraftment and decrease the incidence and severity of GVHD that is associated with decreased intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This study tested the feasibility of using UV-B phototherapy that was initiated before grafting and continued until engraftment to determine its effect on transplantation outcome. Eight patients (median age, 55. 5 years; range, 32 - 65 years) with hematologic malignancies were included. Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells were obtained from matched related (n = 5) or matched unrelated (n = 3) donors. Conditioning regimen was fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 intravenously for 5 days, cyclophosphamide 1 g/m 2 /d intravenously for 2 days, and equine antithymocyte globulin 30 mg/kg/d for 2 days. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine, methylprednisolone, and escalating doses of narrowband UV-B (311 nm) according to skin tolerance, 3 days a week, from 10 days before to 28 days after transplantation. The conditioning regimen and the UV-B therapy were well tolerated. Two patients received all 14 prescribed UV-B treatments (cumulative doses of 2000 and 3260 mJ/cm 2, respectively) and 6 patients received 8 to 13 treatments with a cumulative dose range of 528 - 3465 mJ/cm 2. There was a rapid decrease in epidermal CD 1 a+ cells by day of transplantation. Myeloid engraftment was rapid. One patient had secondary engraftment failure at 3 months and another had mixed chimerism at day 100. Seven of 8 patients developed severe acute GVHD (grade III, n = 5; grade IV, n = 2). Six had skin involvement, 5 had gastrointestinal involvement, and 1 had liver involvement. Four patients died (2 from sepsis, 1 from acute GVHD, and 1 from chronic GVHD). Four patients are alive (130 - 287 days), 3 with extensive chronic GVHD. We conclude that extended peritransplant UV-B therapy at the standard minimally <b>erythemogenic</b> dose is detrimental to the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It is unclear how UV-B at this immunsuppressive dose might have altered skin and systemic cytokine and immune cell compositions in the host and increased GVHD- and treatment-related mortalities. Different UV-B dose and schedules should be further explored. However, although other phototherapeutic modalities may be effective against GVHD, extended UV-B therapy should not be used during early phases of decreased conditioning allogeneic transplantation...|$|E
