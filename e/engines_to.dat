5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|Deeper (average: 3m) {{and much}} wider (av. 10m) {{perimeter}} ditches (fossae). These would have flat floors {{rather than the}} traditional V-shape. Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other <b>engines)</b> <b>to</b> the walls. It would also concentrate attackers in an enclosed area where they would be exposed to missile fire from the walls.|$|E
5|$|For 1966, {{the engine}} {{capacity}} limit in Formula One was doubled from 1.5litres (92cuin) to 3litres (183cuin). It was not feasible to enlarge existing 1.5-litre <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> {{take full advantage}} of the higher limit and Climax chose not to develop a new 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966.|$|E

5|$|Study of {{the wreck}} {{also showed that}} {{restarting}} the <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was then lost, {{it was impossible to}} prevent the ship from sinking — her fate was more the result of design flaws than of the actions of her captain.|$|E
5|$|The two battleships of the Nevada-class were {{virtually}} identical except in their propulsion. Nevada {{and her sister}} were fitted with different <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> compare the two, putting them 'head-to-head': Oklahoma received older vertical triple expansion engines, which had proven more fuel-efficient and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships, while Nevada received geared Curtis steam turbines.|$|E
5|$|After {{launching}} the -200 with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7 engines, on August1, 1972 Boeing {{announced that it}} had reached an agreement with General Electric to certify the 747 with CF6-50 series <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> increase the aircraft's market potential. Rolls-Royce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from British Airways for four aircraft. The option of RB211-524B engines was announced on June 17, 1975. The -200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of an {{unforeseen}} surge in ridership, the NYCEDC and Hornblower announced in July 2017 that three of the twenty vessels would be reconfigured into 250-passenger boats. These boats would have bigger <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the additional passengers. In September 2017, the NYCEDC ordered three new 350-passenger boats for NYC Ferry service to supplement the 20 original boats. Metal Shark would build the new boats for $7 million to $7.5 million each.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} The Argentine, Soderbergh depicts Guevara's {{derailment}} of {{a freight}} train during the Battle of Santa Clara. In filming the sequence, Soderbergh balked at the digital effects solution and managed to reallocate $500,000 from the overall $58 million budget to build a real set of tracks and a train powered by two V-8 car <b>engines.</b> <b>To</b> film the scene, they had six rehearsals, and could only shoot the scene once.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{successful}} contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design {{evolved from a}} straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become {{commonly referred to as}} the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker).|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Providence {{was one of}} the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest {{industrial}} manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products from steam <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of the Loom textile company.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three <b>engines,</b> <b>to</b> compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|Further {{possible}} {{development work}} on the R engine was discussed in The National Archives' file AVIA 13/122, which contains a proposal from the Royal Aircraft Establishment dated October and November 1932, to test four <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> destruction. This document states that there were five engines available for test purposes, the fifth {{to be used for}} a standard Type Test at high revolutions.|$|E

5000|$|... ==History== Archimedes is {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} first marine engineer, having developed a number of marine engineering systems in antiquity. Modern marine engineering {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Industrial Revolution (early 1700s). In 1712 Thomas Newcomen, a blacksmith, created a steam powered <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> pump water out of mines. In 1807 Robert Fulton successfully used a steam <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> propel a vessel through the water. Fulton's ship used the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> power a small wooden paddle wheel as its propulsion system. The integration of steam engines into ships was the start of the marine engineering profession.|$|R
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> be shut down. The explosion {{was caused by}} failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1995, Boeing {{delivered}} {{the first model}} with General Electric GE90-77B <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> British Airways, which entered service five days later.

5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached.

The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
