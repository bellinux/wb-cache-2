500|$|Entering 2008, Baseball America ranked Davis {{the number}} two {{prospect}} in the Rangers' organization, behind Elvis Andrus. Davis began the season playing first base for Frisco. He batted [...]333 with 62 hits, 13 home runs, and 42 RBI in 46 games before earning a promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League. In 31 games with Oklahoma, he hit [...]333 with 37 hits, 10 home runs, and 31 RBI. He {{was named to the}} All-Star Futures Game but was unable to play in it because he was promoted to the major leagues by the Texas Rangers. Later, during his breakout 2013 season, Davis referred to his time with Round Rock in 2008: [...] "I know nobody really cares about Triple-A, but <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> these numbers up in Triple-A. That was kind of the question, 'Was he {{going to be able to}} do it at the big league level?' The thing about it was, I just couldn't do it consistently. I couldn't put the bat on the ball. I was striking out an astronomical amount, and this year it's just been consistency day in and day out." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} said that each islander (or his family) had a jumper {{with a unique}} design, so that if he drowned and was found, maybe weeks later, on the beach, his body could be identified. This misconception may have originated with John Millington Synge's 1904 play Riders to the Sea, in which {{the body of a}} dead Islander is identified by his hand-knitted socks. However, even in the play, there is no reference to any decorative or Aran-type pattern. The socks are identified by the number of stitches, the quote being [...] "it's the second one of the third pair I knitted, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> three score stitches, and I dropped four of them".|$|E
60|$|Lov. And {{though for}} this time <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up,</b> because I am a winner-- [Snatches the gold.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are," [...] said he; [...] "this is {{the place}} w'ere <b>I</b> <b>puts</b> <b>up</b> w'en I'm ashore--w'ich ain't often--that's a fact. After you, sir." ...|$|R
60|$|A Radical!!! <b>I</b> could <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with a {{good deal}} of provocation, but, after holding the soundest Conservative {{principles}} all my life, <b>I</b> could NOT <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with being called a Radical. My blood boiled at it--I started out of my chair--I was speechless with Indignation.|$|R
60|$|FEEMY. <b>I</b> aint <b>put</b> <b>up</b> {{no story}} on you. This is a plant: you {{see if it}} isnt.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> {{the note}} in my pocket-book. I slipped the five-franc pieces into my purse--then I {{took a turn}} through my narrow chamber.|$|E
60|$|HARRY. That's {{the only}} reason <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with her. She gives me the creeps. I have the {{impression}} that she watches every movement I make.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{the nature}} of it. After that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> some signs, for the {{protection}} of future committees, and we have had no intruders since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if {{that goes}} for anything. <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a hundred-pound bar till further orders; but what sort of a calling is that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot do that, sir. It {{would be}} {{giving up the}} command of the brigantine, and <b>I</b> would <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with {{anything}} rather than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At the stables, Miss, while <b>I</b> was <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> the horse. The men about {{were all}} on the broad grin when they heard Mr. Arthur's message." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{became aware}} of a dull ache {{on the right side}} of my head. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> my hand, and withdrew it moist. She saw the action.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear me!" [...] she interrupted. [...] "Very well! You {{really are}} a most trying person, you know. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> {{with a great deal}} from you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll do my best, ma'am, and I can't say no more. And if you scolds me afterwards, ma'am,--why, of course, <b>I</b> must <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Howsomever, 'twas <b>I</b> <b>put</b> her <b>up</b> to it! 'Nothing venture nothing have,' I said. If I hadn't she'd no {{more have}} been his mis'ess than I." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe it. Of {{course the}} Marquis is ill, and I could bear much from him. But <b>I</b> won't <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with it from Lord Hampstead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, forgive!" [...] I pleaded. And getting {{no answer}} <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> {{my hands to}} take hers. [...] "Mother!" [...] I cried, and the tears were {{streaming}} down my face.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. The nearest {{place is}} a little hut that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> at {{this end of the}} island several years ago. It isn't very much of a shelter, but it might do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who to?" [...] ses {{one of the}} draymen, {{sticking}} {{his face}} into mine. [...] "You go ’ome to your wife and kids. Go on now, afore <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> my ’ands to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty {{close to}} it. And now about this present scrape, Mr. Hall. <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a nasty fight. What {{are you going}} to do about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Pudd'nhead, I'm {{bound to}} say <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it <b>up</b> the way Tom does. They hadn't the knife; {{or if they}} had it, they've got it yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|CASHEL. [...] Yes, I am. [...] <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with much; but--"Nature's gentleman"! [...] I thank your ladyship of Lyons, but [...] Must beg to be excused.|$|R
6000|$|Now indeed all was over, {{for when}} it saw blood upon that cloth----! <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> one short, piteous prayer to Heaven {{to save me}} from this terrible end, and lo, it was answered! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> {{the tiller}} and eased the sheet, and the salmon boat ran off {{five or six}} points. Big Alec watched us till {{we were out of}} range, when he {{returned}} to his work.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I took a {{drink that}} braced me up and soon {{afterwards}} thought I saw my chance. The cards looked pretty good, and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a big bluff and piled on all I had." ...|$|E

6000|$|... [Defiantly.] He'd {{better not}} start patronising me, because <b>I</b> won't <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with it. I'm a gentleman, and I'm {{every bit as}} good as he is--if not better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you see why}} me an' Mary don't get married," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{some big}} Indian myself, an' I'll be everlastingly jiggerooed if <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> for a wigwam I can't be boss of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Master George, I am {{not going}} to bear {{correction}} from you," [...] said Hampstead, [...] "though <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with it from your elders. Miss Fay, when you were at school did they talk slang?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{makes me}} angry {{to be called}} a little girl when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> my hair a year ago, and Uncle Abimelech knows it. I gave up arguing with him. I knew it was no use anyway.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{expectation}} or design," [...] Hallett grumbled, [...] "but {{it seems}} to amuse you. However, I suppose <b>I</b> must <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with it, till the end." ...|$|R
