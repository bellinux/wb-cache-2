30|$|STORM imaging was {{performed}} on a custom setup built around a Nikon TiU inverted microscope (Huang et al. 2008; Bates et al. 2007). Illumination of the Alexa- 647 dye was provided by a 300 [*]mW 656 [*]nm solid state laser (Crystalaser, CL 656 - 300). The 656 [*]nm laser light excites fluorescence from Alexa 647 and switches the dye off rapidly. The same light also reactivates Alexa 647 back to the fluorescent state, but at a very low rate such {{that only a small}} fraction of the dye molecules (~ 0.1 %) emit fluorescence at any given instant. When necessary, a 50 [*]mW 405 [*]nm diode laser (Coherent, Cube- 405) was used to increase the dye activation rate (Dempsey et al. 2011). The output of the lasers was combined and coupled into a single mode photonic fiber (NKT Photonics, LMA- 8) for transmission to the STORM microscope. Light from the fiber was collimated and focused on the back-focal plane of the microscope objective. The illumination was adjusted from epi-flourescence to total internal reflection by translating the illumination beam across the back-focal plane of the objective. Imaging {{was performed}} with a 100 x oil immersion objective (Nikon, Plan Apo λ, 1.45 NA). The laser intensities at the sample were ~ 1 [*]kW/cm 2 for the 656 [*]nm laser light and ~ 20 [*]W/cm 2 for the 405 [*]nm laser light. The fluorescence signal was recorded with an EMCCD camera (Andor, DU- 897). For 3 D STORM images, a 1 [*]m focal length cylindrical lens was added to the optical path to provide astigmatism, such that the PSF of individual emitters appear elliptical with ellipticity depending on the z position of the emitter (Huang et al. 2008). In addition the setup had an infrared <b>focus</b> <b>lock</b> system that was used to stabilize the distance between the microscope objective and the sample (Huang et al. 2008).|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} in vivo imaging {{is to remove}} movement artifacts. These movements (typically due to either respiration and cardiac-related movement or surface chemical response) are normally limited to the axial direction, and hence features {{move in and out}} of the focal plane. This presents a real problem for high resolution optically sectioned imaging techniques such as confocal and multiphoton microscopy. To overcome this we have developed an actively locked focus-tracking system based around a deformable membrane mirror. This has a significant advantage over more conventional focus-tracking techniques where the microscope objective is dithered, since the active element is not in direct, or indirect, contact with the sample. To examine the operational limits and to demonstrate possible applications for this form of <b>focus</b> <b>locking,</b> sample oscillation and movement are simulated for two different biological applications.

The Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) model is a recent case management approach that substantially influences OMG’s emerging Case Man-agement Modeling Notation standard.

One element of the framework focuses on restructuring the GSM schema to facilitate outsourcing while preserving the semantics of the original schema; the second <b>focuses</b> on <b>locking</b> protocols that define how the distributed parties should operate. Additionally, the framework allows parties to keep local parts of their GSM subschema private without affect-ing the outcomes of the global execution. The rules restructuring developed here enables a crisp separation of concerns, which allows reuse of existing GSM (and thus Case Management) engines for executing the subschemas. ...|$|R
40|$|The present chapter <b>focuses</b> on <b>locks</b> {{and their}} impact on (inland) waterbound logistics. Examples of lock systems are given, and the main {{characteristics}} of the serial lock scheduling problem discussed. Locks are often scheduled manually and, despite constituting a complex combinatorial problem, academia has given little attention to optimizing lock operations. Two measures can be suggested to considerably improve the competitiveness of inland waterway transportation within the supply chain: increasing the scheduling horizon of locks and treating series of locks as a single system, instead of operating them individually. A decision support system for the ship placement problem is introduced. The system is analysed both from the algorithmic and operational side, and some implementation difficulties are highlighted. Transferring ships through a series of locks based on their requested time of arrival at a destination, has potential to generate a green wave for waterbound logistics. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{multi-core}} processors provide primitives {{to allow}} parallel programs to atomically perform selected operations.

We <b>focus</b> on <b>locks,</b> the most widespread mechanism, and on transactional memories, {{one of the most promising}} alternatives. The results come from an extensive experimental campaign based upon simulation of the considered systems. We show that locks prove to be a more robust synchronization primitive, because their vulnerable section is smaller. On the other hand, transactional memory is more likely to yield an observable wrong behaviour in the case of a fault, and this could be used to detect and correct the error. We also show that implementing locks on top of transactional memory increases its robustness, but without getting on par with that offered by locks...|$|R
