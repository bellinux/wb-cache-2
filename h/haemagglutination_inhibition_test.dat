40|$|Although the {{haemagglutination}} inhibition assay {{is considered the}} "gold standard" for antigenic characterisation of influenza viruses, some limitations of this technique are well known. A new microneutralisation assay, {{as a tool for}} antigenic characterisation of influenza B viruses, has been standardised and its performance evaluated in comparison with the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> in the light of molecular characterisation of the haemagglutinin. Twelve B viruses belonging to the two lineages and the four sub-lineages discriminated by phylogenetic analysis of HA were tested. The microneutralisation assay clearly distinguishes viruses belonging to different lineages and, in addition, discriminates strains belonging to different sub-lineages that are poorly or not discriminated using the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> This new microneutralisation assay could provide a useful tool for antigenic characterisation of circulating influenza viruses and contribute, together with the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> and sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, in the choice of the strain for use in vaccine composition...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the removal of non-specific inhibitors of rabies virus haemagglutinin by treatment with colloidal silicic acid, which was proposed in an earlier study, was examined {{in a number of}} test samples. The non-specific inhibitors were removed in 289 out of 296 normal human sera (97. 6 %) by this treatment to a level that was undetectable at the 1 : 4 starting dilution in the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> Antigenic differences among three strains of rabies virus were detected in the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> and the antibody titres to the homologous antigens were apparently higher than those to heterologous antigens...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{of the relationship}} between the passive <b>haemagglutination</b> and <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> used in serum surveys for specific plague antibodies. Both techniques gave similar titres for sera of albino Rattus norvegicus convalescent from plague infection. They appear to be equally suitable for plague surveillance and control programmes...|$|R
40|$|Over 500 human sera {{were tested}} by {{complement}} fixation and <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> for antibody {{to the human}} polyomavirus (B. K.). Both tests showed that antibody to this virus was very common in the population and began to be acquired {{after the age of}} 1 year. No clinical illness has so far been associated with the development of this antibody in a series of paired sera from children...|$|R
40|$|Three field {{strains of}} Newcastle Disease virus, {{designated}} S 20, S 21 and S 23, isolated from chickens or turkeys in Ontario during the 1971 - 72 epizootic, were characterized as velogenic viscerotropic viruses. No significant antigenic differences were demonstrated among B 1, LaSota and a field strain (S 23) of velogenic vescerotropic virus by <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> or protection <b>tests.</b> Primary water vaccination of chicks with commercial B 1 and LaSota vaccines at {{five weeks of}} age and aerosol revaccination with the same strains four weeks later resulted in protection that lasted 16 weeks after revaccination against experimental challenge with strain S 23. The differences in <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> titres noted when the homologous or the heterologous viruses were used as haemagglutinating antigen were not statistically significant. The rates of decay of virus neutralizing and <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> antibodies in vaccinated birds showed a divergence indicating the possible duality of antibodies measured in serum neutralization and <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{quantitative}} estimations of {{tetanus toxoid}} by different {{methods have been}} made. The in vivo total combining power test is considered likely to give a true assessment of the combination of toxoid with antitoxin since {{it is based on}} the biological action of toxin. The <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> has been found to give good agreement with the in vivo test and it is cheap, sensitive and readily repeatable. Since the <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> can be performed with toxin or toxoid by the same method, it is possible to relate the quantitative estimation of toxoid to the L+ dose of a routine test toxin, and thus to a standard antitoxin, which is convenient...|$|E
40|$|The {{indirect}} haemagglutination test {{has been developed}} for use with LCM and Tacaribe viruses employing antibody-sensitized erythrocytes. Both in this test and in the indirect <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> cross-reactions between LCM and Tacaribe viruses were revealed.

40|$|<b>Haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> {{are easy}} to perform and easy to read. The results are {{reproducible}} and {{are not subject to}} the vagaries of supply and temperament inherent in tests using living creatures. In a series of tests with Prepuerin done in parallel with the Hogben test the former has shown a higher sensitivity. There have been three false positive results with Prepuerin tests in the series but it was not established on general grounds that pregnancy was not in fact present...|$|R
50|$|Blue {{eye disease}} {{outbreaks}} can happen {{throughout the year}} but are most common during spring and summer months of April to July. The mortality rate usually rises and falls and between a two- to nine-week time frame. After the epidemic subsides, no more cases occur unless new susceptible pigs are introduced into the farm. In severe outbreaks of the disease a presumptive diagnosis can be made. Serological testing via virus neutralization and <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>testing</b> can be performed to diagnose the disease. Virus isolation from tissue samples is also possible.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 360 trachea, kidneys and serum samples were {{collected}} from 21 broiler poultry farms having no history of vaccination against infectious bronchitis (IB). The agar gel precipitation and trypsin induced <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> revealed 2. 22 % seroprevalence of IB. Data analysis revealed significantly (P< 0. 031) higher IB seroprevalence in 1 - 2 weeks old broilers (5. 36 %), while the lowest prevalence {{was found in the}} older birds. After purification, IB virus was analyzed for polypeptides applying SDS-PAGE. The indigenous IB virus consisted of six major polypeptides with molecular weights of 84, 51...|$|R

40|$|Sulphoglycoproteins, {{isolated}} from human gastric juice, were observed to possess blood group activity, compatible with hosts' blood group in eighteen normal subjects and in nine patients with atrophic gastritis. The activities were of comparable magnitude with neutral glycoproteins of gastric juice as measured with <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> The content of neutral glycoproteins is, however, about ten {{times that of}} sulphoglycoproteins and, it was thought, {{this would be the}} reason why the latter had been previously overlooked...|$|E
40|$|Immunosuppression was {{observed}} with dehydroheliotridine (DHH), a recently isolated and identified metabolite of certain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The primary response to sheep {{red blood cells}} (SRBC) and to influenza virus vaccine (IVV) was significantly depressed. The secondary response to SRBC was suppressed only if the DHH was given {{at the time of}} the secondary stimulus. DHH is active when given before or with the antigen but not when given 6 or 24 hours after the antigen. There was some evidence that the withdrawal of blood for <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> derepressed the immunological response of DHH treated mice...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{inconsistencies in}} rubella haemagglutinin assays {{the components of}} the assay technique were examined. The results of carefully controlled assays of rubella haemagglutinin antigens from different sources in various plates and diluents with four species of indicator cells are reported. The quality and quantity of gelatin in the dextrose-gelatin-veronal buffered diluent commonly used in rubella haemagglutinin assays {{had a profound effect on}} the haemagglutination pattern and antigen titre. The veronal buffered saline used in the complement fixation test offered a valid alternative to the more complex diluents incorporating gelatin currently used in rubella haemagglutinin assays and <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Influenza equine (Heq 2 Neq 2) strains {{isolated}} {{during the}} course of epizootics observed in Guanabara (Rio de Janeiro) and São Paulo, Brazil, in July—October 1969 were shown to differ antigenically from earlier strains of the same subtype (A/equine/Miami/ 1 / 63 (Heq 2 Neq 2)). The difference could be clearly demonstrated in <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> performed with postinfection horse or ferret sera but not with hyperimmune rooster sera. Antibody responses of diseased horses were higher and more frequent against current isolates than against strain equine/Miami/ 1 / 63.

40|$|Span 20 -based niosome was {{prepared}} by lipid film hydration technique and loaded with Newcastle disease vaccine. Three batches with Span 20, cholesterol and dicetyl phosphate in micro molar ratios of 10 : 10 : 1; 15 : 15 : 1 and 20 : 20 : 1 were prepared and evaluated for encapsulation efficiency using haemagglutination test. The morphology of the vesicles was studied {{by means of}} transmission electron microscopy. Particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy using a nanosizer. Adjuvanticity was assessed using <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> The vesicles of Span 20 -based niosomes were distinct, near spherical large unilamellar vesicles. The vesicles were of varied sizes (< 1000 nm) with the entrapped Newcastle disease vaccine {{in the core of}} the vaccine. The zeta potential had a peak at - 50 mV. The polydispersity index was 0. 68. <b>Haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> showed a 71 % increment in immune response over that of the marketed La Sota® vaccine which had a 60 % increment in immune response.

Tests of 707 serum samples showed that the modified test was sensitive and reliable by both macrotitration and microtitration techniques. The minor disadvantages of some reduction in antibody level when rubella sera were tested within one week of the rash and of spontaneous sheep erythrocyte agglutination in 0 - 7 % of sera were out-weighed by the increased speed of the new test {{and the fact that}} it was carried out at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|A {{woman who}} had had high titres of rubella {{antibodies}} some months before she became pregnant gave birth to an infant in whom congenital rubella was confirmed at 4 months. Rubella <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests,</b> complement fixation tests, and immunofluorescence tests with anti-human IgG were carried out on sera from the mother. Rubella antibody titres in sera obtained in March 1971, {{seven and a half}} months before conception, were equivalent to 400 units, which is usually taken as indicating good immunity. Rubella virus was isolated from the baby's nose and throat in July 1973 but was not isolated from a cervical swab taken from the mother in December 1973; tests of her immunological competence did not show any definite abnormality. The presence of high levels of rubella <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> antibodies does not invariably confer immunity or exclude the possibility of congenital rubella in a subsequent pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{separate}} the antigenic and mitogenic properties of E. coli bacteria and bacterial lipopolysaccharide antigen inhibited the mitogenic response by the cultures but did not inhibit the induction of anti-LPS antibody or polyclonal antibody synthesis to SRBC. Dextran sulphate, acting as a B-cell mitogen, increased the mitogenic response in spleen cell cultures incubated with bacteria, but did not affect the production of anti-LPS antibody. Mild alkaline hydrolysis (0 - 1 N NaOH at 56 degrees) of LPS destroyed the mitogenic properties of the molecule, leaving the antigenic properties qualitatively intact. Harsher conditions of base hydrolysis destroyed both the mitogenic and antigenic properties of LPS, as determined by antigenicity in murine spleen cell cultures and <b>haemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
