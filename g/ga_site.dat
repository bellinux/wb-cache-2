40|$|The {{conversion}} of light alkanes to high value aroms. proceeds {{with a high}} selectivity over bifunctional, gallium (Ga) contg. zeolite catalysts. It is generally agreed that <b>Ga</b> <b>sites</b> are involved in dehydrogenation reaction steps and that the zeolite acid sites catalyze cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization reactions. However, understanding of the precise roles of the acid and <b>Ga</b> <b>sites</b> in the reaction mechanisms is significantly hampered since the no. of these sites in working catalysts is not known. This paper describes a kinetic approach to evaluation of the acid and <b>Ga</b> active <b>sites</b> in working <b>Ga</b> contg.

Our {{results show that the}} rate of ethane formation at low n-butane conversions {{can be used as a}} quant. est. of acidity in working bifunctional zeolite catalysts and demonstrate, for the first time, a significant decrease in the no. of Bronsted acid <b>sites</b> in the <b>Ga</b> contg. catalysts under reaction conditions: around 47 and 79 % for the catalysts with Ga loading of 1. 5 and 2. 5 wt. %, resp.

Valence-band anisotropy, band mixing, and effects due to local strain distribution at the atomistic level are all taken into account. Several structure models with varying degrees of alloy mixing for lateral modulation are considered. A valence force field model is used to find the equilibrium atomic positions in the QWR structure by minimizing the lattice energy. The strain tensor at each atomic (In or <b>Ga)</b> <b>site</b> is then obtained and included in the calculation of electronic states and optical properties. It is found that different local arrangement of atoms leads to very different strain distribution, which in turn alters the optical properties.

The results for an isolated Mn impurity on a <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> {{show that there}} is no appreciable effect in GaAs, whereas, in GaN there is a Jahn-Teller effect in which the symmetry around the impurity changes from T$_{d}$ to D$_{ 2 d}$ or to C$_{ 2 v}$. The large effect in GaN occurs because of the localized d$^ 4 $ character, which is further enhanced by the distortion. The lower symmetry should be detectable experimentally in cubic GaN with low Mn concentration, and should be affected by charge compensation (reductions of holes and conversion of Mn ions to d$^ 5 $ with no Jahn-Teller effect). Jahn-Teller effect is greatly reduced because the symmetry at each Mn site is lowered due to the Mn-Mn interaction. The tendency toward ferromagnetism is found to be stronger in GaN:Mn than in GaAs:Mn and to be only slightly reduced by charge compensation. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

Large resonant signals of magnetic dipole character are observed below the Neel temperatures at both edges. The signals at the Np edges confirm the behaviour determined previously from neutron diffraction, i. e. the moments along [001] in NpCoGa_{ 5 } and in NpRhGa_ 5 a reorientation of the moments from the c-axis direction to the ab plane.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{resonance}} of Raman scattering by Si local vibrational modes (LVM's) in heavily doped GaAs prepared by ion implantation and rapid thermal annealing. For photon energies (1. 9 - 2. 7 eV) approaching the E 1 energy gap, similar resonance behavior was found for scattering by the Si on As site (Si sub As) LVM and by the longitudinal-optical phonon. Compared with undoped GaAs, both resonances are reduced in peak height and are broadened. This can be understood {{on the basis of}} a lowering and broadening of the (E 1,E 1 +Delta 1) gap resonance due to residual implantation damage and due to the high dopant concentration. Scattering by the Si on <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> (Si sub Ga) LVM, in contrast, shows no resonance enhancement for the above range of photon energies. However, excitation at 3. 00 eV, which is almost in resonance with the E 1 gap energy, also enhances scattering by the Si sub Ga LVM, indicating a rather narrow E 1 gap resonance for that LVM.
