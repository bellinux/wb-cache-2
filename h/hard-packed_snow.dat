2500|$|Lt. Arnett {{and crew}} {{had survived the}} crash landing without {{sustaining}} any injuries. They had landed on a small frozen lake in Northern Greenland which was covered with 2–10inches of <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow.</b> [...] A later debriefing of the crew indicated that the aircraft had reached the Pole, then made a 70 degree turn to the southeast, then a 120 degree turn to the southwest. [...] The pilot became disoriented over the polar icepack just north of 85 degrees north latitude, then began to fly to the south, then east until turning west over northern Greenland where an emergency landing was successfully made.

60|$|By {{the time}} they reached the foot of the hill and were fairly in Dawson, lights were {{springing}} up in the cabins, doors were slamming, and from behind came the sound of many moccasins on the <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow.</b> Again Shorty delivered himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll mighty soon see," [...] said Milton, as {{he wound}} the lines around {{his hands and}} braced his feet, giving a low whistle, which seemed to run through the colt's blood like fire. His stride did not {{increase}} in rate, but its reach grew majestic as he seemed to lengthen and lower. His broad feet flung great disks of <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> over the dasher, and under the clash of his bells {{the noise of the}} other team grew plainer.|$|E
60|$|Thornton's command cracked {{out like}} a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself forward, {{tightening}} the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great chest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet were flying like mad, the claws scarring the <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> in parallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward. One of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it never really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two inches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained momentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.|$|E
6000|$|The Eldorado emptied its {{occupants}} {{into the}} street to see the test. The tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see {{the outcome of the}} wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred and mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson's sled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a couple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the runners had frozen fast to the <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow.</b> Men offered odds of two to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose concerning the phrase [...] "break out." [...] O'Brien contended it was Thornton's privilege to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to [...] "break it out" [...] from a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor, whereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.|$|E

5000|$|Mountain {{walking or}} hiking boots are {{designed}} for mountain and hill walking, backpacking and mountaineering. Crampons can be attached to them for a better grip on glaciers or <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow.</b> They are extremely strong, durable, and have stiff soles to give the ankles support and protection on difficult rocky trails. Mountaineering boots are usually taller and stiffer than hiking boots, providing insulation as well as support and protection.|$|E
50|$|With the {{assumption}} of the support mission from the Navy, the 109th established an operating location at Christchurch and a forward location at Williams Field, on the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. Williams Field consists of two <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> runways located on approximately 8 meters (25 ft) of compacted snow, lying on top of 80 meters (262 ft) of ice, floating over 550 meters (1,800 ft) of water. Williams provides support to the United States McMurdo Station and New Zealand’s Scott Base. During October 1999 the 109th AW aided in the rescue of Dr. Jerri Nielsen, a doctor with breast cancer symptoms and based at isolated Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica.|$|E

5000|$|Snow tires—also called winter tires—are tires {{designed}} for use on snow and ice. Snow tires have a tread design with bigger gaps than those on summer tires, increasing traction on snow and ice. Such tires that have passed a specific winter traction performance test are entitled to display a [...] "Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake" [...] symbol on their sidewalls. Tires {{designed for}} winter conditions are optimized to drive at temperatures below [...] Some snow tires have metal or ceramic studs that protrude from the tire to increase traction on <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> or ice. Studs abrade dry pavement, causing dust and creating wear in the wheel path. Regulations that {{require the use of}} snow tires or permit the use of studs vary by country in Asia and Europe, and by state or province in North America.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main station}} was logistically {{supported}} by Thule Air Base, and personnel {{assigned to the}} Radar Station would transport {{to and from the}} base, weather permitting. Duty at the station consisted of an [...] "A" [...] and a [...] "B" [...] shift of twelve hours each day, seven days a week. Personnel at the remote sites lived under the snow in metal structures connected by unheated hallways of steel corrugated tubes. When they did go outside it was through hatches in the ceilings to access auxiliary structures and the radar antennas. The locations of the stations, all north of the Arctic Circle, meant long periods without sunlight all day or with sunlight all day. The remote sites were supported by C-47 Skytrains equipped with skis, which would land on the <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> near the stations, providing logistical support and personnel transportation to and from Thule AB. Each remote site had a personnel complement of 20.|$|E
5000|$|... 2nd: The plow has a {{horizontal}} wedge to lift snow above {{the level of}} snow accumulation beside the track. A cutting edge low above the rails usually employed a cast iron or steel leading edge for durability against ice and for weight to discourage the tendency of the wedge to climb over <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> causing derailment by lifting the wheels off the rails. Under most conditions, the tendency to climb was reduced by weight {{of snow on the}} upper side of the wedge, and by downward reaction force accompanying upward acceleration of lifted snow. However, this downward snow loading may be absent when a plow first strikes a snow drift or packed snow face where the plow train has previously stalled. Before making a running start against such conditions, prudent crews would dig into the lower edge of the drift or snow face creating a notch to receive and guide {{the leading edge of the}} horizontal wedge.|$|E
40|$|The road {{condition}} model {{presented in}} this paper is a submodel in the Swedish winter maintenance management system, the Winter Model. The Winter Model will make it possible to asses the most important effects and their monetary value of changes in winter maintenance strategies and operations in Sweden. The effects are assessed for road users, road administrators, and the environment. The submodel road condition modelis {{the central part of the}} Winter Model. The road condition model will characterize the state of a winter in terms of a road condition description hour by hour. The road condition modelprovides input data for other models where different effects such as accident risk, travel time, fuel consumption, road management costs, and environmental effects are assessed. In the first stage we have developed a model that will describe how road conditions are affected by weather, maintenance measures taken, and traffic on two-lane rural roads with a width of 7 to 9 m and speed limit of 90 km/h. To a great extent, the basis for developing the road condition model will be data already collected from nine observation sites, during one or two winter seasons, with the purpose of developing another submodel of the Winter Model, the accessibility model. For several periods, data from these observation sites contain information hour by hour regarding weather, traffic flow, initial road condition, and maintenance measures taken. Also specified types of road condition development 9 ̆ 7 mainly connected with snowplowing and anti-icing treatment 9 ̆ 7 can be studied. Additional information has been collected in special field surveys from the winter of 20029 ̆ 62003. One survey covers the development of ruts down to the pavement in <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> or thick ice, caused by vehicles with studded tires. Also the mechanism for a wet or moist road to dry out has been studied. The road condition model will initially consist of the following nine submodels. The first five submodels are related to measures and the last four to traffic and weather: (a) anti-icing treatment, (b) snowplowing combined with anti-icing treatment, (c) snowplowing, (d) gritting, (e) grading, (f) rut development in <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> or thick ice, (g) condensation, (h) splashing from a wet road, and (i) drying of a moist road...|$|E
40|$|The Road Condition Model is {{the central}} part of the Winter Model. The reason for this is that it {{produces}} input data for most of the models that describe effects of different kinds, such as accident risks, travel times, fuel consumption and environmental impact. The road condition model supplies a condition assessment for a winter in the form of a road condition description on an hourly basis. According to the requirements of the client, the road condition model is confined to describing road conditions for two-lane roads with oncoming traffic in rural areas. At this stage, the model is also confined to describing road conditions in the traffic lane. No account is thus taken of hard shoulders, if any. The aim of the project is to develop a working prototype to the definite road condition model. The road condition model consists of the following sub models. The first five are related to maintenance measures taken and the last four to traffic and weather. 1. Anti-icing treatment. - 2. Snow ploughing combined with anti-icing treatment. - 3. Snow ploughing. - 4. Gritting. - 5. Grading. - 6. Rut development in <b>hard-packed</b> <b>snow</b> or thick ice. - 7. Condensation. - 8. Splashing from a wet road. - 9. Drying of a moist road...|$|E
