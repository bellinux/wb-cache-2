500|$|In {{eight of}} the nine ATP 1000 events, Raonic matched or {{improved}} on his career-best performance. This included his first ATP 1000 series final at the Canadian Open in August. During his third round victory over del Potro, Raonic was awarded a point even though his foot touched the net. He did not report his error to the umpire, and won the last nine points to close out the match. Raonic later admitted that he was wrong not to admit his error at the time: [...] "I {{made a mistake in}} {{the spur of the moment}} ... I'm disappointed with myself, how <b>I</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] After beating Ernests Gulbis in the quarterfinals, Raonic defeated compatriot Pospisil in the semifinals. The match against Pospisil was the first all-Canadian semifinal in an ATP 1000 tournament. In the final, he lost to Nadal in just 68 minutes. Following the tournament, Raonic was ranked No. 10, becoming the first Canadian player and the first player born in the 1990s to break into the top10.|$|E
500|$|... "Cruise Control", {{featuring}} reggae artist Damian Marley, {{is influenced}} by R and reggae, and finds her adapting to the genre by imitating Jamaican phrases, accents and styles of singing. [...] "I Stay in Love" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from the album. Written by Carey and Bryan-Michael Cox, is a mid-tempo [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that {{is influenced by}} pop and RB& music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though [...] "we said let go", and [...] "inside she knows it's over", she still [...] "stays in love with him". Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, [...] "Side Effects" [...] describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how {{she was young and}} naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read [...] "Keepin' me there, under your thumb / Cause you were scared that I'd become much / More than you could handle," [...] she confesses, and refers to herself as [...] "Shining like a chandelier / That decorated every room inside / The private hell we built / And <b>I</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> it / Like a kid I wished / I could fly away." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as [...] "another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola", and wrote [...] "Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past." [...] MTV News writer Jennifer Vineyard described the song in detail: ...|$|E
