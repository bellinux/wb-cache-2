40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Vehicles are {{expected}} to deliver adequate power for the engine size and vehicle class. They must also deliver good response to the driver’s desired action as well as deliver the lowest possible fuel consumption in all possible conditions and comply with emissions regulations. The combination of these factors is termed good driveability. Evaluating driveability is time and cost intensive and is most commonly evaluated from a subjective driver prospective. Advanced control systems allow for more accurate control of the vehicles response to the drivers demands. The objective of this document {{was to develop a}} quantitative driveability evaluation model for <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> calibration. The important aspects of <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>control</b> for driveability, as well as how they are manipulated to deliver acceptable driveability were identified. Test procedures were developed to measure and quantify all these important factors. The test procedures can be evaluated for their different sections or for a complete driveability evaluation method. An optimised driveability evaluation method was developed to reduce the driveability evaluation time. Verification of the driveability evaluation model did provide different results for a different <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> calibration...|$|R

40|$|The {{advantages}} {{arising from}} dc distribution networks {{are related to}} the possibilities of achieving higher quality supply and easier reconfigurability of the system. This paper presents the concept of introducing some dc islands interconnected with the ac distribution network. This will make it easier to connect storage systems, electrical drives, power converters, and renewable sources (i. e., photovoltaic panels). In order to realize the aforementioned goals, a methodology for designing the control strategy of different power converters connected to a dc bus without a centralized system <b>management</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> is proposed. In this way, a plug-and-play functionality for connecting new power converter interfaced elements in the dc network able to stabilize the voltage under different working conditions is realized. In order to prove the advantages obtainable with such a network, a 100 -kW dc test facility has been realized at the laboratories of RSE. Different working conditions were tested by means both of numerical and experimental results, proving the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for voltage regulation, continuity of service, and the smart use of storage devices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Since {{hydraulic}} hybrid vehicles are power dense {{and do not}} require costly batteries, they {{have the potential to}} achieve high fuel economy and performance and at low cost. The three main classes of {{hydraulic hybrid}} architectures are series, parallel and hydro-mechanical (HMT) or powersplit. These architectures have intrinsic differences in transmission efficiencies and effectiveness in <b>engine</b> <b>management.</b> This paper compares the fuel economies and performance of these architectures and validates these features. Using a Toyota Prius like engine and chassis as common factors, fuel economies are compared for the “optimal ” design for each architecture which considers both the physical designs and the engine/energy management. Physical design variables include pump/motor sizes and gear ratios. The effect of pump/motors efficiencies, extra gears and different engine efficiency maps are also studied. To improve computational efficiency in evaluating fuel economy, engine operation is restricted to several operating modes and the accumulator pressure is assumed to be constant. These simplifications enable the Lagrange multiplier method to be employed so as to quickly determine the optimal <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>control</b> and the resulting fuel economy for each design iteration. Full optimal control computations without the simplifying assumptions for the optimized design for each architecture (using dynamic programming) verify that, despite these simplification, the estimated fuel economies are close. It is shown that hybrid HMT offers the best fuel economy for various hydraulic efficiencies, followed by parallel and series architectures. However, the difference between HMT and parallel architectures diminishes if the engine has a wide efficient speed range of operation. It is also shown that an extra mechanical gear ratio can significantly increase fuel economy for all three architectures. I...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a novel {{resource}} allocation approach dedicated to hard real-time systems with distinctive operational modes is proposed. The {{aim of this}} approach is to reduce the energy dissipation of the computing cores by either powering them off or switching them into energy-saving states while still guaranteeing to meet all timing constraints. The approach is illustrated with two industrial applications, an <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>management</b> and an <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> Moreover, the amount of data to be migrated during the mode change is minimised. Since the number of processing cores and their energy dissipation are often negatively correlated with the amount of data to be migrated during the mode change, there is some trade-off between these values, which is also analysed in this paper.|$|R

30|$|Regarding the {{processing}} of financial statements, Enron applied the highly controversial Special Purpose Entities account in order {{to solve the problem}} of financing liabilities. However, the company did not have to list its increased financing liabilities in the balance sheet, which is known as off-balance sheet financing in accounting. The US Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (Beasley et al. 1999) and SAS No. 99, 2002 defined a fraudulent financial statement as either intentional or reckless conduct based on false information or omissions that results in significantly misleading financial reports. The cost of the prevention of fraudulent financial statements in the United States is estimated to be in the billions of dollars each year (Humpherys et al. 2011). The US Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) classifies fraud into six types: (1) providing false financial information; (2) misuse or misappropriation of corporate assets; (3) improper support or loans; (4) improperly acquiring assets or income; (5) improper circumvention of costs or fees; and (6) improper manipulation of financing by executives or board members. The Taiwan Accounting Research and Development Foundation released the Auditing Standards No. 43 communiqué in 2006, in which fraud was defined as the <b>management,</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> or one or more employees deliberately using deception and other methods to acquire improper or illegal benefits. Therefore, it could be concluded that the four elements of fraud are: (1) serious erroneous expressions of the nature of transactions, (2) knowingly violating rules, (3) the victim accepting a misstatement as fact; and (4) damage due to financial losses caused by the above three situations. Misstatement fraud relating to financial statement auditing includes financial report fraud and misappropriation of assets. Financial reporting fraud refers to untrue financial statements which aim to deceive users. The US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) state that financial statements should “provide a comprehensive overview of the company’s business and financial condition and include audited financial statements”.|$|R
