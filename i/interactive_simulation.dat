It is mainly {{used as an}} earth-science teaching museum for local schools and natural-science interest groups in southern Ontario. The main exhibits cover the Great Lakes, rocks and minerals, dinosaurs and ice age mammals. The museum's dinosaur exhibit includes a complete cast of an Albertosaurus. The museum also houses an <b>interactive,</b> <b>simulation</b> mining tunnel which aims to teach sustainable mining practices. Also {{owned and operated by}} the university is the Museum of Vision Science, which is at the university's School of Optometry building. The university had previously operated the Elliott Avedon Museum and Archive of Games, created by the Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies and previously managed by the university's Faculty of Applied Health Sciences. Due to a lack of specific academic interest, in 2009, {{the decision was made to}} close the museum and transfer the collection elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|Simulations {{demonstrate}} that a suitable [...] "nearest neighbour rule" [...] eventually results {{in all the}} particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, {{even though there is}} no centralized coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time (see the <b>interactive</b> <b>simulation</b> in the box on the right). SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals in the swarm. Swarming systems give rise to emergent behaviours which occur at many different scales, some of which are turning out to be both universal and robust. It has become a challenge in theoretical physics to find minimal statistical models that capture these behaviours.|$|E

In 1981 he adapted his visual flight simulator to run over the ARPANet, the first application of packet switching networks to real-time applications. In 1993, he worked on Distributed <b>Interactive</b> <b>Simulation</b> through several projects funded by United States Department of Defense.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} Ethiopian physics undergraduate students’ conceptual change in the concepts of electric potential and energy (EPE) and electromagnetic induction (EMI). A quasi-experimental design was used to study the effect of cognitive perturbation using physics <b>interactive</b> <b>simulations</b> (CPS) in relation to cognitive conflict using physics <b>interactive</b> <b>simulations</b> (CCS). Data was collected by using the modified Diagnostic Exam of Electricity and Magnetism (DEEM). ANCOVA was conducted on the scores of 45 students on the modified DEEM test to compare the effectiveness of the CCS and CPS. The results showed a significant difference between the two classes of the post test scores on the DEEM test, (1, 36) = 4. 66, p= 0. 04, partial eta squared= 0. 12. Consequently, it was concluded that there is a statistically significant difference between CPS and CCS in changing students’ alternative conceptions towards scientific conceptions favoring CPS. Medium practical difference between the two classes was estimated by the partial eta squared effect size. To characterize and compare improvement of the students’ conceptual learning in both treatment classes, Hake’s average normalized gain from pre to post scores were analyzed. It is suggested that in abstract conceptual areas of electricity and magnetism, in which most students have inappropriate and counterproductive responses, cognitive perturbation through <b>interactive</b> <b>simulations</b> is more effective than cognitive conflict through <b>interactive</b> <b>simulations</b> in facilitating conceptual change, and, thus, can improve classroom instruction in the area. Recommendations are also suggested for guiding future research in this area...|$|R
