[...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> you get on the bus after the game and admire you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The comedian/lyricist Tom Lehrer penned {{a number}} of humorous and well known songs {{relating}} to nuclear weapons. His song Who's Next? took {{up the issue of}} nuclear proliferation, chronicling the acquisition of nuclear weapons by various nations, then theorizing on [...] "Who's Next," [...] ending with Luxembourg, Monaco, and Alabama becoming nuclear powers, while We Will All Go Together When We Go looked at the brighter side of nuclear holocaust (not having to mourn over the death of others, since [...] "if the bomb that drops on you gets your friends and neighbors too, there'll be nobody left behind to grieve"). It assumes that the entire planet will be instantaneously wiped clean by nuclear fire, and bypasses the much grimmer idea of radiation poisoning. [...] A third song by Lehrer, So Long Mom (A Song From World War III), was introduced as existing because, [...] "If any songs are {{going to come out of}} World War III, we had better start writing them now," [...] and tells the tale of a young soldier marching off to nuclear war, promising his mother that [...] "Although I may roam, I'll come back to my home/ Although it may be a pile of debris" [...] and also satirizing the likely extremely short duration of a major nuclear war ("And I'll look <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> the war is over/ An hour and a half from now!").|$|E
