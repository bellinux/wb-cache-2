25|$|The {{first known}} <b>investment-based</b> <b>crowdfunding</b> {{platform}} for startups {{was launched in}} Feb. 2010 by Grow VC, followed by the first US. based company ProFounder launching model for startups to raise investments directly on the site, but ProFounder later decided to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing, having launched their model for US. markets prior to JOBS Act. With the positive progress of the JOBS Act for crowd investing in US., equity crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and CircleUp started to emerge in 2011 and platforms such as investiere, Companisto and Seedrs in Europe and OurCrowd in Israel. The idea of these platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were {{taking place in the}} market. The first problem was for startups to be able to access capital and to decrease {{the amount of time that}} it takes to close a round of financing. The second problem was intended to increase the amount of deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process.|$|E

We find that women invest {{less in the}} riskiest investments but more in safer ones. These findings are better explained by differences in risk aversion than differences in overconfidence between men and women. Investors located in an area considered more "sociable" (socially friendly) also invest more, especially if the investor is a woman. Overall, the findings contribute {{to our understanding of}} how <b>investment-based</b> <b>crowdfunding</b> can be a viable source of entrepreneurial finance and how entrepreneurs' campaign decisions affect investor participation in this new form of entrepreneurial finance...|$|E

However, the emergence of crowdfunding as an alternative way of raising capital has opened doors for entrepreneurs {{of sustainability}} projects. In contrast to conventional for-profit investors, funders tend to be motivated by the projects’ ideas rather than financial returns. Thus, crowdfunding {{is assumed to be}} suitable for sustainability projects because of their focus on social and environmental objectives. Despite the rapid growth of crowdfunding, research on the phenomenon remains limited. This study aims to explore how entrepreneurs of sustainability projects can utilise the potential of crowdfunding for fundraising. We have conducted semi-structured interviews with five entrepreneurs and a crowdfunding expert in the Netherlands to examine their experiences in crowdfunding. The results show that geographical proximity and social networks are important for fundraising, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} campaign period. Furthermore, crowdfunding platforms can affect fundraising success, especially by acting as trustworthy intermediates. Entrepreneurs of noninvestment-based crowdfunding campaigns also tend to be more committed to their projects’ social and environmental objectives, while this is not prevalent to the same extent in <b>investment-based</b> <b>crowdfunding</b> campaigns. Finally, our findings indicate that signalling commitment to sustainability objectives in crowdfunding campaigns can positively influence the projects’ appeal to funders...|$|E
