5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now my concern is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{sit down}} with Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks {{and one of those}} videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E

25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write {{something}} which did speed up, and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that was the idea of it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E

I know I {{probably}} didn't {{get a couple of}} jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the way I was going to do it.... For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... We all know that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E

500|$|She {{said she}} wasn't {{interested}} in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which {{is a bit of}} a stern statement from someone who has been so out there.

500|$|Both Motley and Willis {{made the}} team and became two of the first African-Americans to play {{professional}} football in the modern era. The Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League had signed the only other black players in pro football earlier that year: Kenny Washington and Woody Strode.

500|$|Development and {{pre-production}} for TMNT {{began in}} June 2005 at Imagi's Los Angeles facility and the CGI animation {{was produced in}} Hong Kong, followed by post-production in Hollywood. In designing the New York backdrop, art director/concept artist Simon Murton stylized the familiar Manhattan skyline and urban landscapes: [...] "We began with cinematic cues from certain black-and-white films from the 1940s and '50s. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> push the lighting and the environments to create {{the look and feel}} of an alternate reality." [...] The animators that worked on the fight sequences were inspired by Hong Kong action films. Animation director Kim Ooi explains said that because of CGI they were able to [...] "push and stylize beyond the limits of live action." [...] Imagi used Maya with Pixar’s RenderMan for the production pipeline’s back-end.|$|E
500|$|After the 1983–84 season, Olajuwon {{debated whether}} {{to stay in}} college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time (before the NBA Draft Lottery was {{introduced}} in 1985), the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: [...] "I really believed that Houston {{was going to win}} the coin flip and pick the number 1 draft choice, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early)." [...] His intuition proved correct, and a lucky toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was considered the top amateur prospect in the summer of 1984 over fellow collegians and future NBA stars Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton, and was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.|$|E

500|$|Stylistically, [...] "Oh Love" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as power pop. Its musical style is reminiscent of the band's early albums Dookie (1994) and Nimrod (1997).

Bassist Mike Dirnt described the musical style of [...] "Oh Love" [...] by stating, [...] "We were just thinking about making a killer power-pop record– dirtier, back to basics. We tapped into our version of Exile on Main Street". Vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong also talked about his desire to write a power pop song, stating, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was write real power-pop kind of music that had that old Green Day energy, so the original Green Day sound became ¡Uno!".|$|E
500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series.

Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more like a game that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; we look at it and tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E
500|$|Two record {{companies}} showed {{an interest in}} Higgins—Sony and [...] She signed with Eleven, partly because they agreed {{that she would not}} be [...] "made into a pop star" [...] and partly because they were happy for her to take time off for a backpacking holiday.
