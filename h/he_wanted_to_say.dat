5|$|Firefighters {{extinguished}} {{the fires}} without any major {{damage to the}} school. Saari remained at large for {{some time in the}} school grounds after they had been evacuated. Two days after the killings, a friend of Saari's, named Rauno, told 7 päivää that at 11:53 he received a call from Saari in which he confessed to having killed ten people. Saari is claimed to have spoken to Rauno in a calm manner, telling him that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye. He was found alive by the police at 12:30, having shot himself in the head. He was taken to Tampere University Hospital, where he was treated for his gunshot wound. He died a short time later at 17:40.|$|E
25|$|Gary Kirsten {{cleared the}} air of any rumours about a renewal in {{contract}} by adopting a modest approach on his further availability as coach to the Indian team by stating that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to India {{to spend time with}} his family.|$|E
25|$|Speech errors {{will usually}} {{occur in the}} stages that involve lexical, morpheme, or phoneme encoding, and usually not {{the first step of}} {{semantic}} encoding.This can be credited to how a speaker is still conjuring the idea of what to say, and unless he changes his mind, can not be mistaken in what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Something's {{upon his}} mind still," [...] Elma cried, looking hard at him. [...] "He's dying! he's dying! But <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} else before he dies, I'm certain. ... Mr. Kelmscott, it's to you. Oh, Cyril, stand back! Mother, leave them alone! I'm sure from his eye <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something <b>to</b> Mr. Kelmscott." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't <b>say.</b> I'm expecting <b>to</b> hear shortly. But we needn't worry ourselves. The next move's with him. If <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} about it, he {{must come to}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} immensely," [...] Hewet replied, {{speaking}} with the relief {{of a person who}} is unexpectedly given an opportunity of <b>saying</b> what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> stopped moving the pebbles.|$|R
25|$|In 1905, Geronimo {{agreed to}} tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain {{permission}} to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing exactly what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{appearing}} in Tekken 7s original arcade release, Nina returns in its updated title, Tekken 7: Fated Retribution. In the story mode, {{she was forced}} to work for the returning Heihachi in the first-half, until she began to concern about Lars' good reason on keeping Jin safe with him, deeming it very interesting to watch and resign from Zaibatsu, faking her death while setting her private assassination job for hire. She is later tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding... posing as the bride. During the ceremony, a firefight broke out where Nina took out all her targets. However, the commotion had attracted the Tekken Force, who had been dispatched to suppress the violence, and they gave chase. With the Tekken Force in hot pursuit, Nina made her escape. That's when she bumped into a man she found vaguely familiar, who happens to be her son, Steve Fox. Steve wouldn't leave her alone. He seemed to have something <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to her... Nina decided that a confrontation was her best chance of escape.|$|E
500|$|After an {{instrumental}} introduction, {{there are two}} verses, followed by a guitar solo, which {{has been described as}} [...] "richly melodic" [...] by biographer Keith Shadwick. [...] Shapiro noted the song's brevity: [...] "The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty-five seconds. Even live, 'Little Wing' was hardly any longer – he said what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and stopped".|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll get {{her some}} tea," [...] said Lady Glencora. [...] "Yes, I will. I'll do it myself. I know <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a word <b>to</b> you alone." [...] This she {{added in a}} whisper.|$|R
50|$|The {{police have}} succeeded in {{breaking}} into the tomb, and bring Sterling to justice. The Egyptian spy who warned Wright over the phone {{turned out to be}} an Egyptian secret policeman, Rasheed Bey (Francis McDonald), who was investigating Sterling. Whittaker hands over the diary to be used as evidence. Wright has something <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Mary, but he forgot.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{an anecdote}} about Xuedou's last words. Near {{the end of}} his life, his pupils, regretting the {{inevitable}} death of their master, asked if there is anything that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Xuedou simply replied:"The only regret of my life was speaking too much." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{indefinite}} {{article is}} frequently omitted in German when speaking of an individual's profession or residence but {{is in any}} case used when speaking in a figurative sense. [...] Since the President was not literally from Berlin but declaring his solidarity with its citizens, [...] "Ich bin ein Berliner" [...] {{was the only way}} to express what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Charles and the {{children}} were officially Swiss nationals until they became naturalised on 22 October 1919. Dirac's father was strict and authoritarian, although he disapproved of corporal punishment. Dirac had a strained relationship with his father, so much so that after his father's death, Dirac wrote, [...] "I feel much freer now, and I am my own man." [...] Charles forced his children to speak to him only in French, in order that they learn the language. When Dirac found that he could not express what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in French, he chose to remain silent.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe procrastinated. The {{evening before}} the deadline, he typed {{a letter to}} Dobell {{explaining}} what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the subject, ignoring all journalistic conventions. Dobell's response was to remove the salutation [...] "Dear Byron" [...] {{from the top of}} the letter and publish it intact as reportage. The result, published in 1963, was [...] "There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby." [...] The article was widely discussed—loved by some, hated by others. Its notoriety helped Wolfe gain publication of his first book, The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby, a collection of his writings from the Herald-Tribune, Esquire, and other publications.|$|E
50|$|Nozaki's overly lazy younger brother. Because he was bullied {{when he was}} young, {{he rarely}} talks. He {{sometimes}} writes abbreviated phrases on what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but will talk if it is quicker. The rare time when he puts in effort is when he captains his school's judo club.|$|R
5000|$|Jeremy Biltz of DVD Talk said [...] "Nightfur {{is like a}} {{pleasant}} dream... The direction is confident. Writer / director Jason Brown definitely knows where he's going and what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say...</b> Nightfur is recommended for anyone looking for a film {{very different from what}} usually screens at the multiplex." ...|$|R
500|$|Aldous Huxley {{wrote in}} 1957 that Goya lacked Rubens' ability {{to fill the}} canvas with an ordered composition; but he {{considered}} The Third of May a success because Goya [...] "is speaking in his native language, and he is therefore able <b>to</b> express what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with maximum force and clarity".|$|R
2500|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the sixth}} season, Raj {{remained}} silent when Penny was present. Penny occasionally taunted him about this, saying such things as [...] "Yo, Raj, talk to me". Raj sometimes whispered what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to Howard or Leonard, who then repeated his words or responded to his question out loud. However, Howard sometimes used the situation to amuse himself—for example, when he [...] "confessed" [...] on Raj's behalf that Raj had stalked Penny with binoculars, or when Sheldon called Penny over to their table to silence Raj; Howard then refused to act as a mouthpiece and told Raj, [...] "No no no, he won; Suck it up." [...] In [...] "The Dumpling Paradox", Leonard jokingly suggests cutting Raj in half so the group can play video games without Howard while Penny is in the room: Raj turns to Leonard (facing away from Penny) and responds, [...] "Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half. There's a billion more where he came from." [...] Later, in [...] "The Bat Jar Conjecture", Raj accidentally utters a few words ("good story"), much to the surprise of his friends, but he immediately realizes Penny is there and covers his mouth with both hands. A recurring gag was for Raj to find himself left alone when his friends, in the company of Penny or another woman, make plans to go somewhere and Raj's mutism prevents him from speaking up to join in.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2010, a fan-made mash-up of {{the video}} and a Sesame Street segment {{appeared}} online. The original Sesame Street clip featured a puppet portrayed as a young black girl proud of her hair. She flails her braids, cornrows, afro, and other ethnic hairstyles. According to the show's writer, Joey Mazzarino, the song was a tribute to his Ethiopian daughter's hair, writing it, stating that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Your hair is great. You can put it in ponytails. You can put it in cornrows. I wish I had hair like you." [...] The mash-up uses different shots in the show's segment paired with [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] {{to act as a}} music video. During the week of release of the [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] video, the Sesame Street clip also went viral. Veronica Miller of NPR commented that with both clips, [...] "little black girls are having the best week ever", noting the rarity that [...] "little African-American girls are publicly celebrated for their uniqueness and beauty", due to non-positive comments about their physical appearance, making them question individual and collective beauty. On the single's video, Miller said, [...] "Little Willow is operating with a sort of empowerment that grown women can sense, admire, and in some cases, envy", stating, [...] "not many girls are taught that it's OK to openly love and affirm yourself." [...] Noting that the norm is not to be [...] "sassy" [...] or [...] "cute", she said that [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] is [...] "a celebration of little girls celebrating themselves".|$|E

5000|$|... "Generation P has the {{energizing}} {{feel of a}} work by {{a filmmaker}} who has a lot <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and is unafraid to risk clumsiness in order to fully express it. Also, Ginzburg's freewheeling visual invention merely reflects a society that seems to prize slick appearances over actual substance." [...] Kenji Fujishima, Slant Magazine ...|$|R
5000|$|In the song, {{the male}} narrator {{is facing the}} end of a marriage. The title has two meanings. First, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> his wife to reconcile, but he can't think of anything; he has [...] "got nothin'". Then, {{at the end of the}} song, he reflects that once she leaves, he has [...] "got nothin'".|$|R
60|$|He paused. <b>He</b> had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that, {{but it was}} not {{the thing}} we had <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|Clutton put {{his hands}} over his eyes so that he might {{concentrate}} his mind on what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{became aware}} of the lapse. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something, to get on to a new more {{ordinary}} footing.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "handwriting", but {{the word}} still refused to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan {{snatched}} the paper from him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Inspector Jacks," [...] he said, [...] "you are a {{wonderful}} man. Even {{now you are}} asking yourself, 'What does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me--Prince Maiyo? Is he {{going to ask me}} questions, or will he tell me things which I should like to hear?' You know, Mr. Inspector Jacks, between ourselves, you are just a little interested in me, is it not so?" ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps, {{but it is}} an open question, Steve is the one who is most {{surprised}} to hear this. <b>He</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something on the subject, but a look of entreaty from Alice silences him.|$|R
5000|$|Wack One {{of the two}} ducks on the farm. He {{wears an}} orange collar. In [...] "Wild Ducks", <b>he</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> hello <b>to</b> the wild ducks.|$|R
6000|$|... "T-t-t-t-ta-ta-tay-tay-tay-tay----" [...] began Mohler, {{in great}} excitement, {{but as he}} could not finish what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no one caught his meaning.|$|E
60|$|Philip waited. Mr. Perkins ran his lean {{fingers through}} his beard and looked at Philip. He seemed to be {{thinking}} over what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brand lingered still, {{looking at}} the ceiling; there was evidently {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> [...] "What {{do you mean by}} Miss Gertrude being strong?" [...] he asked abruptly.|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the weirdest}} {{old man in}} the trio, he {{is a fan of}} anime figures, and tends to make weird sound effects when he talks. In fact, sound effects are pretty much the only thing you will hear from this old guy. He also uses hand {{gestures}} and facial expressions <b>to</b> explain what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> wears girly clothes, a long haired green wig, and cat ears, which, when paired with a mustache, provides comical relief for watchers.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} this profane and cordial {{explosion}} he fetched {{a prodigious}} [...] "WHOOSH!" [...] to relieve his lungs and make recognition of the heat, and then he straightway dived into his narrative again for [...] "Johnny's" [...] benefit, beginning, [...] "Well, ------it ain't any use talking, some of those old American words DO have a kind of a bully swing to them; a man can EXPRESS himself with 'em--a man can get at what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>SAY,</b> dontchuknow." ...|$|R
5000|$|Louder Than The Musics Jono Davies noted how [...] "you {{can tell}} that Rhett will create music his way and <b>say</b> what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> This can be {{refreshing}} to hear but also makes listening to the songs an unsettling experience. Yet isnt being uncomfortable sometimes an inspiring thing? This album has turned me into a fan of Rhett Walkers work. Maybe for me the album jumps in styles a little too much, but the songs {{make up for it}} in so many ways." ...|$|R
