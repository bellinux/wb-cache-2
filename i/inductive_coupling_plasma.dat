The {{results showed that the}} biggest difference between them was the content of gas-liquid inclusions. Thus, in order {{to improve the quality of}} our country high purity quartz sand, development of new technology to remove gas-liquid inclusions has been imperative. Method for removal of gas-liquid inclusions, using microwave radiation, was studied in this project. Meanwhile, the change of microscopic morphology of gas-liquid inclusion was observed by polarizing microscope. And the change of water content in gas-liquid inclusion was investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Our results showed that micro-crack could be produced on the surface of gas-liquid inclusion under microwave treatment. The results also showed that new water molecules and liquid inclusions could be generated in the process. Furthermore, these liquid inclusions could be removed and H 2 O could be reduced by HF acid leaching. ...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{environmental}} concerns associated with currently used wood preservatives {{have seen a}} trend {{in the development of}} biocides that include inorganic-organic binary mixtures. One such mixture is the ammoniacal copper quaternary ammonium system (ACQ) which contains copper as the primary biocide and didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) as the co-biocide. In view of experience in agriculture and horticulture, where similar changes from inorganic to organic formulations resulted in failure through the development of tolerance to the organic compounds in target organisms, the present investigation set out to determine if a similar fate awaits these binary wood preservatives which are exposed continuously {{to a wide range of}} microorganisms in soil. Soil fungi tolerant of DDAC, copper and a combination of both were isolated from liquid medium inoculated with soil and from treated blocks of Pinus radiata sapwood which had been buried in soil for 26 weeks. Matric potentials of soil and blocks were determined and treated blocks were buried in soil to give two moisture contents. More species of fungi were isolated from blocks at the higher moisture content than at the lower one. All were Hyphomycetes and included species of Verticillium, Paecilomyces and Gliocladium. Growth of selected tolerant isolates, measured as extension of colony diameters on PDA, was not sensitive to pH. Variation in growth rates among isolates was not related to tolerance of DDAC. Isolates of Verticillium were the most tolerant. Toxic thresholds of DDAC and copper to selected soil isolates and two wood-decay fungi were determined in liquid media. The fungi varied widely in their responses. Species of soil fungi were more tolerant of these chemicals than were wood-decay species. V. lecanii was the most tolerant of DDAC and was able to grow in medium containing 250 ppm DDAC, while the brown-rot fungus, Antrodia vaillantii was able to tolerate only 2. 5 ppm. V. lecanii was also much more copper tolerant than A. vaillantii and grew in medium containing 12000 ppm elemental copper. Growth of V. lecanii, measured as biomass, was not affected by test concentrations of DDAC. Bioassays in liquid medium showed that the fungus was able to reduce the concentration or activity of DDAC to levels permitting growth of other more sensitive isolates, including wood-decay fungi. None of the soil isolates examined was able to utilise DDAC as a sole source of carbon. Growth rate and biomass production were not affected by 500 ppm copper but at 3000 ppm reduction of both was observed. <b>Inductive</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>plasma</b> (ICP) emission spectroscopy analyses showed that V. lecanii reduced the concentration of soluble copper in the growth media. Combinations of DDAC and copper were much more effective against V. lecanii than either component alone and in certain ratios these combinations were synergistic. The amount of copper required to control V. lecanii was substantially less when it was combined with DDAC which could have economic as well as environmental benefits.
