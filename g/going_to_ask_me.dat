2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't think so. When {{we found}} her address among the truck Strange had left with the foreman, it was the proper {{thing for me to}} tell her he was drowned.

6000|$|Here my spouse, {{talking of}} my <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Ireland, <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I had no affairs {{to settle at}} London before we went off.

'Madam,' says he, very respectfully, 'I suppose the {{greatest}} part of your estate, which my sister tells me is {{most of it in}} money in the Bank of England, lies secure enough, but in case it required transferring, or any way altering its property, it might be necessary to go up to London and settle those things before we went over.' ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{few months}} into Garbage's hiatus, Manson began writing a solo record, working with {{musician}} Paul Buchanan, producer Greg Kurstin, and film composer David Arnold. In 2007, Manson collaborated with Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, who {{at that point}} had never co-written material with anyone. Manson presented some of her work to Geffen Records in 2008, who found it [...] "too noir", prompting Manson and Geffen to mutually terminate her contract. Manson continued to write material while without a record deal and was in talks with David Byrne and Ray Davies about a potential collaboration. Manson posted three demos on her Facebook profile, written by her and Kurstin, titled [...] "In the Snow", [...] "Pretty Horses" [...] and [...] "Lighten Up". [...] "I had taken some of my solo music into the record label. They didn't really care for the direction I was moving in and I found it really disheartening.

6000|$|... "My first step," [...] {{she began}} on her return, [...] "was, of course, {{to find out}} what members of the Simcoe family lived there. After {{engaging}} a room at the hotel, which I can assure you was the most unpleasant part of the business, for they seemed to be altogether unaccustomed to the arrival of young ladies unattended, I went into the town. It is not much of a place, and after making some little purchases and inquiring at several places, I heard of a maiden lady of that name. The woman who told me of her was communicative. 'She has just had a great piece of luck,' she said. 'About ten months back a nephew, whom everyone had supposed to have been lost at sea, came home with a great fortune, and they say that he has behaved most handsomely to her. She has always bought her Berlin wool and such things here, and she has spent three or four times as much since he came home as she did before, and I know from a neighbor, of whom she is a customer, that the yards and yards of flannel that she buys for making up into petticoats for poor children is wonderful. Do you know her, miss?' I said that I did not know her personally, but that some friends of mine, knowing that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Stowmarket, had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> inquire if Miss Simcoe was still alive. I said casually that I might call and see her, and so got her address.|$|R

6000|$|But Dorothy exclaimed: 'No, no, father, I {{will not}} have it so.
