500|$|I love New York. But if I'm there, I {{want to go}} out, friends come to the studio, {{the phone}} rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, {{and there is no}} one <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> into. I felt that in Capri I would be able to {{effectively}} finish the album on a shorter schedule. And I did. I made it in three months, I was like 'Get me off this label!' I couldn't take it. The situation there [...] was becoming increasingly difficult.|$|E

[...] "I think we've got the balance real close," [...] Johnson continued. [...] "My motor's running great. Maybe some overall grip but I think there I'm one of 43 guys that are saying that. This hot sun out here [...] the track awful slick." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{ride and}} <b>run</b> too. In a long day's journey I should {{get to the}} end on foot nearly as fast as you would on horseback." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{promise to}} be of much use, Major," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I know myself too well; but at least <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> my chance of being killed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Electric lights have a civilizing influence," [...] {{continued}} the young man. [...] "I'm quite {{sure all the}} farmers between here and Huntingdon would use them, at a reasonable price. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> also <b>run</b> a line to Hooker's Falls, and one to Chazy Junction. Plenty of poles can be cut from our pine forests and the wires will be the chief expense. I may not make money, at first, but I'll play pretty nearly even and have something to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not {{volunteer}} for the service," [...] Francis said. [...] "I {{was asked by the}} admiral to undertake it, and even had I wished it, I could hardly have refused.
