500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the <b>drillhead</b> as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E
40|$|The large {{success of}} Mars {{exploration}} missions, {{such as the}} NASA Mars Exploration Rovers, Pathfinder and Viking I and II, have allowed a widespread access to {{the top layer of}} Martian regolith. However, no exploration deeper than the few centimetres allowed by the scoop of Phoenix has been conducted on Mars. The potential discoveries that will follow from access to the Martian sub-surface (for example, {{the presence or absence of}} extinct life forms and of resources for future human exploration; a better understanding of Martian and Solar System history) require the development of new tools and a better understanding of their interaction with regolith to increase their performance and reliability. A promising new drilling methodology, dual reciprocating drilling (DRD), was tested in regolith and showed higher penetration than static penetration. DRD is conducted by two half-cone <b>drillheads,</b> with back-ward facing teeth, moved back and forth in opposition one to another (no rotation). To gain a better understanding of the forces acting on each half-drill-bit and the influence of slippage on drilling performance, a mono-block drill-head, with the same shape as the DRD drill-head, was tested in static and alternating penetration in two different regolith simulants. The forces acting on it were measured. These novel experimental observations allowed to revise the penetration model of DRD in regoliths and to illustrate the importance of lateral forces in the drilling process. To complement the experimental campaign and to gain a better insight on the regolith kinematics around the reciprocating drill-head, numerical simulations were developed. The discrete element method was chosen to simulate the complex behaviour of regolith. It was implemented within the commercial software Impetus-AFEA. The advantage of using this platform is its ability to use the power of graphical processing units (GPU) to cope with a very large number of elements within reasonable computation times. These numerical simulations allowed to confirm the importance of the lateral forces in DRD. They are also one of the first DEM simulations with more than one million particles on a single desktop computer and pave the way to highly efficient numerical simulations...|$|R
