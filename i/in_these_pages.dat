Critic Orville Prescott, writing in The New York Times, although admitting that the novel was [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "a triumph of delicate and suggestive mystification", nevertheless concluded that the story was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "vexatious". He ended his review with the words: [...] "One feels constantly that shining truths are about to be revealed; that there is something important, something significant, hidden <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>pages.</b> But it is never made clear, while the ridiculous details remain all too conspicuously in view." [...] Prescott was just as critical of Rexroth's preface to the first American edition, describing it as a [...] "pretentious introduction of uncommon density". Writing in The Independent in 1993, shortly after the 100th anniversary of Read's birth, critic Geoffrey Wheatcroft commented that Read may not have been a great novelist [...] "but The Green Child is the kind of book to write {{if you are going to}} leave just the one novel behind: singular, odd, completely original".|$|E

2500|$|The Irish Independent {{describes}} {{the book as}} a [...] "disturbingly giddy, schoolgirlish, exclamation mark-littered diary form" [...] and [...] "nothing in the slightest bit revelatory about it... tiptoeingly discreet", but that [...] "Brown comes across <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>pages</b> as a decent and likeable" [...] with [...] "enough gossipy details to satisfy star-hungry readers", with Caitlin Moran declaring: [...] "School run, conference call, Obama for tea – Sarah Brown smiled, and tweeted, through it all.

Scribner's magazine compared {{the work to}} Evelyn Waugh's Vile Bodies for its bitter humor. The New York Times found it socially superficial, but praised its [...] "lovely festoons of epigrams" [...] and beguiling stylishness: [...] "What malice there may be <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>pages</b> has a felinity that is the purest Angoran." [...] The book's device of characters interlinked from story to story was borrowed from Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio (1919), but it impressed Andre Maurois, who asked Luce's permission to imitate it. Luce also published many magazine articles. Her real talent, however, was as a playwright.|$|E
