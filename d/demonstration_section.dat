40|$|The {{goals of}} this project were to {{implement}} several stabilization methods for preventing or mitigating freeze-thaw damage to granular surfaced roads and identify {{the most effective and}} economical methods for the soil and climate conditions of Iowa. Several methods and technologies identified as potentially suitable for Iowa were selected from an extensive analysis of existing literature provided with Iowa Highway Research Board (IHRB) Project TR- 632. Using the selected methods, <b>demonstration</b> <b>sections</b> were constructed in Hamilton County on a heavily traveled two-mile section of granular surfaced road that required frequent maintenance during previous thawing periods. Construction procedures and costs of the <b>demonstration</b> <b>sections</b> were documented, and subsequent maintenance requirements were tabulated through two seasonal freeze-thaw periods. Extensive laboratory and field tests were performed prior to construction, as well as before and after the two seasonal freeze-thaw periods, to monitor the performance of the <b>demonstration</b> <b>sections.</b> A weather station was installed at the project site and temperature sensors were embedded in the subgrade to monitor ground temperatures up to a depth of 5 ft and determine the duration and depths of ground freezing and thawing. An economic analysis was performed using the documented construction and maintenance costs, and the estimated cumulative costs per square yard were projected over a 20 -year timeframe to determine break-even periods relative to the cost of continuing current maintenance practices. Overall, the sections with biaxial geogrid or macadam base courses had the best observed freeze-thaw performance in this study. These two stabilization methods have larger initial costs and longer break-even periods than aggregate columns, but counties should also weigh the benefits of improved ride quality and savings that these solutions can provide as excellent foundations for future paving or surface upgrades...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{primarily}} {{looks at}} estimation error problems {{and other related}} issues arising in connection with portfolio optimization. With some available assets, a portfolio program or optimizer seeks to distribute a fixed amount of capital among these available assets to optimize some cost function. In this regard, Markowitz portfolio selection basis defines the variance of the portfolio return to being that of the portfolio risk and tries to find an allocation that reduces or minimizes the risk subject to a target mean or expected return. Should the mean return vector and the covariance matrix of returns for the underlying assets be known, the Markowitz problem {{is said to have}} a closed-form solution. In practice, however, an estimation is made from historical data for unknown expected returns and the covariance matrix of the returns, and this brings into the domain several problems such as estimation problems and renders the Markowitz theory impracticable in real-life portfolio applications. Estimators necessary to remedy these problems would be made bare to show how possible it is to tackle such issues. In the concept <b>demonstration</b> <b>sections,</b> the analysis starts with the price data of 40 stocks and the S&P index.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project was to {{demonstrate}} the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to reduce NO{sub x} emissions from pulverized-coal utility boilers using medium- to high-sulfur US coal. The prototype SCR facility, built {{in and around the}} ductwork of Plant Crist Unit 5, consisted of three large SCR reactor units (Reactors A, B, and C), each with a design capacity of 5, 000 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) of flue gas, and six smaller reactors (Reactors D through J), each with a design capacity of 400 scfm of flue gas. The three large reactors contained commercially available SCR catalysts as offered by SCR catalyst suppliers. These reactors were coupled with small-scale air preheaters to evaluate (1) the long-term effects of SCR reaction chemistry on air preheater deposit formation and (2) the impact of these deposits on the performance of air preheaters. The small reactors were used to test additional varieties of commercially available catalysts.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in beams {{has been largely}} addressed by authors and researchers. However, relatively few researchers have considered the case of unknown boundary conditions, as usually {{it is reasonable to}} assume the classical cases such as simply supported, clamped or free. Indeed, there are a wide variety of boundary-condition configurations, each one representing a whole different problem with its own modal characteristics. ^ A method for updating experimental beam models to specifically address the issue of unknown boundary conditions is proposed. This methodology takes advantage of vector comparison techniques such as the modal assurance criterion and the dot product to determine the degree of linear relationship between two mode shapes systematically and iteratively until an acceptable parametric match is found. This thesis includes the phases of development, numerical demonstration and experimental verification. In the section devoted to development, a detailed explanation of the method is given; the numerical <b>demonstration</b> <b>section</b> is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of the method using mathematical models only; and finally, in the experimental verification section, a case study example is developed using real experiment data. ^ At the end of this thesis, a generalized procedure is described so the method can be applied to beam-behaving structures and ultimately any engineering model in which boundary conditions have an important role. ...|$|E
