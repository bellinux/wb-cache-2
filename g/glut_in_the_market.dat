The migration of Byzantine artists to Crete continued increasingly the next years and reached its peak after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when Crete became [...] "the most important centre of art in the Greek world", influencing artistic developments {{in the rest of the}} Greek world. Cretan icons were commissioned for monasteries on Mount Athos and elsewhere. [...] The Cretan school had a smaller rival; until it fell to the Turks in 1522, Rhodes also had a community of artists, but not so large or significant. [...] The Venetian archives preserve considerable documentation on the trade of artistic icons between Venice and Crete, which by the end of the 15th century had become one of mass production. There is documentation of a specific order in 1499, of 700 icons of the Virgin, 500 in a Western style, and 200 in Byzantine style. The order was placed with three artists by two dealers, one Venetian and one from mainland Greece, and the time between contract date and delivery was set at only forty-five days. Probably the quality of many such commissioned icons was fairly low, and the dismissive term Madonneri was devised to describe such bulk painters, who later practised in Italy also, often using a quasi-Byzantine style, and apparently often Greek or Dalmatian individuals. Production of icons at these levels seems to have led to a <b>glut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> and in the following two decades there is much evidence that the Cretan trade declined significantly, as the European demand had been reduced.

60|$|The second {{cause is}} not so easily anticipated, but then, though its {{immediate}} result <b>in</b> <b>glutting</b> <b>the</b> labour <b>market</b> is similar, its final consequences are entirely {{different from those of}} the first. The whole trend of a scientific mechanical civilisation is continually to replace labour by machinery and to increase it in its effectiveness by organisation, and so quite independently of any increase in population labour must either fall in value until it can compete against and check the cheapening process, or if that is prevented, as it will be in Utopia, by a minimum wage, come out of employment. There is no apparent limit to this process. But a surplus of efficient labour at the minimum wage is exactly the condition that should stimulate new enterprises, and that in a State saturated with science and prolific in invention will stimulate new enterprises. An increasing surplus of available labour without an absolute increase of population, an increasing surplus of labour due to increasing economy and not to proliferation, and which, therefore, does not press on and disarrange the food supply, is surely the ideal condition for a progressive civilisation. I am inclined to think that, since labour will be regarded as a delocalised and fluid force, it will be the World State and not the big municipalities ruling the force areas that will be the reserve employer of labour. Very probably it will be convenient for the State to hand over the surplus labour for municipal purposes, but that is another question. All over the world the labour exchanges will be reporting the fluctuating pressure of economic demand and transferring workers from this region of excess to that of scarcity; and whenever the excess is universal, the World State--failing an adequate development of private enterprise--will either reduce the working day and so absorb the excess, or set on foot some permanent special works of its own, paying the minimum wage and allowing them to progress just as slowly or just as rapidly as the ebb and flow of labour dictated. But with sane marriage and birth laws there is no reason to suppose such calls upon the resources and initiative of the world more than temporary and exceptional occasions.|$|R
40|$|The {{mainstay}} {{of economic activity}} in Cat Que Commune, Hoai Duc District of Ha Tay Province in Vietnam is got raising, which is the production of piglets between 8 to 30 kg, filling {{a gap between the}} sow/piglet and meat pig productions. A cluster of associated enterprises have developed around this got-based enterprise which include the got raisers, piglet suppliers, feed and medicine suppliers, veterinarian services, got collectors, and manure collectors. The relationships with these associated enterprises form the basis of the complex enterprise strategies of the got raisers, which strive to balance a complex set of issues of feed, growth, season, disease control, labour, credit, and marketing in order to ensure the profitability and sustainability of the enterprise. The got are fed a rice-based diet, with occasional protein concentrate to speed up growth for seasons when got prices are high; while inferior feed is given when there is a <b>glut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Disease control is as much related to management as it is to marketing strategy and labour requirements. To sell the whole lot of got yields lower profit and leads to uneven labour requirements, but it provides the opportunity for thorough cleaning of the pig pens and a break in disease; both contribute to better health condition. Selling got on credit fosters relationships with the collectors, but also creates a cash flow problem which in turn is passed on to the feed suppliers who then must sell feed to got raisers on credit. The in-depth analysis of this complex set of interrelated issues provides the basis for elaborating an enterprise plan to improve the system.

This exploratory research therefore investigated the importance of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) in enhancing customer service for sustainable competitive advantage. Guided by an analytical framework, it reviewed the key issues {{in the context of}} customer service within the Malaysian {{property development}} industry, the existing challenges faced by Malaysian property development companies, emotional intelligence (EQ) and training and development. The identified research gaps permitted the crafting of three Research Propositions. The combined outputs from the literature review, analysis of the research data and conclusions provided useful insights on the research problem. The case study methodology, supplemented by two other categories of exploratory research, namely experience surveys and one-on-one interviews, were the research techniques used to test the research propositions. The participants involved in the experience survey and one-on-one interviews included Heads of Department from the case-study company, Frontline employees, existing clients and vendors supplying goods and services to the case-study company. The procedure of data analysis consisted of examining, categorising, tabulating and recombining the evidence to address the research problem and the related research questions. The testing, by this research, yielded useful insights on the research problem. First, in order for Malaysian property developers to gain a sustainable competitive advantage, {{there is a need for}} fresh emphasis and commitment towards customer service, placing special focus on the development of employees in the area of emotional intelligence (EQ) through the reinforcement of emotional competencies. Despite efforts to enhance customer service through training programmes, the lack of effectiveness needs to be addressed and new measures should be undertaken. Second, the need for Malaysian property development companies to understand the importance of building a service culture and to begin by formulating and implementing a service strategy and it is here that leadership plays a critical role in ensuring the success of every customer service programme throughout the entire organisation. This suggests that new approaches to creating a service culture are necessary, benchmarking with best practices of service leaders around the world, even from different industries. Third, the need for the customer service training model to be reviewed and revamped. It calls for new emphasis on the development of emotional intelligence (EQ) competencies, to ensure training effectiveness and the achievement of customer service excellence through human capital. Finally, the research findings permitted the construct of a policy framework for securing sustainable competitive advantage. The research yielded useful insights for theory and model building. In respect of enhancing customer service to achieve sustainable competitive advantage in the Malaysian property development market, the research findings suggested a Service Culture Development Model that will ensure that customer service excellence can be maintained and delivered consistently, leading to a sustainable competitive advantage in the marketplace. In respect of enhancing customer service through the development of EQ competencies in every employee and throughout the organisation, the research findings suggested a new Customer Service Training Model, where EQ competencies development programme becomes the pre-requisite foundational programme for all employees, prior to the training of customer service skill-sets. In order to create a service culture throughout the entire organisation, a customer service-oriented organisation will ensure that all employees, including top management personnel, participate in the EQ development programme. Follow-up research to test a model, based on this framework should further contribute to new theory development in emotional intelligence impacting customer service in the Malaysian property development industry...|$|E
30|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{literature}} {{there is}} a lot of information about lactic acid production from other carbon sources such as saccharides e.g., (Wee et al. 2006; Hujanen et al. 2001; Liu 2003; Jun et al. 2003). Thus we wanted to check if the change of carbon source from glycerol to pure saccharides increases the level of lactic acid synthesis by Cl. bifermentans isolates. It occurred that the highest productions of lactic acid were obtained when mannitol was used – the yield of production increased more than three times: YLA= 0.62, YLA= 0.78, and YLA= 0.76 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of KM 371, KM 374, and KM 376, respectively. Moreover, some lactic acid bacteria, as it turned out, are able to ferment mannitol into lactic acid. For instance, Lactobacillus casei utilizes mannitol through the following pathway: mannitol->mannitol- 1 -phosphate->fructose- 6 -phosphate-> 2 pyruvate-> 2 lactate (Liu 2003). Under aerobic conditions, Lb. casei converts mannitol primarily to lactate only. However, under anaerobic conditions mannitol is fermented to lactate, acetate, formate, and ethanol (Liu 2003). The effect of variable saccharides on the lactic acid production by Rhizopus oryzae was investigated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work by Yin et al. (1997). These authors tested the efficiency of lactic acid production from glucose, mannose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose, inulin, maltose, rhamnose, xylose, galactose, and corn starch. It occurred that mannitol is a good carbon source also in lactic acid production by Rhizopus oryzae and the YLA= 0.70 which is comparable with <b>the</b> results obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present work. This step of our experiment also shows that all the saccharides used (except of xylose, raffinose and, additionally, sorbitol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of KM 374) are a preferable carbon source for lactic acid synthesis. The main aim of this work, however, was to investigate into how utilize glycerol as a by-product from biodiesel production. Thus it was checked if the addition of small amount of saccharide to glycerol used as a main carbon source can result in an increase of the level of lactic acid synthetized. Generally, the levels of lactic acid obtained from a mixed carbon source were comparable with the results from our tests with glycerol only. Only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of addition of mannitol for all strains, and mannose for KM 376, the yields of lactic acid increased. When some saccharides were used as a carbon source – no 1, 3 -PD was synthetized, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> situation when the saccharides were added to glycerol, 1, 3 -PD was synthetized. Moreover, the amount of utilized glycerol was lower and the saccharides were completely consumed. Biebl and Marten (1995) made similar observations. In their experiments, glucose was applied <b>in</b> half <b>the</b> concentration of glycerol for a mixed-substrate culture. It occurred that the addition of glycerol to medium with glucose increased the rate of glucose utilization by Cl. butyricum (up to 8 h). Moreover, product formation changed markedly in comparison with glycerol fermentation as 90 % of the glycerol was converted to 1, 3 -PD and only 10 % was used for acids. Additionally, mixed fermentation (glycerol plus glucose) shifted from butyrate to acetate production. Because the addition of the saccharides did not increase the efficiency of lactic acid production, a better solution from the environmental point of view is to optimize the production of metabolites using only glycerol as a carbon source. Growing prices of crude oil and fuels for the transportation sectors have resulted in a rapid growth in biodiesel production worldwide. An increase of biodiesel production leads thus to an increased quantity of its primary co-product, glycerol. Since the existing glycerol supply and demand <b>market</b> was tight, <b>the</b> recent increase <b>in</b> glycerol production from biodiesel refining has created a <b>glut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glycerol <b>market.</b> This situation made the price of glycerol fall significantly and biodiesel refiners are faced with limited options for managing the glycerol by-product (Johnson & Taconi 2007). One of the solutions of this problem is to use crude glycerol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of industrially useful metabolites such as lactic acid and 1, 3 -PD (Kubiak et al. 2012).|$|R

50|$|Until {{the mid-1950s}} coal {{was still the}} world's {{foremost}} fuel, but after this time oil quickly took over. Later, following the 1973 and 1979 energy crises, there was significant media coverage {{on the subject of}} oil supply levels. This brought to light the concern that oil is a limited resource that will eventually run out, at least as an economically viable energy source. Although at the time the most common and popular predictions were quite dire, a period of increased production and reduced demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following years caused an oil <b>glut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. This was not to last, however, and by {{the first decade of the}} 21st century discussions about peak oil had returned to the news.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} exists that glucose transporter 3 (GLUT 3) {{plays an important}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> energy metabolism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain. Most previous studies have been conducted using focal or hypoxic ischemia models and have focused on changes <b>in</b> <b>GLUT</b> 3 expression based on protein and mRNA levels rather than tissue levels. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, we observed change <b>in</b> <b>GLUT</b> 3 immunoreactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adult gerbil hippocampus at various time points after 5 minutes of transient forebrain ischemia. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> sham-operated group, <b>GLUT</b> 3 immunoreactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hippocampal CA 1 region was weak, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pyramidal cells of the CA 1 region increased in a time-dependent fashion 24 hours after ischemia, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hippocampal CA 1 region decreased significantly between 2 and 5 days after ischemia, with high level of GLUT 3 immunoreactivity observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CA 1 region 10 days after ischemia. In a double immunofluorescence study using GLUT 3 and glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), we observed strong <b>GLUT</b> 3 immunoreactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> astrocytes. <b>GLUT</b> 3 immunoreactivity increased after ischemia and peaked 7 days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dentate gyrus after ischemia/reperfusion. In a double immunofluorescence study using GLUT 3 and doublecortin (DCX), we observed low level of <b>GLUT</b> 3 immunoreactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> differentiated neuroblasts of the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus after ischemia. <b>GLUT</b> 3 immunoreactivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sham-operated group was mainly detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>GLUT</b> 3 immunoreactivity may be a compensatory mechanism to modulate glucose level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hippocampal CA 1 region and to promote adult neurogenesis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dentate gyrus...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Circulating glucose {{inhibits}} glucose {{production in}} normal rodents and humans, but this glucose effectiveness is disrupted in diabetes due partly to sustained hyperglycemia. We hypothesize that hyperglycemia in diabetes impairs hypothalamic glucose sensing to lower glucose production, and changes of glucose transporter- 1 (<b>GLUT</b> 1) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hypothalamic glial cells {{are responsible for}} the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia in vivo. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We tested hypotha-lamic glucose effectiveness to increase hypothalamic glucose concentration and lower glucose production in rats induced with streptozotocin (STZ) uncontrolled diabetes, STZ and phlorizin, and whole-body and hypothalamic sustained hyperglycemia. We next assessed the content of glial <b>GLUT</b> 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hypothalamus, generated an adenovirus expressing GLUT 1 driven by a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter (Ad-GFAP-GLUT 1), an...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis of 2008 - 2009, public debt in advanced economies has increased substantially. In all 22 OECD countries that have public debt, the excess liabilities (i. e. negative financial net worth) of the non-financial corporations are less than the excess financial assets (i. e. positive financial net worth) of <b>the</b> households. <b>In</b> these countries, non-financial corporations are reluctant to invest so that <b>the</b> private sector <b>in</b> total has excess financial assets.

40|$|Glucose is {{the main}} energy {{substrate}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bovine ovary, and a sufficient supply of {{it is necessary to}} sustain the ovarian activity. Glucose cannot permeate the plasma membrane, and its uptake is mediated by a number of glucose transporters (<b>GLUT).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, we investigated the gene expression of GLUT 1, 3 and 4 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bovine follicle and corpus luteum (CL). Ovaries were obtained from HolsteinJapanese Black F 1 heifers. Granulosa cells and theca interna layers were harvested from follicles classified into five categories by their physiologic status: follicular size (8 · 5 mm: dominant; < 8 · 5 mm: subordinate), ratio of estradiol (E 2) to proges-terone in follicular fluid (1 : E 2 active;< 1 : E 2 inactive), and stage of estrous cycle (luteal phase, follicular phase) ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the crude oil price increases, {{associated}} with the Middle East crisis, many countries, particularly Brazil, began producing ethanol for the use as fuel in mixture with gasoline. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, 'gasohol', a blend of approximately 90 % gasoline and 10 % ethanol began to be marketed. It was quickly accepted in a market which at that time was being controlled by political and supply problems. Major global and domestic events such as <b>the</b> general <b>glut</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world supply of crude oil, decontrol of prices, lower demand for gasoline and the effect of the current administration on government funding and/or guarantees and the lack thereof, has resulted in a restructing and change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry.
