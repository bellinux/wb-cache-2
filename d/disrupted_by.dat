5|$|Because of self-irradiation, {{a sample}} of {{plutonium}} fatigues throughout its crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> radiation with time.

5|$|Black Creek is an ephemeral stream. It used {{to drain}} an area between Turtle Creek and the Susquehanna River, but now loses its flow to {{underground}} mines via broken bedrock.

5|$|Cyclone 05B, a supercyclone {{that struck}} Orissa on 29 October 1999, was the deadliest {{in more than}} a quarter-century. With peak winds of , it was the {{equivalent}} of a Category 5 hurricane. Almost two million people were left homeless;another 20 million people lives were <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> the cyclone. Officially, 9,803 people died from the storm; unofficial estimates place the death toll at over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Disruption of the Commonwealth {{governance}} {{caused by}} the liberum veto was highly significant. From 1573 to 1763, about 150 Sejms where held, of which 53 failed to pass any legislation.

5|$|It {{was also}} {{intended}} to develop reconnaissance and bomber versions, but these plans were <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> the German invasion in June 1941. The project was stymied {{by the failure}} of its intended inline engine, the Mikulin AM-37, and its performance was disappointing when a second prototype was built later with M-82 radial engines. It was cancelled in 1943 after at least two prototypes were built.|$|E
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third rail to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 {{million gallons of water}} when it is not raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of Triton’s capture {{has been the}} subject of several theories over the years. One of them postulates that Triton was captured in a three-body encounter. In this scenario, Triton is the surviving member of a binary Kuiper belt object <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> its encounter with Neptune.|$|E

5|$|After the floods, {{helicopters}} airlifted {{relief supplies}} like {{food and water}} to isolated villages, and to residents riding out the floods on their roofs. However, relief coordination was <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall. Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents. India's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500million rupees (US$15million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery. Conditions returned to normal within 12days of the onslaught of the rains, {{with the exception of}} minor delays to trains. However, another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event, killing over 1,000people.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E

30|$|Radio jamming is the {{deliberate}} transmission of radio signals to <b>disrupt</b> communications <b>by</b> decreasing the SNR of the received signal.

5|$|Brought {{up in the}} Rhondda Valley, Paul {{became a}} miner after leaving school, but an offer of a {{professional}} contract from Swansea gave {{him the opportunity to}} leave the colliery. His football career was then <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> Second World War, during which he was a physical training instructor. After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948–49. Transfer listed after an abortive move to Colombian club Millonarios, Paul joined Manchester City for £19,500 in June 1950.|$|E

This was {{only about half of}} her full passenger capacity of 2,435, as it was the low season and shipping from the UK had been <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> a coal miners' strike. Her passengers were a cross-section of Edwardian society, from millionaires such as John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim, to poor emigrants from countries as disparate as Armenia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Syria and Russia seeking a new life in America.|$|E
5|$|Charles Coghlan {{was educated}} at home until January 1870, {{when he was}} {{enrolled}} at the Jesuit St Aidan's College in Grahamstown. He was awarded a bursary to the South African College, Cape Town, where he studied law {{with the intent of}} becoming a barrister, but these plans were <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> his father's death from dysentery. Short of money, Charles quit university in 1882 and went to work for Paley and Coghlan, the law firm where his eldest brother James was a partner, in Kimberley.|$|E

5|$|Deep {{convection}} reformed the storm's center {{southwest of}} Haiti, near Jamaica's east coast. Under {{the influence of}} a mid-level ridge that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean, Gustav picked up a westward motion. It was briefly <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> Jamaica as it passed over the mountainous island but rapidly strengthened when it moved over open water once again. Reaching Category4 strength less than 24 hours after having been a tropical storm, Gustav brushed the Isle of Youth and made landfall on Cuba's western's peninsula.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disrupted</b> <b>by</b> {{mountains}} once again, Gustav never regained {{its former}} strength. Briefly traveling over a warm eddy of the Gulf Stream's loop current it encountered moderate wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures. Fluctuations in its internal structure and visible appearance did not counter the storm's general weakening trend, and Hurricane Gustav made its final landfall as a Category2 hurricane near Cocodrie, Louisiana on September 1. Moving inland, the storm quickly weakened but persisted {{as a significant}} tropical depression until it was adsorbed by a frontal boundary on September 5.|$|E
5|$|Four British athletes {{competed in}} alpine skiing {{events at the}} Games. Andy Noble and David Ryding {{qualified}} for two events each whilst Ed Drake and Chemmy Alcott, taking part in her third Olympics, qualified for all five variants. The preparations of Britain's skiers were <b>disrupted</b> <b>by</b> the collapse of Snowsport GB, but all athletes were able to enter the games after {{the intervention of the}} British Olympic Association. Alcott, considered a realistic contender for a medal, achieved the squad's best finish coming eleventh in the women's combined.|$|E
