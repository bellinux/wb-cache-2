In 1841, he joined the New Zealand Company in its venture to establish a settlement {{in the north of}} the South Island of New Zealand, to be called Nelson. As well as working as an apprentice surveyor and laying sections and roads for the new settlement, he explored the interior, seeking pastoral land <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> colony. In 1846 he undertook extensive journeys with Charles Heaphy and a Māori named Kehu towards and along the West Coast.|$|E

25|$|With an {{increased}} demand for resources and food, constant pressure was put upon the land and soil to provide food <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> economy. Regular clearing and plowing exhausted existing soil, which eventually became infertile.

25|$|The new and {{slightly}} larger St James, built of weatherboard and battens, was dedicated in 1878.

In 1968 a damaging tornado hit Kerikeri with enough force to skew St James' off line. Services had to be held elsewhere until a major repair and restoration was completed. The church bell came from HMNZS Black Prince, a light cruiser which had served with the Royal New Zealand Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} slums, over time, get established next to {{centers of}} economic activity, schools, hospitals, sources of employment, which the poor rely on. Established old slums, {{surrounded by the}} formal city infrastructure, cannot expand horizontally; therefore, they grow vertically by stacking additional rooms, sometimes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> family and sometimes {{as a source of}} rent from new arrivals in slums. Some slums name themselves after founders of political parties, locally respected historical figures, current politicians or politician's spouse to garner political backing against eviction.|$|E
25|$|Balaguer {{remained}} in power as president for 12 years.

His rule was criticized <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive Columbus Lighthouse, completed in 1992 during a later tenure.|$|E

By the 1950s, petroleum had become a staple in Trinidad's export market, and was responsible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> middle class among all sections of the Trinidad population. The collapse of Trinidad's major agricultural commodities, followed by the Depression, and the rise of the oil economy, led to major changes in the country's social structure.|$|E

A ski hut was erected at Mount Baw Baw, just 120km East of Melbourne, in 1945 and a ski rope tow added in 1955. The first ski lift went into service at Mount Buller in 1949, {{and in the same}} year a rope tow was installed at Falls Creek. In 1957, Australia's first chairlift was installed at Falls Creek, and the area is today the largest ski resort in Victoria.|$|E

In 1978, having exhausted Naa-nnn to Paa-nnn combinations Queensland reversed the format, starting at 000-NAA continuing through to 999-PZZ in 1987, when plates commencing at 000-AAA were issued. Colours were white reflective background and green lettering (later maroon). There are still a number of vehicles in Queensland with the old white-on-black Q and six black on white digits at this time. Only one of these was issued, for display at the rear.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin E was co-discovered by UA Agricultural Chemistry Professor Barnett Sure (1920–51). Sure, {{along with}} fellow {{professor}} Marinus C. Kik (1927–67) made major advances in nutrition science during their long tenures at the University of Arkansas. Sure co-discovered vitamin E, and extended {{knowledge of how}} vitamin E, amino acids and B-vitamins function on reproduction and lactation. Kik developed the process for parboiling rice (a major agricultural crop in the state) to increase retention of vitamins and shorten cooking time. He documented benefits of adding fish and chicken to rice and grain diets to provide adequate protein <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> world population. Sure and Kik were Agricultural Experiment Station scientists and professors in the UA Department of Agricultural Chemistry, which merged in 1964 with Home Economics, now the School of Human Environmental Sciences.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the race has changed little through Formula One's history. The main changes have {{revolved}} around what is allowed at pit stops. In {{the early days of}} Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in his teammate's car should his develop a problem—in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. From the 2010 season, refuelling—which was reintroduced in 1994—has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> international live television audience.|$|E
