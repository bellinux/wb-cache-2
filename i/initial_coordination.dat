50|$|Cyclometalated rhodium {{compounds}} {{constitute an}} important class of organometallic chemistry. Although such compounds are well {{documented in the}} literature rhodium(III) cyclometalates with azo function are spare. A typical example of this category viz. novel hexacoordinated orthometalated rhodium(III) thiolato complex trans-Rh(C∧N∧S)Cl(PPh3)2 was synthesized from benzyl 2-(phenylazo)phenyl thioether and RhCl3·3H2O {{in the presence of}} excess PPh3 via in situ C(sp2)−H and C(sp3)−S bond scissions. This is the first example for a coordination compound of (phenylazo)thiolate ligand.

40|$|Metal {{coordination}} {{is a key}} {{structural and}} functional component of a large fraction of proteins. Given this dual role we considered the possibility that metal coordination {{may have played a}} templating role in the early evolution of protein folds and complexes.

Using a folded monomeric protein, cytochrome cb 562, as a building block we show that its non-self-associating surface can be made self-associating through a minimal number of mutations that enable Zn coordination. The protein interfaces in the resulting Zn-directed, D 2 -symmetrical tetramer are subsequently redesigned, yielding unique protein architectures that self-assemble in {{the presence or absence of}} metals.

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} {{verification of}} S-MAC, a {{medium access control}} protocol designed for wireless sensor networks, {{by means of the}} PRISM model checker. The S-MAC protocol is built on top of the IEEE 802. 11 standard for wireless ad hoc networks and, as such, it uses the same randomised backoff procedure as a means to avoid collision. In order to minimise energy consumption, in S-MAC, nodes are periodically put into a sleep state. Synchronisation of the sleeping schedules is necessary for the nodes to be able to communicate. Intuitively, energy saving obtained through a periodic sleep mechanism will be at the expense of performance. In previous work on S-MAC verification [25], a combination of analytical techniques and simulation has been used to confirm the correctness of this intuition for a simplified (abstract) version of the protocol in which the <b>initial</b> schedules <b>coordination</b> phase is assumed correct.

40|$|Many {{analyses}} of <b>initial</b> <b>coordination</b> {{are based on}} the view that elements like either, both and neither are conjunctions.

This not only accounts for their relatively free distribution but also explains the restrictions that are posed on their possible surface positions by focus and intonation. In addition, the scopal effects that have been observed in either-or constructions can be explained. The behavior of English either and Dutch of with disjunctions thus suggests a complex interaction between syntactic, prosodic and discourse-semantic information in the process of sentence generation. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} feature of human locomotion is its instant adaptability to unpredictable changes in the conditions affecting gait. Humans can, for example, seamlessly adapt their gait to successive unpredictably fluctuating perturbations, e. g., a series of oncoming collisions with other people in a crowded street. Based on neurophysiological evidence, theoretical studies of bipedal locomotion have revealed that a basic walking gait is generated by a coupled system composed of a central pattern generator (CPG) and the body itself. Modeling studies from a neurophysiological and biomechanichal perspective have referred to the leg posture {{at the beginning of}} the stance phase of the step cycle as the initial state, since it determines the subsequent behavior of the system with regard to whether or not it continues to walk. Such modeling studies have shown that <b>coordination</b> of the <b>initial</b> state can induce the coupled system composed of a CPG and body to adapt to various strong perturbations.

This behavioral rule is related to bounded-rationality models of Rosenthal (1989) and Schlag (1998). Moreover, agents stay with their strategy in case they successfully coordinate with their local neighbors. Our main results show that both strict Nash equilibria of the coordination game correspond to invariant distributions of the process, hence evolution of play is not ergodic but instead depends on <b>initial</b> conditions.
