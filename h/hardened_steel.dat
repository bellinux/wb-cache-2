Typical moulds are constructed from <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. <b>Hardened</b> <b>steel</b> moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts.

40|$|Typical {{products}} made of case <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> are transmission parts like gear wheels, pinions and crown wheels. Case hardening produces a carbon-rich surface {{and provides the}} parts with both enhanced hardness and fatigue life. However, variations in machinability are regularly observed when producing the same part out of different material batches. This leads to a non-robust production process with increased manufacturing costs as well as unforeseen stops and maintenance of machines. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in case <b>hardening</b> <b>steels.</b> Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite. Since a homogeneous material is required, relatively small sample diameters had to be used. Therefore, the machinability ranking (with respect to tool wear) was performed with help of the Volvo Standard Machinability Test which is a short-term test. Additionally, chip breakability was evaluated and measurements of cutting forces and surface roughness were performed. The tests have shown that a case <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> with larger pearlite nodular size (produced by a higher austenitizing temperature) provides better chip breakability but also an increased tool wear compared to a material with smaller pearlite nodular size. Hence, to achieve a more robust production process for case <b>hardening</b> <b>steels,</b> it might be necessary to include pearlite nodular size and/or amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite in the materials specification. Moreover, the different tests have revealed that hardness is not a suitable criterion for machinability...|$|R

The maximum revolutions of a rotary engine is limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. <b>Hardened</b> <b>steel</b> gears are used for extended operation above 7000 or 8000rpm.

Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used.
