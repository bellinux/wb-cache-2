During the voting for the appointment, however, the rest of the Communist Party and Lytvyn Bloc were absent together with Ivan Plyushch from Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc. Beside that for some reason the electronic counting system of the parliament seemed to malfunction and did not count votes of two parliamentarians showing only 225 approving votes.|$|E

5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his <b>first</b> <b>word</b> in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E

The rest of the Cybermen painfully experience the emotions they have repressed from Craig's struggle, and their circuits start to overload. The Doctor and Craig escape via the teleporter as the ship explodes, the blast contained by the cavern. Craig reunites with Alfie, while the Doctor slips away unseen. Craig returns home to find the Doctor already there, having used time travel to clean the house. The Doctor tells Craig that Alfie now has a much higher opinion of his dad.

5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's <b>first</b> <b>word</b> appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{describing how}} brand names with English in Indonesian products are created. To {{analyze the data}} found the researchers applied English word formation in English morphology. This is a descriptive research. The data were brand names using English found in Indonesian product which were taken from three supermarkets in Solo namely Hypermart Solo Grand Mall, Hypermart Gorro Assalam, and Carefur from February up to April 2010. The research found that the brand names with English in Indonesian products can be created by applying word formation such as compounding, blending, affixation, reduplication, onomatopoeia, abbreviation, acronym and clipping. The process of compounding consists of pure compounding and modification compounding, The process of blending includes the first syllable of the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and the <b>first</b> syllable of the second <b>words,</b> the <b>first</b> syllable of the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and the second syllable {{from the front of}} the second <b>words.,</b> the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and the last syllables of the second <b>words,</b> the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and two syllables {{from the front of the}} second words, two syllables from the front of the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and the second words, two syllables from the front of the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and the <b>first</b> syllable of the second <b>words,</b> the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and the two last syllables from the back of the second <b>words,</b> and the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> and the <b>first</b> syllables of the second words. The affixation process covers prefixes pro-, -bio and suffixes –y, - er, -ness, -ish, and –s. The process of reduplication includes pure modification, modification with intensifier meaning and reduplication with sound change. The process of abbreviation found is pure abbreviation and acronym. The process of clipping includes the clipping of letter and syllables...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the difference in <b>first</b> <b>words</b> between typically developing children and language impaired children. Data were collected from ２２８ typically developing children and ２１ language-impaired children. The data include questions to caretakers such as the period of the first-words production, the sound of the first-words production, the meaning of the first-words production, and the impression of the parents about their children’s first-words development. The following {{is the result of the}} questionnaire: Of the typically developing children, approximately ９０% produced their <b>first</b> <b>words</b> by １５ months of age. A majority of the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> consist of “ma-ma” meaning “mother” in Japanese. The second frequently uttered words are “mam-ma” meaning “food” in Japanese. The parents of typically developing children noticed when their children did not produce their <b>first</b> <b>words</b> by １７ to １８ months of age. A majority of the language impaired children did not produce their <b>first</b> <b>words</b> before １７ month years old. In some cases, the production of the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> did not occur until four years old. The content of the <b>first</b> <b>words</b> were the same in most cases for both the typically developing and the language impaired children. However, the language impaired children uttered such words as “o-wa-ri” meaning “finish” in Japanese and “go” in English. These words were not identified in the production of the typically developing children. These results suggest that the first-words production is delayed in the language impaired children, and some of the words produced by the impaired children are different from those produced by the typically developing children. 子どもが初めて発する意味ある音声表出を初語という．本研究では，定型発達児と言語発達障害児の初語について検討した．対象は定型発達児２２８例と言語発達障害児２１例であった．対象児の保護者に初語に関するアンケートないし問診を行い，初語の時期，初語発語，初語の意味内容，初語表出時期についての感想を聴取した．主な知見は以下であった．定型発達児では約９０％が１５か月までに初語が表出されていた．初語には「ママ」が最も多く，その意味はお母さんであった．次に多いのは「マンマ」であり，その意味内容は食べ物であった．定型発達児の保護者にとって初語が遅いと感じ始める時期は１７～１８か月頃からであった．言語発達障害児の多くは，初語表出期時期が１７か月以降で，４歳を過ぎても初語がない例も認められた．言語発達障害児の初語の多くは定型発達児と同じであったが，「おわり」や「ゴー」といった定型発達児では認められない初語があった．以上の結果から，言語発達障害児では初語が遅れること，初語が定型発達児とは異なる可能性が示唆される...|$|R
