5|$|The <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> of the Sun {{is based}} upon {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E

40|$|Large {{amount of}} such {{renewable}} <b>energy</b> <b>generations</b> as wind/photovoltaic generations {{directly connected to}} grid acting as distributed generations will cause control, protection, security, and safety problems. Microgrid, which has advantages in usage and control of distributed generations, is a promising approach to coordinate the conflict between distributed generations and the grid. Regarded as mobile power storages, batteries of electric vehicles can depress the fluctuation of power through the {{point of common coupling}} of microgrid. This paper presents a control strategy for microgrid containing renewable <b>energy</b> <b>generations</b> and electric vehicles. The control strategy uses current control for renewable <b>energy</b> <b>generations</b> under parallel-to-grid mode, and uses master-slave control under islanding mode. Simulations and laboratory experiments prove that the control strategy works well for microgrid containing renewable <b>energy</b> <b>generations</b> and electric vehicles and provides maximum power output of renewable energy and a stable and sustainable running under islanding mode...|$|R

5|$|When a {{main-sequence star}} consumes the {{hydrogen}} at its core, {{the loss of}} <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> causes its gravitational collapse to resume. Stars with less than 0.23 , are predicted to directly become white dwarfs when <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> by nuclear fusion of hydrogen at their core comes to a halt. In stars between this threshold and 10 , the hydrogen surrounding the helium core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, {{turning it into a}} red giant. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. The path which the star now follows across the HR diagram, to the upper right of the main sequence, is called an evolutionary track.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{renewable}} <b>energy</b> <b>generations</b> in Hong Kong based on realistic meteorological data, {{and find that}} different renewable sources exhibit diverse time-varying and location-dependent profiles. To efficiently explore and utilize the diverse renewable <b>energy</b> <b>generations,</b> we propose a theoretical framework for the cooperative planning of renewable generations {{in a system of}} interconnected microgrids. The cooperative framework considers the self-interested behaviors of microgrids, and incorporates both their long-term investment costs and short-term operational costs over the planning horizon. Specifically, interconnected microgrids jointly decide where and how much to deploy renewable <b>energy</b> <b>generations,</b> and how to split the associated investment cost. We show that the cooperative framework minimizes the overall system cost. We also design a fair cost sharing method based on Nash bargaining to incentivize cooperative planning, such that all microgrids will benefit from cooperative planning. Using realistic data obtained from the Hong Kong observatory, we validate the cooperative planning framework, and demonstrate that all microgrids benefit through the cooperation, and the overall system cost is reduced by 35. 9 % compared to the noncooperative planning benchmark.

5|$|Main-sequence stars employ {{two types}} of {{hydrogen}} fusion processes, {{and the rate of}} <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> from each type depends on the temperature in the core region. Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is primarily generated {{as the result of the}} proton-proton chain, which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such as <b>energy</b> <b>generation,</b> use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack}} of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E

5|$|When a {{protostar}} {{is formed}} from {{the collapse of}} a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E

The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass <b>energy</b> <b>generation,</b> as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E

In this study, an elastic ring laminated with a piezoelectric layer on the inner surface is utilized as the basic structure for energy harvesting. The piezoelectric layer is uniformly segmented into several energy harvesting patches for practical applications. The generated electrical energy resulting from modal voltages is analyzed under the open-circuit condition. Two modal <b>energy</b> <b>generations</b> are evaluated: one is the energy induced by the membrane oscillation and the other is the energy induced by the bending oscillation. For practical design applications, <b>energy</b> <b>generations</b> are evaluated with respect to ring radius, piezoelectric layer thickness, ring thickness and segment size. The maximal energy of all harvester patches on the ring is calculated to determine the optimal patch locations with respect to various ring modes. By summing up energies generated from all harvesters on the ring, the overall energy is also evaluated Based on the normalizations and assumptions of parameters, results indicate that the larger the segment size is, the less the energy can be generated...|$|R
5|$|The mass, radius and {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} {{are closely}} interlinked, and their respective values can be approximated by three relations. First is the Stefan–Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity L, the radius R and the surface temperature Teff. Second is the mass–luminosity relation, which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally, the relationship between M and R is close to linear. The ratio of M to R increases {{by a factor of}} only three over 2.5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star's inner temperature TI, and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> in the core strongly depends on this temperature, whereas it has to fit the mass–luminosity relation. Thus, a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability.|$|E
