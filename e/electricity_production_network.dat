40|$|A rapid {{method for}} sizing and placing of {{distributed}} electricity generation (DES) systems in an electric transmission network {{in respect to}} voltage has been developed and successfully validated. The new tool presented is in particularly useful for avoiding overvoltage situations, which are critical for the whole electricity system. The results show that DES placement closer to the transformer side is always more beneficial in terms of voltage than {{at the end of}} the line. Depending on the size of the DES unit, both up and downstream flow of power may occur. The method can be used for investigating a range of different placement and sizing configurations.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of methane and <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> from sewage sludge in a two-chamber {{microbial fuel cell}} (MFC) was studied. The results showed that methane production in the anode chamber could enhance the <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> from sewage sludge, and the output voltage of the MFC with methane production (0. 505 - 0. 600 V) was {{higher than that of}} the MFC without it (0. 506 - 0. 576 V) in the stable electricity-producing stage. The polarization curves analysis of the two MFCs suggested that methane production could improve the performance characteristics of the MFC. Simultaneous methane and <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> from sludge in the two-chamber MFC could maintain the mixed sludge in a suitable pH range in the anode chamber for <b>electricity</b> <b>production.</b> Meanwhile, simultaneous methane and <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> could enhance the hydrolysis of sludge, which increased the reduction of sludge concentration (about 8. 31 % VSS) and offered more substrates to alleviate the competition between methane and <b>electricity</b> <b>production.</b> Additionally, the addition of 2 -Bromoethanesulfonate (BES) could substantially affect the dominant archaea but had little effect on the dominant bacteria in the anode chamber.

Three national <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> scenarios such as S 1 -Business-As-Usual, S 2 -Oﬃcial Government Plan and S 3 -Go-Green Plan are analyzed to help policy makers to estimate the consequences of energy investment scenarios on resource footprint based on 19 minerals from 12 diﬀerent <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> sectors.

However, under business-as-usual scenario in UK, 84. 6 % of metallic mineral and 81. 4 % of nonmetallic mineral consumption will be due to <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> from coal and natural gas combined while coal alone will constitute to about 41 % of the nonmetallic mineral consumption in 2050. In addition, the nonmetallic mineral consumption by <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> from coal and natural gas in UK will be around 95. 5 % by 2050 under all three scenarios.
