5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|In {{the current}} fast5 format, {{when a team}} uses it in a quarter, all goals scored by that team are worth twice as normal. A shooter that scores a goal within 3.5 meters from the goal post scores two points instead of one. Four points (instead of two) <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> was scored at least 3.5 meters away from the goal post but within the goal circle. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> was scored from outside of the goal circle (known as a super goal), six points is scored instead of three. The winner of the coin toss chooses which quarter to have this power play and the other team must choose a {{different}} quarter for their power play. This prevents both teams from having their power plays in the same quarter.|$|E

5000|$|Once all nursing {{intervention}} actions have taken place, the nurse completes an evaluation to determine <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> for patient wellness have been met. The possible patient outcomes are generally described under three terms: patient;s condition improved, patient's condition stabilised, and patient's condition deteriorated.

25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of chainring must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> is to switch to the next higher or lower gear ratio.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> of shorter-term {{therapy is}} for {{patients}} {{to understand that}} they are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970s, transformations like HSV or HSI were used as a {{compromise}} between effectiveness for segmentation and computational complexity. They {{can be thought of}} as similar in approach and intent to the neural processing used by human color vision, without agreeing in particulars: <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> is object detection, roughly separating hue, lightness, and chroma or saturation is effective, but there is no particular reason to strictly mimic human color response. John Kender’s 1976 master’s thesis proposed the HSI model. Ohta et al. (1980) instead used a model made up of dimensions similar to those we have called I, α, and β. In recent years, such models have continued to see wide use, as their performance compares favorably with more complex models, and their computational simplicity remains compelling.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{method for}} determining sentiment {{is the use}} of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a −10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing, each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score. This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment, because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the {{competition}} changed from 1954: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played {{each of the other}} teams in its group at least once, without extra time {{in the event of a}} draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points then goal average would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> averages were equal then lots would have been drawn. These arrangements had not been finalised by the time the tournament started and were still being debated as it progressed. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off. This was overturned when the Swedish Football Association complained, ostensibly that it was wrong to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.|$|E

40|$|Goal {{attainment}} scaling is {{a mathematical}} technique for quantifying the achievement (or otherwise) of goals set, {{and it can}} be used in rehabilitation. Because several different approaches are described in the literature, this article presents a simple practical approach to encourage uniformity in its application. It outlines the process of setting goals appropriately, so that the achievement of each goal can be measured on a 5 -point scale ranging from 2 to þ 2, and then explains a method for quantifying the outcome in a single aggregated goal attainment score. This method gives a numerical T-score which is normally distributed about a mean of 50 (<b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> are achieved precisely) {{with a standard deviation of}} around this mean of 10 (<b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> are overachieved or underachieved). <b>If</b> desired, <b>the</b> approach encompasses weighting of <b>goals</b> to reflect <b>the</b> opinion of the patient on the personal importance of <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> and <b>the</b> opinion of the therapist or team on the difficulty of achieving <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> Some practical tips are offered, as well as a simple spreadsheet (in Microsoft Excel) allowing easy calculation of the T-scores...|$|R

500|$|In practice, {{computational}} addition may {{be achieved}} via XOR and AND bitwise logical operations {{in conjunction with}} bitshift operations {{as shown in the}} pseudocode below. Both XOR and AND gates are straightforward to realize in digital logic allowing the realization of full adder circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all floating-point operations as well as such basic tasks as address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching. To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in parallel; these schemes go by such names as carry select, carry lookahead, and the Ling pseudocarry. Many implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs. Unlike addition on paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient abacus and adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early Latin texts often claimed that in the process of adding [...] "a number to a number", both numbers vanish. In modern times, the ADD instruction of a microprocessor often replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the addend.

The result shows that many of the students taking part in the study do not understand what they are supposed to learn in PE. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> are well articulated by teachers, the students are more likely to both understand and be aware of the learning outcomes and what to learn in PE.
