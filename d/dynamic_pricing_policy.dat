We analyze {{the difference between a}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> and a list price capacity control policy. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> adjusts prices steadily resolving the underlying problem every time step, whereas the list pricing policy sets static prices once but controls the capacity by allowing or preventing product sales. As steady price changes are often costly or unachievable in practice, we investigate the question of how much riskier it is to apply a list pricing policy rather than a <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> We conduct several numerical experiments and compare expected revenue, standard deviation, and conditional-value-at-risk between the pricing policies. The differences between the policies show that list pricing can be a useful strategy when dynamic pricing is costly or impractical. conditional value at risk, capacity control, dynamic pricing, revenue management, risk...|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamic pricing}} problem that arises in are venue {{management}} context is considered, involving several resources and several demand classes, {{each of which}} uses a particular subset of the resources. The arrival rates of demand are determined by prices, which can be dynamically controlled. When a demand arrives, it pays the posted price for its class and consumes a quantity of each resource commensurate with its class. The time horizon is finite: at time T the demands cease, and a terminal reward (possibly negative) is received {{that depends on the}} unsold capacity of each resource. The problem is to choose a <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> to maximize the expected total reward. When viewed in diffusion scale, the problem gives rise to a diffusion control problem whose solution is a Brownian bridge on the time interval [0, T]. We prove diffusion-scale asymptotic optimality ofa <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> that mimics the behavior of the Brownian bridge. The 'target point' of the Brownian bridge is obtained as the solution of a finite dimensional optimization problem whose structure depends on the terminal reward.

40|$|The {{exchange}} {{of goods and services}} is affected by pricing policies, of which there are two broad categories: posted-price mechanisms (take-it-or-leave-it pricing), and price-discovery mechanisms (auction pricing). In the past, companies fixed prices of a product for a relatively long time period; i. e., prices were considered static. The reason for this strategy is found in the absence of accurate demand information, high transaction costs associated with changing prices, and huge investment in software and hardware to implement a dynamic pricing strategy. Although dynamically posted prices are also take-it-or-leave-it prices, the seller can dynamically change prices over time. The goal here is to balance demand and supply via dynamic pricing. Early adopters of dynamic pricing methods are commonly found in industries where the short-term capacity is difficult to change such as airlines, and hotels. Most of these industries operate in a centralized fashion, which allows prices to be changed at little or no cost. Contrasting to the former are retail-like industries, for whom short-term supply is more flexible but price changes are costly. ^ The primary focus of this research is on the latter type industry. We consider a two-echelon supply chain with a single retailer and a single supplier for whom we develop a <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy,</b> which optimizes the net profit in the presence of costly price changes. Besides that cost, we consider that under a <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> costs for buyers are uncertain. This uncertainty is addressed in an optimal order policy. In addition, repeated buyer seller interaction in a dynamic pricing setting requires the incorporation of buyer behavior and, therefore, it is included in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> ^ The results we obtain are twofold. First, we show that the use of dynamic pricing is beneficial to the individual node, but when applied to multiple nodes in a supply chain environment results in price amplification, or price bullwhip. Second, we observe that the cost for changing price is the unique contributor to 2 ̆ 2 sticky prices 2 ̆ 2, prices that remain fixed for a certain period of time. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{develop a}} market-based {{mechanism}} that enables a building Smart Microgrid Operator (SMO) to offer regulation service reserves {{and meet the}} associated obligation of fast re-sponse to commands issued by the wholesale market Independent System Operator (ISO) who provides energy and purchases reserves. The proposed market-based mechanism allows the SMO to control the behavior of internal loads through price signals and to provide feedback to the ISO. A regulation service reserves quantity is transacted between the SMO and the ISO for a relatively {{long period of time}} (e. g., a one hour long time-scale). During this period the ISO follows shorter time-scale stochastic dynamics to repeatedly request from the SMO to decrease or increase its consumption. We model the operational task of selecting an optimal short time-scale <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy</b> as a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes average SMO and ISO utility. We then formulate an associated non-linear programming static problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal utility. We study an asymptotic regime in which this upper bound is shown to be tight and the static policy provides an efficient approximation of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>policy.</b> Equally importantly, this framework allows us to optimize the long time-scale decision of determining the optimal regulation service reserve quantity. We demonstrate, verify and validate the proposed approach through a series of Monte Carlo simulations of the controlled system time trajectories.
