50|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>jettisoning</b> or <b>fuel</b> dumping is an {{emergency}} procedure used by crews of to reduce an aircraft's weight in {{an emergency}} when the aircraft needs to land safely.|$|R
50|$|Fuel dumping (or a <b>fuel</b> <b>jettison)</b> is a {{procedure}} used by aircraft in certain emergency situations before {{a return to}} the airport shortly after takeoff, or before landing short of its intended destination (emergency landing) to reduce the aircraft's weight.|$|R
50|$|Surveyor 1 {{required}} {{a total of}} about 63 hours (2.6 days) to reach the Moon, and Surveyor 5 required 65 hours (2.7 days). The launch weights (at lunar injection) of the seven Surveyors ranged from 995.2 kg to 1040 kg, and their landing weights (minus <b>fuel,</b> <b>jettisoned</b> retrorocket, and radar unit) ranged from 294.3 kg to 306 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Most Marks {{were divided}} into [...] "Series" [...] to {{distinguish}} differences in equipment. The ST Mk I Series 1 (eight aircraft) had the four gun turret replaced with hand operated twin-guns under a sliding hood. As a special transport, a loading door was fitted on the starboard side; the rear fuel tank was removed. The 14 ST Mk I Series 2 aircraft were equipped with gear for towing gliders. The Mk II could carry 10 paratroops and the Mk V was essentially the same but with a <b>fuel</b> <b>jettison</b> capability. All production Albemarles were powered {{by a pair of}} [...] Bristol Hercules XI radial engines.|$|R
50|$|A third {{prototype}} flew on 25 February 1939 with Jumo 211A {{engines in}} place of the DB 601s. On 15 August 1939 and 23 January 1940, the aircraft was flown to Rechlin, where it was tested in night flying trials. A number of the flights were to assess the performance of the new Siemens navigation aids under development. At the same time, Dornier also carried out <b>fuel</b> <b>jettisoning</b> and drop tank trials using the standardized 900 l capacity, vertical-finned drop tanks pioneered by the Bf 110D extended-range heavy fighter. As with the Do 17, the test team tried several tail configurations with the Do 217 V3. Single, double and triangular-planform assemblies were tried. These designs were used in the Do 217 M-3, M-9 and Dornier Do 317.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the increased fuel load of the late model Il-76, the Il-78 has two removable 18,230-litre fuel tanks installed in the freight hold, giving transferable loads of 85,720 kg (with hold tanks) or 57,720 kg (without). Controlled from the gunner station, which is stripped of military equipment, three aircraft can refuel in flight simultaneously from the UPAZ-1A (Il-78) / UPAZ-1M (IL-78M) 26m refuelling pods fitted to the outer wings and rear fuselage. In addition, four aircraft can also be refuelled on the ground using conventional refuelling hoses extending from the freight hold. Because of the aircraft's high all-up weight after takeoff, which in an emergency would mean landing at weights well in excess of maximum allowable landing weight, the Il-78 has a <b>fuel</b> <b>jettison</b> system with jettison ports at the wingtips.|$|R
50|$|For {{emergency}} landings at sea the Fi 167 could <b>jettison</b> its landing <b>gear,</b> and airtight compartments in {{the lower}} wing would help the aircraft stay afloat at least {{long enough for the}} two-man crew to evacuate.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, {{after being}} {{established}} as a wildlife refuge in 1937, the island {{was used by the}} United States Army for artillery practice during World War II. Although the wildlife population and the lighthouse were not significantly damaged, the keeper's house was destroyed. It is also reported that <b>fuel</b> tanks <b>jettisoned</b> by dive bombers can still be found on the island.|$|R
5000|$|September 18-19, 1980: the Damascus Accident, {{occurred}} in Damascus, Arkansas, where a Titan missile {{equipped with a}} nuclear warhead exploded. The accident {{was caused by a}} maintenance man who dropped a socket from a socket wrench down an 80-foot shaft, puncturing a fuel tank on the rocket. Leaking fuel resulted in a hypergolic <b>fuel</b> explosion, <b>jettisoning</b> the W-53 warhead beyond the launch site.|$|R
25|$|The Shaldag commandos were extracted, and all Israeli {{aircraft}} {{returned to}} base. On {{their way back}} to Israel, the aircraft flew over Turkey and <b>jettisoned</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks over the Hatay and Gaziantep provinces.|$|R
5|$|Six B.2s {{converted}} for air-to-air refuelling with Mark 17 Hose Drum Unit (HDU) mounted semi-recessed in tail cone. TFR deleted. Fitted {{with three}} bomb-bay drum tanks, {{it was the}} only mark of Vulcan that could <b>jettison</b> <b>fuel</b> in an emergency.|$|R
5000|$|After that Lieutenant Calvi had his men {{open fire}} again, making Jones {{believe that a}} battle had begun in earnest so he slowed his ship to allow the Inghams {{broadside}} guns to be brought into action. Calvi exploited this opportunity to disengage and {{he headed for the}} shore, <b>jettisoning</b> <b>gear</b> and weapons along the way to lighten the schooner, increase her speed, and to shorten the vessel's draft in order to cross the bars of the Rio Grande. Calvi, for unknown reasons, did not sail into port; instead he anchored with his broadside facing the Ingham. The alarm was also raised and Mexican Army troops reinforced the Montezuma. Soon after that the Mexicans were back in sail and they resumed their firing on the American cutter. Calvi stayed close to shore so the remainder of the engagement was a long range gunnery duel. Captain Jones attempted to cut the Mexicans off by getting in between the Montezuma and the harbor's entrance but Calvi was [...] "too far to the leeward" [...] for that to be done. By 12:00 the Mexicans were unable to escape the pursuing Ingham so Clavi chose to run his ship [...] "into the Breakers & on the Bar" [...] which caused heavy damage to the Montezuma. Jones considered shelling the wreck but he later decided against this and broke off the action now that the enemy was no longer a threat.|$|R
25|$|Stephens flew {{nearly all}} jet fighter {{aircraft}} of the 1940s and 1950s era from the F-80 Shooting Star to the F-106 Delta Dart. He flight tested the YF-100A, YF-102, XF-104, X-5, X-1B, Navy F2H3, F4D, the F-94 series, F-86, F-89D, F-89H, and YF-101. He served as test {{director for the}} F-104 program and performed the first wingtip <b>fuel</b> tank <b>jettison</b> test. On this flight, the fuel tanks slammed into the fuselage of the F-104 instead of falling free. Stephens made an emergency landing and saved the aircraft. Working with Lockheed engineers and other aviation consultants, he helped solve this and other problems with the F-104.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was an all-metal structure {{built in}} three main sections. These {{consisted of the}} nose section, which accommodated the crew; the section built integrally with the wing centre section; and the rear fuselage. The main structure was built out of the standard stringer and former skeleton design, to which stressed skin was riveted.The centre and rear sections were divided in the horizontal plane to {{within a couple of}} metres of the tail. The lower half of the fuselage contained the bomb cells, while the remainder and upper parts contained the bracing frames which supported and kept the bomb load secure.In {{the lower half of the}} fuselage the bomb bay stretched past the trailing edge wing roots to nearly a quarter of the way down the rear fuselage. Extra doors were added for torpedo operations against Naval targets. The extreme rear of the fuselage contained stowage space for anti-shipping weapons.In the upper fuselage, directly above the forward bomb cells in the centre section, just aft of the cockpit, the 242 gallon fuel tank was located. Attached to this was a <b>fuel</b> <b>jettisoning</b> pipe which was fitted to the roof of the fuselage and ran along it to the tail of the aircraft. It declined and exited the fuselage behind the tail wheel to allow fuel dumping in an emergency.Above the two rear bomb cells in the centre section, a dinghy stowage place was created. To protect its very vulnerable structure against enemy fire, it was placed in a heavily armoured case. Either side of the dinghy, aft of the 242 imp gal fuel tank, and directly above the rear bomb bay, were the oxygen bottles.|$|R
50|$|Miss Veedol was a 1931 Bellanca CH-400 or Bellanca J-300 Long-Distance Special, {{registration}} NR796W. It {{was built}} at Bellanca Airfield in New Castle, Delaware. It could carry 696 usgal L of fuel. Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon modified Miss Veedol while {{being held in}} Japan on unfounded suspicions of spying {{to be able to}} carry more fuel, {{and to be able to}} <b>jettison</b> the landing <b>gear.</b> Miss Veedol carried an initial load of 915 usgal L of aviation gasoline on her record-breaking flight.|$|R
50|$|Pangborn and Herndon {{finally took}} off on October 4, 1931, from Sabishiro Beach, Misawa, Aomori, Japan. Their {{destination}} was Seattle, Washington, just under 5500 miles (8,500 km) away, a distance exceeding Charles Lindbergh's flight from New York to Paris by 2,000 miles. Three hours after takeoff, a problem arose: the device intended to <b>jettison</b> the landing <b>gear</b> partially failed. The gear was ejected, but the two root struts remained. Pangborn had to climb out onto the wing supports barefoot at 14,000 feet to remove them.|$|R
50|$|Up to this point, the Iraqis {{had fired}} {{most of their}} SAMs ballistically. Within a short time of the Weasel call that they were leaving, SAMs {{directly}} engaged Nichols' flight. Many SAMs were now guided {{and most of his}} flight had to take evasive action, which included “last-ditch maneuvers” such as <b>jettisoning</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks and bombs. Approximately half of the flight struck the oil refinery; others were en route to alternate targets when SAMs engaged and forced them to jettison ordnance.|$|R
50|$|S-39s fifth patrol (now under Francis E. Brown), delayed twice by {{mechanical}} {{failures and}} once by {{the necessity of}} hospitalizing her executive officer, began on 10 August. Assigned station off New Ireland, {{she made her way}} across the Coral Sea to the Louisiades. On the night of 13/14 August, she grounded on submerged rocks off Rossel Island and took on a 35° port list. S-39 immediately blew ballast tanks dry and <b>jettisoned</b> <b>fuel</b> to lighten ship, then backed emergency, to no avail. Heavy seas pounded her and pushed her farther up on the rocks.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all {{the weights}} {{mentioned}} above in [...] "Overview and basic terminology" [...] {{may be subject}} to minimum and/or maximum values. Due to stress on the wheels and undercarriage when landing, the maximum safe landing weight may be considerably less than the maximum safe brake-release weight. In such cases, an aircraft that encounters some emergency and has to land immediately after taking off may have to circle for a while to use up <b>fuel,</b> or else <b>jettison</b> some <b>fuel,</b> or else land immediately and risk having the undercarriage collapse.|$|R

50|$|On October 5, 1931, East Wenatchee {{became part}} of {{aviation}} history. Having taken off from Misawa, Japan, pilots Clyde Pangborn and Hugh Herndon Jr. safely belly-landed their Bellanca airplane, Miss Veedol, on a nearby airstrip known then as Fancher Field. After take off, the pilots intentionally <b>jettisoned</b> the landing <b>gear</b> to conserve fuel. This flight was the first nonstop flight across the Pacific Ocean. In honor of this pioneering flight, East Wenatchee's airport is called Pangborn Memorial Airport, the Pangborn-Herndon Memorial Site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is nearby, and Miss Veedols propeller is displayed in the Wenatchee Valley Museum & Cultural Center.|$|R
5000|$|After {{leave in}} Sydney, Australia, Buchanan joined {{the screen of}} TF 15. On 30 April 1943, while {{screening}} in convoy, the ship ran aground off the southern coast of Guadalcanal and, after <b>jettisoning</b> heavy <b>gear</b> and ammunition, she was eased off the reef by three tugs. She proceeded to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, for repairs. Repairs completed, she participated in the New Georgia Group operations (30 June - 13 July) and while under heavy attack she effectively bombarded the enemy shore batteries during the invasion of Rendova. She participated in the bombardment of Munda (12 July) and the Battle of Kolombangara (13 July). Buchanan was damaged when she collided with the destroyer [...] during the latter engagement and retired to Nouméa for repairs. During the ensuing months, Buchanan convoyed ships to Nouméa, Espiritu Santo, and Guadalcanal. She participated in the Treasury-Bougainville operation (1-11 November), {{taking part in the}} Rabaul and Buka-Bonis strikes. Next, as a unit of TF 38, she bombarded Shortland Island and Bougainville (8 and 13 January 1944).

50|$|Sara {{tries to}} regain control, but a loose bolt has jammed the elevator. Only able to climb, they fly into a storm and lose radio contact. Sara {{explains}} {{that with the}} elevator jammed, they will keep climbing until they run out of fuel or reach the aircraft's ceiling. They have less than an hour's worth of fuel left; Bruce has a panic attack and is put to sleep with a choke hold by Sal. In an effort to save <b>fuel,</b> they <b>jettison</b> everything overboard. The only way to unjam the tail is to climb outside and manually remove the obstacle. Cory, who has experience as a climber, volunteers. He has climbing gear with him and a rope for to use as an anchor. Sal wraps the rope around himself and after some difficulty, Cory {{makes it to the}} tail and removes the errant bolt. Sal then sees a horrifyingly giant tentacle among the clouds and loses control of the rope. Cory slips and Sal is almost pulled out of the aircraft. Panicking, he cuts the rope and Cory falls, only to be caught by the monster tentacle.|$|R
50|$|In May 2014 a {{video that}} went viral showed a {{commercial}} passenger airplane landing on a foggy night, which {{was described as}} emitting chemtrails. Discovery News pointed out that passengers sitting behind the wings would clearly see anything being sprayed, which would defeat any intent to be secretive, and that the purported chemical emission was normal air disruption caused by the wings, visible due to the fog. In October 2014, Englishman Chris Bovey filmed a video of a plane <b>jettisoning</b> <b>fuel</b> on a flight from Buenos Aires to London, which had to dump fuel to lighten its load for an emergency landing in São Paulo. The clip went viral on Facebook, with nearly 3 million views and over 47,000 shares, cited as evidence of chemtrails.|$|R
5|$|The {{mission was}} given the go-ahead; the Horsas were {{modified}} to <b>jettison</b> their landing <b>gear</b> after takeoff to reduce drag, while the Halifax bombers were modified with long-range fuel tanks fitted in the bomb bays. The pilots for the gliders came from No.2 Wing, having been left in England {{when most of the}} wing departed for Tunisia earlier in the year. An eleven-week period of training followed, during which four crashes killed thirteen men. At a mission conference on 21 May 1943, hosted by No. 38 Wing RAF, the impossibility of training the bomber crews to tow the gliders and deliver forty gliders to North Africa was discussed. In the end it was decided that as a priority ten bomber crews would be fully trained to deliver around fifteen gliders to North Africa by 21 June.|$|R
25|$|The Britannia Empress of Lima {{was on a}} {{scheduled}} flight from Honolulu Airport, Hawaii to Nadi Airport, Fiji. Shortly after take-off the crew had an engine fire warning, they feathered No. 1 engine and they <b>jettisoned</b> <b>fuel</b> before returning to Honolulu 40 minutes later. The three-engined approach appeared to be normal {{but at the last}} minute the crew decided to go-around and attempt another approach. The aircraft banked and veered to the left and the left wing tip hit the ground about 550 feet left from the center over the runway. The aircraft then disintegrated as it moved across the airfield before hitting some heavy earth-moving equipment. Apart from the rear fuselage and tail the aircraft was destroyed by fire, thirteen on board escaped but seven crew and 20 passengers were killed.|$|R
50|$|Occupying over 150000 sqm sq ft of {{land and}} hangars, {{it is one of}} the oldest {{aviation}} museums in the world. The museum's collection contains more than 19,595 items, including 150 aircraft, and material from as far back as the 16th Century. Also displayed are more modern air and spacecraft, including the prototype for Concorde, and Swiss and Soviet rockets. The museum also has the only known remaining piece — the <b>jettisoned</b> main landing <b>gear</b> — of the L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird), the 1927 aircraft which attempted to make the first Transatlantic crossing from Paris to New York. On 8 May 1927, the aircraft took off from Le Bourget, jettisoned its main landing gear (which is stored at the museum), which it was designed to do as part of its trans-Atlantic flight profile, but then disappeared over the Atlantic, only two weeks before Lindbergh's monoplane completed its successful non-stop trans-Atlantic flight to Le Bourget from the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The {{minesweeper}} Staff {{found she}} could not budge Glennon, whose stern seemed to be firmly anchored to the bottom by her starboard propeller. Most of her crew boarded Staff, and those remaining on Glennon lightened her stern by pumping <b>fuel</b> forward and <b>jettisoning</b> depth charges and topside gear. On 9 June, salvage equipment was assembled, and some 60 officers and men of Glennon came back on board. The following morning, just as Cdr. Johnson was preparing to resume efforts to save his ship, a German shore battery near Quinéville found her range. A second salvo hit Glennon amidships and cut off all power. After a third hit, Cdr. Johnson ordered his crew to abandon ship and the men were taken off in a landing craft. Glennon floated until 21:45, 10 June 1944, then rolled over and sank (location: [...] ). She suffered 25 lost and 38 wounded.|$|R
2500|$|Redesigned bow {{and stern}} {{sections}} increased the gas capacity slightly for a corresponding increase in lift, but a more radical measure was {{the removal of the}} external keel corridor from the R23X design. Not contributing significantly to the strength of the hull, the keel's main function was to distribute the weight of the fuel tanks, ballast bags and other heavy items, as well as to allow the crew to travel between the cars, and its removal effected a considerable reduction in weight together with improved manoeuvrability. Instead, the various loads were concentrated at the bulkheads and suspended from the radial wiring that maintained the shape of the hull. The gas-bags were shaped to accommodate a new internal corridor, created by the provision of inverted [...] "U"-shaped ribs above the two lowest longitudinal members, which also allowed access to the fuel tanks and ballast. An improved system of pipes linking the fuel tanks enabled faster refuelling, and could be used to <b>jettison</b> <b>fuel</b> in an emergency. However, as with earlier designs, doped linen was used for the hull's outer covering; and being absorbent, just a few hours of rain could add around a ton of water to the weight.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{performance}} analysis and conceptual design are described {{for a class}} of unmanned airplanes possessing multi-day endurance capability. A mixed-mode electric power system incorporates solar cells for daytime energy production and a non-regenerative H 2 - 02 fuel cell to supply energy for night flight. The power system provides energy for all onboard systems, including propulsion., payload, and avionics. Excess solar energy is available during significant portions of the day, and {{may be used for}} climbing, maneuvering, or payload functions. By <b>jettisoning</b> <b>fuel</b> cell reactant product (water) during flight, vehicle endurance may be increased under certain conditions. Empirical structure sizing algorithms are combined with low-Reynolds number aerodynamics algorithms to estimate airplane size and geometry to meet prescribed mission requirements. Initial calculations for summertime, high-altitude flight (above 40, 000 ft (12 km)) at moderate latitude (31 deg N) indicate that mission endurance of several days may be possible for configurations having wing loadings on the order of 0. 9 to 1. 3 lb/ft(exp 2). These aircraft tend to be somewhat smaller than solar-powered aircraft previously conceived for multi-month endurance utilizing regenerative fuel cell systems for night flight...|$|R

40|$|The March, 2012 {{issue of}} Aerospace America {{stated that the}} near-to-medium {{prospects}} for applying advanced propulsion {{to create a new}} era of space exploration are not very good. In the current world, we operate to the Moon by climbing aboard a Carnival Cruise Lines vessel (Saturn 5), sail from the harbor (liftoff) shedding whole decks of the ship (staging) along the way and, having reached the return leg of the journey, sink the ship (burnout) and return home in a lifeboat (Apollo capsule). Clearly this is an illogical way to travel, but forced on Explorers by today's propulsion technology. However, the article neglected to consider the one propulsion technology, using today's physical principles that offer continuous, substantial thrust at a theoretical specific impulse of 1, 000, 000 sec. This engine unequivocally can create a new era of space exploration that changes the way spacecraft operate. Today's space Explorers could travel in Cruise Liner fashion using the technology not considered by Aerospace America, the novel Dusty Plasma Fission Fragment Rocket Engine (FFRE). This NIAC study addresses the FFRE as well as its impact on Exploration Spacecraft design and operation. It uses common physics of the relativistic speed of fission fragments to produce thrust. It radiatively cools the fissioning dusty core and magnetically controls the fragments direction to practically implement previously patented, but unworkable designs. The spacecraft hosting this engine is no more complex nor more massive than the International Space Station (ISS) and would employ the successful ISS technology for assembly and check-out. The elements can be lifted in "chunks" by a Heavy Lift Launcher. This Exploration Spacecraft would require the resupply of small amounts of nuclear fuel for each journey and would be an in-space asset for decades just as any Cruise Liner on Earth. This study has synthesized versions of the FFRE, integrated one concept onto a host spacecraft designed for manned travel to Jupiter's moon, Callisto, and assessed that round trip journey. This engine, although unoptimized, produced 10 pounds force of thrust at a delivered specific impulse of 527, 000 seconds for the entire 15 -year mission while providing enormous amounts of electrical power to the spacecraft. A payload of 60 metric tons, included in the 300 metric ton vehicle, was carried to Callisto and back; the propellant tanks holding the 4 metric tons of <b>fuel</b> were not <b>jettisoned</b> in the process. The study concluded that the engine and spacecraft are within today's technology, could be built, tested, launched on several SLS (Space Launch System) (or similar) launchers, integrated, checked out, moved to an in-space base such as at a Lagrange point and operated for decades...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{is seeking}} to develop thermal {{insulation}} material systems suitable for withstanding both extremely high temperatures encountered during atmospheric re-entry heating and aero- braking maneuvers, as well as extremely low temperatures existing in liquid fuel storage tanks. Currently, materials used for the high temperature insulation or Thermal Protection System (TPS) {{are different from the}} low temperature, or cryogenic insulation. Dual purpose materials are necessary to the development of reusable launch vehicles (RLV). The present Space Shuttle (or Space Transportation System, STS) employs TPS materials on the orbiter and cryo-insulation materials on the large fuel tank slung under the orbiter. The expensive <b>fuel</b> tank is <b>jettisoned</b> just before orbit is achieved and it burns up while re-entering over the Indian Ocean. A truly completely reusable launch vehicle must store aR cryogenic fuel internally. The fuel tanks will be located close to the outer surface. In fact the outer skin of the craft will probably also serve as the fuel tank enclosure, as in jet airliners. During a normal launch the combined TPS/cryo-insulation system will serve only as a low temperature insulator, since aerodynamic heating is relatively minimal during ascent to orbit. During re-entry, the combined TPS/cryo-insulation system will serve only as a high temperature insulator, since all the cryogenic fuel will have been expended in orbit. However, in the event of an. aborted launch or a forced/emergency early re-entry, the tanks will still contain fuel, and the TPS/cryo-insulation will have to serve as both low and high temperature insulation. Also, on long duration missions, such as to Mars, very effective cryo-insulation materials are needed to reduce bod off of liquid propellants, thereby reducing necessary tankage volume, weight, and cost. The conventional approach to obtaining both low and high temperature insulation, such as is employed for the X- 33 and X- 34 spacecraft, is to use separate TPS and cryo-insulation materials, which are connected by means of adhesives or stand-offs (spacers). Three concepts are being considered: (1) the TPS is bonded directly to the cryo-insulation which, in turn, is bonded to the exterior of the tank, (2) stand-offs are used to make a gap between the TPS and the cryo-insulation, which is bonded externally to the tank, (3) TPS is applied directly or with stand-offs to the exterior so the tank, and cryo-insulation is applied directly to the interior of the tank. Many potential problems are inherent in these approaches. For example, mismatch between coefficients of thermal expansion of the TPS and cryo-insulation, as well as aerodynamic loads, could lead to failure of the bond. Internal cryo-insulation must be prevent from entering the sump of the fuel turbo-pump. The mechanical integrity of the stand-off structure (if used) must withstand multiple missions. During ground hold (i. e., prior to launch) moisture condensation must be minimized in the gap between the cryo-insulation and the TPS. The longer term solution requires the development of a single material to act as cryo- insulation during ground hold and as TPS during re-entry. Such a material minimizes complexity and weight while improving reliability and reducing cost...|$|R
