40|$|A {{majority}} of the human population lives in urban areas and as such, the quality of urban environments is becoming increasingly important to the human population. Furthermore, these areas are major sources of environmental contaminants and sinks of energy and materials. Remote sensing provides an improved understanding of urban areas and their impacts by mapping urban extent, urban composition (vegetation and impervious cover fractions), and urban radiation balance through measures of albedo, emissivity and land surface temperature (LST). Recently, the National Research Council (NRC) completed an assessment of remote sensing needs {{for the next decade}} (NRC, 2007), proposing several missions suitable for urban studies, including a visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer and a multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) instrument called the Hyperspectral Infrared Imagery (HyspIRI). In this talk, we introduce the HyspIRI mission, focusing on potential synergies between VSWIR and TIR data in an urban area. We evaluate potential synergies using an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and MODIS-ASTER (MASTER) image pair acquired over Santa Barbara, United States. AVIRIS data were analyzed at their native spatial resolutions (7. 5 m VSWIR and 15 m TIR), and aggregated 60 m spatial resolution similar to HyspIRI. Surface reflectance was calculated using ACORN and a ground reflectance target to remove atmospheric and sensor artifacts. MASTER data were processed to generate estimates of spectral emissivity and LST using Modtran radiative transfer code and the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation algorithm. A spectral library of common urban materials, including urban vegetation, roofs and roads was assembled from combined AVIRIS and field-measured reflectance spectra.

40|$|There {{exists a}} large {{discrepancy}} between the rural and urban land cover in terms of soil water, aerodynamical, thermal and radiative characteristics, and anthropogenic heat. This results in urban-scale meteorological features such as the urban heat island, reduced wind speed and the city breeze. Some of these effects have a considerable impact on human health in cities when the nocturnal cooling is reduced during heat waves or when air quality is affected during smog episodes. Regional climate models and air-quality models are used to quantify, understand and mitigate these effects. Inside the CLM-community, which is the climate group affiliated to the COSMO consortium, a range of urban parametrizations for the regional climate model COSMO-CLM are currently tested with a variety in complexity and input parameters. At the same time, the air-quality model AURORA is developed and used at VITO, the Flemish Institute of Technological Research. The question rises what impact does urban climate have on air quality in cities. The presented urban parameterization covers a simple and direct implementation of urban characteristics in TERRA_ML, the soil module of COSMO(-CLM), which has been tested 'offline' for Marseille and Toulouse. Besides the anthropogenic heat, specific dynamic, radiative and thermal parameters including roughness length, heat capacity, conductivity, albedo and emissivity are assigned for the urban land-cover. Furthermore, a bluff-roughness thermal roughness length parametrization is used. New surface-layer transfer coefficients are adopted which can deal with very small thermal roughness lengths typical for urban surfaces. A puddle storage for the urban <b>impervious</b> <b>soil</b> has been implemented. The regional climate model COSMO-CLM updated with urban parameterization and the air-quality model AURORA are currently applied at a horizontal resolution of 1 km over Toulouse (France). It is investigated whether air-quality modeling can be improved when forcing it with (urban) mesoscale meteorological data generated with COSMO-CLM rather than with coarser meteorological data from ECMWF reanalysis. Therefore each nesting step of COSMO is used subsequently as input for the air-quality model.

40|$|Levees are earthen {{structures}} {{that are designed}} to protect land from flooding and are commonly composed of <b>impervious</b> <b>soils</b> and built on sandy foundations. They are sensitive to an erosion process that is known as piping. After several years of investigation into piping, Sellmeijer proposed design rules by curve fitting results of a numerical model. The design rule are currently applied in the assessment of levees, despite being obtained under the assumption of uniform and homogenous subsoils. Consequently, the design rules seem to be fine for standard consultancy, but it is insufficient for heterogeneous and anisotropic. In this thesis, the effects of anisotropy and heterogeneity are analysed in a elementary and a realistic numerical model study in order to improve the design rule of Sellmeijer. In the elementary study, several aquifers compositions are created by adding an artificial element with a different permeability to the body or by varying the permeability of the body depending on direction. The realistic study is a modification of the elementary study since stratified aquifer compositions have been implemented. After each simulation, the critical head computed in the elementary or realistic composition is compared to the critical head computed with Sellmeijer design rules which requires one calculation value of the bulk permeability. To improve the design rules an alternative method to determine the bulk permeability is proposed that assumes that there is curved or radial flow towards the exit point instead of the Dupuit method which assumes that there is only horizontal flow. As a consequence, the bulk permeability is calculated as the geometric or logarithmic mean of the vertical and horizontal permeability. Based on both studies, it can be concluded that both anisotropy and heterogeneity in the aquifer greatly increase the critical head so that heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers are significantly more resistant to piping. In some cases, the aquifer can withstand a 45 % higher water level. Furthermore, Sellmeijer’s design rules more accurately approach the heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer, if the bulk permeability is determined with the new approach...|$|R

This method models pixel spectra as a linear combination of spectral signatures from two or more ground components. However, spectral mixture analysis does not account for the absence of one of the surface features or spectral variation within pure materials since it utilizes an invariable set of surface features.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 Growing urban populations {{has sparked}} {{concerns}} over the urbanization impacts to ecosystems. Gradient analysis has been presented {{as a method of}} assessing human impacts on the environment, but few studies have used satellite data to provide information for these analyses. In this dissertation techniques to interpret satellite data were used to investigate urban-rural gradients. The combination of a spectral mixing model and V-I-S (vegetation, <b>impervious,</b> <b>soils)</b> model provided information about the land cover in and around several cities. Based on accuracy assessments using ground data, the model output was determined to be an acceptable predictor of land cover values. An analysis of the Seattle Washington urban-rural region revealed a land cover gradient does indeed exist along a distance gradient from the city center. Traditional land use classes, human population and distance to city center were poor predictors of land cover for a specific location, but acceptable for determining large scale trends. Techniques using V-I-S data to provide landscape level analysis were compared with traditional thematic data. In Seattle Washington no relationship was observed between forest patch size or patch shape along the urban rural gradient. Traditional landscape ecology analysis for urban-rural areas is problematic. A data smoothing technique is presented that allows a landscape context to be determined from spatially continuous raster data. Using this approach, small urban forest patches can be distinguished from small rural forest patches. Lastly, the land cover along the urban-rural gradient of eight cities was compared. Within these eight cities the urban land cover was relatively similar even though the rural land cover was dissimilar. Rural vegetation cover was correlated with precipitation and changes in percent vegetation along the gradient were greater for wet environments than dry. The population of a city is correlated with both the extent of the built environment and the rate of change in impervious cover along the gradient. The techniques presented in this dissertation can be used to compare the land cover along the urban rural gradient of different cities, changes over time, and provide information useful in understanding changes in ecosystem processes from urbanization...|$|R

50|$|A stagnogley soil is a {{typically}} non-alluvial, non-calcareous, loamy or clayey soil {{with a relatively}} <b>impervious,</b> subsurface horizon.Stagnogley <b>soils</b> {{are related to the}} pseudogleys and are a type of gleyic soil. The name of this hygroscopic soil derives from its gley dynamics. The nutrient-poor, often heavily acidified soil is poorly aerated and is not suited to arable use on account of the poor growth performance of cultivated crops. As a shallow topsoil with a moderately stony subsoil, it is mainly used for woodland. Because of its shallow nature it is only suitable for species of trees that thrive well in these conditions, such as the English Oak.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGiven the {{predicted}} expansion of cities throughout the world, understanding {{the effect of}} urbanization on bee fauna is a major issue {{for the conservation of}} bees. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand how urbanization affects wild bee assemblages along a gradient of impervious surfaces and to determine the influence of landscape composition and floral resource availability on these assemblages. We chose 12 sites with a proportion of <b>impervious</b> surfaces (<b>soil</b> covered by parking, roads, and buildings) ranging from 0. 06 % to 64. 31 % within a 500 m radius. We collected using pan trapping and estimated the landscape composition of the sites within a 500 m radius and the species richness of plant assemblages within a 200 m radius. We collected 1104 bees from 74 species. The proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale had a negative effect on wild bee abundance and species richness, whereas local flower composition had no effect. Ground-nesting bees were particularly sensitive to the urbanization gradient. This study provides new evidences of the impact of urbanization on bee assemblages and the proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale emerged as a key factor that drives those assemblages...|$|R
40|$|In 1927 an {{experimental}} farm {{was established in}} Carbon County, Utah. The farm is on a new irrigation tract south of the Price River and about four miles south of Price. The agricultural problems of the Carbon County Experimental Farm and the locality which it serves are distinctly {{different from those of}} most of the farming sections in Utah. The soil of this region is of a sandy, silty nature apparently with deflocculated colloids which make it somewhat difficult to manage. There is a low percentage of organic matter in this soil, and because of this and its <b>impervious</b> condition the <b>soil</b> absorbs water slowly.

40|$|In recent decades, the Sahel has {{witnessed}} a paradoxical increase in surface water despite a general precipitation decline. This phenomenon, {{commonly referred to}} as "the Sahelian paradox", is not completely understood yet. The role of cropland expansion due to the increasing food demand by a growing population has been often put forward to explain this situation for the cultivated Sahel. However, this hypothesis does not hold in pastoral areas where the same phenomenon is observed. Several other processes, such as the degradation of natural vegetation following the major droughts of the 1970 s and the 1980 s, the development of crusted topsoils, the intensification of the rainfall regime and the development of the drainage network, have been suggested to account for this situation. In this paper, a modeling approach is proposed to explore, quantify and rank different processes that could be at play in pastoral Sahel. The kinematic runoff and erosion model (KINEROS- 2) is applied to the Agoufou watershed (245 km(2)), in the Gourma region in Mali, which underwent a significant increase of surface runoff during the last 60 years. Two periods are simulated, the "past" case (1960 - 1975) preceding the Sahelian drought and the "present" case (2000 - 2015). Surface hydrology and land cover characteristics for these two periods are derived by the analysis of aerial photographs, available in 1956, and high-resolution remote sensing images in 2011. The major changes identified are (1) a partial crusting of isolated dunes, (2) an increase of drainage network density, (3) a marked decrease in vegetation with the nonrecovery of tiger bush and vegetation growing on shallow sandy soils, and (4) important changes in soil properties with the apparition of <b>impervious</b> <b>soils</b> instead of shallow sandy soil. The KINEROS- 2 model was parameterized to simulate these changes in combination or independently. The results obtained by this model display a significant increase in annual discharge between the "past" and the "present" case (p value < 0. 001), which is consistent with observations, despite a slight overestimation of the past discharge. Mean annual discharges are estimated at 0. 51 x 10 (6) m(3) (2. 1 mm yr(- 1)) and 3. 29 x 10 (6) m(3) (13. 4 mm yr(- 1)) for past and present, respectively. Changes in soil properties and vegetation cover (tiger bush thickets and grassland on shallow sandy soil) are found to be the main factors causing this increase of simulated runoff, with the drainage network development contributing to a lesser extent but with a positive feedback. These results shed a new light on the Sahelian paradox phenomenon in the absence of land use change and call for further tests in other areas and/or with other models. The synergetic processes highlighted here could play a role in other Sahelian watersheds where runoff increase has been also observed...|$|R
