Later that year, she did a screen test for the upcoming Douglas Fairbanks film The Gaucho. Fairbanks was reportedly impressed by Vélez and quickly signed her to a contract and hired her {{to appear in the}} film with him. Upon its release in 1927, The Gaucho was a hit and critics were duly impressed with Vélez's ability to hold her own alongside Fairbanks, who was well known for his spirited acting and impressive stunts.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} former {{poet laureate}} Robert Pinsky as himself. Pinsky {{was chosen to}} guest star because the writers wanted an intellectual reference for Lisa, [...] and because they knew that Pinsky was {{a fan of the}} show, having read an article of The Time in which Pinsky stated that he [...] "admired the writing" [...] of The Simpsons. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Pinsky stated that he flew to the Simpsons recording studios in Los Angeles on September 10, 2001, and, following the September 11 attacks, was [...] "stranded" [...] there for four days, since no planes were flying following the attacks. Pinsky enjoyed his stay however; [...] "Ian [...] and The Simpsons people were very nice to me," [...] he said. [...] "...

500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E
500|$|After {{abandoning the}} songs {{she had written}} with Babyface, Madonna turned to {{musician}} Rick Nowels, who had previously co-written songs with Stevie Nicks and Celine Dion. The collaboration produced seven songs in nine days, but those songs also did not display the album's future electronic musical direction. Three of the songs, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye", [...] "To Have and Not to Hold" [...] and [...] "Little Star", appear on the album. Madonna then began writing songs with Leonard, who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s. Unlike her previous albums, Leonard's song writing collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input. Madonna believed that Leonard's production [...] "would have lent the songs more of a Peter Gabriel vibe", a sound {{that she did not}} want for the album. Guy Oseary, chairman of Maverick Records, then phoned British electronic musician William Orbit, and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape to Madonna. [...] "I was a huge fan of William's earlier records, Strange Cargo 1 and 2 and all that. I also loved all the remixes he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time," [...] Madonna said.|$|E

500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E

His father, Virgil, wanted to keep him off the streets, so he created a program called REACH (an acronym for religion, education, athletics, {{character}} and hope) where Rashad and others could go to play basketball and stay out of trouble. Later, when he was a senior at college, Phillips said, [...] "I thank God every day for giving me a father who did the things he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>me...</b> I've seen a lot of people fall victim to the streets, but that was never an option for me.

2500|$|The Seder is {{a ritual}} {{performed}} by a community or by multiple generations of a family, involving a retelling {{of the story of}} the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. [...] This story is in the Book of Exodus (Shemot) in The Hebrew Bible. [...] The Seder itself is based on the Biblical verse commanding Jews to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt: [...] "You shall tell your child on that day, saying, 'It is because of what the LORD <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> when I came out of Egypt.'" [...] (Exodus 13:8) Traditionally, families and friends gather in the evening to read the text of the Haggadah, an ancient work derived from the Mishnah (Pesahim 10). The Haggadah contains the narrative of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, special blessings and rituals, commentaries from the Talmud, and special Passover songs.|$|E
2500|$|Rabban Gamaliel {{said that}} one needed to mention three things on Passover to {{discharge}} one's duty: the Passover offering, unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah), and bitter herbs (maror). The Passover offering was sacrificed because God passed over the Israelites' houses in Egypt. They ate unleavened bread because the Israelites were redeemed from Egypt. And they ate bitter herbs because the Egyptians embittered {{the lives of the}} Israelites in Egypt. In every generation, all were bound to regard themselves as though they personally had gone out of Egypt, because [...] says, [...] "You shall tell your child in that day: ‘It is because of what the Lord <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> when I came out of Egypt.'" [...] Therefore, it was everyone's duty to thank and praise God for performing those miracles for the Israelites and their descendants. God brought them forth from bondage into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning into festivity, from darkness into light, and from servitude into redemption. Therefore, they were to say hallelujah! ...|$|E
