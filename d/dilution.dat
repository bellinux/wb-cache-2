5|$|After the Act's initial {{success in}} combating tactics {{designed}} to deny minorities {{access to the}} polls, the Act became predominately used {{as a tool to}} challenge racial vote <b>dilution.</b> Starting in the 1970s, the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory annexations, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting. In total, 81% (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote <b>dilution.</b> Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote <b>dilution.</b> Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60% of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2% challenged at-large election systems and 38.5% challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2% of the 331 lawsuits, and {{they were more likely to}} succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color <b>Dilution</b> Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color <b>dilution</b> that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} current study was to improve cytokeratin 19 (CK 19) quantification using plasmid <b>dilutions</b> of cloned PCR fragments to obtain a more reliable and reproducible quantification of CK 19 transcripts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PB samples of 14 stage IV breast cancer patients and 23 healthy controls were examined with RT-PCR using plasmid quantification. RESULTS: Median CK 19 + copy numbers of one and 11 were detected in the control group and stage IV breast cancer patients, respectively (Mann-Whitney, P </= 0. 0001). When comparing the results obtained using cell line <b>dilutions</b> with those obtained using plasmid <b>dilutions,</b> a good correlation was observed (r(2) = 0. 98). CONCLUSIONS: Plasmid <b>dilutions</b> are more reliable than cell line <b>dilutions</b> for quantification of gene expression, and more objective criteria for positivity could be defined based on the characteristics of the standard curve (slope and intercept).

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} various <b>dilutions</b> of antibiotic medicaments used in endodontic regeneration on the survival of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and to determine their antibacterial effect against established Enterococcus faecalis biofilm. Materials and methods The cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of different triple (TAP) and double antibiotic paste (DAP) <b>dilutions</b> (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, and 10 mg/ml) were tested against Enterococcus faecalis established biofilm and DPSC. Established bacterial biofilm were exposed to antibiotic <b>dilutions</b> for 3 days. Then, biofilms were collected, spiral plated, and the numbers of bacterial colony forming units (CFU/ml) were determined. For the cytotoxic effect, lactate dehydrogenase activity assays (LDH) and cell viability assays (WST- 1) were {{used to measure the}} percentage of DPSC cytotoxicity after 3 -day treatment with the same antibiotic <b>dilutions.</b> A general linear mixed model was used for statistical analyses (α[*]=[*] 0. 05). Results All antibiotic <b>dilutions</b> significantly decreased the bacterial CFU/ml. For WST- 1 assays, all antibiotic <b>dilutions</b> except 0. 125 mg/ml significantly reduced the viability of DPSC. For LDH assays, the three lowest tested concentrations of DAP (0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 125 mg/ml) and the two lowest concentrations of TAP (0. 25 and 0. 125 mg/ml) were non-toxic to DPSC. Conclusions All tested <b>dilutions</b> had an antibacterial effect against E. faecalis. However, 0. 125 mg/ml of DAP and TAP showed a significant antibacterial effect with no cytotoxic effects on DPSCs.

40|$|Hydrogenated {{amorphous}} silicon (a-Si:H) films are grown at different hydrogen <b>dilutions.</b> For high <b>dilutions</b> we observe a discrepancy {{in the surface}} roughness analysis between real-time spectroscopic ellipsometry (RTSE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. With RTSE a much higher roughness layer thickness is measured than with AFM. Additionally we observe {{what appears to be}} a strong roughening phase in the first 30 - 50 nm of film growth for all conditions. A mechanism that involves the formations of a hydrogenrich overlayer and etching of higher hydrides in this overlayer is suggested. This mechanism explains the difference in RTSE roughness layer thickness evolution. At higher hydrogen <b>dilutions,</b> we obtain a thicker overlayer dominated by lower hydrides. RTSE interprets this overlayer as additional surface roughness and consequently overestimates the surface roughness for higher <b>dilutions.</b> The initial strong roughening phase is related to the built-up of this over-layer. In this phase, we obtain much denser films compared to the bulk film.

Methods: The study was conducted at the State University of Maringa, in 2015. Step 1, <b>dilutions</b> 1 / 10 were performed from T. cruzi -Y strain to obtain preparations of 50, 000 - 0. 05 parasites/mL from which DNA were extracted, quantified, and amplified. Step 2, the extracted DNA in the <b>dilutions</b> 5 - 0. 05 parasites/mL was re-diluted 1 / 10, 1 / 100, 1 / 1000, quantified, and amplified. Polyacrylamide gels were photographed and thicknesses of the 330 bp kDNA fragments were measured. Results: Step 1, in the <b>dilutions</b> 50, 000 - 50 parasites/mL kDNA fragments had same thickness and, <b>dilutions</b> 5 - 0. 05 parasites/mL showed progressive decrease in thicknesses and staining intensity of the 330 bp fragments. Step 2, demonstrated that <b>dilutions</b> of five (re-dilutions 1 / 10 and 1 / 100) and 0. 5 (1 / 10) parasites/mL produced similar thicknesses of the 330 bp fragments obtained in Step 1.
