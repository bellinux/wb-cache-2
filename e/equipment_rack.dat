2500|$|Three dual-gimbal CMGs were {{mounted on}} the <b>equipment</b> <b>rack</b> of the Apollo Telescope Mount at {{the hub of the}} windmill-shaped array of solar panels {{on the side of the}} station. [...] They were {{arranged}} so that the casings (and therefore the rotors when all gimbals were at their zero positions) pointed in three mutually perpendicular directions. [...] Since the units were dual-gimballed, each one could produce a torque about any axis at right angles to its rotor axis, thus providing some redundancy; if any one of the three failed, the combination of the remaining two could in general still produce a torque around any desired axis.|$|E

5000|$|Installation of {{a typical}} 10 Phasor PMU is a simple process. A phasor will be either a 3 phase voltage or a 3 phase current. Each phasor will, therefore, require 3 {{separate}} electrical connections (one for each phase). Typically an electrical engineer designs the installation and interconnection of a PMU at a substation or at a generation plant. Substation personnel will bolt an <b>equipment</b> <b>rack</b> {{to the floor of}} the substation following established seismic mounting requirements. Then the PMU along with a modem and other support equipment will be mounted on the <b>equipment</b> <b>rack.</b> They will also install the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) antenna on the roof of the substation per manufacturer instructions. Substation personnel will also install [...] "shunts" [...] in all Current transformer (CT) secondary circuits that are to be measured. The PMU will also require communication circuit connection (Modem if using 4-wire connection or Ethernet for network connection).|$|E
50|$|For video {{switching}} in {{home and}} professional theater applications, a crossbar switch (or a matrix switch, {{as it is}} more commonly called in this application) is used to distribute the output of multiple video appliances simultaneously to every monitor or every room throughout a building. In a typical installation, all the video sources are located on an <b>equipment</b> <b>rack,</b> and are connected as inputs to the matrix switch.|$|E
5000|$|Disk media [...] was {{initially}} 24-inches in diameter {{but over time}} it {{has been reduced to}} today's typically 95 or 65 mm. Drives with the larger 24-inch and 14-inch diameter media were typically mounted in standalone boxes (resembling washing machines) or large <b>equipment</b> <b>rack</b> enclosures. Individual drives often required high-current AC power due to the large motors required to spin the large disks. Drives with smaller media generally conformed to de facto standard form factors.|$|E

50|$|Internal to the {{laboratory}} are racks, rack stand-offs, and vestibule jumpers. The lab racks house the system hardware in removable modular units. The stand-offs provide space for electrical connections, data management systems cabling for computers, air conditioning ducts, thermal control tubes and more, {{all of which}} support the space station's <b>equipment</b> <b>racks.</b> The racks interface to the piping and wiring in the standoff via outlets and ports located in the standoffs at the base end of each rack location.|$|R

5000|$|A rackmount effects unit {{may contain}} an {{electronic}} circuit {{nearly identical to}} a stompbox-based effect, but it is mounted in a standard 19" [...] <b>equipment</b> <b>rack,</b> which is usually mounted in a road case {{that is designed to}} protect the equipment during transport. More recently, as signal-processing technology continuously becomes more feature-dense, rack-mount effects units frequently contain several types of effects. They are typically controlled by knobs or switches on the front panel, and often by a MIDI digital control interface.|$|E
50|$|Power {{supplies}} are packaged {{in different ways}} and classified accordingly. A bench power supply is a stand-alone desktop unit used in applications such as circuit test and development. Open frame power supplies have only a partial mechanical enclosure, sometimes consisting of only a mounting base; these are typically built into machinery or other <b>equipment.</b> <b>Rack</b> mount power {{supplies are}} designed to be secured into standard electronic equipment racks. An integrated power supply is one that shares a common printed circuit board with its load.|$|E
50|$|Flyers are aerial {{vehicles}} {{that are used}} for travel between the dome cities, as well as research trips into the Darklands. A large variety of fliers exist, although the most famous ones belong to DGAP (Darklands Genetic Adaption Program) and resemble a squat bug. These fliers have three seats (Pilot, Co-Pilot and Commander/Observer) in the cockpit (The Front Dome) arranged in a triangle (Pilot Front-Left, Co-Pilot Front-Right and Commander/Observer Rear-Center), as well as space behind the front dome. This space includes an <b>equipment</b> <b>rack</b> for suits and helmets.|$|E

50|$|Broadcast {{equipment}} was largely obsolete {{and in a}} state of series disrepair by 1991. Allerton contacted various commercial and public radio stations in the Toronto area and requested any unused equipment be donated.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} {{suggested that this}} usage dates {{from the days when}} punched cards and/or punched tape were common. Card and paper-tape punches each had a receptacle for the 'chips' punched from the cards or tape to create the holes (rectangular in a card, round in a paper tape), which often looked like a bucket and was known by this name. By analogy it was jokingly suggested that the CPU, which in those days was an <b>equipment</b> <b>rack</b> of similar size to a large peripheral unit, contained a similar receptacle for lost data.|$|E

The term [...] "studio" [...] usually refers to a place where a particular local program is originated. If the program is broadcast live, the signal goes from the PCR to MCR and then out to the transmitter.|$|E

50|$|Most models did {{not have}} many accessories, unlike the {{competitors}} Minialuxe, but a few items like roof skis did occasionally appear, like on the Panhard Dyna (Ralston 2008, p. 32). After about 1960, opening features began to appear on some - like the opening doors on the Renault 4 van or the Land Rover Expedition, which also featured a spare tire and roof luggage / <b>equipment</b> <b>rack.</b> Also, different companies would often be advertised {{on the sides of}} the model trucks and vans, like Locatel telephone, Cibie lights, or Fleury Michon, a provider of meat products (Ralston 2008, p. 33).|$|E

50|$|The R-390A is {{a general}} {{coverage}} radio receiver capable of receiving amplitude modulated, code, and frequency shift keying signals. Its tuning range is from 500 kilohertz to 32 megahertz, in 32 one-megahertz bands. The circuit is the superheterodyne type, double conversion above 8 MHz, below which triple conversion is used. It employs 26 vacuum tubes (6AK6 x 3, 5654 x 2, 12AU7/5814A x 2, 26Z5W x 2, 3TF7 x 1, 6BA6/5749W x 6, 6C4/6100 x 3, 6DC6 x 1, 0A2 x 1), a larger than normal count for most general-coverage receivers. The receiver weighs 85 pounds and can be operated on 120 volt or 240 volt supplies. It fits neatly into a 10.5 inch-tall standard 19 inch <b>equipment</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|E
