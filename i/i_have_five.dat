500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann {{to admit he}} was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>five</b> million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets. During later examination by the judges, he admitted he meant the Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.|$|E
500|$|Oakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight {{because they}} [...] "didn't {{want to break}} [...] " [...] and Mike Scully took over as showrunner in 1997. As showrunner and {{executive}} producer, Scully said his aim was to [...] "not wreck the show", Scully was popular with the staff members, many of whom praised his organization and management skills. Writer Tom Martin said he was [...] "quite possibly the best boss I've ever worked for" [...] and [...] "a great manager of people" [...] while writer Don Payne commented that for Scully [...] "it was really important that we kept decent hours". Scully noted: [...] "I wrote a lot of Lisa's shows. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>five</b> daughters, so I like Lisa a lot. I like Homer, too. Homer comes very naturally to me: I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. A lot of my favorite episodes are the ones when Homer and Lisa are in conflict with each other... They're very human, I think that's their appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, David Mirkin hired Scully {{to write}} for The Simpsons, as a {{replacement}} for the departing Conan O'Brien, after reading some of his sample scripts. He began as a writer and producer for the show during its fifth season and wrote the episodes [...] "Lisa's Rival", [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] and [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] which aired in season six. [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] was his first episode; he wrote the script, but the original concept had been conceived by O'Brien. Similarly, he wrote the script for [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds", which was based on an idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] was inspired by Scully's love of ice hockey and featured many experiences from his childhood, as was [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (which he wrote for season seven) which was based [...] "one of the most traumatic moments" [...] of his life, when he was caught shoplifting at age 12. He jokingly told Variety that [...] "It's great to be paid for reliving the horrors of your life." [...] He also wrote [...] "Team Homer" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Date with Density". Scully noted: [...] "I wrote a lot of Lisa's shows. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>five</b> daughters, so I like Lisa a lot. I like Homer, too.

2500|$|In a {{contrast}} to his largely comedy-based acting career, Koechner starred in the 2016 drama Priceless, a film about human trafficking. He said of the role, [...] "My wife and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>five</b> kids — {{three of them are}} daughters. So, just to imagine the horror of any young lady having to go through this.
