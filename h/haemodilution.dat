40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of concentrates of fibrinogen and factor XIII in hypothermia and <b>haemodilution</b> {{has not yet}} been completely investigated. Clauss methods have not previously been evaluated perioperatively. Methods: Coagulation was assessed with rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) or free oscillation rheometry (FOR) in vitro and different fibrinogen measurement methods in observational studies. Results: <b>Haemodilution</b> with human albumin (HA) impaired clot strength (EXTEM MCF, maximal clot formation) less than the synthetic colloids hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or dextran (p 0. 001). Finally, when comparing seven different Clauss methods during cardiac surgery, within-method variability was low, but between-method variability was high (mean difference > 0. 5 g/l). No differences between pre- and post-weaning from cardiopulmonary by-pass was seen. Conclusion: Fibrinogen concentrate improved coagulation better after <b>haemodilution</b> with HA than synthetic colloids, but equal with or less than after crystalloid <b>haemodilution.</b> FXIII had an additional effect to that of fibrinogen. Hypothermia and <b>haemodilution</b> with HES interacted to impair coagulation. Fibrinogen+/-FXIII improved coagulation also at 33 °C. Clauss methods after in vivo HES <b>haemodilution</b> did not overestimate fibrinogen; however, fibrinogen-dependent clot strength decreased more than fibrinogen concentration. Clauss methods varied considerably between methods. These findings support the use of fibrinogen concentrate after resuscitation with HA, also at hypothermia, but question the use of colloids, especially HES, in resuscitation.

Alterations in the serum concentrations of cytokines have important prognostic significance. Reports on cytokine release during cardiac surgery with CPB have yielded conflicting results. <b>Haemodilution</b> occurs {{with the onset of}} CPB resulting in large fluid shifts during the perioperative course of cardiac procedures. In the present study we compare the perioperative course of serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10 and sIL- 2 R with and without correction for <b>haemodilution</b> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Twenty male patients undergoing elective CABG surgery with CPB and general anaesthesia using a balanced technique with sufentanil, isoflurane and midazolam were enrolled into the study. Serum levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10 and sIL- 2 R were measured using commercially available ELISA kits. Simultaneous haematocrit values were obtained at all sample times. Statistical analysis was performed by non-parametric analysis of variance and t-tests for data corrected for <b>haemodilution</b> and data that were not corrected for <b>haemodilution.</b> Adjusted significance level was P < 0. 01. Intra-operatively, up to the second post-operative day PCV values were significantly decreased compared with preoperative values. Cytokine measurements not corrected for <b>haemodilution</b> were significantly lower than the corrected values. The perioperative <b>haemodilution</b> and decrease in PCV may lead to an underestimation of the cytokine secretion in post-operative patients. We conclude that cytokine measurements were significantly influenced by the perioperative <b>haemodilution</b> and the subsequent decrease in PCV and may in part account for the varying results reported in the literature regarding cytokine release in patients undergoing CABG surgery...|$|E

Little is known about the dose-response relationships of <b>haemodilution,</b> and {{it is reasonable to assume}} that a linear association exists. This may not be the case with altered electrolyte compositions of the fluids used for <b>haemodilution.</b> We have therefore conducted an in vitro study of <b>haemodilution</b> of human whole blood using lactated Ringer's solution and two high molecular weight hetastarches, one in a balanced salt solution, the other in a 0. 9 % saline solution. The thrombelastograph, commonly used for the assessment of the coagulation effects of synthetic colloids, was used as the coagulation assessment device. Serial <b>haemodilution</b> with hetastarch in a balanced salt solution demonstrated a biphasic response (of r-times and k-times, as well as alpha angles), with <b>haemodilution</b> in the 20 - 40 % range causing enhanced coagulation, and higher degrees of dilution causing a decrease in overall coagulation performance. A similar picture was observed with lactated Ringer's solution, but only significantly so in alpha angles. Hetastarch in saline did not display this initial increased coagulability at mild to moderate dilutions. This biphasic response of lactated Ringer's solution and hetastarch in a balanced salt solution reflects the complex interaction of fluids and the coagulation system, and that these effects cannot be attributed to simple <b>haemodilution.</b> On the other hand, there was a linear decrease in maximum amplitude with <b>haemodilution.</b> Maximum amplitude was particularly affected by both starches, which is an expected finding in view of the known interaction between the hydroxyethyl starches and von Willebrand's factor...|$|E

Methods. Clot formation was measured by thromboelastography (TEG) using blood from healthy volunteers. In vitro effects of rFVIIa with <b>haemodilution,</b> acidosis, and hypothermia were examined. Conditions were induced by dilution with NaCl (0. 9 %), lactated Ringer’s solution, albumin 5 %, or hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions [MW (molecular weight) 130 – 670 kDa]; by adjusting pH to 6. 8 with 1 M HEPES (N- 2 -hydroxyethylpiperazine-N 0 - 2 -ethanesulphonic acid) buffer; or by reducing temperature to 328 C.

40|$|Background Fibrinolysis {{contributes}} to coagulopathy after major trauma and surgery. We hypothesized that progressive <b>haemodilution</b> is responsible, {{at least in}} part, for increased fibrinolytic tendency of blood clot. Methods The study was performed in two parts. First, whole blood (WB) samples collected from six healthy, consented volunteers were diluted in vitro with either saline or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) to 40 % and 15 % of baseline. We quantified factor levels related to coagulation and fibrinolysis, and measured endogenous thrombin generation in undiluted control plasma samples and in samples diluted with saline or FFP. Additionally, thromboelastometry {{was used to assess}} susceptibility to fibrinolysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator in undiluted WB samples and in samples diluted with saline before and after substitution of fibrinogen or FFP. Secondly, as a model of in vivo <b>haemodilution,</b> we evaluated the same parameters before and after operation in nine consented patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Results The dilution with saline caused dose-dependent decreases in plasma levels of coagulation and antifibrinolytic factors, and in thrombin generation. In FFP-supplemented samples, factor levels and thrombin generation were maintained within normal ranges. Fibrinolytic tendency was significantly higher after <b>haemodilution</b> with saline independent of fibrinogen substitution compared with FFP. Similarly, increased tendency for fibrinolysis was also observed in the in vivo <b>haemodilution.</b> Conclusions We demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that progressive <b>haemodilution</b> decreases endogenous antifibrinolytic proteins including α 2 -antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, resulting in increased fibrinolytic tendency. Therefore, early fluid replacement therapy with FFP might be advantageous after massive haemorrhag...|$|E
40|$|Background:Laboratory {{analysis}} of coagulation is often important in emergencies. If vascular access is challenging,intraosseous catheterization {{may be necessary}} for treatment. We studied the {{analysis of}} coagulation parameters inintraosseous aspirate during stable conditions and after major haemorrhage in a porcine model. Methods:Ten anesthetized pigs received central venous and intraosseous catheters and samples were taken foranalysis of thromboelastography (TEG), prothrombin time (PT), {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) andfibrinogen concentration. Analyses were repeated after removal of 50 % of the calculated blood volume andresuscitation with crystalloid. Intraosseous and venous values were compared. Results:Bleeding and resuscitation resulted in <b>haemodilution</b> and hypotension. Median TEG reaction time wasshorter in intraosseous than in venous samples before (1. 6 vs 4. 6 min) and after (1. 6 vs 4. 7 min) <b>haemodilution.</b> Median maximal amplitude was smaller in intraosseous samples at baseline (68. 3 vs 76. 4 mm). No major differenceswere demonstrated for the other TEG parameters. The intraosseous samples often coagulated in vitro, makinganalysis of PT, APTT and fibrinogen difficult. After <b>haemodilution,</b> TEG maximal amplitude andα-angle, andfibrinogen concentration, were decreased and PT increased. Discussion:The intraosseous samples were clinically hypercoagulable and the TEG demonstrated a shortenedreaction time. The reason for this may hypothetically be found in the composition of the IO aspirate or in thesampling technique. After 50 % haemorrhage and <b>haemodilution,</b> a clinically relevant decrease in fibrinogenconcentration and a lower TEG maximal amplitude were observed. Conclusions:Although the sample is small, these data indicate that intraosseous samples are hypercoagulable,which may limit their usefulness for coagulation studies. Major <b>haemodilution</b> only moderately affected the studied parameters...|$|E
40|$|Fluids {{balanced}} {{to avoid}} acid-base disturbances may be preferable to saline, which causes metabolic acidosis in high volume. We evaluated acid-base and bio-energetic effects of <b>haemodilution</b> with a crystalloid balanced on physical chemical principles, versus crystalloids causing metabolic acidosis or metabolic alkalosis. Anaesthetised, mechanically ventilated Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 32, allocated to four groups) underwent six exchanges of 9 ml crystalloids for 3 ml/blood. Exchange was {{with one of}} three crystalloids with strong ion difference (SID) values of 0, 24 (balanced) and 40 mEq/l. Controls did not undergo <b>haemodilution.</b> Mean haemoglobin concentration fell 11 to approximately 50 g/l after <b>haemodilution.</b> With SID 24 mEq/l fluid, metabolic acid-base remained unchanged. Dilution with SID 0 mEq/l and 40 mEq/l fluids caused a progressive metabolic acidosis and alkalosis respectively. Standard base excess (SBE) and haemoglobin concentration were directly con-elated in the SID 0 mEq/l group (R- 2 = 0. 61), indirectly correlated in the SBE 40 mEq/ 1 group (R- 2 = 0. 48) and showed no correlation in the SID 24 mEq/l group (R- 2 = 0. 003). There {{were no significant differences}} between final ileal values of CO 2 gap, nucleotides concentration, energy charge, or luminal lactate concentration. SID 40 mEq/l crystalloid dilution caused a significant rise in subcutaneous lactate. In this group mean kidney ATP concentration was significantly less than controls and renal energy charge significantly lower than SID 0 mEq/l and control groups. We conclude that a crystalloid SID of 24 mEq/l provides balanced <b>haemodilution.</b> Bio-eneigetic perturbations with higher SID <b>haemodilution</b> may be more severe and need further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Haemodilution</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with neurological morbidity in surgical patients. This study tests the hypothesis that inhibition of cerebral vasodilatation by systemic β 2 adrenergic blockade would impair cerebral oxygen delivery leading to tissue hypoxia in severely haemodiluted rats. Methods. Under general an aesthesia, cerebral tissue probes were placed to measure temperature, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and tissue oxygen tension (PBrO 2) in the parietal cerebral cortex or hippocampus. Baseline measurements were established before and after systemic administration of either a β 2 antagonist (10 mg kg- 1 i. v., ICI 118, 551) or saline vehicle. Acute <b>haemodilution</b> was then performed by simultaneously exchanging 50 % of the estimated blood volume (30 ml kg- 1) with pentastarch. Arterial blood gases (ABGs), haemoglobin concentration (co-oximetry), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were also measured. Data were analysed using a two-way anova and post hoc Tukey's test [mean (sd) ]. Results. <b>Haemodilution</b> reduced the haemoglobin concentration comparably in all groups [71 (9) g litre- 1]. There were no differences in ABGs, co-oximetry, HR and MAP measurements between control and β 2 blocked rats, either before or 60 min after drug or vehicle administration. In rats treated with the β 2 antagonist there was a significant reduction in parietal cerebral cortical temperature, regional blood flow and tissue oxygen tension, relative to control rats, 60 min after <b>haemodilution</b> (P< 0. 05 for each). These differences were not observed when probes were placed in the hippocampus. Conclusion. Systemic β 2 adrenergic blockade inhibited the compensatory increase in parietal cerebral cortical oxygen delivery after <b>haemodilution</b> thereby reducing cerebral cortical tissue oxygen tension. © 2006 Oxford University Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

They demonstrated that, in patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty, normovolaemic <b>haemodilution</b> caused no change in jugular bulb saturations () but decreased cerebral saturations () when measured with a cerebral oximeter (INVOS 4100 S). Two explanations were offered for the unexpected disparity in readings. First, they postulated that subtle changes in regional might not be revealed with the global measure provided by.

40|$|We have {{compared}} compensatory mechanisms during acute isovolaemic <b>haemodilution</b> of 12 ml/kg body weight of blood with hydroxyethyl starch (450, 000 / 0. 7) exchange, in non-beta-blocked and beta-blocked patients with coronary artery disease. During <b>haemodilution,</b> mean concentrations of haemoglobin decreased from 12. 8 (SEM 0. 2) to 10. 1 (0. 1) g dl- 1 (P < 0. 01). Only beta-blocked patients had {{an increase in}} cardiac index (P < 0. 01); in non-beta-blocked patients, cardiac index remained constant. In both groups oxygen extraction increased (P < 0. 01), but the increase tended to be greater in non-beta-blocked patients (P = 0. 06). Oxygen consumption was maintained in both groups. There were no ECG signs of myocardial ischaemia. We conclude that beta-blocked and non-beta-blocked patients with coronary artery disease tolerated well moderate <b>haemodilution</b> to a haemoglobin value of approximately 10 g dl- 1, however, compensatory haemodynamic mechanisms differed fundamentally between the two group...|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Haemodilution</b> and {{hypothermia}} induce coagulopathy separately, {{but their}} combined effect on coagulation {{has not been}} widely studied. Fibrinogen concentrate can correct dilutional coagulopathy and has an additional effect when combined with factor XIII concentrate. However, their effect on dilutional coagulopathy concomitant with hypothermia has not been studied previously. Free oscillation rheometry – FOR (Reorox®) – is a novel viscoelastic haemostatic assay {{that has not been}} studied in this context before. Methods Blood from 10 healthy volunteers was diluted by 33 % with hydroxyethyl starch or Ringer’s acetate solutions. Effects of fibrinogen added in vitro with and without factor XIII were studied at 33 °C and 37 °C. Coagulation velocity (coagulation time) and clot strength (elasticity) were assessed with FOR. Coagulation was initiated in vitro with thromboplastin alone, or thromboplastin plus a platelet inhibitor. Results Hydroxyethyl starch increased the coagulation time and decreased clot strength significantly more than Ringer’s acetate solution, both in the presence and absence of a platelet inhibitor. There was a significant interaction between <b>haemodilution</b> with hydroxyethyl starch and hypothermia, resulting in increased coagulation time. After addition of fibrinogen, coagulation time shortened and elasticity increased, with the exception of fibrinogen-dependent clot strength (i. e., elasticity {{in the presence of a}} platelet inhibitor) after hydroxyethyl starch <b>haemodilution.</b> Factor XIII had an additional effect with fibrinogen on fibrinogen-dependent clot strength in blood diluted with Ringer’s acetate solution. Hypothermia did not influence any of the coagulation factor effects. Conclusions Both <b>haemodilution</b> and mild hypothermia impaired coagulation. Coagulopathy was more pronounced after <b>haemodilution</b> with hydroxyethyl starch than with Ringer’s acetate. Addition of fibrinogen with factor XIII was unable to reverse hydroxyethyl starch induced clot instability, but improved coagulation in blood diluted with Ringer’s acetate solution. Fibrinogen improved coagulation irrespective of hypothermia. Funding Agencies|Region Skane (Sweden) ||CSL Beehring||</p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if acute perioperative normovolaemic <b>haemodilution</b> with retransfusion of the autologous blood at the end of operation would reduce or eliminate the need for homologous (banked) blood. Forty patients scheduled for total hip prosthesis replacement (THPR) were randomly divided into two groups: Group A, 20 patients from whom 900 ml of blood was taken 20 min preoperatively, the volume being replaced with 1000 ml of gelatin solution (Haemaccel). Group B, 20 patients who were undergoing the same operation but from whom no blood was taken. Both groups were allowed a fall in haematocrit (Hct) to 0. 25 before transfusion was started. A standard formula to calculate allowable blood loss plus intraoperative Hct measurements were used to achieve the <b>haemodilution.</b> There was no significant difference in blood loss between the two groups. Transfusion requirement was the same in the two groups. In this study, autotransfusion by the withdrawal of 900 ml of blood is inadequate to reduce the transfusion requirement further than that which can be achieved by <b>haemodilution</b> alone...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{cerebral}} arterial vasospasm and ischaemia, a serious complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Firstly is the noninvasive transcranial Doppler ultrasound and transcranial cerebral oximetry techniques evaluated in detecting cerebral arterial vasospasm in clinical practice. Patients were examined during first 14 {{days after the}} bleed. Flow velocities in normo- versus hypertensive patients were also compared. Secondly is the effect in blood viscosity, cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen delivery rate evaluated during the commonly used haemodilutive therapy for vasospasm. Haematocrit after colloid infusion was compared with controls. Both global and regional cerebral blood flow was measured after iso- and hypervolaemic <b>haemodilution.</b> Transcranial Doppler ultrasound used daily is a valuable non-invasive bedside method to detect an increased risk for vasospasm. Especially {{when there is a}} rapid increase in mean flow velocity during 24 hours. However, in patients with verified arterial hypertension even a moderately increased mean flow velocity may indicate vasospasm. Transcranial cerebral oximetry may be useful as a complement to transcranial Doppler ultrasound as a correlation between reduced cerebral saturation and increased mean flow velocity seem to exist. There is a spontaneous <b>haemodilution</b> after subarachnoid haemorrhage as haematocrit is lowered irrespective of haemodilutive therapy or not. Haemodilutive therapy alone may therefore not be beneficial for SAH patients. Isovolaemic <b>haemodilution</b> does not improve cerebral oxygen delivery although global cerebral blood flow and transcranial Doppler mean flow velocity increases. Nor is hypervolaemic <b>haemodilution</b> beneficial for patients with vasospasm as the increased CBF is counteracted by a reduction in oxygen delivery to the brain...|$|E
40|$|Haemodynamic {{parameters}} and oxygen consumption were determined in 20 patients with mitral regurgitation {{before and after}} a 12 ml. kg- 1 isovolaemic exchange of blood for 6 % hydroxyethyl starch. During <b>haemodilution,</b> mean (SEM) haemoglobin concentration decreased from 13. 0 (0. 4) to 10. 3 (0. 4) g. dl- 1 (p = 0. 001). With cardiac filling pressures maintained at predilution levels, cardiac index increased from 1. 84 (0. 08) to 1. 94 (0. 08) l. min- 1. m- 2 (p = 0. 025) while systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1556 (86) to 1425 (83) dyne. s. cm- 5 (p = 0. 002) and oxygen extraction increased from 31. 7 (1. 1) to 37. 3 (1. 4) % (p = 0. 001) resulting in an unchanged oxygen consumption. The haemodynamic response to <b>haemodilution</b> was not affected by the patients' cardiac rhythm, i. e. whether it was sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation.
