40|$|Marama bean (Tylosema esculentum (Burch) A. Schreib) is an underutilised, drought-tolerant legume {{native to}} the drier parts of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. The bean is {{comparable}} to soya beans in protein content and quality whereas its oil content is {{comparable to that of}} peanuts. By adding value to the marama bean through processing into protein-rich flours, its utilisation may be increased. Therefore, one of the objectives {{of this study was to}} adopt suitable low-cost processing technologies used for soya processing to produce protein-rich marama bean flours. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on lipoxygenase enzymes of its <b>defatted</b> <b>flour</b> was determined since oxidative rancidity catalysed mainly by lipoxygenase enzymes can reduce the shelf-life of the flour. The presence of trypsin inhibitors can affect the protein digestibility of the marama bean flour adversely. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on in-vitro protein digestibility and amino acid content of its <b>defatted</b> <b>flour</b> was determined. Lastly, the effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on the protein-related functional properties of the resultant <b>defatted</b> <b>flour</b> was determined. The presence of lipoxygenase iso-enzymes (L- 1 and L- 2) activity in marama beans was determined by a visual and spectrophotometeric method using unheated soya beans as reference. Lipoxygenase iso-enzymes (L- 1 and L- 2) activity was not detected in marama beans. This may possibly suggest that these lipoxygenase iso-enzymes are absent or possibly inhibited in marama beans. In an attempt to optimise dry heating to inactivate trypsin inhibitors in marama beans, whole marama beans were dry heated at 100 °C, 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively for 20 min. Defatted flours prepared from the heated marama beans (HMF’s) were analysed for their trypsin inhibitor activity using defatted flours from unheated marama beans (UMF) and soya beans (USF) as control and reference samples, respectively. Trypsin inhibitor activity in UMF was almost four and half times higher than in USF. Dry heating of whole marama beans at 150 °C/ 20 min significantly reduced the trypsin inhibitor activity in its <b>defatted</b> <b>flour</b> to almost zero probably due to inactivation of the trypsin inhibitor. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans at 150 °C/ 20 min on the physico-chemical, nutritional and protein-related functional properties of defatted marama bean flour was determined. UMF was used as a control while USF and HSF were used as reference samples. HMF had higher protein content but lower fat content than UMF. It is suggested that dry heating disrupted the lipid bodies of the marama beans allowing more oil to be expelled during coarse milling of the flour. Heating significantly reduced the L* values of marama and soya bean flours possibly due to Maillard browning reactions. Heating significantly increased in-vitro protein digestibility of marama and soya bean flours probably due to protein denaturation and inactivation of trypsin inhibitors. Heating generally decreased the amino acid contents of marama and soya bean flours possibly due to chemical modification of the amino acids. UMF and HMF can potentially be used to improve protein quality in marama-cereal composite flours, porridges and breads. Heating significantly decreased the nitrogen solubility index (NSI) and emulsifying capacity (EC) of marama and soya bean flours possibly due to protein denaturation and/or cross-linking. This may make HMF and HSF not suitable for applications in emulsion type meat products such as sausages because emulsion formation is critical during processing of sausages. Heating significantly decreased the foaming capacity of soya flour but did not have an effect on that of marama bean flour probably due to their high residual fat content which may have disrupted protein films during foam formation. UMF has a potential to be used in comminuted meat products because of its relatively high NSI, EC and OAC. The laboratory process used in this study can be modified and adopted by SME’s to produce defatted marama bean flours with potential applications in bakery and meat products and as a protein supplement in composite marama-cereal products.

40|$|Biscuits {{prepared}} from flour blends containing varying {{proportions of}} sorghum flour (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 %) and fortified with 5 % <b>defatted</b> soy <b>flour,</b> were evaluated for different quality parameters. Spread ratio was decreased with increased proportions of sorghum flour in biscuits. Dough strength decreased but hardness, toughness, average breaking force and average breaking energy of biscuits increased (p< 0. 001) with increased proportions of sorghum flour. L* values decreased while a* value increased (p< 0. 001) with increased proportion of sorghum flour, {{resulting in the}} darkening of biscuit samples but on sensory evaluation, mean sensory scores for different level of sorghum flour incorporated biscuits fortified with 5 % <b>defatted</b> soy <b>flour,</b> for all the sensory attributes, were more than the minimum acceptable score of 6 with highest overall acceptability at 10 % sorghum flour level...|$|R
