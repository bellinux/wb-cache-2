50|$|Prior to World War II in {{the early}} 1940s, most {{petroleum}} refineries in the United States consisted simply of crude oil <b>distillation</b> <b>units</b> (often referred to as atmospheric crude oil <b>distillation</b> <b>units).</b> Some refineries also had vacuum <b>distillation</b> <b>units</b> as well as thermal cracking units such as visbreakers (viscosity breakers, units to lower the viscosity of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or {{within a few years}} after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel.|$|R
