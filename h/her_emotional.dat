25|$|The {{scientists}} {{acknowledged that}} Genie's extreme emotional difficulties {{may have contributed}} to delaying her acquisition and willingness to use a few specific pieces of grammar, and at the beginning may have partially explained her very tacit demeanor. Nonetheless, in Curtiss and Fromkin repeatedly maintained that <b>her</b> <b>emotional</b> profile could not have impeded her ability to acquire language; they pointed out that she had clearly progressed in other aspects of her psychological development and was generally happy during their testing, and argued it was extremely implausible that emotional difficulties could interfere with her grammar acquisition without affecting her vocabulary. Several linguists, including Pinker and Derek Bickerton, accepted Curtiss and Fromkin's assessment while a few, including Stephen Laurence, questioned it but considered her case highly valuable. Other linguists, including Geoffrey Sampson, argued that the severity of <b>her</b> <b>emotional</b> difficulties made this extremely implausible and therefore negated much of the scientific significance ascribed to her case.|$|E

25|$|The Sepid poem (which {{translates}} to white poem), which draws its sources from this poet, avoided the compulsory rules which {{had entered the}} Nimai’ school of poetry and adopted a freer structure.

25|$|In {{the woman}} afflicted with gigantomastia (>1,000 gm {{increase}} per breast), the average breast-volume reduction diminished her oversized bust by three (3) brassière cup-sizes.

Afterwards, the woman's ability to comfortably perform physical activities previously impeded by oversized breasts improves <b>her</b> <b>emotional</b> health (self-esteem) by reducing anxiety and lessening psychological depression.|$|E

It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through <b>her</b> <b>emotional</b> problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Within {{six months}} of their marriage, Gustavus Adolphus left to command the siege of Riga, leaving Maria Eleonora {{in the early stages}} of her first pregnancy. She lived {{exclusively}} in the company of her German ladies-in-waiting and had difficulty in adapting herself to the Swedish people, countryside and climate. She disliked the bad roads, sombre forests and wooded houses, roofed with turf. She also pined for her husband. A year after their wedding she had a miscarriage and became seriously ill. She was tempestuous, excessive, neurotic and jealous. She was often given to harsh language, and she did not spare her husband, even when strangers were present. <b>Her</b> <b>emotional</b> life lacked balance, and everything Maria Eleonora undertook on her own initiative needed careful watching. Soon Gustavus Adolphus' intimates knew that his married life was a source of grief and anxiety.|$|E

25|$|Storm {{has been}} shown to be {{sensitive}} to the dynamics of the natural world, and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent <b>her</b> <b>emotional</b> state from resulting in violent weather. She has once sensed a diseased and dying tree on the X-Mansion grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums—including water, and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet's magnetosphere. Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns. Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body. Sentinels have considered Storm an Omega-level mutant on one occasion.|$|E
25|$|The {{set list}} for the concerts {{included}} songs from Knowles' three studio albums {{as well as several}} covers of other artists and a Destiny's Child medley. The central theme of the tour was to showcase the difference between Knowles' dual personality; <b>her</b> <b>emotional</b> side and her onstage persona, Sasha Fierce which was also demonstrated in the dual album I Am... Sasha Fierce. The show featured two stages – the main one and a smaller B-stage where Knowles was transferred {{during the middle of the}} show. She was backed by an all-female band, female background dancers and a big LED screen. Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the costumes and had a creative advisor role further working on the choreography, lighting and production. Chris March made the costumes usable for stage and helped in their making. For the ballads, Knowles wore longer dresses while for the performances of the up-tempo songs, more make-up and more revealing outfits were worn. The fashion and Knowles' look and figure received praise from critics.|$|E
25|$|Her {{changeable}} {{nature is}} reflected throughout her work, {{which has led}} critics and scholars to have very different conclusions about her and her work. Her style often goes {{back and forth between}} classic structure and baroque action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and monochrome palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often. By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction. Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery. Her interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works. Krasner is often reluctant to discuss the iconography of her work and instead emphasizes the importance of her biography since she claims her art is formed through her individual personality and <b>her</b> <b>emotional</b> state.|$|E
