500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E
2500|$|In the DuckTales series, Scrooge {{has adopted}} the nephews (as Donald {{has joined the}} Navy and is away on his tour of duty), {{and as a result}} his rougher edges are {{smoothed}} out somewhat. While most of his traits remain from the comics, he is notably more jovial and less irritable in the animated cartoon. In an early episode, Scrooge credits his improved temperament to the nephews and Webby (his housekeeper's granddaughter, who comes to live in Scrooge's mansion), saying that [...] "for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> left Scotland, I have a family". Though Scrooge is far from heartless in the comics, he is rarely so openly sentimental. While he still hunts for treasure in Ducktales, many episodes focus on his attempts to thwart villains. However, he remains just as tightfisted with money as he has always been. But he's also a good-hearted and generous with his family and friends.|$|E
60|$|I started, in ungovernable agitation, to my feet. The lawyer's {{question}} reminded me, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{had left}} England, that something HAD happened.|$|E

60|$|Then for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> her malady <b>I</b> saw Philippa blushing! Her long curved eyelashes hid her eyes, which presumably {{were also}} pink, but {{certainly}} my mother's broad pleasantry had called a tell-tale blush to the cheek {{of the young}} person.|$|R
50|$|Established in 1947 {{under the}} Liquor Licence Act (Ontario), which {{permitted}} alcohol {{to be sold}} and consumed in public taverns for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> World War <b>I,</b> the agency {{is not to be}} mistaken with the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, an alcohol retailer.|$|R

50|$|In 1919 the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards were disbanded, and the 1st Irish Guards {{returned}} to the United Kingdom victoriously. In 1920, for St Patrick's Day, the regiment donned its full-dress for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> World War <b>I.</b> In 1922 the regiment deployed to Constantinople {{as part of an}} allied force during the troubles in that region.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> sir, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{have taken}} part in politics, that anyone has offered to return money he has {{received}} {{on the ground that}} he had not sufficiently earned it; or indeed, upon any other ground, whatever. Your doing so has confirmed my opinion of the honesty of your people, and I would that such a feeling were common among my countrymen, here. No negotiations can be carried on, no alliance can be formed, without a demand for a large sum of money, or for an addition of territory. All our petty wars are waged, not on a question of principle, but entirely from greed.|$|R
5000|$|Brett Milano {{called it}} [...] "a {{brilliant}} album" [...] in the Boston Phoenix. [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> ''Til <b>I</b> Die', he's writing directly about his breakdown and recovery...Landy may have written these lyrics, but it hardly matters; Wilson didn't write {{the lyrics to}} Pet Sounds either." [...] Milano later labeled it one of Wilson's best post-'60s albums. Jackson Griffith praised it in Tower Records' Pulse magazine, calling it [...] "easily the finest, most consistently satisfying Wilson disc since The Beach Boys' Sunflower. He's still got it." [...] Bill Holdship praised the album in both BAM and MOJO magazines. The Detroit News' Susan Whitall and Entertainment Weekly's Dave DiMartino praised the album in their publications, and it appeared on several 1991 year-end poll lists.|$|R

60|$|I {{smoked a}} couple of cigars for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> came from the country; and as Anne and Charles went to the play, I muddled away the evening over my Sheriff-Court processes, and {{despatched}} a hugeous parcel to Will Scott at Selkirk. It is always something off hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{straightened}} {{up and looked at}} me. For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> knew her I saw her face--which was the color of the white keys of a new piano--turn pink. I walked toward her without a word. She let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass.|$|E
25|$|The 1920 Great Britain Lions tour saw the British rugby {{league team}} tour Australia for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> World War <b>I</b> and huge crowds {{attended}} their games. The first match {{of the tour}} was at the SCG against Metropolis in front of nearly 68,000 spectators. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane {{and in the second}} Test at the SCG on 3 July. The Australians sealed the series, scoring five tries to win 21–8 and secure the Ashes series for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> at home.|$|R
50|$|Spinax {{deployed}} to the Mediterranean Sea from 3 January to 3 March 1949, {{as the first}} postwar submarine unit of the Sixth Fleet. Upon her return to New London, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 6 based at Norfolk, Virginia—the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> World War <b>I</b> that submarines {{had been scheduled to}} operate from that base. She conducted operations along the east coast until again being {{deployed to}} the Sixth Fleet from 6 January to 23 May 1950. She returned to Norfolk until 12 June when she was transferred to the West Coast.|$|R
25|$|The {{game was}} {{televised}} in the United States by Fox, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck and color commentators Cris Collinsworth and Troy Aikman. Pam Oliver (Patriots sideline) and Chris Myers (Eagles sideline) served as sideline reporters. This marked the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> Super Bowl <b>I</b> {{that none of}} the network commentators had ever called a Super Bowl game before (although Collinsworth had worked three prior Super Bowl telecasts as a pregame analyst).

60|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{had known}} Theodore Watling, however, I {{saw him in}} the shadow of another individual; a man who, like a {{powerful}} magnet, continually drew our glances.

50|$|In 1975 the 36th Marine Amphibious Unit {{participated in}} Exercise Staff Zugel in West Germany. This marked the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> World War <b>I</b> that Marines took a {{combined}} arms force ashore in Germany. The unit was redesignated as the 26th Marine Amphibious Unit in 1982 and {{became part of}} the rotation cycle of three MAUs on the East Coast in 1985. It {{was the first of the}} MAUs to undergo Special Operations Capability training, earn the SOC qualification and have AV-8B Harriers attached. In 1988 the unit was again redesignated as the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit.|$|R

60|$|Here, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> leaving home, <b>I</b> was {{ushered into}} a civilised drawing-room; and when I found myself {{seated on a}} {{cushioned}} chair, with my moccasined feet pressing a soft carpet, and several real, bona fide ladies (the wife and daughters of my entertainer) sitting before me, and asking hundreds of questions about my long voyage, the strange species of unbelief {{in the possibility of}} again seeing the civilised world, which had beset me for the last three years, began slowly to give way, and at last entirely vanished when my host showed me into a handsomely furnished bedroom, and left me for the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do {{not take}} your advice {{it will be the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have come to look to you for so much," [...] she went on.

60|$|The {{last two}} {{occasions}} on which I {{was allowed to}} see my friends here, I tried to be as cheerful as possible, and to show my cheerfulness, {{in order to make}} them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the way from town to see me. It is only a slight return, I know, but it is the one, I feel certain, that pleases them most. I saw R--- for an hour on Saturday week, and I tried to give the fullest possible expression of the delight I really felt at our meeting. And that, in the views and ideas I am here shaping for myself, I am quite right is shown to me by the fact that now for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> my imprisonment <b>I</b> have a real desire for life.|$|R
2500|$|Reeve {{went through}} inner anguish in the ICU, {{particularly}} {{when he was}} alone during the night. His approaching operation to reattach his skull to his spine (June 1995) [...] "was frightening to contemplate. ... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent." [...] The man {{announced that he was}} a proctologist and was going to perform a rectal exam on Reeve. It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film Nine Months. Reeve wrote: [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the accident, <b>I</b> laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay." ...|$|R
40|$|Courts are {{currently}} concerned over {{the extent of}} their powers to integrate racially separate housing and schools within metropolitan areas containing black inner cities and white suburbs. This Comment reviews the jurisprudence addressing when it is a proper exercise of a court 2 ̆ 7 s equity jurisdiction to fashion a metropolitan or interdistrict remedial order in which the city and its surrounding suburbs are treated as one system. The Comment focuses on the recent Supreme Court decision in Milliken v. Bradley, in which the Court reversed a decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld the district court 2 ̆ 7 s power to order enforcement of a plan that would have integrated the schools of up to fifty-four school districts in Detroit. The Court held that an interdistrict remedy is dependent on finding an interdistrict constitutional violation, which it found was not present in the Milliken case. The Comment observes that Milliken was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> Brown <b>I</b> that the Court had reversed a lower court order which sought to promote the integration of the races after finding unconstitutional segregation. It thus concludes that the history of the Supreme Court as an instrument of reversing the 2 ̆ 2 separation of the races 2 ̆ 2 has entered a new phase...|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” she assented with a weary air, “except {{that you}} might ask {{yourself}} what is the good of tormenting a man of noble feelings, however absurd.

He was cornered almost for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had known him; and to tell the truth I rather wondered at the almost childish obstinacy which kept him so close to his original prejudice in favour of the wildly questionable lieutenant. At length he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Swords gleamed around me: one, two, three, four, five, six, I counted, {{and stood}} weak and dazed from loss of blood, gazing stupidly {{at the white}} blades.

But the absence of that trusty friend left me limp and helpless--cowed for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had borne arms.|$|E
50|$|The Reforger {{exercise}} {{itself was}} first conceived in 1967. During the ongoing Vietnam War, the Johnson administration {{announced plans to}} withdraw approximately two divisions from Europe in 1968. As a demonstration of its continuing commitment {{to the defense of}} NATO and to illustrate its capability of rapid reinforcement, a large scale force deployment was planned that would deploy a division or more to West Germany in a regular annual exercise. The first such exercise was conducted beginning on 6 January 1969. These exercises continued annually past the end of the Cold War, except for the year 1989, until 1993. Reforger 1975 marked the operational presence of the United States Marine Corps in Europe for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> World War <b>I</b> when the 2nd Marine Division's 32nd Marine Amphibious Unit (32nd MAU) was deployed from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina as part of that exercise. Reforger 1988 was billed as the largest European ground maneuver since the end of World War II as 125,000 troops were deployed.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, Dangarembga {{published}} {{a short story}} in Sweden called [...] "The Letter". In 1987, she published the play She Does Not Weep in Harare. At the age of 25, she had her first taste of success with her novel Nervous Conditions, which won the African section of the Commonwealth Writers' Prize in 1989 and {{is considered one of}} the twelve best African novels ever written. Asked about her subsequent prose drought, she explained: [...] "There have been two major reasons for my not having worked on prose since Nervous Conditions: firstly, the novel was published only after I had turned to film as a medium; secondly, Virginia Woolf's shrewd observation that a woman needs £500 and a room of her own in order to write is entirely valid. Incidentally, I am moving and hope that, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> Nervous Conditions, <b>I</b> shall have a room of my own. I'll try to ignore the bit about £500." ...|$|R

[...] The project affected Kellaway [...] "in a way that the writings of Camille Paglia, Natasha Walter or Naomi Wolf never have. For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the 1970s, <b>I</b> find myself cross on behalf of women, and rather inclined to take up cudgels. What has swayed me are not statistics or arguments but real stories of sexism. So far she has collected more than 60,000 of them, which sit there online, hard to ignore or dismiss."
