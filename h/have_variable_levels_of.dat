This thesis examines {{the effects of}} bimodality in transit time distributions -in particular, the cost of ignoring bimodality. One method common in practice is to completely ignore variability. On the other hand, a popular theoretical method to account for transit time variability is to assume that demand over transit time is normally distributed. Which is, in many cases, false. To display the incorrectness of such assumptions, the paper will compare the two approaches to empirical analysis on bimodal transit time distributions. by Lita Das. Thesis (S.

Previously, we showed that M. tuberculosis contains a copper-sensitive operon, cso, that is induced during early infection in mice. In this study, we showed that ctpV, a gene in the cso operon, is a copper-responsive gene and most likely encodes an efflux pump for Cu. Furthermore, the transcription of key genes in the cso operon is induced by Cu ions and not by other ions, such as Ni and Zn ions. To elucidate copper-responsive genes other than those in the cso operon, we utilized DNA microarrays to profile mycobacterial responses to physiological levels of Cu. A transcriptome analysis identified a novel set of 30 copper-responsive genes in M. tuberculosis, one-half of which were induced only when toxic levels of Cu were added. Interestingly, several transcriptional regulators, including the furA gene, were induced during toxic Cu exposure, indicating that there was a generalized response to oxidative stressors rather than a Cu-specific response. In general, the Cu-induced transcriptome generated should help elucidate the role of the Cu response in maintaining M. tuberculosis survival during infection and could provide novel targets for controlling this virulent pathogen...|$|E

However, findings suggest a difference between the perceived role and MHNs' practice in undertaking physical health promotion which highlights the need for role clarification and further skills training.

Spoilage bacteria are known {{to communicate with each other}} by release of signaling molecules, a phenomenon described as quorum sensing (QS). Some food matrices inhibit these signaling compounds. In this study we screened QS inhibitory activities in raw milk of cattle and camel. Ten samples each of fresh raw cow’s milk and she-camel’s milk from apparently healthy animals were screened using the bacterial model Cromobacterium violaceum. The tested cow’s raw milk samples were able to inhibit the production of QS signalling molecules acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) produced by C. violaceum. However, she-camel’s milk samples were less effective in inhibiting such AHLs. Thus, one of the factors which influence the inhibitory activity could be derived from variation in milk chemical composition, especially in the percentage of fat which is significantly higher in tested cow’s milk samples (2. 22 ± 0. 12) than in tested she-camel’s milk samples (1. 44 ± 0. 35).

Despite recent advances in exercise hardware and prescribed exercise countermeasures, ISS crewmembers are still found to <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> deconditioning post-flight. This presentation {{provides an overview of}} the astronaut medical certification requirements, pre-flight physical training, in-flight exercise countermeasures, and the post-flight reconditioning program. Astronauts must meet medical certification requirements on selection, annually, and prior to ISS missions. In addition, extensive physical fitness testing and standardized medical assessments are performed on long duration crewmembers pre-flight. Limited physical fitness assessments and medical examinations are performed in-flight to develop exercise countermeasure prescriptions, ensure that the crewmembers are physically capable of performing mission tasks, and monitor astronaut health. Upon mission completion, long duration astronauts must re-adapt to the 1 G environment, and be certified as fit to return to space flight training and active duty. A structured, supervised postflight reconditioning program has been developed to prevent injuries, facilitate re-adaptation to the 1 G environment, and subsequently return astronauts to training and space flight. The NASA reconditioning program is implemented by the Astronaut Strength, Conditioning, and Rehabilitation (ASCR) team and supervised by NASA flight surgeons. This program has evolved over the past 10 years of the International Space Station (ISS) program and has been successful in ensuring that long duration astronauts safely re-adapt to the 1 g environment and return to active duty. Lessons learned from this approach to managing deconditioning can be applied to terrestrial medicine and future exploration space flight missions...|$|E

Despite the high prevalence of undernutrition amongst older adults in long-term care, few screening instruments have been developed or evaluated in this setting. This review aims to evaluate the validity, reproducibility and feasibility of nutrition screening instruments developed for use, or described as being used, with older adults in long-term care. Ten publications encompassing nine independent nutrition screening tools were identified using electronic databases and manual searches of reference lists. The Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) was the most widely evaluated nutrition screening instrument and met the requirements for a valid instrument (sensitivity and specificity > 0. 9) {{for use in the}} long-term care setting. Modified versions of the MNA for use in China and South Africa also demonstrated acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity. Other nutrition screening instruments were found to <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> sensitivity and specificity and while some demonstrated levels consistent with the MNA-SF, only two were evaluated across more than one study population, Body Mass Index (BMI) +weight loss and BMI+albumin.

In conclusion, it is evident from this review that further work in this area is needed. Based on validity, reproducibility and feasibility it appears that BMI+weight loss is the most suitable nutrition screening instrument for use in the long-term care setting at this time. MNA-SF is promising; however, there is currently no data for inter-rater or test-retest reproducibility in the long-term care setting. <br /...|$|E

The priorities of the program are high grain yield, disease resistance, tolerance to abiotic stresses (drought and heat), and desirable quality. The Wheat Chemistry and Quality Laboratory has been continuously evolving to be able to analyze the largest number of samples possible, in the shortest time, at lowest cost, in order to deliver data on diverse quality traits on time to the breeders for making selections for advancement in the breeding pipeline. The participation of wheat quality analysis/selection is carried out in two stages of the breeding process: evaluation of the parental lines for new crosses and advanced lines in preliminary and elite yield trials. Thousands of lines are analyzed which requires a big investment in resources. Genomic selection has been proposed to assist in selecting for quality and other traits in breeding programs. Genomic selection can predict quantitative traits and is applicable to multiple quantitative traits in a breeding pipeline by attaining historical phenotypes and adding high-density genotypic information. Due to advances in sequencing technology, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism markers are available through genotyping-by-sequencing at a cost conducive to application for genomic selection. At CIMMYT, genomic selection has been applied to predict all of the processing and end-use quality traits regularly tested in the spring wheat breeding program.

We have previously reported that patients with chronic progressive MS (CPMS) have significantly increased numbers of circulating monocytes which express the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). In the present study, we examined the expression of uPAR on monocytes in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) not currently participating in a clinical trial and in patients with RRMS who were enrolled in a double-blind multicenter clinical trial designed to examine the effect of glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1; Copaxone) on relapsing disease. Patients with CPMS have sustained high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> circulating uPAR-positive (uPAR+) monocytes. In comparison, patients with RRMS displayed <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> circulating uPAR+ monocytes.

In both placebo-treated and glatiramer acetate-treated patients, the percentage of circulating uPAR+ monocytes, as well as the density of uPAR expressed per cell (mean linear fluorescence intensity), increased just prior to the onset of a clinically documented exacerbation. Values fell dramatically with the development of clinical symptoms. uPAR levels in all groups correlated with both clinical activity and severity.

The Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model simulates how random geometric graphs grow in the hyperbolic space, reproducing strong clustering and scale-free degree distribution, however it misses to reproduce an important feature of real complex networks, which is the community organization. The Geometrical-Preferential-Attachment (GPA) model was recently developed to confer to the PSO also a community structure, which is obtained by forcing different angular regions of the hyperbolic disk to <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> attractiveness. However, the number and size of the communities cannot be explicitly controlled in the GPA, which is a clear limitation for real applications.

The nPSO differs from GPA in other three aspects: it allows to explicitly fix the number and size of communities; it allows to tune their mixing property through the network temperature; it is efficient to generate networks with high clustering. After several tests we propose the nPSO as a valid and efficient model to generate networks with communities in the hyperbolic space, which can be adopted as a realistic benchmark for different tasks such as community detection and link prediction...|$|R

An understanding of the distribution and levels of expression of the ARs on the cellular and tissue level demonstrates the pattern of responsiveness to the androgenic hormones in a given organism. In this study, a fragment of the AR gene was cloned and sequenced from the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, an elasmobranch species with a well-defined annual reproductive cycle. Acquiring this gene sequence facilitated the construction of species-specific AR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and species-specific AR mRNA probes {{that were used to}} screen reproductive tissues for evidence of AR gene expression using reverse transcription (RT) -PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. The RT-PCR screens demonstrated AR gene expression in the testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles, and claspers of male sharks. The use of relative PCR revealed that these organs <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> AR gene expression that significantly differ with the stage of the shark 2 ̆ 7 s seasonal reproductive cycle.

Immunocytochemical methods used to detect the AR protein using a rabbit polyclonal antibody, PG- 21, produced comparable results in the shark testes but did not yield positive results in the seminal vesicles or the epididymides. However, the Leydig gland, whose secretions contribute to the seminal fluid, demonstrated consistent AR immunoreactivity. Results of ICC in male and female embryos of S. tiburo revealed AR protein in the developing kidney but not in the embryonic reproductive structures.

40|$|The role {{of spatial}} {{reasoning}} {{in the development}} of systems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence is increasing. One particular approach, qualitative spatial reasoning, investigates the usage of abstract representation to facilitate the representation of and the reasoning with spatial information. This thesis investigates the usage of intervals along global axes as the under-lying representational and reasoning mechanism for a spatial reasoning system. Aspects that are unique to representing spatial information (flow and multi-dimensionality) are used to provide a method for classifying relations between objects at multiple levels of granularity. The combination of these two mechanisms (intervals and classification) provide the basis {{for the development of a}} querying system that allows qualitative queries about object relations in multi-dimensional space to be performed upon the representation. The second issue examined by this thesis is the problem of representing intervals when all the interval relations may not be known precisely. A three part solution is proposed. The first shows how the simplest situation, where all relations are explicit and primitive, can be represented and integrated with the above mentioned querying system. The second situation demonstrates how, for interval relations that are primitive but are not all explicitly known, an effective point based representation may be constructed. Finally, when relations between intervals are disjunctions of possible primitive interval relations, a representation is presented which allows solutions to queries to be constructed from consistent data. Our contribution is two-fold: 1. a method of classifying the spatial relations and the means of querying these relations; 2. a process of efficiently representing incomplete interval information and the means of efficiently querying this information. The work presented ++in this thesis demonstrates the utility of a multi-dimensional qualitative spatial reasoning system based upon intervals. It also demonstrates how an interval representation may be constructed for datasets that <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> information about relationships between intervals represented in the dataset...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Atrialnatriureticpeptides (ANP 5) from severalspecies induced {{the human}} {{acrosome}} reaction. The maximal response was highest for human ANP (18. 6 % above unstimulated or baseline values) and decreased progressively for peptides derived from animals {{lower on the}} phylogenetic scale. ANP concentrations required for a half-maximal effect in noncapacitated spermatozoa ranged from 0. 07 to 0. 38 nM. ANP induced the acrosome reaction incapacitated spermatozoa, but the concentration required was higher than in noncapacitated cells. The response in noncapacitated spermatozoa was independent of added extracellularCa 2 and was completely inhibited by 1 pM LY 83583 (inhibits particulate guanylate cydase). However, 10 pM Nw-nitro-L-arginine (inhibits soluble guanylate cyclase) had no effect. ANP (80 pM) and 3 pM 1, 2 -dihexanoyl-sn. glycerol each induced a nearly half-maximal acrosome reaction. Added in combination, they produced no increased response, suggesting antagonism. Follicular fluid <b>had</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> immunoreactive ANP. Average ANP content was nearly zero in samples that contained no oocyte {{at the time of}} aspiration but was higher (6. 9 pM; 90 % confidence limits = 1. 67 - 28. 72 pM) in follicular fluid containing oocytes that did not fertilize in vitro. Highest concentrations of ANP were present in follicular fluid containing oocytes that fertilized in vitro (72. 8 pM; 90 % confidence limits = 38. 1 - 139. 1 pM). These data suggest that noncapacitated spermatozoa can acrosome react without added extracellular Ca 2 in response to an extracellular ligand. Also, human spermatozoa appear to contain receptors for ANP similar to those found in other cell types. The ANP content of follicular fluid might partly explain the ability of follicular fluid to induce the acrosome reaction...|$|R

UBC 22, UBC 19 - 20, and UBC 1 - 6 <b>had</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> E 3 -independent activity. Six UBCs were inactive with all RINGs tested. Closely related UBC 8, 10, 11, and 28 were active with the largest number of RING E 3 s and with all RING types. Expression analysis was performed to determine whether E 2 s or E 3 s were expressed in specific organs or under specific environmental conditions. Closely related E 2 s show unique patterns of expression and most express ubiquitously. Some RING E 3 s are also ubiquitously expressed; however, others show organ-specific expression. Of all the organs tested, RING mRNAs are most abundant in floral organs. This study demonstrates that E 2 diversity includes examples with broad and narrow specificity toward RINGs, and that most ubiquitin E 2 s are broadly expressed with each having a unique spatial and developmental pattern of expression...|$|R
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors <b>have</b> a <b>variable</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of appropriate crop rotation(s) and management interventions {{has the potential}} to transform saline-sodic soil and water resources from an environmental burden into an economic asset. We carried out 2 -year field studies in the Indus Basin of Pakistan to evaluate different irrigation and soil management options of using saline-sodic waters (SSW) and soils for reclamation and for growing salt-tolerant cultivars of rice (SSRI- 8) and wheat (SIS- 32). These soils <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> salinity and sodicity (ECe 9 - 44 dS m) 1 and SAR 83 - 319). The treatments on both the sites were the same and consisted of: (1) Irrigation with SSW, (2) Irrigation with freshwater (FW), (3) Soil application of gypsum at 100 % gypsum requirement of soil + SSW (G + SSW), (4) G + one irrigation with SSW and one with FW (G + 1 SSW + 1 FW), (5) G + two irrigations with SSW and one with FW (G + 2 SSW + 1 FW), (6) Farm manure at 25 Mg ha) 1 each year before rice + one irrigation with SSW and one with (FW FM + 1 SSW + 1 FW) and (7) FM + two irrigations with SSW and one with FW (FM + 2 SSW + 1 FW). Rice was grown as the first crop. After harvesting final wheat crop (fourth in sequence), maximum decrease in bulk density and increase in infiltration rate was observed with G + 1 SSW + 1 FW while FM + 1 SSW + 1 FW treatment showed higher decrease in pHs and ECe. Significantly the highest decrease in SAR occurred at both sites with G + 1 SSW + 1 FW. Maximum yields of rice and wheat were generally observed with G + 1 SSW + 1 FW. The crop yield and economic benefits with treatments showed a positive correlation with that of improvement in soil physical and chemical properties. Overall, the greatest net benefit was obtained from G + 1 SSW + 1 FW treatment. We also found that the farmers' management skills were crucial in the overall success in improving crop yields during reclamation of saline-sodic soils. Based on the results of this study, we propose that SSW could be used to reclaim saline-sodic soils by using a rice-wheat rotation and a site-specific {{combination of}} soil amendments and water application strategies...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{increasing}} variability will have especially profound adverse impacts upon {{the lives of}} rural communities in developing countries. However, households have differing asset bases and livelihood strategies, and therefore may <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability. Designing appropriate climate adaptation strategies must take these differences into account. This study examined the heterogeneity of vulnerability amongst rural communities in Lombok, Indonesia, and considers implications for climate adaptation policy interventions. Three villages, with differing natural resource bases, were selected as case studies: forest, rain-fed agriculture, and coastal fisheries and aquaculture. Based on a questionnaire survey (n= 250), a household typology was generated. Cannon's (2008) vulnerability framework was applied to analyse the factors driving vulnerability for each household type in the villages. Interviews (n= 72) with individuals from different household types were also employed to determine their perceptions about vulnerability and adaptation preferences. Participatory focus group discussions and social network mapping were also utilised to triangulate causes of vulnerability and dependencies between household types. Three main key conclusions emerged. First, although climate variability contributes to increased livelihood vulnerability, the degradation of traditional institutions through modernisation and social change {{was considered to be}} a more serious problem. In particular, traditional institutions are an important source of adaptive capacity for poorer households. Second, community structures are complex, with different household types depending on one another for support. Social cohesion and mutual assistance are important for maintaining livelihood activities both in difficult times and during normal daily situations. Third, current development programs do not account for this variability of household types, their adaptation needs or the linkages between them. As a result, wealthier households benefit more than poorer ones, and there is little evidence of 'trickle down' benefits from rich to poor. This inequality could potentially lead to maladaptation. These patterns were similar across all case study villages. However, the dynamic interactions among households types differed based on the strength of social cohesion and local institutions. Therefore adaptation policies must be better designed and be more egalitarian. Specifically they must restore and maintain traditional institutions and social capital. The 'vulnerability components framework' from Cannon (2008) was used to identify necessary intervention points for different household types. These components are interlinked to each other and enable understanding of what causes some people to be more at risk of a hazard than others...|$|E
40|$|Induction of {{immunity}} that limits Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice is critically {{dependent on the}} activation of the innate immune response. In this study, we investigated the role of cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing a pyrin domain (NLRP) inflammasome sensors during acute toxoplasmosis in mice. We show that in vitro Toxoplasma infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages activates the NLRP 3 inflammasome, resulting in the rapid production and cleavage of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), with no measurable cleavage of IL- 18 and no pyroptosis. Paradoxically, Toxoplasma-infected mice produced large quantities of IL- 18 but had no measurable IL- 1 β in their serum. Infection of mice deficient in NLRP 3, caspase- 1 / 11, IL- 1 R, or the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC led to decreased levels of circulating IL- 18, increased parasite replication, and death. Interestingly, mice deficient in NLRP 1 also displayed increased parasite loads and acute mortality. Using mice deficient in IL- 18 and IL- 18 R, we show that this cytokine {{plays an important role}} in limiting parasite replication to promote murine survival. Our findings reveal T. gondii as a novel activator of the NLRP 1 and NLRP 3 inflammasomes in vivo and establish a role for these sensors in host resistance to toxoplasmosis. IMPORTANCE Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that are a major component of the innate immune system. They contain “sensor” proteins that are responsible for detecting various microbial and environmental danger signals and function by activating caspase- 1, an enzyme that mediates cleavage and release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and IL- 18. Toxoplasma gondii is a highly successful protozoan parasite capable of infecting a wide range of host species that <b>have</b> <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> resistance. We report here that T. gondii is a novel activator of the NLRP 1 and NLRP 3 inflammasomes in vivo and establish a role for these sensors in host resistance to toxoplasmosis. Using mice deficient in IL- 18 and IL- 18 R, we show that the IL- 18 cytokine plays a pivotal role by limiting parasite replication to promote murine survival. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

Agricultural production presents many hazards {{which may or may}} not be unique to this industry.

University farms face many of the same problems as private production agriculture, with the added pressure of often being diverse operations with the constant presence of student workers, which <b>have</b> highly <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> experience.

40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{is crucial for}} long-term population persistence. Population loss and subsequent reduction in migration rate {{among the most important}} processes that are expected to lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and an increase in genetic differentiation. While the theory behind this is well-developed, empirical evidence from wild populations is inconsistent. Using microsatellite markers, we compared the genetic structure of populations of an amphibian species, the midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans), in four Swiss regions where the species <b>has</b> suffered <b>variable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> subpopulation extirpation. We also quantified the effects of several geographic factors on genetic structure and used a model selection approach to ascertain which of the variables were important for explaining genetic variation. Although subpopulation pairwise FST-values were highly significant even over small geographic scales, neither any of the geographic variables nor loss of subpopulations were important factors for predicting spatial genetic structure. The absence of a signature of subpopulation loss on genetic differentiation may suggest that midwife toad subpopulations function as relatively independent units...|$|R
