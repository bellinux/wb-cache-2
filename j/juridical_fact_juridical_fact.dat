40|$|The person’s civil ability, having as {{constitutive}} elements {{the capacity}} to have rights and obligations and the legal competence, assigns the juridical capacity specific to the civil law. While the civil capacity to have rights and obligations represents the general and abstract aptitude of a person to have rights and obligations and it is gained at birth date and sometimes even since the conception, the legal competence is granted in considering the discernment gradually formed and it supposes the person’s aptitude to exert and accomplish civil obligations by contracting civil juridical documents. As such, the legal competence regards exclusively the person’s juridical documents and has no connection to the stricto sensu <b>juridical</b> <b>facts.</b> Depending {{on the stage of}} the discernment development, the Civil Code classifies natural persons in four classes, namely: persons missing the legal competence, persons having a restrained legal competence, persons having an anticipated legal competence and persons having full legal competence. Natural persons placed in one of the respective classes either cannot contract civil juridical documents, or can contract by themselves only certain civil juridical documents, or can contract certain juridical documents with the permission of the legal protector, and others even with the authorization of certain protecting organisms, or can contract by themselves any civil juridical documents allowed by the valid legislation at a certain time. juridical capacity, civil capacity, restrained exertion ability, full legal competence, discernment, civil juridical documents. ...|$|R

" This is probably an accurate description especially as it came straight from the horse's mouth - Lugard being one of the agents involved in their collection. Several writers have expressed the opinion that, from an international law point of view, these cartloads of "treaties" were just scraps of paper which neither imposed legal obligations nor conferred any rights. It is said that at best they were moral rights and duties which could be ignored at the whim of the European states. In this paper I examine some of these arguments in relation to {{the agreements}} which the British made with African chiefs {{in the late nineteenth}} century and endeavour to establish the legal significance of these agreements in international law and in British municipal law.

Children as the creature created by One Mighty God have basic rights since they were born, thus there is no one or other part that is permitted to take this rights. One of the shapes of Children Basic Rights was the guarantee for gaining protection of which is appropriate to the values of Pancasila and the state purpose as has been stipulated in the Preface of Constitution of 1945. Children are actually children, instead of smaller adults. Started from this characteristic, the treatment to the children involved in a crime or who have social problem, should be addressed in order and due of their prosperity. Relating to the great deal of legal problem resulted by the happening of criminal action which is conducted by the children, thus it becomes very interesting if the legal problem concerning to the happening of criminal action of stealing is submitted and studied by title “The Judge’s Judgment in Sentencing Criminal Punishment to the Perpetrator of Stealing Criminal Action of which is conducted by Children. ” Based on aforementioned above problem background, thus it can be formulated an issue, i. e. what is the judge’s basic of consideration in sentencing criminal punishment to the perpetrator of stealing criminal action of which is conducted by children.

40|$|Two {{divergent}} {{systems are}} usually differentiated between {{when it comes}} to the way in which real rights are transferred from one person to another, namely abstract and causal systems. In this article the features of each system, the respect in which they differ from each other, and the practical implications of the distinction are established. It appears that in a causal system real rights are transferred by conclusion of the obligatory agreement, which should be valid and enforceable. The mutual intention to transfer and to receive real rights is not construed as an independent real agreement as it is contained in the obligatory agreement. In a causal system the transferor finds himself in a favourable position in relation to other parties while bona fide third parties undoubtedly get the worst of the deal since they have no protection against the disadvantageous consequences of delivery owing to a void obligation. In an abstract system the obligatory agreement is not sufficient for the transfer of real rights, the thing should also be delivered and there should be a valid real agreement which consists merely of the mutual intention to transfer and to receive real rights. The real agreement is a characteristic of an abstract system which distinguishes it from a causal system. Compared with the position of those in the causal system, the transferee and third parties find themselves in a favourable position vis-à-vis the transferor. In a causal system the concept iusta causa refers to a valid and enforceable obligatory agreement or other <b>juridical</b> <b>fact</b> which obliges the transferee to deliver the thing. In an abstract system it serves no purpose to describe the causa with reference to the obligatory agreement, since it is not a substantive law requirement for the transfer of real rights. The causa concept refers rather to the mutual intention to transfer and to receive real rights, which is nothing less than the real agreement. Since the causa is contained in the real agreement it is no longer of any use in an abstract system and should be abandoned. The Dutch system displays the characteristics of an abstract system in that a separate act of delivery should exist and a valid real agreement is a requirement for the transfer of real rights. On the other hand it also displays characteristics of a causal system, since a valid obligatory agreement is a requirement for the transfer of real rights...|$|R

40|$|Without {{claiming}} of exhaustivity, {{this work}} aims at verifying {{the possibility to}} consider food as a common good from a <b>juridical</b> perspective. In <b>fact,</b> it seems that so far the Italian constitutional doctrine has not covered this particular aspect – anything but irrelevant – in the studies dealing with these theories. Therefore, I will try hereafter to make some short reflections from a constitutional perspective, {{with the purpose of}} showing the quantity of difficulties that can be encountered if one considers this hypothesis, i. e. if one places the right to food not only beyond the «private», but also beyond the «public» dimension provided by the Constitution. Ultimately, after identifying some critical aspects of the doctrines of common goods, I will try to examine the possibility to guarantee all people the fundamental right to access to food by using the «public utilities made available by the local government». Otherwise, if we let the laws of the market be the ones that can guarantee food, we risk legitimizing a “juridical paradox” that the constitutional order (at least the Italian one) by no means can tolerate...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Italian law no. 86 of 5 June 2012, which {{establishes}} {{a set of}} rules on the matter of breast implants, came into effect in July 2012. The law {{is at the center of}} a widespread and animated cultural debate that in recent years has been taking place in Italy. DISCUSSION: The fundamental prohibition imposed by the law concerns the age limit. Breast implants for exclusively aesthetic purposes are allowed only if the legal age (18 years) has been reached. This prohibition does not apply in cases of severe congenital malformations certified by a physician operating within the National Health Service or by a public health care institution. The legal imposition of an age limit raises a number of perplexities: one at a bioethical level and one that is strictly <b>juridical.</b> In <b>fact,</b> it is impossible to deal with this issue unless the wider debate concerning the self-determination and autonomy of underage patients in biomedical matters is considered. It appears, then, that the issue is again exclusively related to the peculiarity of cosmetic surgery, which when aimed at correcting "only" the pathologic experiences of self-image, does not acquire the dignity of therapy. If, however, the improvement of self-image serves to achieve a better psycho-emotional balance and favors the development of social relations undermined by evident physical defects, age restrictions can be disregarded. The authors believe the real risk is that the law imposed by the Italian state is based on assumptions and preformed value judgments. Furthermore, in the understanding of needs, legislation often is biased toward objective biophysical problems without attaching due importance to subjective psychological and social problems. While acknowledging the seriousness of the issue, the authors do not agree with the legislature's rigidity. However, plastic surgeons must form a plan for addressing the concerns about breast implants and evaluating whether they are appropriate for adolescents, taking into account the unique psychological and developmental considerations of adolescent cosmetic surgery patients...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the benevolence {{starting}} from the Reflexio 903 of Kant’s anthropological Nachlaβ, that depicts {{the figure of the}} Cyclops as a subject shun from sociality. The autor wants to raise the issue whether the virtue of benevolence could contribute to overcome the condition of those Cyclops, who nowadays maintain a hyper-liberal conception of justice. According to the Grundlegung der Methaphysik der Sitten, benevolence should be interpreted {{as the result of a}} phenomenological path of moral consciousness, whose figures can be represented by the four duties of love. The phenomenology of benevolence is then accompanied by the analysis of its conceptual structure. Starting from Kant’s Methaphysik der Sitten benevolence involves in <b>fact</b> the <b>juridical,</b> communicative, and ethical dimension of social coexistence.

40|$|Abstract. Data {{privacy is}} a {{fundamental}} human right, not only accord-ing to the EU perspective. Each EU state implements sophisticated data protection acts.

This paper is an interdisciplinary study that examines this hypothesis by means of empirical <b>facts</b> on <b>juridical</b> assessment criteria – and validates it. We have inspected 100 service providers, from social online platforms to web shops. Our study considers legal requirements of the privacy policy and how providers ask for consent and react to requests for information or deletion of personal data.

While these theories are often regarded as opposite, they in <b>fact</b> are dissimilar <b>juridical</b> solutions. The exhaustion doctrine derives from an economic conception of copyright law whereas the droit de destination originates from natural law focussed on the interests of the author. The second part is concerned with the fact that a coherent theory on work distribution in Canadian copyright law has yet to be established. It will be shown how the legislator and the jurisprudence have developed means to assure that, after the first distribution of the work, the copyright holder is still in the position to control some of its use. Finally, I will proceed to analyse the regime that deals specifically with parallel imports allowing the copyright holder to supervise imported works...|$|R
40|$|Juridical {{acts are}} drafted {{in order to}} create legal effects. Giving effect is, however, not always as easy as it might seem at first sight. During the {{execution}} of the juridical act, it frequently is unclear which obligations it actually entails. This lack of clarity results from the <b>fact</b> that <b>juridical</b> acts are concluded using a code, which is language. Because of the vagueness of expression or {{as a result of the}} indistinctness of language, the uttered intention is not always in agreement with the real one. Sometimes an expression has more than one meaning. Besides, words are never clear. They derive their meaning from a context. Therefore all communication, including every juridical act, needs to be interpreted. This PhD investigates the interpretation of juridical acts. All juridical acts volitional acts. Therefore, the governing interpretation criterion has to be the intention. When it comes to unilateral acts, the intention is the will of the party who undertakes a performance. When it comes to reciprocal acts, the intention is the common will of the contracting parties. Two different approaches can govern the search for the intention. One the one hand, one can argue that the real intention has to be decisive. A contract comes into being as a result of a consensus, and intention is also the base of every unilateral juridical act. On the other hand, one can reason that the written word is of overriding importance. It is the outward reflection of the intention, which the other party and third parties have become acquainted with. In some jurisdictions, the essential rule of interpretation is subjective, while other jurisdictions start from the premise that interpretation has to be fundamentally objective. In practice, however, all interpretative systems use subjective as well as objective components. This finding of course triggers the question: which interpretative system is the best one? This PhD investigates what a coherent and practicable system of interpretation of jurdical acts should look like, taking into account the autonomy of the parties on the one hand and legal certainty on the other hand. nrpages: 803 P. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} the two Sabbath conflict narratives in the Fourth Gospel (In 5 and 9 : 1 - 10 : 21) from a narrative-critical perspective. It seeks {{to determine the}} precise nature of the Johannine juridical metaphor as reflected in these narratives, the specific purpose of its use as a distinctive narrative genre in the text under study, {{as well as the}} plausible social function it would have played within the Johannine Sitz im Leben. The scope of the study is determined by the above-stated three-fold objective. Thus, it begins with the examination and critical evaluation of previous Johannine scholarship concerning the nature of the Fourth Gospel 2 ̆ 7 s juridical metaphor which, at least since Theo Preiss, is generally understood as corresponding to a trial. It then goes on to establish that, in the light of recent understanding of the Old Testament rib-pattern as a two-party juridical controversy, In 5 and 9 : 1 - 10 : 21 are best understood not as a trial, but as a two party juridical controversy as found in the Old Testament. This formal analysis of the text is then followed by an exegetical study of the Johannine Sabbath conflict material (In 5 and 9 : 1 - 10 : 21). The exegetical analysis underscores the <b>fact</b> that the <b>juridical</b> process in the text under study is throughout bilateral in nature and therefore corresponds to the controversy as a juridical procedure and not to a trial (which is not encountered until chapters 18 - 19). The study closes by examining the specific role that the juridical controversy, as a narrative strategy, plays in terms of the communication to the reader of the christology which emerges from the two narratives, and the social function which the use of this distinctive genre would have had within the Johannine Sitz im Leben. In terms of major conclusions, the study establishes firstly that the Johannine Sabbath conflicts are essentially bilateral in nature with Jesus as the accused and 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 the Jews 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 as the accusers.;This means that we are dealing here with a juridical controversy and not a trial which is trilateral in nature. As a bilateral procedure, the juridical controversy is marked by a strong rhetoric of persuasion which is always aimed at one 2 ̆ 7 s opponent in a bid to convince him/her of the truthfulness of one 2 ̆ 7 s position in order to bring the conflict to a peaceful end and effect reconciliation. Secondly, it demonstrates that the narrator of the Fourth Gospel uses the juridical controversy as a narrative strategy {{for the purposes of the}} christological persuasion of the reader. This means that the narrator places the rhetorical techniques inherent in the juridical controversy at the service of the christological credo which he/she is seeking to communicate to the reader. Finally, the study shows that the recourse to the juridical controversy as a narrative strategy in the Fourth Gospel would have been necessitated by the Christian-Jewish conflicts of the post 70 C. E. period. The use of the juridical controversy in In 5 and 9 : 1 - 10 : 21 would therefore have been part of the effort of the 10 hannine Christians to convince their opponents of the truthfulness of their christological claims and to lead them to faith in Jesus. In this perspective, the juridical controversy christology would have functioned within the Johannine Sitz im Leben. among other things, as a means of persuasion of and an appeal to first-century Jewish non-Christians to acknowledge the true identity and significance of Jesus...|$|R
