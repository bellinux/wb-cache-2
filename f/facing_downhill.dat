50|$|Seonodae is an octagonal, steep-stepped, black brick {{platform}} directly {{adjacent to}} Seojangdae {{at the crest}} of Paldalsan when heading uphill from Hwaseomun. From here, archers could attack assailants {{in a wide range}} of directions and <b>facing</b> <b>downhill,</b> too.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{withstand}} any downward thrust, the end <b>facing</b> <b>downhill</b> is normally built in the shape of an apse with a strong support. Entrances are very rarely placed in the apsidal end, in order not to compromise its strength.|$|E
50|$|After {{passing the}} Little Sluice the next {{obstacle}} is Thousand Dollar hill (also sometimes called Million Dollar hill). It is a rock ledge {{followed by a}} steep grade, <b>facing</b> <b>downhill</b> if driving the trail toward Lake Tahoe. As of 7/15/2012, Thousand Dollar Hill has been closed. This obstacle had a moderately difficult bypass (the original trail), which is now the only route open.|$|E

25|$|The Saint Andrew's Church was {{constructed}} on a 15-meter foundation-stylobate, which {{from the eastern}} side <b>faces</b> <b>downhill</b> and from the western—has a two-story construction. The church consists of a single dome and five small decorative spires. From the outside façade, Corinthian columns decorate the church, accompanied by additional decorations. The windows and doors of the church are decorated with ornamental details.|$|R

BC. south and east of the village which are typical of the tombs found around Maktar. A study of fifty-three of the dolmens by Belmonte, Esteban and Jiménez González suggest that some of these tombs may be orientated towards Alpha Centauri. In contrast Hoskin argues that Tunisian dolmen orientations {{can be explained by the}} local topography, in that the entrances all <b>face</b> <b>downhill.</b>|$|R
50|$|In snowboarding, {{in a park}} event, landing {{the other}} way from natural is landing switch. In a pipe event, It is called landing fakie. Freeride, powder, and alpine snowboards are non-symmetrical so {{theoretically}} riding them backwards with the tail <b>facing</b> <b>downhill</b> is riding fakie, and riding with switched bindings (goofy setting if you are regular) with the nose pointing downhill is riding switch.|$|E

50|$|Panoramic Way {{is a very}} {{steep and}} narrow public road with {{numerous}} sharp turns and curves serving approximately 500 residents. Traffic can become difficult during rush hours, waste collection times or when construction and service vehicles are present. Emergency vehicles do regular patrols of the area to test their ability to access all residents in case of emergency. The speed limit is limited to 15 mph. Where the street is only wide enough for one car, the car <b>facing</b> <b>downhill</b> must yield to the car facing uphill, as required by California Motor Vehicle Code.|$|E
5000|$|Hebden Bridge is {{a popular}} place to live. However, space is limited due to the steep valleys and lack of flat land. In the past, this led to [...] "upstairs-downstairs" [...] houses known as over and under dwellings. These were houses built in {{terraces}} with 4-5 storeys. The upper storeys face uphill while the lower ones <b>face</b> <b>downhill</b> with their back wall against the hillside. The bottom 2 storeys would be one house while the upper 2-3 storeys would be another. This also led to unusual legal arrangements such as the [...] "flying freehold", where the shared floor/ceiling is wholly owned by the underdwelling.|$|R

50|$|In layman’s terms, {{the modern}} hill-holder {{function}} works by using two sensors, {{in concert with}} the brake system on the vehicle. The first sensor measures the forward-facing incline (nose higher than tail) of the vehicle, while the second is a disengaging mechanism. The 1930s-1950s NoRoL used a ball bearing as a check valve in the hydraulic brake line; when the car was on an uphill incline, the ball rolled back and blocked the brake line - when the car was level or <b>facing</b> <b>downhill,</b> the ball rolled away, leaving the line free. The clutch linkage slightly dislodged the ball when the clutch was released, enabling the car to move away from a stop.|$|E
50|$|The Liljestrands {{presented}} Ossipoff with demanding requirements, {{while the}} topography and highly variable daily weather conditions - sun, wind, and rain - imposed further constraints. The house is on two terraces, with the carport, entrance, and {{main part of}} the long, narrow house on the uphill terrace, and a lower story opening onto the downhill terrace. On a third, lower tier is a swimming pool. The upper side of the house is well sheltered from frequent mountain showers, while low-lying wooden louvers draw cooling breezes toward the larger openings on the side <b>facing</b> <b>downhill.</b> A long, open-sided recreation room extends beneath the bedrooms and faces onto a wide lawn. The large master bedroom at one end is angled to preserve an old stand of eucalyptus trees, and a sharp, wraparound deck juts out from the living room end of the house, overlooking the pool, the treetops, and a wide expanse {{of the city and the}} leeward side of the island stretching into the distance. Every room has a view.|$|E
40|$|Court proper. Begins with Alouitious I think, then Max. I {{am sitting}} <b>facing</b> <b>{{downhill}}</b> North, with the accused woman Edna downhill under another house (invisible) {{and the other}} accused Peter Paul Vyînkê uphill invisible from me. The case: Aloutious' daughter Edna and his Son Peter Paul have had sexual intercourse. Apparently she confessed the sin, originally to Mwolâ, claiming that force was used (so semi-rape, but people don't believe her). Alouitious had tried to hush it up, but then it got out. Peter Paul's original defence was Rosanna his wife had slept with Mwolâ (treated laughably) and that this had led him to do it. But at court he rapidly confessed and said "sorry". They are half brother-sister - same F (Alouitious, Kmatpi) but different mothers, since he had two wives who were closely related membersof the same clan, Nkêê Daa. Thus {{there are a number}} of delicts: (a) adultery by Peter Paul, damages owed to his wife by Edna, (b) effective adultery by Edna against Mwolâ, since she is unmarried but effective wife of Mwolâ who pays suppoirt for her children by a prior case I filmed, requiring payment by Peter Paul, (c) clan incest and incest simpliciter. A number of people pointed out that a while ago they would have been eaten by now. The case dragged because compensation could not be agreed. First Rosanna demanded her husband to be sent to trial, but then she agreed to compensation. Then Peter Paul produced a Chomo and a precious ndap as his payment to Mwolâ. Then Edna ought to have produced the same as compensation to Rosanna. That would have settled the "customary" compensation, but it was noted that in court each would have had to pay K 1000 to the injured parties (Rosanna and Mwolâ). Despite an hour and half cajoling, Edna refuses to pay the chomo and ndap. Alouitious refuses to help, saying "we are all sons of dogs" (he had just bought two other sons out of Giligili jail using bagi, so claimed to have no valuables). At the end, the magistrate Kostka, with Max the mediator doing most of the talking, says OK, no deal, returns the chomo and ndap to Peter Paul, and puts the case before the civil authorities (he will radio Tagula to report in the morning). Speakers included: Protoagonists: Peter Paul, Edna, Alouitious, Mwolâ, Rosanna. Kostka: magistrate. Max and Thomas: mediators. Regius Teluwe, brother of Mwolâ, Chris, Yidika, towards end Joseph...|$|E
50|$|Very {{little was}} {{known of the}} {{breeding}} habits of this bird so a study was undertaken in 1991. Nine birds were {{in the vicinity of}} the study site, four pairs and a single bird. There was much vocalisation mostly in the form of duetting and choruses, with all the birds joining in synchrony. Calling took place in the mornings and to a lesser extent in the afternoons indicating the presence of birds close to the nest. The study nest was a cone-shaped mound in a fallow cultivated field close to scrub and forest remnants. It was built over two rotting logs and was constructed of sand and clay. Eggs are laid by the female in the mound and covered with soil (this was not observed). During the month-long observation period, a bird (or sometimes two) would approach the mound on most days and rake the surface with its claws. The bird <b>faced</b> <b>downhill</b> and scratched the surface with alternate feet, working in one instance for 116 minutes. Another bird could sometimes be heard in the nearby undergrowth. The scratching bird was alert to danger, freezing at unexpected noises, and peering round and responding to the warning cries of the blue-backed parrot (Tanygnathus sumatranus) and the spangled drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus). Monitor lizards (Varanus) sometimes tried to raid the nest, usually after an adult bird had been raking, but had little success while the researchers were watching.|$|R
5000|$|UMass Memorial Healthcare <b>faced</b> a <b>downhill</b> {{financial}} slide over a 5 year period, {{starting with}} an operating surplus of $83 million in 2009 to a $55 million operating {{loss in the}} 2013 fiscal year. [...] The organization was criticized for being inefficient. In addition, changes in healthcare reimbursement impacted the Medical Center more severely than other hospitals as its proportion of Medicaid patient business, the state-federal health plan for the poor that tends to be less lucrative for hospitals, is 25% higher than the statewide average (24% in 2012 compared to state average of 19%). [...] The financial decline culminated in the downgrading of the system's rating by Moody's Investors service in 2013.|$|R
50|$|In {{the high}} villages {{people live in}} homes built {{according}} to medieval designs that withstand cold winters. The kitchen is separated from the living area (called the stube, {{the area of the}} home heated by a stove), and second-floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat. The typical Swiss chalet originated in the Bernese Oberland. Chalets often <b>face</b> south or <b>downhill,</b> and are built of solid wood, with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily. Stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside, and balconies are sometimes enclosed.|$|R
40|$|Snow slab {{avalanches}} {{are believed}} to begin by the gravity- driven shear failure of weak layers in stratified snow. The critical crack length for shear crack propagation along such layers should increase without bound as the slope decreases. However, recent experiments show that the critical length of artificially introduced cracks remains constant or, if anything, slightly decreases with decreasing slope. This surprising observation can {{be understood in terms}} of volumetric collapse of the weak layer during failure, resulting in the formation and propagation of mixed- mode anticracks, which are driven simultaneously by slope-parallel and slope-normal components of gravity. Such fractures may propagate even if crack- <b>face</b> friction impedes <b>downhill</b> sliding of the snowpack, indicating a scenario in which two separate conditions have to be met for slab avalanche release...|$|R
30|$|Based on a {{conveying}} {{capacity of}} 3000 t/h and a chain speed of 1.77  m/s, and the installed power of 2000  kW, the theoretical power consumption utilization was analyzed under {{the conditions of}} face lengths of 300, 250 and 207  m respectively (the actual length at the No. 8105 face in Tashan coal mine). The calculation results showed that: when the face length is 300  m, and face dip is 0 °, the power utilization reaches up to 94.3  %, power margin is small, which is only used in a flat or <b>downhill</b> <b>face.</b> When the face length is 250  m (or the actual face length at No. 8105 face is 207  m), and the face dip is 0 °, the power utilization is 78.6  % and 65  %, respectively, showing a large margin. Therefore, a total power of 2  ×  1000  kW can meet the requirement of transport capacity of 3000 t/h.|$|R
5000|$|John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Throughout, gags are cartoonishly {{broad and}} afforded {{so little time}} for setup and {{delivery}} {{we seem to be}} watching less a story than a catalog of tossed-out material."

[...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film one out of four stars, saying, [...] "The temptation arises to say something nice about [...] "Grown Ups 2" [...] just because it doesn't cause injury. But no, it's a bad movie, just old-school bad, the kind that's merely lousy and not an occasion for migraines or night sweats." [...] Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film zero out of four stars, saying, [...] "Adam Sandler scrapes the bottom of the barrel—and then he pukes into it—with Grown Ups 2, a lazily cribbed-together swamp of pointless and unfunny sketches that makes 2010’s Grown Ups look like Citizen Kane." [...] Matt Patches of Time Out New York gave the film one out of five stars, saying, [...] "In the first five minutes, a deer walks into the star's bedroom and urinates on his <b>face.</b> It's all <b>downhill</b> from there." ...|$|R
