60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Stephen! [She {{sits down}} again; and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> tears].|$|R

6000|$|... 'I didn't I didn't I didn't!' said Mrs. Hauksbee angrily, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filling</b> <b>with</b> tears; 'there was no malice at all. Oh, it's too vexatious!' ...|$|R
60|$|Euphemia {{looked at}} me an instant, and then <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears. She {{dropped her}} arms with a weary little gesture.|$|E
60|$|She rose, {{and looked}} at him proudly. The next moment <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{a blessed}} thought to me," [...] said Dinah, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filling</b> <b>with</b> tears. [...] "It's a fearful thing hurrying her soul away so fast." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{then asked}} whether {{he was going to}} Nukuheva; he nodded yes; and with a plaintive wail, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filling</b> <b>with</b> tears, she rose and left him.|$|R

60|$|And, {{in spite}} of all her pride, and of Orestes's presence, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{scalding}} tears.|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} drove all {{the playful}} humour out of poor Marie, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> sudden tears.|$|E
60|$|Ethel felt deeply the obduracy {{and pride}} of these answers; <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears, and her hopes failed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--killed him!" [...] she answered, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filling</b> <b>with</b> {{tears as}} she gave {{particulars}} of Prince's death. [...] "And I don't {{know what to}} do for father on account of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are both}} lonely; both far from home!" [...] said Hilda, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filling</b> <b>with</b> tears. [...] "I am a poor, weak girl, {{and have no}} such wisdom as you fancy in me." ...|$|R
50|$|The final shot is of {{the five}} characters, now seen as dolls with painted faces and glass eyes. The ballet dancer moves to hold {{the hand of the}} major and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> tears.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{tears and}} her voice broke. Susie, with a little laugh that was half hysterical, kissed her.|$|E

60|$|Richard {{entered the}} front chamber at once. As he did so, his mother passed out, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Always so generous, so kind!" [...] he murmured, {{with her}} hand against his feverish cheek; then, looking up, he went on in a tone so humbly contrite it made <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> slow, hot tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I do mind, I can't bear {{for you to}} cry. You know I can't, so don't begin again," [...] added he, as his affectionate tones {{made her}} lip quiver, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> tears.|$|R
60|$|Rose felt <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filling</b> <b>with</b> tears. The {{figure of}} her lonely old father came before her. She saw him sitting beside the kitchen table, {{his head on}} his palm, and all the new house empty and dark.|$|R
60|$|My Dear {{met him at}} the gate, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{questioning}} and sorrow, for she saw that Meriem was not with him.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced at}} it {{carelessly}} enough, but at once her whole expression changed. The smile left her lips, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> trouble.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears. She dashed them away, {{made for}} the door, and laughed with a desperate levity, as she {{unlocked}} it again.|$|E
60|$|Next moment I {{was sorry}} for the words, for I saw <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> tears and <b>her</b> breast shake with {{something}} like a sob. However, it was Pereira and not Marie who answered, for at the moment I believe she could not speak.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} her father, and <b>her</b> quiet <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed it is {{wonderful}} happiness,' said Anne, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filling</b> <b>with</b> tears, 'but I {{do not know}} whether you feel as I do, that it is too great, too overwhelming, to talk of now it is fresh.

60|$|The girl laughed delightedly, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{pleasant}} tears, as he {{put both}} his arms round her waist and so held her.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> sudden moisture. She stilled {{him with}} a {{pressure}} of her hand, and, to regain herself, {{she went back to}} her recital: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I mean--all {{you think}} I mean," [...] she answered, {{and then her}} fortitude failed her, and she turned away, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> hot tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, Bee," [...] said Aunt Mary, smiling; [...] "tell him {{he ought}} to be ashamed of having monopolized you all so long, and spoilt all the comfort of your household.

60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>filled</b> slowly <b>with</b> tears. Aynesworth looked away. He was miserably uncomfortable.|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped at}} that moment, for <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{suddenly}} <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> tears.|$|R
