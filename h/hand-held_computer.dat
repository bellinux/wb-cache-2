40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} prototypical implementation of a mobile user-interface to assist paramedics in disaster operations based on the mSTaRT triage algorithm. Due to {{the increasing use of}} algorithms in the disaster management the introduction of mobile <b>hand-held</b> <b>computers</b> stands to reason. The triage algorithm has been implemented on <b>hand-held</b> <b>computers</b> and tested in a disaster control exercise to evaluate its functionality in real situations. Since mobile, computer-based triage systems for paramedics must not delay the care taking procedures, the major indicator to measure the performance was the time needed by the proposed system as opposed to current paper based methods.

5000|$|Later, {{at the end}} of the 1980s, {{much more}} {{powerful}} calculators appeared on the Soviet market. For example, the calculator or <b>hand-held</b> <b>computer</b> MK-90, which had a graphic LCD display and an internal BASIC interpreter, was essentially a pocket-sized variety of the PDP-11. Due to their high price and the growing popularity of much more powerful personal computers, such as ZX Spectrum, these powerful calculators never gained popularity among the general Soviet population. Therefore, the B3-34-derived calculators are remembered by many as their [...] "first computer".|$|E

An alternative method of collecting data centrally is to transmit meter readings via a modem.|$|E

The project is based on the concept of context awareness, whereby mobile computers make use of knowledge of their environment to alter their behaviour, typically by selective presentation of information. Our system can be used for data collection, the authoring and delivery of field exercises and student field experiments. We have carried out very successful field trials of the system in a variety of locations and on several different projects.

40|$|Introduction The {{portability}} {{requirement of}} <b>hand-held</b> <b>computers</b> and other portable devices places severe restrictions on size and power consumption. Even though battery technology is improving continuously and processors and displays are rapidly improving {{in terms of}} power consumption, battery life and battery weight are issues {{that will have a}} marked influence on how <b>hand-held</b> <b>computers</b> can be used. These devices often require realtime processing capabilities, and thus demand high throughput. Power consumption is becoming the limiting factor in the amount of functionality that can be placed in these devices. More extensive and continuous use of network services will only aggravate this problem since communication consumes relatively much energy. Research is needed to provide policies for careful management of the energy consumption while still providing the appearance of continuous connections to system services and applications. In this chapter we will explore sources of energy...|$|R

50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{projects}} done by WILD youth in the year of 2004. This project used three different ways to gain information about the Chinatown/International District community. ComNETsm (Computerized neighborhood environmental tracking) was used. ComNETsm is <b>hand-held</b> <b>computer</b> allowing the youth to track street and sidewalk conditions by taking pictures matching with the problems (i.e. graffiti, trip hazards and feces). According to Joyce Pisnanont, Youth Program Coordinator for WILD from 2003 to 2007, the program found that ComNETsm only tracks the deficits of the neighborhood so the program decided to supplement the project with Photovoice and multilingual interviews. Through Photovoice, they youth and elders of the CID community are able to express their perspective on what they like or dislike about the community. This project was presented to Seattle City Council, Jim Compton by the youths in early 2005 regarding the safety concerns in Seattle CID. In May 2005, WILD youth brought this project to the Community-Based Solutions for Environmental & Economic Justice 4th Annual Conference at the University of Washington. The main focus of this project is to help the limited-English speaking residents to speak up about health and safety related issues in their community.|$|E
40|$|Handwriting is {{the primary}} input method for <b>hand-held</b> <b>computers</b> because they are too small {{physically}} to have keyboards. To investigate the requirements for upcoming computer algebra systems on handheld computers, we designed and implemented an application for recognizing on-line handwritten mathematical expressions on the pocket PC. The objective was to translate handwriting mathematical expressions into corresponding presentation MathML, which can be understood by computer algebra systems. This application consists of three components: 1) a handwriting recognizer for recognizing individual mathematical symbols, 2) a structural analyzer for interpreting and maintaining the relationship between symbols of the expression, and 3) a generator for generating MathML code. Currently {{it is able to}} recognize simple expressions including polynomial equations, fractions, trigonometric functions, allowing nested structures.
