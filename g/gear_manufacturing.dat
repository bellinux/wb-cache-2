5000|$|Wells {{was born}} near Coventry, Warwickshire, England, where his grandfather, Frederick Wells, owned the {{precision}} <b>gear</b> <b>manufacturing</b> company, Coventry Gear, that provided critical materials to the British war effort during World War Two. Wells was educated at Bablake School, Coventry, {{one of the}} UK’s oldest schools founded in 1344 by Queen Isabella, St. Cuthbert’s Society at Durham University, (BA with honors and MA degree by research), King’s College, University of London (PhD), and the London School of Economics, University of London (MSc). Wells was called to the Bar as a Barrister by Lincoln’s Inn in November, 1980. He received his basic naval training at Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, advanced training at the School of Maritime Operations, and intelligence training with the UK’s intelligence directorates. His mentors were Sir Harry Hinsley, the Bletchley Park code breaker, and Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University, Professor Sir Lawrence Martin, at King’s College, London, and Professor Bryan Ranft at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Wells {{was introduced to the}} special intelligence world by his mentors, and notably Hinsley through the Ultra material and Wells became unique in that he had access to ENIGMA material several years before the British government announced even the existence of ENIGMA in 1974. To this day Wells remains one of just a handful of living people knowledgeable of still hugely sensitive data that the British have not released from World War Two, particularly data relating to decisions made personally by Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt based on ENIGMA and US MAGICS data.1,2,4,7 ...|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical {{self-steering}} gear {{is made by}} {{a number}} of manufacturers, but most systems produced today share the same principle (servo pendulum rudder, see below).As well as their requirement for electric power, many long-distance cruisers observe that electronic self-steering machinery is complex and unlikely to be repairable without spare parts in remote areas. By contrast the vane gear offers at least the possibility of an improvised repair at sea, and can usually be rebuilt on land using non-specific parts (sometimes plumbing parts) by a local welder or machinist.To minimize the speed loss by the self steering gear it is essential to have the vessel's sails balanced with little load on the rudder before any attempt is made to engage the self steering. With the sails are trimmed correctly, the force-balance of the servo oar and the main or auxiliary rudder is minimized that way, that the lowest angles of attack of rudder and servo oar towards the water flow are achieved. Some experimentation and judgement is usually needed, however, to determine the proper settings for a given vessel and steering mechanism.A popular source on contemporary windvane technology is The Windvane Self-Steering Handbook. One particularly valuable contribution of Morris's book is his coverage of the variety of alloys used in vane <b>gear</b> <b>manufacturing.</b> Morris admits to his practice of setting a kitchen timer for a half-hour at a time and sleeping while the windvane steering device controls the helm, even in head winds of 25 to 35 knots. In a recent interview, he said he once narrowly missed being hit by a huge freighter while sleeping on his sail up the Red Sea. Morris points out, [...] "An autopilot wouldn't have made any difference in this case. If I had been using an electronic autopilot, that freighter still would have been there. I made a choice to sail two-thirds of my circumnavigation single-handed, and I accepted the risks that came with that decision. I guess fate was on my side." ...|$|E
