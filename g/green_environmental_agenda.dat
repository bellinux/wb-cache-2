40|$|This note {{explores the}} interrelationship between ecologically {{sustainable}} development (the <b>green</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda)</b> and pro-poor urban development {{and environmental health}} (the brown environmental agenda) in relation to local government in South Africa. The meaning and relevance of the brown agenda versus the green agenda in environmental governance are discussed in general. This discussion subsequently feeds into the argument that South Africa's constitutional environmental right also foresees the advancement of the brown environmental agenda, which has implications for the interpretation and enforcement of local government's service delivery mandate. This link between municipal service delivery and the environmental right further informs understanding of what is required of government to fulfill this right. This paper is thus devoted to an introductory conceptual framing of South Africa's environmental right {{that goes beyond the}} green agenda. This impacts on how the constitutional duties of municipalities are interpreted and executed...|$|E

Second, MFIs are able to support policy reforms within developing countries to ensure environmental standards and issues are properly addressed.

40|$|Under {{the modern}} {{manufacturing}} environment-oriented, both productivity and <b>green</b> <b>environmental</b> consideration {{are made in}} diverse phases of production operations. In this paper, in order to dynamically analyse and control changes of Work-In-Process (WIP) inventory level, a centralized fuzzy control method is proposed. Additionally, a new environmental management accounting method, Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA), is adopted to find and calculate environmental waste hiding in the production processes. Moreover, a simulation model integrated with these methods above is constructed. Based on the simulation data, sensitivity analysis between control factors of WIP inventory level and negative product costs ratio is made. To achieve a reasonable productivity as well as <b>green</b> <b>environmental</b> performance for this case, a corresponding optimized solving measure is put forward by means of OptQuest in the Arena simulation system. Through studying, the proposed control approach of WIP can reduce the <b>green</b> <b>environmental</b> cost, and improve production capacity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how, by undertaking {{an international}} agenda to address global environmental problems, subnational governments (SGs) are promoting a rescaling of environmental governance. It uses the Brazilian state of São Paulo {{as a primary}} example. It argues that by establishing an international <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda,</b> the state breaks the fixed scales in which it would traditionally operate. As a result, the state engages in a particular form of rescaled environmental governance—one that extends the locus, agency, and scope of action from the regional to the transnational level. To undertake this analysis, the paper brings the multilevel governance and subnational diplomacy literatures into dialogue. The paper suggests that when engaging in an international <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda,</b> SGs promote six forms of rescaling; this is a wider and more nuanced picture than so far envisioned by the literature. The paper draws upon documental analysis, and semi-structured interviews...|$|R

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of nineties, when significant changes took place, Russia began to elaborate new environmental policy and designed new patterns for responding the environmental problems. The paper {{tried to make a}} contribution to our understanding of environmental policy and policy processes within the Russia in general terms and to the nature of <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda</b> setting in Pskov region in more specific terms. This thesis is therefore explores <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda</b> setting process in Russia taking into consideration contemporary trends in the analysis of policy- making, such as inclusion of non-state actors as well as role of ideas shaping actors attitudes and behaviour. The purpose of the thesis is to study the relationship between transnational forces and interactions, national policy and local political developments and the role of various agents and institutions in agenda setting of the regional environmental policy-making. The frame of reference is constituted by a theoretical combination of the agenda-setting model with constructivist approach in order to broaden our investigation of the implications of environmental policy-making, impact of political culture upon construction of environmental issues, and transformations in the public policy. By focusing on Pskov region case, the paper identifies and discusses a number of reasons why environmental issues are found on the margins of the political agenda. A central argument is that in the absence of effective governance in the Pskov region, international agents together with regional interest groups formulate <b>environmental</b> <b>agenda.</b> The paper concludes that, even though, the mentality of environmentalism is set through the foreign assistance, the processes of learning from international cooperation may contribute to attainment of regional environmental objectives...|$|R
