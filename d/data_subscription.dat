25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in blister packaging. It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an electronic module. The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC smart phone or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable data network is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, handheld device, tablet or smart watch via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver. It avoids the huge effort required to equip every single blister with a SIM module and expensive monthly <b>data</b> <b>subscription.</b>|$|E

One could therefore question the viability of installing an integrated TWCS system. However, direct communication from a device on board with a wayside NOP is mostly not the preferred way of communication. One {{of the reasons is}} the poor coverage of mobile networks inside a train, which also leads to frequent voice call drops on trains. Another reason is that the TWCS relieves all onboard devices from the burden of maintaining a connection at vehicular speeds.|$|R

40|$|The Finnish Mobile Operators face {{two main}} challenges: (i) mobile <b>data</b> <b>subscriptions</b> {{penetration}} and traffic are experiencing rapid growth; and (ii) government intervenes {{in the market}} to attain contradictory goals related to extensive high-speed mobile networks and energy consumption reduction. The mobile operators have to increase the capacity in their networks, taking energy efficiency into account. The reduction of energy consumption in mobile networks results to the reducing carbon emissions, and possibly to cost savings. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the wide-to-local area offloading in urban regions in Finland and examine the impact of such a network on the wide area access network in terms of energy and capacity. The results show that the capacity relief ranges from 9. 7 to 38. 7 %, depending on the penetration of local area service, but the energy savings in macro cellular network are negligible...|$|R

40|$|The CERN 26 GeV Proton Synchrotron (PS) {{accelerator}} complex {{produces a}} sequence of different beams in cycles of a duration of 1. 2 sec or multiple of it. A Main Control Room operator, supervising the functioning of (part of) an accelerator for a particular beam, needs to coherently display on his workstation the beam-dependent data in synchronism with this particular cycle (within a certain time delay).

30|$|Students {{in public}} {{universities}} would {{rely more on}} school-provided computers and Internet services {{in the conduct of}} their Internet-related activities. This may be the case because Internet services at the university are free of charge. The Philippines {{has one of the most}} expensive Internet with a monthly average cost of $ 18.19 (P 848.65) per Mbps (Shahani, 2015). Likewise, only 26.9 % of households in the Philippines have Internet (The State of Broadband, 2015). In terms of computer ownership, out of the projected 21.5 million Filipino households only 3.8 million households have computers at home for the year 2013 (Labucay, 2014). Thus, students prefer to use the school’s resources (might be highly attributed to purchasing power). As more faculty members are using ICT tools in their teachings, students expect that the university would provide them access to computers with superior Internet connection. In contrast, students from private HEIs may have access to Internet through home and/or mobile <b>data</b> <b>subscription,</b> and are, therefore, not solely dependent on the school’s network for Internet access.|$|E
40|$|Smartphones {{have become}} the major {{communication}} and portable computing devices that access the Internet through Wi-Fi or mobile networks. Unfortunately, users without a mobile <b>data</b> <b>subscription</b> can only access the Internet at limited locations, such as hotspots. In this paper, we propose a collaborative bandwidth sharing protocol (CBSP) built on top of MultiPath TCP (MPTCP). CBSP enables users to buy bandwidth on demand from neighbors (called Helpers) and uses virtual interfaces to bind the subflows of MPTCP to avoid modifying the implementation of MPTCP. However, although MPTCP provides the required multi-homing functionality for bandwidth sharing, the current packet scheduling in collaborative MPTCP (e. g., Co-MPTCP) leads to the so-called biased-feeding problem. In this problem, the fastest link might always be selected to send packets whenever it has available cwnd, which results in other links not being fully utilized. In this work, {{we set out to}} design an algorithm, called Scheduled Window-based Transmission Control (SWTC), to improve the performance of packet scheduling in MPTCP, and we perform extensive simulations to evaluate its performance...|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is very prevalent in Kenya-mobile phone penetration is at 88 % and mobile <b>data</b> <b>subscriptions</b> form 99 % of all internet subscriptions. While {{there is great}} potential for such ubiquitous technology to revolutionise access and quality of healthcare in low-resource settings, {{there have been few}} successes at scale. Implementations of electronic health (e-Health) and mobile health (m-Health) technologies in countries like Kenya are yet to tackle human resource constraints or the political, ethical and financial considerations of such technologies. We outline recent innovations that could improve access and quality while considering the costs of healthcare. One is an attempt to create a scalable clinical decision support system by engaging a global network of specialist doctors and reversing some of the damaging effects of medical brain drain. The other efficiently extracts digital information from paper-based records using low-cost and locally produced tools such as rubber stamps to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines. By bringing down the costs of remote consultations and clinical audit, respectively, these projects offer the potential for clinics in resource-limited settings to deliver high-quality care. This paper makes a case for continued and increased investment in social enterprises that bridge academia, public and private sectors to deliver sustainable and scalable e-Health and m-Health solutions...|$|R
