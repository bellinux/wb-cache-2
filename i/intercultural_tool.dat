40|$|This {{qualitative}} study examines {{the role of}} humour in cross-cultural adaptation as an interdisciplinary study in the discipline of Intercultural Studies. A review of existing theories of humour presents the complexity of humour studies, which then links to relevant theoretical models of cross-cultural adaptation. This linking draws out the connections between Humour and Intercultural Studies. The occurrence and relevance of these connections {{is based on the}} analysis of primary research data from a study on the role of humour in the adaptation process of Spanish migrants living in Ireland. Data collection is by semi-structured interview of twenty participants and analysis is by grounded theory using Atlas. ti software. Analysis details their views on the cultural facets of humour and the positive and negative effects that humour may have on the process of adaptation to Irish culture. Results demonstrate that humour is a key factor in the cross-cultural adaptation process. Humour is a powerful <b>intercultural</b> <b>tool,</b> an essential element in the acquisition of intercultural competence and a fundamental part of an emerging intercultural identity. ...|$|E
30|$|One {{should mention}} here that a measure that, of course, {{is not of}} the <b>intercultural</b> <b>tool</b> box, the recent burka laws of France, Belgium, or Austria, which {{prohibit}} to cover one’s face in all public spaces, are exactly meant to facilitate communication and “dialogue” across ethnic group boundaries. In the French justification of the law before the European Court of Human Rights, the burka interrupts the “reciprocity” and the availability for communication that {{is said to be the}} life-blood of “civil society”. 4 Weirdly, the French government construed it to be the “right of others” that any person, including the pious Muslim woman, be always available for communication at any one time one pleases. As this “right” entails the obligation to always be available for communication, it naturally cannot be found in the European Convention of Human Rights. Of course, no interculturalist endorses forced “contact” of this sort. Because the point about “contact” is that it cannot be forced, at least not in a liberal society worth the name. But then you cannot say more about it than “nice” when it happens (and all goes well in its course), and just register a fact beyond your control, except perhaps trying to establish a “choice architecture” (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) that may facilitate talk and walk across group lines - say, placing a playground not within but at the intersection of two ethnic neighborhoods. The local as site of integration, though proverbially the site of integration, is entirely vacuous for the purposes of theory and better left to those who live and act it out at their discretion - too much state and policy there can only do harm, as in the notorious burka laws.|$|E

40|$|This {{survey is}} a text {{analysis}} of 4 teaching books during a ten years period in Social studies from a multicultural and intercultural perspective. Taking {{as a starting}} point that society and the school in today’s Sweden are multicultural and in need of more intercultural teaching I explore teaching books in social science to se how they relate to Sweden as a multicultural society and their way of relating to intercultural teachings and compare them. The questions asked are: How do the different books describe the multicultural society in Sweden? What kind of <b>intercultural</b> <b>tools</b> are found in the books? And are there any similarities or differences among these books? The theories used {{as a starting point}} are reformulated by the author after theories of Von Wright and Lahdenperä to fit in to the context of a text analysis of teaching books and the method used is a content analysis with its purpose of describing how the books are constructed. I have found that two older books from ten years ago are not describing Sweden as a multicultural society and are not including people with different origin as a natural part of the society. I have also found that there are not much <b>intercultural</b> <b>tools</b> used for increasing the reader’s intercultural understanding. In two older books from 1994 {{there is a tendency to}} stereotype people with different origins in and to not describe them as participant members of society. The newer books from 2004 and 2005 are more describing Sweden as a multicultural society both directly and indirectly and they are including people with different origins to be a participant part of the society. It is also reflected that there is always a risk for stereotyping different groups in society by discussing problems but that there are different ways considered to avoid that. The books from today are both using more <b>intercultural</b> <b>tools</b> to increase the reader’s intercultural understanding in different ways...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: India {{contains}} many {{different cultures and}} it has inducted components through intercultural exchanges. This process enriches individual cultures and propagates the message of peaceful co-existence, mutual respect and tolerance for other cultures. Indian Music has elements of different cultures and it is widely accepted in the world periphery. This indicates that enlightenment through inter-cultural exchanges has the potentiality to elevate a culture towards universality. Education and culture are intimately related. Three important aspects of living education are: the man in his commonness and in his uniqueness, the nation and universal humanity. General study of world culture and <b>intercultural</b> activities are <b>tools</b> to foster such understanding...|$|R
40|$|Digital <b>intercultural</b> {{training}} <b>tools</b> play {{an important}} role in helping people to mediate cultural misunderstandings. In recent years, these tools were made to teach about specific cultures, but there has been little attention for the design of a tool to teach about differences across a wide range of cultures. In this work, we take the first steps to create a digital self-contained culture-general training tool. In the first part of the article, we focus on different aspects and methods of intercultural training. This information is then used in the second part to evaluate the effect of these different methods on the perception of behaviour in misunderstandings. We found that experiential and story-based approaches may lead to different perceptions of participants. In the third part, we expanded on these critical incidents, and incorporated virtual characters, to evaluate if experiential incidents in an embedded story can lead to an attribution of perceived differences in behaviour to specific differences in culture and to users becoming less judgemental of inappropriate behaviours by people from different cultures. The results suggest that the tool had some effect, but that a debriefing relating the general differences to specific instances would be beneficial. </p...|$|R
40|$|Values {{are crucial}} for {{explaining}} the motivational basis of human attitudes and behavior, {{as well as}} social and personal organization. This project investigates methods to analyze values possessed by diverse individuals residing in several societies based in Japan and other foreign countries. The aim is to identify useful intercultural data analysis methods to examine the heterogeneity of societies within and across countries based on advanced AI technologies such as machine learning and ontology technologies. Our intercultural data analysis project is based on the publicly available data such as World Value Survey and European Social Survey. The project eventually aims at developing an <b>intercultural</b> data analysis <b>tool</b> for public and private service providers to identify potential target consumer segments of services/products and to indicate preferences of the potential customers in a foreign market...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} reassesses {{the role}} conceptual art played amidst {{the transition from}} modern to contemporary art {{during the second half}} of the twentieth century by focusing on the movement’s international scope and structure. My inquiry centers on Art & Language, an art collective comprising dozens of conceptual artists, and I emphasize a rarely discussed but absolutely essential aspect of their work together: the collaborations they undertook between the United States, England, Australia, and Yugoslavia that employed travel, exhibitions, publications, correspondence, and communication technologies to forge an unwieldy but productive alliance between likeminded thinkers and practitioners on three continents. I account for the art and writing that emerged from this interconnected web in terms of the innovative artistic and political strategies that Art & Language developed by prioritizing written and spoken language, and I situate their work relative to the realignment of international relations during the period of their association. In so doing, I show how Art & Language conceptualized opposition to the emerging global art world, which was — as it remains — driven primarily by monolithic institutions and official discourses. I argue that Art & Language’s preference for interpersonal contact and <b>intercultural</b> exchange provides <b>tools</b> for articulating a politics of artistic activity adequate to art’s loss of autonomy and its gain of worldliness during the passage from modern to contemporary art...|$|R
40|$|Many {{industries}} are now {{dealing with the}} issue of globalization and emphasized the need of the influence of a global marketplace. Globalization extends computing, information, and communication technologies across an increasing number of cultural boundaries, generating a corresponding need for cross-cultural partnerships. Due to globalization, global virtual teams with members from different cultures are an emerging trend. The use of collaborative projects is increasing and affects users’ approach to work in a collaboration application, so called groupware. Groupware is a collaboration application designed to support the work of groups. It can allow globalized industries and organizations greater coordination of activities, reducing and eliminating time and geography barriers, and speeding the decision making process. Groupware users are influenced by demographic, social, cultural, psychological and contextual factors, which complicate the understanding of groupware use. The different backgrounds of users may cause them to have different expectations and attitudes towards their acceptance of using groupware. In order for a specific technology application to be useful, applying technology appropriately to the needs of its users is very important. Groupware that only determines structures of communication, such as floor control, turn-taking, communication procedures, and so on may disadvantage and discourage people from different cultural communication styles. These factors should be considered by designers when designing such groupware application in order to be successful. A groupware targeted for multicultural users should have a flexible intercultural support which means can adaptively manage the cultural differences of its users. A great attention should be given for the cultural element in creating products and interfaces that are culture “fit” to its users. Understanding these social and cultural differences is very important in groupware to support cross-cultural collaboration. This dissertation offers solutions to the design issues in groupware for multicultural user to avoid a failed system. Most software engineers when designing applications focuses only on the technical issues and fail to include the social factors that are very important in developing technologies that serves as social applications. Therefore in this dissertation, two extension layers are introduced extending the well know 7 -layers OSI model. These two extension layers of ISO/OSI layer model mainly focus on the end-user of the applications consisting of social layer as the 8 th layer and cultural layer as the 9 th layer, used to link applications to human needs. The social layer representing the support of groups and the cultural layer representing the communication as it is influenced through different cultural backgrounds of users using the tools. These extension layers help software engineers to develop applications within a socio-cultural deployment context. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is extended in this dissertation to understand the mechanism by which cultural differences could explain users’ behaviors toward the acceptance of groupware applications as a remote collaboration tool for global virtual team. A new approach, called culture-centered design and cultural engineering as the anchor for groupware development in multicultural context is introduced to define the requirements, features and functions that should be included in groupware as an <b>intercultural</b> collaboration <b>tool.</b> An expert system to be embedded in groupware, called Intercultural Collaboration Environment Expert System (ICEES), is also developed {{in the context of a}} cross-cultural collaboration and is expected to support PASSENGER 2, a new innovative groupware that is currently under development at the Institute of Computer Engineering, University Duisburg-Essen. ICEES provide advice to the group in selecting the most suitable tools for enhancing the group discussion. This dissertation is expected to serve as a benchmark for future research on groupware design for multicultural users across different countries...|$|R
