25|$|Occasional epithets are not capitalized: {{only their}} fixed {{equivalents}} are. Commons nouns expressing rank or relation are written separately (István király ‘King Stephen’, Németh mérnök ‘Mr. Németh, engineer’).

25|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{not always}} known whether a {{specific}} form is actually the official name of an institution, or what is its official name (e.g. whether the city of its location is part of the name). In addition, {{it is not}} always clear if a group is actually an institution in the sense of having been registered at the court, with a statute, a stamp, letter header etc. on its own. A third problem is {{the question of whether the}} spelling of an organization can be corrected if it is not written according to the above rule. In addition, adjectival forms derived from institution names are also often mistaken because people feel the need to distinguish them from genuine common names (especially if the name contains a <b>fancy</b> <b>name</b> that becomes identical with a common name if written in lowercase). Furthermore, it is unclear why cinemas are treated differently (see above) from theatres, cf. Művész mozi, but Magyar Színház.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a pioneer}} in radio broadcasting, KDKA {{struggled}} in particular with studio acoustics, especially for large groups of performers. An early attempt to broadcast a concert by Westinghouse employees from a local auditorium found that the sensitive microphones picked up echoes from the walls, causing severe distortion. Moving the performers outdoors eliminated the echoing, so a tent was erected on the building roof, {{and for a time}} concerts were performed from this location. Eventually the tent was blown down in a storm, so it was moved indoors, where it was found the tent material helped deaden the echoes. This led to modern studio design, including walls covered with noise-absorbing material, initially [...] "monks cloth" [...] (which {{turned out to be a}} <b>fancy</b> <b>name</b> for burlap).|$|E

50|$|Although {{different}} colors can be perceived in different ways, {{the name of}} those colors matters as well. Many products and companies focus on producing {{a wide range of}} product colors to attract the largest population of consumers. For example, cosmetics brands produce a rainbow for eye shadow and nail polish colors for every type of person. Even companies such as Apple Inc. and Dell make iPods and laptops with color personalization to attract buyers. But, color name, not only the actual color, can actually attract or repel buyers as well. When asked to rate either color swatches or products with generic color names, such as brown, or <b>fancy</b> color <b>names,</b> such as mocha, participants rated items with <b>fancy</b> <b>names</b> as significantly more likable than items with generic names. In fact the same paint color swatch with two different names produced different rating levels. The same effect was found when participants rated the pleasantness of towels with <b>fancy</b> and generic <b>names.</b> This shows a greater favorability for <b>fancy</b> <b>names</b> compared to generic names for exactly the same colors.|$|R

For he created nothing, he invented nothing, he economised nothing. I cannot claim that a single one of the great businesses we organised added any real value to human life at all. Several like Tono-Bungay were unmitigated frauds by any honest standard, the giving of nothing coated in advertisements for money. And the things the Hardingham gave out, I repeat, were nothing to the things that came in. I think of the long procession of people who sat down before us and propounded this and that. Now it was a device for selling bread under a <b>fancy</b> <b>name</b> and so escaping the laws as to weight--this was afterwards floated as the Decorticated Health-Bread Company and bumped against the law--now it was a new scheme for still more strident advertisement, now it was a story of unsuspected deposits of minerals, now a cheap and nasty substitute for this or that common necessity, now the treachery of a too well-informed employee, anxious to become our partner. It was all put to us tentatively, persuasively. Sometimes one had a large pink blusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by his pseudo-boyish frankness, now some dyspeptically yellow whisperer, now some earnest, specially dressed youth with an eye-glass and a buttonhole, now some homely-speaking, shrewd Manchester man or some Scotchman eager to be very clear and full.|$|E

The objective is to carry out, within the theoretical framework of sociolinguistics, a qualitative and quantitative research around the lexical choices (through loanwords/foreigns or not) made by entrepreneurs when naming their commercial enterprises. In order to do this, we performed a survey regarding the origin of the names of all companies in Marechal Cândido Rondon, Paraná. Subsequently, the use of German words when naming companies was verified and interviews were carried out with the entrepreneurs, to identify the relationship between the lexical choice and the speaker. Based on the investigation, it was found that, although the city has been settled mostly by German descendent, the use of the German language appears little in the denomination of <b>fancy</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R
