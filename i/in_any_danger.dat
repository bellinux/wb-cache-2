5|$|The three wake {{up again}} on the TARDIS, no longer <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger.</b> The Doctor realises both realities were false since the Dream Lord had no power over {{the real world and}} was a manifestation of his darker side. The three were {{influenced}} by psychic pollen that had fallen in the TARDIS time rotor and heated up, creating the Dream Lord and the false realities. Rory comes to realise that Amy killed herself in the Leadworth reality out of love for him, and the two confess their love for each other. The Doctor sees the Dream Lord smile at him through his reflection.|$|E
5|$|In response, a 5 September news {{briefing}} at the Pentagon by Press Secretary Geoff Morrell {{stated that}} {{at no time}} was the public <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> and that military personnel had custody of the weapons at all times. The USAF announced that {{within days of the}} incident, the USAF relieved the Minot munitions squadron commander of duty and eventually disciplined 25 airmen. USAF Major General Doug Raaberg was assigned by General Keys to lead an investigation into the incident. The USAF inventory of nuclear warheads was checked to ensure that all warheads were accounted for. In addition, the DoD announced that a Pentagon-appointed scientific advisory panel, called the Defense Science Board, would study the mishap {{as part of a larger}} review of procedures for handling nuclear weapons. On 28 September, the USAF announced that General Keys was retiring and would be replaced as ACC commander by General John Corley, effective 2 October.|$|E
5|$|Tatum is paroled and {{the media}} begins hyping the fight. Marge makes Moe promise her that the moment Homer is <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger,</b> he will throw in the towel. The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger,</b> as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 2012, the Expedition touched bottom at Isispynten, east of Nordaustlandet in the Arctic. Reports {{state that}} the ship was {{travelling}} at a low speed {{at the time and}} that nobody was ever <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger.</b> The ship freed itself under its own engine power and continued on its way. One reason given for this was the buildup of rubbish {{in the bottom of the}} channel which had severely restricted the depth of water in an area that the ship had regularly travelled through.|$|E

"The Illuminata colt", as he {{was still}} known, was then given a break of three months before {{returning}} in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in September, in which a horse named Sempronius was his only rival. [...] "The Illuminata colt" [...] led from the start, and when Sempronius moved up to challenge him, he quickened away to win easily. After his win at Doncaster, he was officially named Ladas and was then sent to Newmarket for the Middle Park Plate, the most important two-year-old race of the season. He started at odds of 1/5 (0.2/1) and was never <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger,</b> leading at half way and winning the race by two lengths from a filly named Jocasta, with Sempronius two lengths further back in third.|$|E
500|$|In the event, the {{government}} was soundly defeated on 12 October, losing {{more than half its}} seats in parliament. To add to his humiliation, Bruce was defeated in his own seat of Flinders by Labor challenger Jack Holloway. On paper, there was no indication that Bruce was <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> of losing his seat; he held Flinders with a reasonably safe majority of 10.7 percent in 1928. [...] However, on the second count Holloway picked up enough preferences from an independent Liberal candidate to give him the victory. Bruce was the first sitting prime minister to lose his own seat, a feat which would not be repeated until 2007. [...] He was measured in defeat however, stating, [...] "The people have said they do not want my services, and I am going into the banishment to which they have sent me." ...|$|E

500|$|The De Beers {{company was}} {{concerned}} about the defence of Kimberley some years before the outbreak of the war, particularly its vulnerability to attack from the neighbouring Orange Free State. In 1896, an arms depot was formed, a plan of defence sent to the authorities and a local defence force set up. [...] As it began to look more likely that war would break out, the nervous citizens of Kimberley appealed to the premier of the Cape Colony, William Philip Schreiner, for additional protection, but he did not believe the town to be under serious threat and declined to arm it further. His reply to an appeal for arms in September 1899 stated: [...] "There is no reason whatever for apprehending that Kimberley is or will be <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> of attack and your fears are therefore groundless." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 January 1918, the Light Cruiser Force sortied from Rosyth to {{participate}} in a training exercise with elements of the Grand Fleet. The 12th and 13th Submarine Flotillas were sandwiched by squadrons of battlecruisers and battleships as the ships departed in poor visibility. Around 19:14 the steering gear of one of the 13th SF's submarines failed and she fell out of the formation. One of the trailing submarines did not see her in time and accidentally rammed her, badly damaging both boats. Commander William Leir commanded the 13th SF and decided to turn his flotilla around to their aid after he was notified of the accident around 17:40. In doing so, his ships crossed the path of the oncoming 12th SF and Fearless accidentally rammed and sank the submarine [...] Captain Charles Little attempted to avoid her, but the cruiser was moving too fast to do so. She launched her boats in a failed attempt to rescue any survivors, but the few found were recovered by one of the other submarines. The bulkheads in Fearless bow had to be shored up to prevent further flooding, but she was not <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger</b> of sinking and returned to Rosyth at a very slow speed. She was repaired and survived the war, but was sold for scrap in November 1921.|$|E
500|$|A {{controversial}} {{incident occurred}} during a public show on 2 January 2004, when Irwin carried his one-month-old son, Bob, {{in his arm}} while hand-feeding a chicken carcass to Murray, a [...] saltwater crocodile. The infant {{was close to the}} crocodile, and comparisons were made in the press to Michael Jackson's dangling his son outside a German hotel window. In addition, some child welfare groups, animal rights groups, and some of Irwin's television viewers criticised his actions as irresponsible and tantamount to child abuse. Irwin apologised on the US NBC show Today. Both he and his wife publicly stated that Irwin was in complete control of the situation, as he had dealt with crocodiles since he was a small child, and based on his lifetime of experience neither he nor his son was <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger.</b> He also showed footage of the event shot from a different angle, demonstrating that they were much farther from the crocodile than they had appeared in the publicised clip. Terri Irwin said their child was in no more danger than one being taught to swim. No charges were filed; according to one journalist, Irwin told officials he would not repeat the action. The incident prompted the Queensland government to change its crocodile-handling laws, banning children and untrained adults from entering crocodile enclosures.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} Test, Bradman made the highest {{individual}} score in a Test match by scoring 334 out of Australia's 566. Assisted by rain that shortened the available playing time, England drew the match. Chapman scored 45 in his only innings. The fourth Test match was also badly affected by rain which brought about another draw. Chapman now faced further {{criticism of his}} captaincy. His field placings were again queried; Warner noted that Chapman's tactics were poor {{and that he was}} slow to react to the opposition. According to cricket writer Leo McKinstry, the selectors lost faith in Chapman on account of his inconsistent, risky batting and his increased tactical shortcomings. However, McKinstry also writes that the selectors and other influential members of the cricketing establishment were privately concerned by Chapman's heavy drinking which they felt was affecting his leadership. There were also rumours that he was drunk during some sessions of the fourth Test. Following an extended meeting of the selectors, Chapman was left out of the side and replaced as captain by Bob Wyatt. The press were united in attacking the decision, praising Chapman's batting and captaincy while denigrating Wyatt's lack of experience. Gibson observes: [...] "In 1930, despite the occasional criticisms, Chapman's position did not seem <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger.</b> He was still the popular, boyish, debonair hero. He had been having his most successful series with the bat, and as a close fieldsman England still did not contain his equal. He could not seriously be blamed because the English bowlers could not get Bradman out (though this was perhaps more apparent in retrospect than at the time). Wyatt, though nothing was known against him... was a figure markedly lacking in glamour." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to this threat, the Navy Department decided to send a division of battleships to Berehaven, Ireland, {{to act as a}} guard force against the possibility of a battlecruiser raid. [...] Rear Admiral Rodgers, then in command of Battleship Division Six of the Atlantic Fleet, was selected for this assignment. The division departed for Ireland on August 12, 1918. On October 14, 1918, Rodgers received word that German cruisers might have escaped into the Atlantic. At the time, two troop convoys were approaching European waters. Battleship Division Six put to sea without delay and escorted both convoys out of the danger zone. Despite the prompt action of Admiral Rodgers and the ships under his command, no German warships had been in the Atlantic, and the convoys were never <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>danger.</b> This false-alarm was the only raider-warning issued during Battleship Division Six's service in the warzone.|$|E
