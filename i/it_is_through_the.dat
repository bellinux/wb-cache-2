5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E

5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential. The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E

500|$|Hamlet {{departed}} from contemporary dramatic convention in several ways. For example, in Shakespeare's day, plays were usually {{expected to follow}} the advice of Aristotle in his Poetics: that a drama should focus on action, not character. In Hamlet, Shakespeare reverses this so that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> soliloquies, not the action, that the audience learns Hamlet's motives and thoughts. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action, except in the [...] "bad" [...] quarto. At one point, as in the Gravedigger scene, Hamlet seems resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, however, when Claudius appears, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these twists are mistakes or intentional additions {{to add to the}} play's themes of confusion and duality. [...] Hamlet also contains a recurrent Shakespearean device, a play within the play, a literary device or conceit in which one story is told during the action of another story.|$|E

500|$|As early reviews {{focused on}} Ben Hawkins, Brother Justin Crowe {{and the meaning}} of Carnivàle, the show's {{supporting}} characters received little to no attention other than having their freak appearances mentioned, according to Varietys Phil Gallo because [...] "they don't play significant parts in the first few episodes." [...] Critics who reviewed full seasons gave more credit. Wendy Tuohy of the Australian newspaper The Age stated that show creator Daniel Knauf [...] "sprinkled enough magical gifts over the carnival's cast of mind readers, fortunetellers, snake charmers, catatonic psychics, conjoined twins, bearded ladies and lizard men to make the bizarre and the macabre appear just about routine." [...] Matt Casamassina of IGN added that [...] "from the opening sequence to the fade out on episode 12 , Carnivàle successfully draws you into the Depression-engulfed world of its many oddly likeable characters. And sure enough, odd best describes these people [...] The show prominently features all manners of freaks, but each is well-crafted, layered, and believable, rather than comical, as easily could have been the case under amateur direction." [...] MSNBC acknowledged the characters [...] "speak in a dialogue that feels authentic, even if that authenticity is a modern interpretation [...] Carnivàle manager Samson, Michael J. Anderson gets the best dialogue, dropping terrifically incomprehensible lines." [...] DVD Talk lauded Amy Madigan (Iris), Tim DeKay (Jonesy), and Clea DuVall (Sofie) as [...] "fantastic choices" [...] with particularly convincing 1930s looks. They highlighted Carnivàles status as an ensemble show, with [...] "the performances of all the supporting characters [...] essential to the show's success. Particularly inspired is the voice of Linda Hunt as the decidedly creepy 'Management' and John Savage as Henry Scudder." [...] A DVDTown review further praised the supporting performances of Patrick Bauchau (Lodz) and Michael J. Anderson (Samson), pointing out that [...] "in fact, every single character on the show, no matter how small, quirky or sinister they are, produce noteworthy performances all round. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> efforts of this outstanding cast that makes the entire premise of the show and the period setting so realistic and believable that the audience can't help but get immersed in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Buddhist theory, {{through the}} meditative {{development}} of serenity, one {{is able to}} weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state (samadhi). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which {{is the quality of}} mind that can [...] "clearly see" [...] (vi-passana) the nature of phenomena. According to the Buddhist tradition, all phenomena are to be seen as impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty. When this happens, one develops dispassion (viraga) for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.|$|E

In {{the second part of}} his Imaginary Institution of Society (titled [...] "The Social Imaginary and the Institution"), he gives the example of set theory, which is at the basis of formal logic, which cannot function without having first defined the [...] "elements" [...] which are to be assigned to sets.

[...] The manifesto claimed that art does not just occupy mechanical space, but it [...] "transcends it to become something new." [...] Neo-concrete artists aimed {{to create a new}} expressive space in which an artwork is a living being to have a relationship with and to experience through the senses.

2500|$|Sonnet 1 has the {{traditional}} {{characteristics of a}} Shakespearean sonnet—three quatrains and a couplet written in iambic pentameter with an ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme scheme. Many of Shakespeare's sonnets also reflect the two-part structure of the Italian Petrarchan Sonnet. In this type of sonnet (though not in Sonnet 1) [...] "the first eight lines are logically or metaphorically set against the last six [...] an octave-generalization {{will be followed by}} a particular sestet-application, an octave question will be followed by a sestet answer or at least a quatrain answer before the summarizing couplet".
