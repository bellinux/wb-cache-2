5|$|Cope {{travels with}} Knight to Europe; Knight with the {{intention}} of visiting Paris zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his money buying The American Naturalist, a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to talk about the find Laelaps; in his speech, he subtly <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> folly of Marsh's elitism and backstabbing, as well as Cope's collecting obsession.|$|E
5|$|The violin concerto {{stands out}} from {{previous}} concertos with its connected movements. There is no break {{between the first}} and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two. The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cyclic form of the piece. The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would have come as a surprise to Mendelssohn's audience, who, unlike today's, were used to applauding between movements.|$|E
5|$|Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; {{the royal}} hypogeum {{provided}} {{a large amount}} of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices associated with it. Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they would have left behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in this}} palace that Alboin {{was killed}} on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most {{detailed}} narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by Marius of Aventicum in his Chronica, written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king {{was killed in a}} conspiracy by a man close to him, called Hilmegis (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cooperation of Byzantium. Roger Collins describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.|$|E
5|$|The backup to Justice League #6 <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{formation}} of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The Secret Society was fully introduced in Justice League of America. In Justice League of America #1, {{it was revealed that}} the Justice League of America team was created by A.R.G.U.S. in order to stop the Justice League if needed, with each member being paired with someone in the Justice League. Justice League #18 introduces Firestorm, Element Woman and Atom as the newest members of the Justice League, as well as the Watchtower being hacked. It is revealed at the end of Justice League #20 that Atom is an agent of A.R.G.U.S. and is actually a member of the Justice League of America. She was chosen to act as a spy within the Justice League. In Justice League of America #4, Dr. Arthur Light is called in by A.R.G.U.S. to examine the Secret Society's communication coin. While doing so, it is manipulated from the other side causing Light to be enveloped in a white light, giving him powers. In Justice League of America #5, it is determined that the Secret Society's manor has stained glass with images of Pandora's Box, hinting at their interest in Pandora.|$|E

25|$|Voltaire's {{critique}} concerns not {{the nature}} of the Pascalian wager as proof of God's existence, but the contention that the very belief Pascal tried to promote is not convincing. Voltaire <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fact that Pascal, as a Jansenist, believed that only a small, and already predestined, portion of humanity would eventually be saved by God.|$|E
25|$|The carpet fragments, {{although}} reliably {{dated to}} the early Sasanian time, {{do not seem to}} be related to the splendid court carpets described by the Arab conquerors. Their crude knots incorporating shag on the reverse <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> need for increased insulation. With their coarsely finished animal and hunting depictions, these carpets were likely woven by nomadic people.|$|E
25|$|The {{massacre}} {{created a}} national scandal. The Communist-controlled Italian General Confederation of Labour called {{a general strike}} in protest against the massacre. According to newspaper reports <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possibility of civil war were heard as Communist leaders harangued meetings of 6,000,000 workers who struck throughout Italy in protest against the May Day massacre in Sicily.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, Branta rhuax {{from the}} Big Island of Hawaii, and a {{gigantic}} goose-like anatid from Oahu are known only from very incomplete, {{and in the}} former case much damaged, bone fragments. The former has been alleged to be a shelduck, but this was generally dismissed because of {{the damage to the}} material and biogeographic considerations. The long-legged Kauai bird, however, <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a former tadornine presence on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The Landscape {{with the}} Fall of Icarus, now {{thought to be}} an early copy, {{combines}} several elements of northern Renaissance painting. It <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> renewed interest for antiquity (the Icarus legend), but the hero Icarus is hidden away in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who does not even look up from his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque.|$|E
25|$|Hazlitt's {{criticism}} of Tooke's grammatical work {{has also been}} singled out. Critic Tom Paulin notes the way Hazlitt's subtle choice of language <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> broader, politically radical implications of Tooke's linguistic achievement. Paulin observes also that Hazlitt, himself the author of an English grammar influenced by Tooke, recognised the importance of Tooke's grammatical ideas {{in a way that}} presaged and accorded with the radical grammatical work of William Cobbett, whom Hazlitt sketched in a later essay in The Spirit of the Age.|$|E

25|$|As a {{complicated}} period bridging between Roman art and medieval art and Byzantine art, the Late Antique period saw {{a transition from}} the classical idealized realism tradition largely influenced by Ancient Greek art to the more iconic, stylized art of the Middle Ages. Unlike classical art, Late Antique art does not emphasize the beauty and movement of the body, but rather, <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spiritual reality behind its subjects. Additionally, mirroring the rise of Christianity {{and the collapse of}} the western Roman Empire, painting and freestanding sculpture gradually fell from favor in the artistic community. Replacing them were greater interests in mosaics, architecture, and relief sculpture.|$|E
25|$|By {{locating}} {{the conditions of}} rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in interaction. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted communication. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> source of a new political practice that incorporates the imperatives of evolutionary rationality.|$|E
25|$|The grounds as {{they appear}} today were laid out in grand style in the late 17th century. There are no {{authentic}} remains of Henry VIII's gardens, merely a small knot garden, planted in 1924, which <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gardens' 16th-century appearance. Today, the dominating feature of the grounds is the great landscaping scheme constructed for Sir Christopher Wren's intended new palace. From a water-bounded semicircular parterre, {{the length of the}} east front, three avenues radiate in a crow's foot pattern. The central avenue, containing not a walk or a drive, but the great canal known as the Long Water, was excavated during the reign of Charles II, in 1662. The design, radical at the time, is another immediately recognizable influence from Versailles, and was indeed laid out by pupils of André Le Nôtre, Louis XIV's landscape gardener.|$|E

25|$|Once activated, the dodecahedron {{transports}} {{the group}} {{through a series}} of wormholes to a massive station {{near the center of the}} Milky Way. The station contains a surreal Earth-like beach where the five are split up. Ellie meets an extraterrestrial in a form indistinguishable from Ted Arroway, who explains his people's reasons for making contact, and tells her of their ongoing project to alter the properties of the universe by accumulating enough mass in Cygnus A to counter the effects of entropy. He also tells her that the wormhole system was built by unknown precursors, and <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discovery of artificial messages in transcendental numbers like π. Ellie is reunited with the other four travellers who have also met simulations of their loved ones. She captures video evidence of the encounter before the dodecahedron takes them back to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Munch {{continued}} {{to employ a}} variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, {{as he struggled to}} define his style. His idiom {{continued to}} veer between naturalistic, as seen in Portrait of Hans Jæger, and impressionistic, as in Rue Lafayette. His Inger On the Beach (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come. He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the Post-Impressionists, what evolved was a subject matter which was symbolist in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter Léon Bonnat.|$|E
500|$|The {{causes of}} the Peloponnesian War have been much debated, but many ancient historians lay the blame on Pericles and Athens. Plutarch seems to believe that Pericles and the Athenians incited the war, {{scrambling}} to implement their belligerent tactics [...] "with a sort of arrogance and a love of strife". Thucydides <b>hints</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same thing, believing {{the reason for the}} war was Sparta's fear of Athenian power and growth. However, as he is generally regarded as an admirer of Pericles, Thucydides has been criticized for bias against Sparta.|$|E
