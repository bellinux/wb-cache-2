To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, <b>knew</b> <b>your</b> way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

In May, Smith and Helen left for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley with their baby, where Smith {{undertook}} his magical retirement. Back in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith's birth chart, {{and came to the}} conclusion that he was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him; Smith however remained sceptical. Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O., while Parsons [...] who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict [...] ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head. In a letter informing Crowley of this decision, Smith remarked [...] "Would to God you <b>knew</b> <b>your</b> people better." [...] Germer subsequently appointed Max Schneider head of the Agape Lodge, which remained inactive, while Crowley, Germer, and Schneider began spreading lies about Smith, including that he was responsible for raping initiates, claims that were denied by many Lodge members.|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you <b>knew</b> <b>your</b> power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
