40|$|Introduction Genetic {{evaluation}} and estimation of breeding value {{are one of}} the most fundamental elements of breeding programmes for genetic improvement. Recently, genomic selection has become an efficient method to approach this aim. The accuracy of estimated <b>Genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> is the most important factor in genomic selection. Different studies have been performed addressing the factors affecting the accuracy of estimated <b>Genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value.</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of beta and gamma distributions on the accuracy of genetic evaluation. Materials and Methods A genome consisted of 10 chromosomes with 200 cm length was simulated. Markers were spaced on 0. 2 cm intervals and different numbers of QTL with random distribution were simulated. Only additive gene effects were considered. The base population was simulated with an effective size of 100 animals and this structure continued up to generation 50 to creating linkage disequilibrium between the markers and QTL. The population size was increased to 1000 animals in generation 51 (reference generation). Marker effects were calculated from the genomic and phenotypic information. <b>Genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> was computed in generations 52 to 57 (training generation). Effects of gamma 1 distribution (shape= 0. 4, scale= 1. 66), gamma 2 distribution (shape= 0. 4, scale= 1) and beta distribution (shape 1 = 3. 11, shape 2 = 1. 16) were studied in the reference and training groups. The heritability values were 0. 2 and 0. 05. Results and Discussion The results showed that accuracy of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> reduced with passing generation (from 51 to 57) for two gamma distributions and beta distribution; this decrease may be due to two factors: recombination has negative impact on accuracy of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> and selection reduces genetic variance as the number of generations increases. Accuracy of genomic estimated breeding value increased as the heritability increased so that the high heritability had more accuracy than low heritability in same QTL number. Number and distribution of genes is an important factor for accuracy of estimated breeding value. Duncan test was conducted by SPSS software. Results illustrated that there was no significant difference between the different distributions. Comparing accuracy of estimated breeding value showed that in the low heritability scenario with 10 and 20 QTL, gamma distribution 2 and gamma distribution 1 performed well, respectively, whilst in 50 and 100 QTL scenario, beta distribution was superior in both Lasso and Ridge methods. In the high heritability scenario with 50, 100 QTL gamma distributions 2 were superior in both Lasso and Ridge methods. With four QTL (10, 20, 50 & 100), in high heritability scenario, estimated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> was often increased by increasing the number of QTL. This may be due to increasing linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL. In general, the gamma distribution led to the increased accuracy of the estimations in both Lasso and Ridge methods. Conclusion Marker density, method to estimate marker effects, QTL distribution, number of QTL, number of generations and trait heritability are some effective factors on accuracy of estimated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value.</b> The accuracy of estimated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> is output of these factors and the distribution of genes is an important factor for accuracy of estimated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value.</b> We can conclude that, accuracy is reduced with increasing number of generations from base population to training population while the accuracy of estimated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> is increased when breeding value of the reference group is used in lieu of the phenotypic records. In addition, accuracy of estimated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> is enhanced by increasing heritability, so that, between three the distributions simulated in high heritability scenario, gamma 2 distribution increased accuracy of the estimates. Although, the size and distribution of QTL effects still greatly influence the effectiveness of the genomic prediction methods, but as a suggestion, models of genetic variation of genomic assessment should be considered, since a method of estimating breeding value may have (or produce) a better estimation with a specific model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> {{estimation}} {{is the key}} step in genomic selection. Among many approaches, BLUP {{methods and}} Bayesian methods are most commonly used for estimating genomic breeding values. Here, we applied two BLUP methods, TABLUP and GBLUP, and three Bayesian methods, BayesA, BayesB and BayesCπ, to the common dataset provided by the 15 th QTL-MAS Workshop to evaluate and compare their predictive performances. Results For the 1000 progenies without phenotypic values, the correlations between GEBVs by different methods ranged from 0. 812 (GBLUP and BayesCπ) to 0. 997 (TABLUP and BayesB). The accuracies of GEBVs (measured as correlations between true breeding values (TBVs) and GEBVs) were from 0. 774 (GBLUP) to 0. 938 (BayesCπ) and the biases of GEBVs (measure as regressions of TBVs on GEBVs) were from 1. 033 (TABLUP) to 1. 648 (GBLUP). The three Bayesian methods and TABLUP had similar accuracy and bias. Conclusions BayesA, BayesB, BayesCπ and TABLUP performed similarly and satisfactorily and remarkably outperformed GBLUP for <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimation in this dataset. TABLUP is a promising method for <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimation because of its easy computation of reliabilities of GEBVs and its easy extension to real life conditions such as multiple traits and consideration of individuals without genotypes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although common {{datasets}} are {{an important}} resource for the scientific community {{and can be used}} to address important questions, genomic datasets of a meaningful size have not generally been available in livestock species. We describe a pig dataset that PIC (a Genus company) has made available for comparing genomic prediction methods. We also describe genomic evaluation of the data using methods that PIC considers best practice for predicting and validating genomic breeding values, and we discuss the impact of data structure on accuracy. The dataset contains 3534 individuals with high-density genotypes, phenotypes, and estimated breeding values for five traits. Genomic breeding values were calculated using BayesB, with phenotypes and de-regressed breeding values, and using a single-step genomic BLUP approach that combines information from genotyped and un-genotyped animals. The <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> accuracy increased with increased trait heritability and with increased relationship between training and validation. In nearly all cases, BayesB using de-regressed breeding values outperformed the other approaches, but the single-step evaluation performed only slightly worse. This dataset was useful for comparing methods for genomic prediction using real data. Our results indicate that validation approaches accounting for relatedness between populations can correct for potential overestimation of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> accuracies, with implications for genotyping strategies to carry out genomic selection programs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{national}} evaluations, direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> can {{be considered}} as correlated traits to those for which phenotypes are available for traditional estimation of <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> For this purpose, estimates of the accuracy of direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> expressed as genetic correlations between traits and their respective direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are required. Methods We derived direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for 2239 registered Limousin and 2703 registered Simmental beef cattle genotyped with either the Illumina BovineSNP 50 BeadChip or the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip. For the 264 Simmental animals that were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip, genotypes for markers present on the BovineSNP 50 BeadChip were extracted. Deregressed estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were used as observations in weighted analyses that estimated marker effects to derive direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for each breed. For each breed, genotyped individuals were clustered into five groups using K-means clustering, with the aim of increasing within-group and decreasing between-group pedigree relationships. Cross-validation was performed five times for each breed, using four groups for training and the fifth group for validation. For each trait, we then applied a weighted bivariate analysis of the direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of genotyped animals from all five validation sets and their corresponding deregressed estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> to estimate variance and covariance components. Results After minimizing relationships between training and validation groups, estimated genetic correlations between each trait and its direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 0. 39 to 0. 76 in Limousin and from 0. 29 to 0. 65 in Simmental. The efficiency of selection based on direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> relative to selection based on parent average information ranged from 0. 68 to 1. 28 in genotyped Limousin and from 0. 51 to 1. 44 in genotyped Simmental animals. The efficiencies were higher for 323 non-genotyped young Simmental animals, born after January 2012, and ranged from 0. 60 to 2. 04. Conclusions Direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> show promise for routine use by Limousin and Simmental breeders to improve the accuracy of predicted genetic merit of their animals at a young age and increase response to selection. Benefits from selecting on direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are greater for breeders who use natural mating sires in their herds than for those who use artificial insemination sires. Producers with unregistered commercial Limousin and Simmental cattle could also benefit from being able to identify genetically superior animals in their herds, an opportunity that has in the past been limited to seed stock animals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Three breeds (Fleckvieh, Holstein, and Jersey) were {{included}} in a reference population, separately and together, to assess the accuracy of prediction of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> in single-breed validation populations. The accuracy of genomic selection {{was defined as the}} correlation between estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> calculated using phenotypic data, and <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> The Holstein and Jersey populations were from Australia, whereas the Fleckvieh population (dual-purpose Simmental) was from Austria and Germany. Both a BLUP with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and a Bayesian method (BayesA) were used to derive the prediction equations. The hypothesis tested was that having a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of genomic selection. Minimal advantage existed of either GBLUP or BayesA multi-breed genomic evaluations over single-breed evaluations. However, when the goal was to predict <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for a breed with no individuals in the reference population, using 2 other breeds in the reference was generally better than only 1 breed...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{selection}} (GS) involves estimating <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> using molecular markers {{spanning the}} entire genome. Accurate prediction of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> (GEBVs) presents a central challenge to contemporary {{plant and animal}} breeders. The existence of {{a wide array of}} marker-based approaches for predicting <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> makes it essential to evaluate and compare their relative predictive performances to identify approaches able to accurately predict <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> We evaluated the predictive accuracy of random forests (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (boosting) and support vector machines (SVMs) for predicting <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> using dense SNP markers and explored the utility of RF for ranking the predictive importance of markers for pre-screening markers or discovering chromosomal locations of QTLs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Objective was to {{simulate}} {{the data for the}} QTLMAS 2010 Workshop under a model that includes major additive, epistatic and parent-of-origin effects. Results Data were simulated for 3226 individuals in 5 generations. Genomic data for 5 chromosomes were simulated using coalescent model. In total, the data included 10, 031 SNPs, 30 additive QTLs, 2 interacting QTL pairs, and 3 imprinted loci. The density was 20 SNPs/ 1 Mb, whereas mean linkage disequilibrium between adjacent SNPs was 0. 1. One quantitative and one binary trait were simulated with heritability of 0. 39 - 0. 52 and additive correlation of 0. 59. The data {{can be used as a}} benchmark for comparison of QTL mapping methods and models for <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimation under complex genetic architecture. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of the 54 k goat chip has allowed the genotyping of 825 males from the French goat selection scheme for the two breeds Alpine and Saanen. In this species, genomic selection could improve annual genetic gain by reducing {{the length of the}} sire-son pathway (5. 5 years in 2011). This would require that accuracy of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> of young males (without phenotype) is at least equal to the parent average one. Moreover, the quality of prediction being sensitive {{to the size of the}} reference population (sires already genotyped and phenotyped), a multi-breed (combining Alpine and Saanen performances) approach could be considered. The first part of the study focuses on genomic structure of the reference populations of these two breeds that may impact on expected accuracy of genomic predictions. Persistence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) phases between Alpine and Saanen, 0. 58 at 60 kb, was the same as the one find between Manech and Lacaune dairy sheep breeds. Moreover, a low correlation (68 %) between allele frequencies in Saanen and Alpine breeds and an analysis in principal component based on genotypes have shown that Alpine and Saanen have to be considered as two different breeds. Genetic correlation between the two breeds estimated on SNP data ranged between 0. 45 for milk yield and 0. 76 for udder floor position. Genomic selection was tested using a single step approach applied to a GBLUP model in the multi-breed or within-breed for production and udder type traits. The prediction quality was assessed by cross validation and the accuracy of genomic breeding values of candidates was compared to the parent average one. The prediction quality using multi-breed or within-breed model was similar, between 0. 34 for fore udder in Alpine breed to 0. 73 for protein content for Saanen breed. Within-breed, these values were higher in Saanen due to an higher inbreeding level, and similar as the one obtained in Lacaune dairy sheep with a reference population of 2 185 rams. <b>Genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> accuracy of candidates exceeds parent average accuracy from 10 % for protein yield in Alpine breed to 14 % for protein content in Saanen breed. Clearly the single step GBLUP method provides opportunities for genomic selection in French goats’ population...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Genomic {{selection}} {{refers to}} the use of genomewide dense markers for breeding value estimation and subsequently for selection. The main challenge of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimation is the estimation of many effects from a limited number of observations. Bayesian methods have been proposed to successfully cope with these challenges. As an alternative class of models, non- and semiparametric models were recently introduced. The present study investigated the ability of nonparametric additive regression models to predict genomic breeding values. The genotypes were modelled for each marker or pair of flanking markers (i. e. the predictors) separately. The nonparametric functions for the predictors were estimated simultaneously using additive model theory, applying a binomial kernel. The optimal degree of smoothing was determined by bootstrapping. A mutation-drift-balance simulation was carried out. The breeding values of the last generation (genotyped) was predicted using data from the next last generation (genotyped and phenotyped). The results show moderate to high accuracies of the predicted breeding values. A determination of predictor specific degree of smoothing increased the accuracy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{data are}} used in animal {{breeding}} to assist genetic evaluation. Several models to estimate <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> have been studied. In general, two approaches have been used. One approach estimates the marker effects first and then, <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are obtained by summing marker effects. In the second approach, <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are estimated directly using an equivalent model with a genomic relationship matrix. Allele coding is the method chosen to assign values to the regression coefficients in the statistical model. A common allele coding is zero for the homozygous genotype of the first allele, one for the heterozygote, and two for the homozygous genotype for the other allele. Another common allele coding changes these regression coefficients by subtracting a value from each marker such that the mean of regression coefficients is zero within each marker. We call this centered allele coding. This study considered effects of different allele coding methods on inference. Both marker-based and equivalent models were considered, and restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were used in inference. Results Theoretical derivations showed that parameter estimates and estimated marker effects in marker-based models are the same irrespective of the allele coding, provided that the model has a fixed general mean. For the equivalent models, the same results hold, even though different allele coding methods lead to different genomic relationship matrices. Calculated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are independent of allele coding when the estimate of the general mean is included into the values. Reliabilities of estimated <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> calculated using elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix depend on the allele coding because different allele coding methods imply different models. Finally, allele coding affects the mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, with the centered coding being the best. Conclusions Different allele coding methods lead to the same inference in the marker-based and equivalent models when a fixed general mean {{is included in the}} model. However, reliabilities of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> are affected by the allele coding method used. The centered coding has some numerical advantages when Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used. </p...|$|R
40|$|Stochastic {{simulations}} {{were performed}} to evaluate a variety of scenarios to select young sires in <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> programs. Scenarios included variation of accuracies of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> and h 2 in combination with selection intensities and different types of pre-selection. For conventional methods as done in the past, i. e. contracting bull dams and using their male offspring for AI, true <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of selected sires were substantially lower and their inbreeding coefficients were higher compared to direct selection of genotyped male calves. For all types of pre-selection, {{it is imperative to}} genotype male calves, even if <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> of parents are available. Selection intensity of young sires remains a crucial point also in the genomic era for generating genetic gain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{selection}} can {{be implemented}} by a multi-step procedure, which requires a response variable and a statistical method. For pure-bred pigs, it was hypothesised that deregressed estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> (EBV) with the parent average removed as the response variable generate higher reliabilities of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> than EBV, and that the normal, thick-tailed and mixture-distribution models yield similar reliabilities. Methods Reliabilities of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were estimated with EBV and deregressed EBV as response variables and under the three statistical methods, genomic BLUP, Bayesian Lasso and MIXTURE. The methods were examined by splitting data into a reference data set of 1375 genotyped animals that were performance tested before October 2008, and 536 genotyped validation animals that were performance tested after October 2008. The traits examined were daily gain and feed conversion ratio. Results Using deregressed EBV as the response variable yielded 18 to 39 % higher reliabilities of the <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> than using EBV as the response variable. For daily gain, the increase in reliability due to deregression was significant and approximately 35 %, whereas for feed conversion ratio it ranged between 18 and 39 % and was significant only when MIXTURE was used. Genomic BLUP, Bayesian Lasso and MIXTURE had similar reliabilities. Conclusions Deregressed EBV is the preferred response variable, whereas the choice of statistical method is less critical for pure-bred pigs. The increase of 18 to 39 % in reliability is worthwhile, since the reliabilities of the <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> directly affect the returns from genomic selection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{evaluation}} methods today use {{single nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP) as genomic markers to trace quantitative trait loci (QTL). Today most genomic prediction procedures use biallelic SNP markers. However, SNP can be combined into short, multiallelic haplotypes that can improve genomic prediction due to higher linkage disequilibrium between the haplotypes and the linked QTL. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a method to identify the haplotypes, which can be expected to be superior in genomic evaluation, as compared with either SNP or other haplotypes of the same size. We first identified the SNP (termed as QTL-SNP) from the bovine 50 K SNP chip that had the largest effect on the analyzed trait. It was assumed that these SNP were not the causative mutations and they merely indicated the approximate location of the QTL. Haplotypes of 3, 4, or 5 SNP were selected from short genomic windows surrounding these markers to capture the effect of the QTL. Two methods described in this paper aim at selecting the most optimal haplotype for genomic evaluation. They assumed that if an allele has a high frequency, its allele effect can be accurately predicted. These methods were tested in a classical validation study using a dairy cattle population of 2, 235 bulls with genotypes from the bovine 50 K SNP chip and daughter yield deviations (DYD) on 5 dairy cattle production traits. Combining the SNP into haplotypes was beneficial with all tested haplotypes, leading to an average increase of 2 % in terms of correlations between DYD and <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimates compared with the analysis when the same SNP were used individually. Compared with haplotypes built by merging the QTL-SNP with its flanking SNP, the haplotypes selected with the proposed criteria carried less under- and over-represented alleles: the proportion of alleles with frequencies 40 % decreased, on average, by 17. 4 and 43. 4 %, respectively. The correlations between DYD and <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimates increased by 0. 7 to 0. 9 percentage points when the haplotypes were selected using any of the proposed methods compared with using the haplotypes built from the QTL-SNP and its flanking markers. We showed that the efficiency of genomic prediction could be improved at no extra costs, only by selecting the proper markers or combinations of markers for genomic prediction. One of the presented approaches was implemented in the new genomic evaluation procedure applied in dairy cattle in France in April 2015...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} upon which to base selection decisions has continued to increase over time as has the effort to develop tools to best use this information. From a beef industry historical perspective, initially information for selection was primarily based on pedigree, then improvements came with performance recording and the original efforts of the Beef Improvement Federation to set guidelines to standardize that performance information. Later on, with advancements in computing, combined with the historical databases of performance information genetic evaluation systems were developed to calculate expected progeny differences (EPD). Now with advancements in DNA technologies, <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> information is available. While the additional information gleaned by largescale genetic evaluation, the resulting EPD and now DNA marker information, may better characterize animals genetically, the {{amount of information}} is often overwhelming when trying to make the best selection and purchase decisions.

Methods After collecting phenotypic and genomic information for the total number of piglets born by Landrace pigs, selection accuracy between <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimates using genomic information and breeding value estimates of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) using conventional pedigree information were compared. Results Genetic standard deviation (σa) for the total number of piglets born was 0. 91. Since the total number of piglets born for candidate pigs was unknown, the accuracy of the breeding value estimated from pedigree information was 0. 080. When genomic information was used, the accuracy of the breeding value was 0. 216. Assuming that the replacement rate of sows per year is 100 % and generation interval is 1 year, genetic gain per year is 0. 346 head when genomic information is used. It is 0. 128 when BLUP is used.

40|$|Most current {{research}} on genomic selection {{is focusing on}} the accurate prediction of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> However selection solely based on <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> despite being theoretically promising, is in practice only suboptimal for several reasons. The two most important are that only few animals are genotyped therefore having genomic prediction directly available and that rankings will change. With <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> potentially available in the near future, strategies are required to avoid any confusion {{in the mind of}} users. The aim {{of this study is to}} present three different strategies that could be used to incorporate genomic prediction into population-wide genetic evaluation. The three strategies are: 1) using selection index theory to combine both sources of information into a single set of breeding values; 2) for ungenotyped animals, compute conditional expectation of gene contents for SNP given molecular and pedigree data and use these predicted gene contents; and 3) integrate <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> as external information into genetic evaluation using a Bayesian framework. If strategy 1) is straight forward, additional steps have to be done to adjust <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for changes in those of relatives. A practical implementation is to use reliabilities of the genomic prediction, the population-wide genetic evaluation PA, and PA from the genotyped subset to set up a 3 x 3 matrix for each animal, with off-diagonal elements being functions of the 3 reliabilities. The use of strategy 2) is computationally much more challenging but leads directly to the needed covariance structures combining genomic relationship if known with pedigree relationships. Strategy 3) is potentially a good compromise because the theory is well established and has already been used in beef cattle to incorporate external <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Also current genetic evaluation software can be easily modified to incorporate <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> valuesPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> {{accuracy}} of scarcely recorded traits is low {{because of the}} limited number of phenotypic observations. One solution to increase the breeding value accuracy is to use predictor traits. This study investigated the impact of recording additional phenotypic observations for predictor traits on reference and evaluated animals on the <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> accuracy for a scarcely recorded trait. The scarcely recorded trait was dry matter intake (DMI, n = 869) and the predictor traits were fat-protein-corrected milk (FPCM, n = 1520) and live weight (LW, n = 1309). All phenotyped animals were genotyped and originated from research farms in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Multi-trait REML was used to simultaneously estimate variance components and breeding values for DMI using available predictors. In addition, analyses using only pedigree relationships were performed. Breeding value accuracy was assessed through cross-validation (CV) and prediction error variance (PEV). CV groups (n = 7) were defined by splitting animals across genetic lines and management groups within country. With no additional traits recorded for the evaluated animals, both CV- and PEV-based accuracies for DMI were substantially higher for genomic than for pedigree analyses (CV: max. 0. 26 for pedigree and 0. 33 for genomic analyses; PEV: max. 0. 45 and 0. 52, respectively). With additional traits available, the differences between pedigree and genomic accuracies diminished. With additional recording for FPCM, pedigree accuracies increased from 0. 26 to 0. 47 for CV and from 0. 45 to 0. 48 for PEV. Genomic accuracies increased from 0. 33 to 0. 50 for CV and from 0. 52 to 0. 53 for PEV. With additional recording for LW instead of FPCM, pedigree accuracies increased to 0. 54 for CV and to 0. 61 for PEV. Genomic accuracies increased to 0. 57 for CV and to 0. 60 for PEV. With both FPCM and LW available for evaluated animals, accuracy was highest (0. 62 for CV and 0. 61 for PEV in pedigree, and 0. 63 for CV and 0. 61 for PEV in genomic analyses). Recording predictor traits for only the reference population did not increase DMI breeding value accuracy. Recording predictor traits for both reference and evaluated animals significantly increased DMI breeding value accuracy and removed the bias observed when only reference animals had records. The benefit of using genomic instead of pedigree relationships was reduced when more predictor traits were used. Using predictor traits may be an inexpensive way to significantly increase the accuracy and remove the bias of (genomic) breeding values of scarcely recorded traits such as feed intake...|$|E
40|$|The Bayesian LASSO (BL) {{has been}} pointed {{out to be an}} {{effective}} approach to sparse model representation and successfully applied to quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> (GBV) estimation using genome-wide dense sets of markers. However, the BL relies on a single parameter known as the regularization parameter to simultaneously control the overall model sparsity and the shrinkage of individual covariate effects. This may be idealistic when dealing with a large number of predictors whose effect sizes may differ by orders of magnitude. Here we propose the extended Bayesian LASSO (EBL) for QTL mapping and unobserved phenotype prediction, which introduces an additional level to the hierarchical specification of the BL to explicitly separate out these two model features. Compared to the adaptiveness of the BL, the EBL is “doubly adaptive” and thus, more robust to tuning. In simulations, the EBL outperformed the BL in regard to the accuracy of both effect size estimates and phenotypic value predictions, with comparable computational time. Moreover, the EBL proved to be less sensitive to tuning than the related Bayesian adaptive LASSO (BAL), which introduces locus-specific regularization parameters as well, but involves no mechanism for distinguishing between model sparsity and parameter shrinkage. Consequently, the EBL seems to point to a new direction for QTL mapping, phenotype prediction, and GBV estimation...|$|E

Despite that the true model used to simulate the data was the logistic growth model, the Gompertz model provided a good fit of the data. Genomic breeding values calculated from predicted phenotypes were highly correlated with the breeding values obtained by directly using the respective observed phenotypes. The accuracies between the true and estimated breeding value at time 600 were above 0. 93, even though t 600 was outside the time range used when fitting the data. The analysis of {{the parameters of the}} Gompertz curve successfully discriminated regions with QTL affecting the asymptotic final value, but it was less successful in finding QTL affecting the other parameters of the logistic growth curve. In this study we estimated the proportion of SNPs affecting a given trait, in contrast with previously reported implementations of genomic selection in which this parameter was assumed to be known without error. Conclusions The two-step approach used to combine curve fitting and genomic selection on longitudinal data provided a simple way for combining these two complex tasks without any detrimental effect on breeding value estimation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} we {{compared}} different statistical procedures for estimating SNP effects using the simulated data set from the XII QTL-MAS workshop. Five procedures were considered and tested in a reference population, i. e., the first four generations, from which phenotypes and genotypes were available. The procedures {{can be interpreted as}} variants of ridge regression, with different ways for defining the shrinkage parameter. Comparisons were made with respect to the correlation between genomic and conventional estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> Moderate correlations were obtained from all methods. Two of them were used to predict <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> in the last three generations. Correlations between these and the true <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were also moderate. We concluded that the ridge regression procedures applied in this study did not outperform the simple use of a ratio of variances in a mixed model method, both providing moderate accuracies of predicted <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values.</b> </p...|$|R

Several multi-breed (Alpine and Saanen) reference population sizes, including or excluding female genotypes (from 67 males to 677 males, and 1, 985 females), were used. Genomic evaluations were performed using genomic best linear unbiased predictor for milk production traits, somatic cell score, and some udder type traits. At a marker distance of 50 kb, the average r(2) (squared correlation coefficient) value of linkage disequilibrium was 0. 14, and persistence of linkage disequilibrium as correlation of r-values among Saanen and Alpine breeds was 0. 56. Genomic evaluation accuracies obtained from cross validation ranged from 36 to 53 %. Biases of these estimations assessed by regression coefficients (from 0. 73 to 0. 98) of phenotypes on <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were higher for traits such as protein yield than for udder type traits. Using the reference population that included all males and females, accuracies of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> derived from prediction error variances (model accuracy) obtained for young buck candidates without phenotypes ranged from 52 to 56 %. This was lower than the average pedigree-derived <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> accuracies obtained at birth for these males from the official genetic evaluation (62 %). Adding females to the reference population of 677 males improved accuracy by 5 to 9 % depending on the trait considered. Gains in model accuracies of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 1 to 7 %, lower than reported in other studies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genomic breeding values for milk yield in crossbred dairy goats. The research was based on data provided by 2 commercial goat farms in the UK comprising 590, 409 milk yield records on 14, 453 dairy goats kidding between 1987 and 2013. The population was created by crossing 3 breeds: Alpine, Saanen, and Toggenburg. In each generation the best performing animals were selected for breeding, and as a result, a synthetic breed was created. The pedigree file contained 30, 139 individuals, of which 2, 799 were founders. The data set contained test-day records of milk yield, lactation number, farm, age at kidding, and year and season of kidding. Data on milk composition was unavailable. In total 1, 960 animals were genotyped with the Illumina 50 K caprine chip. Two methods for estimation of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> were compared—BLUP at the single nucleotide polymorphism level (BLUP-SNP) and single-step BLUP. The highest accuracy of 0. 61 was obtained with single-step BLUP, and the lowest (0. 36) with BLUP-SNP. Linkage disequilibrium (r 2, the squared correlation of the alleles at 2 loci) at 50 kb (distance between 2 SNP) was 0. 18. This is the first attempt to implement genomic selection in UK dairy goats. Results indicate that the single-step method provides the highest accuracy for populations with a small number of genotyped individuals, where the number of genotyped males is low and females are predominant in the reference population...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of genomic evaluations {{depends on the}} proportion of genetic variation explained by the DNA markers. In this study, we have estimated the proportion of variance in daughter trait deviations (DTDs) of dairy bulls explained by 45 993 genome wide single-nucleotide poly- morphism (SNP) markers for 29 traits in Australian Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle. We compare these proportions to the proportion of variance in DTDs explained by the additive relationship matrix derived from the pedigree, {{as well as the}} sum of variance explained by both pedigree and marker information when these were fitted simultaneously. The propor- tion of genetic variance in DTDs relative to the total genetic variance (the total genetic variance explained by the genomic relationships and pedigree relationships when both were fitted simultaneously) varied from 32 % for fertility to approximately 80 % for milk yield traits. When fitting genomic and pedigree relationships simultaneously, the variance unexplained (i. e. the residual variance) in DTDs of the total variance for most traits was reduced compared to fitting either individually, suggesting that there is not complete overlap between the effects. The proportion of genetic variance accounted by the genomic relationships can be used to modify the blending equations used to calculate genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) from direct <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> (DGV) and parent average. Our results, from a validation population of young dairy bulls with DTD, suggest that this modification can improve the {{reliability of}} GEBV by up to 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Background: Objective was to {{simulate}} {{the data for the}} QTLMAS 2010 Workshop under a model that includes major additive, epistatic and parent-of-origin effects. Results: Data were simulated for 3226 individuals in 5 generations. Genomic data for 5 chromosomes were simulated using coalescent model. In total, the data included 10, 031 SNPs, 30 additive QTLs, 2 interacting QTL pairs, and 3 imprinted loci. The density was 20 SNPs/ 1 Mb, whereas mean linkage disequilibrium between adjacent SNPs was 0. 1. One quantitative and one binary trait were simulated with heritability of 0. 39 - 0. 52 and additive correlation of 0. 59. The data {{can be used as a}} benchmark for comparison of QTL mapping methods and models for <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> estimation under complex genetic architecture. Background Methods for genome marker assisted selection are being developed for many livestock species. Models focus mainly on additive genes, whereas other effects like epistasis or epigenetic effects are usually ignored. However, epistatic interactions have been documented in model and livestock species, and can contribute significantly to phenotype variation [1]. Studies in mammals highlights the importance of imprinting in regulating development and metabolism. Accounting for significant non-additive and non-mendelian effects may increase power of the method for QTL mapping and the accuracy of estimated breeding values. Furthermore, widespread pleiotropy is observed when large numbers of genes affect each trait. This suggests that multitrait models should perform better than testing one trait at time. Objective was {{to simulate}} phenotypes for two correlated traits under a model that includes epistatic and parent-of-origin effects for QTLMAS 2010 Workshop. Simulation metho...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Using a multi-breed {{reference}} population {{might be a}} way of increasing the accuracy of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> in small breeds. Models involving mixed-breed data do {{not take into account the}} fact that marker effects may differ among breeds. This study was aimed at investigating the impact on accuracy of increasing the number of genotyped candidates in the training set by using a multi-breed {{reference population}}, in contrast to single-breed genomic evaluations. Methods Three traits (milk production, fat content and female fertility) were analyzed by genomic mixed linear models and Bayesian methodology. Three breeds of French dairy cattle were used: Holstein, Montbéliarde and Normande with 2976, 950 and 970 bulls in the training population, respectively and 964, 222 and 248 bulls in the validation population, respectively. All animals were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine SNP 50 array. Accuracy of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> was evaluated under three scenarios for the correlation of <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> between breeds (r g) : uncorrelated (1), r g = 0; estimated r g (2); high, r g = 0. 95 (3). Accuracy and bias of predictions obtained in the validation population with the multi-breed training set were assessed by the coefficient of determination (R 2) and by the regression coefficient of daughter yield deviations of validation bulls on their predicted <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values,</b> respectively. Results The genetic variation captured by the markers for each trait was similar to that estimated for routine pedigree-based genetic evaluation. Posterior means for r g ranged from − 0. 01 for fertility between Montbéliarde and Normande to 0. 79 for milk yield between Montbéliarde and Holstein. Differences in R 2 between the three scenarios were notable only for fat content in the Montbéliarde breed: from 0. 27 in scenario (1) to 0. 33 in scenarios (2) and (3).

40|$|Reproductive {{technologies}} such as multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) and ovum pick-up (OPU) accelerate genetic improvement in dairy breeding schemes. To enhance the efficiency of embryo production, <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for traits such as number of oocytes (NoO) and number of MOET embryos (NoM) can help in selection of donors with high MOET or OPU efficiency. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to estimate variance components and (<b>genomic)</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for NoO and NoM based on Dutch Holstein data. Furthermore, a 10 -fold cross-validation was carried out to assess the accuracy of pedigree and <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for NoO and NoM. For NoO, 40, 734 OPU sessions between 1993 and 2015 were analyzed. These OPU sessions originated from 2, 543 donors, from which 1, 144 were genotyped. For NoM, 35, 695 sessions between 1994 and 2015 were analyzed. These MOET sessions originated from 13, 868 donors, from which 3, 716 were genotyped. Analyses were done using only pedigree information and using a single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) approach combining genomic information and pedigree information. Heritabilities were very similar based on pedigree information or based on ssGBLUP [i. e., 0. 32 (standard error = 0. 03) for NoO and 0. 21 (standard error = 0. 01) for NoM with pedigree, 0. 31 (standard error = 0. 03) for NoO, and 0. 22 (standard error = 0. 01) for NoM with ssGBLUP]. For animals without their own information as mimicked in the cross-validation, the accuracy of pedigree-based <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> was 0. 46 for NoO and NoM.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the accuracy of imputation from LD (7 K) to 54 K panel and compared accuracy of genomic prediction {{with or without the}} X chromosome information, based on data of Nordic Holstein bulls. Beagle and Findhap were used for imputation. Averaged over two imputation datasets, the allele correct rates of imputation using Findhap were 98. 2 % for autosomal markers, 89. 7 % for markers on the pseudo autosomal region of the X chromosome, and 96. 4 % for X-specific markers. The allele correct rates were 98. 9 %, 91. 2 % and 96. 8 %, respectively, when using Beagle. Genomic predictions were carried out for 15 traits based on 54 K marker data, imputed 54 K for test animals, and imputed 54 K for half of reference animals. GBLUP models with or without residual polygenic effect were used for genomic prediction. For all three data sets, genomic prediction using all markers gave slightly higher reliability than prediction excluding the X chromosome. Averaged over 15 traits, the gains in reliability from the X chromosome ranged from 0. 3 % to 0. 5 % points among the three data sets and models. Using a model with a G-matrix accounting for sex-linked relationship appropriately or a model which divided <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> into an autosomal component and an X chromosomal component did not led to better prediction based on the present data where all animals were bulls.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{establish}} a predictive method using whole genome genotyping for early intervention in canine hip dysplasia (CHD) risk management, {{for the prevention}} of the progression of secondary osteoarthritis (OA), and for selective breeding. DesignTwo sets of dogs (six breeds) were genotyped with dense SNPs covering the entire canine genome. The first set contained 359 dogs upon which a predictive formula for <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> (GBV) was derived by using their estimated breeding value (EBV) of the Norberg angle (a measure of CHD) and their genotypes. To investigate how well the formula would work for an individual dog with genotype only (without using EBV), a cross validation was performed by masking the EBV of one dog at a time. The genomic data and the EBV of the remaining dogs were used to predict the GBV for the single dog that was left out. The second set of dogs included 38 new Labrador retriever dogs, which had no pedigree relationship to the dogs in the first set. ResultsThe cross validation showed a strong correlation (R> 0. 7) between the EBV and the GBV. The independent validation showed a moderate correlation (R= 0. 5) between GBV for the Norberg angle and the observed Norberg angle (no EBV was available for the new 38 dogs). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the genomic data were all above 70 %. ConclusionsPrediction of CHD from genomic data is feasible, and can be applied for risk management of CHD and early selection for genetic improvement to reduce the prevalence of CHD in breeding programs. The prediction can be implemented before maturity, at which age current radiographic screening programs are traditionally applied, and as soon as DNA is available...|$|E
40|$|Excessive ambient {{temperature}} and humidity can impair milk production and fertility of dairy cows. Selection for heat-tolerant animals is one possible option to mitigate the effects of heat stress. To enable selection for this trait, we describe {{the development of a}} heat tolerance breeding value for Australian dairy cattle. We estimated the direct genomic values of decline in milk, fat, and protein yield per unit increase of temperature-humidity index (THI) using 46, 726 single nucleotide polymorphisms and a reference population of 2, 236 sires and 11, 853 cows for Holsteins and 506 sires and 4, 268 cows for Jerseys. This new direct genomic value is the Australian <b>genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>value</b> for heat tolerance (HT ABVg). The components of the HT ABVg are the decline in milk, fat, and protein per unit increase in THI when THI increases above the threshold of 60. These components are weighted by their respective economic values, assumed to be equivalent to the weights applied to milk, fat, and protein yield in the Australian selection indices. Within each breed, the HT ABVg is then standardized to have a mean of 100 and standard deviation (SD) of 5, which is consistent with the presentation of breeding values for many other traits in Australia. The HT ABVg ranged from − 4 to + 3 SD in Holsteins and − 3 to + 4 SD in Jerseys. The mean reliabilities of HT ABVg among validation sires, calculated from the prediction error variance and additive genetic variance, were 38 % in both breeds. The range in ABVg and their reliability suggests that HT can be improved using genomic selection. There has been a deterioration in the genetic trend of HT, and to moderate the decline it is suggested that the HT ABVg should be included in a multitrait economic index with other traits that contribute to farm profit...|$|E

MethodsPhenotypes {{used in this study}} were categorical data. Blood was pooled strategically aiming at even pool sizes and within sex and phenotype category. A hybrid genomic relationship matrix was constructed relating pools to sires. This matrix was used to determine the contribution of sires to each of the pools and therefore phenotype category by using a simple regression approach. <b>Genomic</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> were also estimated using the hybrid genomic relationship matrix. ResultsWe demonstrated that, using pooled DNA, the genetic performance of sires can be illustrated as their contribution to phenotype categories and can be expressed as a regression coefficient. <b>Genomic</b> estimated <b>breeding</b> <b>values</b> for sires were equivalent to the regression coefficients and are a commonly used industry tool.
