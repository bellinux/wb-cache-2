40|$|Asian social {{psychology}} begins with relational conceptions of human existence.

40|$|AbstractThe {{public space}} {{is a social}} capital and it becomes an {{important}} part of society, which can promote social cohesion and prevent further fragmentation and atomization of the society (Madanipour, 2003). When the privatization of the public space has blurred between the existence of public and private spaces; especially semi-public and semi-private spaces; so some people realize that public space is not so public. Madurese urban kampong in Surabaya is a social urban ecosystem that has unique characteristics; it is suspected to become a place that produced ambiguous spaces in the modern city era. However there are important questions regarding to the issue; that is: how is the organization of public space and it transformation process.

40|$|International audienceThe present {{research}} examined how construal level and social motivation interact in influencing individuals' behavior in social decision making settings by testing two competing hypotheses. The "increased pro-sociality" hypothesis predicts that high construal level should promote a pro-social motivation {{and therefore a}} constructive approach to conflict. In contrast, the "increased value-behavior correspondence" hypothesis predicts that under high construal level individuals' behavior {{is based on the}} motivation endorsed, no matter whether pro-social or pro-self. Two experiments involving ultimatum game (exp. 1) and face to face negotiation (exp. 2) supported the "increased value-behavior correspondence" hypothesis by showing that prosocials were more cooperatives and proselfs were more competitive under high rather than low construal level. <b>Implication</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> decision making and research on psychological distance are discussed...|$|R
