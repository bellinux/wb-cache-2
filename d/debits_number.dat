50|$|Android Pay takes {{advantage}} of physical authentications such as fingerprint ID where available. On devices without fingerprint ID, Android Pay is activated with a passcode. When the user makes a payment to a merchant, Android Pay does not send the credit or <b>debit</b> card <b>number</b> with the payment. Instead it generates a virtual account number representing the user's account information. This service keeps customer payment information private, sending a one-time security code instead of the card or user details.|$|R

He was able to purchase an ATM for $750.00 US on Craigslist.org, then program and deploy the retail ATM without any red tape or paperwork registration. The ATM also contained over 1000 credit and <b>debit</b> card <b>numbers.</b> Reports of security concerns and Siciliano's access to information retained on the ATM began turning up on the Web, and the ATM industry reportedly braced itself for the backlash.|$|R

This happens every day, and the information is for sale in electronic markets.

Identity theft has been a feature of financial markets for as long as alternatives have existed to cash transactions. Until recently, it occurred on a small scale, involving, for example, the theft of personal checks and the forging of the account holder’s signature to cash them. That type of identity theft posed a risk to the individual consumer, and the risk was relatively small: Access to the consumer’s personal checks did not offer access to all of the consumer’s financial accounts. Such individualized acts of identity theft still occur, but more often identity theft occurs on a larger scale. Data breaches typically involv...|$|R
