Three dimensional mapping was carried out in 4 beagle dogs with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) induced by repetitive (every 10 minutes) doses of cesium chloride (CsCI, 1 mmo/lkg i. v.). Bradycardia was produced by radiofrequency ablation of the AV node. Bipolar left and right ventricular electrograms were simultaneously recorded from 240 endo-, epi- and intramyocardial sites through 60 pins containing 4 bipolar electrodes each (interelectrode distance 2 mm, <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>pins</b> 10 – 15 mm). One (3 dogs) or two (1 dog/ doses of CsCI produced various episodes of PVT, nine of which were analyzed (6. 8 ± 2. 7 consecutive beats). PVT originated from various left (n= 3) or right (n= 6) ventricular endocardial sites. Slow conduction or conduction block was not evident, total ventricular activation time during consecutive beats was 75 ± 12 msec. Initiation and continuation of PVT appeared to be exclusively due to focal mechanisms. Three different activation patterns were observed: (1) Changing foci from beat to beat, with variable coupling intervals (n= 2); (2) Two competing endocardial foci firing at variable rates (n= 3); (3) Periodically changing foci, replacing each other after gradual slowing of respective intrinsic rates (n= 4) ConclusionsCompatible with triggered activity elicited in Purkinje fibers, CsCI induced PVT demonstrate a focal activation pattern with an endocardial site of earliest activation.

40|$|In part I, a {{numerical}} {{study of the}} mixed states in a mesoscopic type-II superconducting cylinder is described. Steady-state configurations and transient behavior of the magnetic vortices for various values of the applied magnetic field H are presented. Transitions between different multi-vortex states as H is changed is demonstrated by abrupt changes in vortex configurations and jumps in the B vs H plot. An efficient scheme to determine the equilibrium vortex configuration in a mesoscopic system at any given applied field, {{not limited to the}} symmetry of the system, is devised and demonstrated. In part II, a superconducting thin film is subject to a non-uniform magnetic field from a vertical magnetic dipole, consisting of two magnetic monopoles of opposite charges. For a film with constant thickness and with no pins, it has been found that the film carries two pairs of vortex-antivortex in the steady state in the imposed flux range of 2. 15 < (Phi) + < 2. 90 (in units of flux quantum) and no vortex at all for (Phi) + <= 2. 15. Transitions from a superconducting state with 3 pairs of vortex-antivortex to one with 2 pairs, where a pair of vortex-antivortex annihilates, have been observed in the pseudo-time sequence. With a perturbation with antidots (holes), vortexantivortex pair has been created for lower magnetic fluxes down to (Phi) + = 1. 3. In the sample of size 16 (Xi) x 16 (Xi), the attraction force between the vortex and antivortex always dominates over the pinning force, so that they eventually come out of pins, move toward each other, and annihilate each other. The annihilation rate, measured with time taken for the annihilation, is reduced noticeably by the increase of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>pins,</b> or the increase in the pin size. A simulation of the magnetic vortex pinning in the sample of size 32 (Xi) x 32 (Xi) suggests we are likely to achieve pinning of the vortex-antivortex pair with the sample size around this and vortex-antivortex separation of 22 (Xi). Using this sample as a template, the maximum density of pinned vortices achievable is calculates to be about 7. 6 x 10 ^ 14 vortices/m 2 for (Xi) =~ 1. 6 A?...|$|E

In this theory the damping of dislocations between obstacles is taken to be very small and the mobile dislocations overshoot their static equilibrium position.

This work reports the elastic and anelastic characterization of the materials carried out by internal friction (IF) and dynamic modulus experiments. IF spectra of HIP and RDB composites are similar.

Long-term isothermal tests performed at different temperatures evidenced a progressive increase of the dynamic modulus E and decrease of the damping factor Q- 1 : higher the temperature greater the variation.

40|$|The {{magnetization}} relaxation in type-II superconductors is modelled by a thermally assisted two-dimensional sandpile model. The model {{reveals a}} distinct correlation effect, or {{the effect of}} flux avalanche in the initial stage of relaxation from the Bean critical state. The effective energy Ueff(J) ≡ -kT ln|dJ/d| where J is the current density, is n in this regime although the activation energy U(J) assumed beforehand is linear. The extracted scaling exponent α ≈ 0. 5 (noticeably robust against different temperatures), which characterizes the current density dependence of the linear size of the avalanche cluster with l ≈ (1 - J Jc 0) -α, is in rough agreement with the theoretical estimation. As the system is driven away from the Bean critical state, flux avalanche plays less and less a role since the linear size of the characteristic avalanche cluster meets the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pinning</b> centers, and the usual logarithmic decay of the Anderson-Kim model is recovered. It is argued from further analysis that the scaling behavior together with the exponent α = 0. 5 is a univeral feature of the present model, irrespectively of the linear or nonlinear details of the U(J) function, or equivalently the underlying pinning mechanism.

J. van der Beek et al., Phys. Rev. B 66, 024523 (2002) ]. Widely varying critical current values for nominally similar compositions show that flux pinning is of extrinsic origin. Vortex configurations, imaged using the Bitter decoration method, show less density fluctuations than those previously observed in charge-doped Ba(Fe_ 1 -xCo_x) _ 2 As_ 2 single crystals. Analysis reveals that the pinning force and -energy distributions depend on the P-content x. However, they are always much narrower than in Ba(Fe_ 1 -xCo_x) _ 2 As_ 2, a result that is attributed to the weaker temperature dependence of the superfluid density on approaching T_c in BaFe_ 2 (As_ 1 -xP_x) _ 2. Critical current density measurements and pinning force distributions independently yield a mean <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> effective <b>pinning</b> centers L̅∼ 90 nm, increasing with increasing P-content x.

The bending force caused by the shear stress is opposed by the line tension of the dislocation, which acts on each end of the dislocation along the direction of the dislocation line away from A and B with a magnitude of , where G is the shear modulus. If the dislocation bends, the ends of the dislocation make an angle with the horizontal between A and B, which gives the line tensions acting along the ends a vertical component acting directly against the force induced by the shear stress. If sufficient shear stress is applied and the dislocation bends, the vertical component from the line tensions, which acts directly against the force caused by the shear stress, grows as the dislocation approaches a semicircular shape. When the dislocation becomes a semicircle, all of the line tension is acting against the bending force induced by the shear stress, because the line tension is perpendicular to the horizontal between A and B. For the dislocation to reach this point, it is thus evident that the equation: ...|$|R
