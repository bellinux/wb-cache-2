40|$|Summary. This paper {{examines}} four selected {{consequences of}} private market revitalization in 12 neighborhoods in six US ~i ies. The analysis {{reveals that the}} physical quality of properties has been improved significantly, property assessments have increased substantially, and <b>the</b> investment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> properties by newcomers to <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> has encouraged original owners to improve their properties <b>in</b> one-third of <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> studied. However, <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> assessed values generally has lagged far behind increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{market value of the}} properties. Reinvestment also appears to have generated negative consequences. Many of <b>the</b> renters living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> prior to <b>the</b> start of reinvestment, many of whom had a low socioeconomic status, may have been displaced. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> assessed value of properties owned by persons living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> prior to revitalization and not improved during revitalization increased as a result of <b>the</b> changes occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> <b>The</b> percentage increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assessed value of these properties was not significantly less than the increase for properties improved by newcomers...|$|R

5|$|The Pulaski station spurred {{commercial}} {{development in the}} Archer Heights neighborhood. Area development began even before the station opened, as the Midway Square shopping mall opened at Pulaski Road and 51st Street in 1988 {{in anticipation of the}} potential customers the Orange Line would bring. The station's opening continued the trend of development, and Pulaski station was credited with boosting business in Archer Heights and doubling property values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> The station also created a parking problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> The station's parking lot filled up as early as 7 A.M. most workdays, causing commuters to park on residential streets. The commuters prompted local residents to ban non-residents from parking on certain streets during daytime hours.|$|E

A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, only funding light rail from the University District to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed.

For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E
