40|$|In vitro steroid biogenesis {{by human}} polycystic ovaries has been {{investigated}} in four patients. Aliquots from each ovarian homogenate were incubated in virto with tritiated pregnenolone, dehydroepiandro-sterone and androstenedione. Labeled metabolites were isolated and identified by crystallizations to constant S. A. The general pattern of steroid metabolism in those four cases {{is very similar to}} that reported from incubations of normal ovarian tissue. It should be noticed particularly that significant amounts of oestrone and oestradiol were recovered from each incubation, whatever the substrate. This <b>finding</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> with a lack of aromatization, therefore it is suggested that such enzyme deficiencies in the polycystic ovaries are not so common as it is generally assumed in the literature. A ratio of oestrone to oestradiol lower than one was observed in most of the polycystic ovary incubations, whereas in normal ovaries that ratio is usualy higher than one. That trend is the only descrepancy that is suggested by the comparison between normal and polycystic ovaries. However, such difference could be the result rather than the origin of the menstrual cycle disturbance. © 1977. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Multifocal ERG (mfERG) and {{multifocal}} VEP (mfVEP) {{have been}} used widely {{in the investigation of}} pathological changes or functional variations in the visual system. Altitudinal hemifield loss is a visual field defect that is usually found in patients with ischaemic optic neuropathy (ION). Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION) is a complex multi-factorial disease {{and it is difficult to}} diagnose according to clinical symptoms and signs alone. AION is believed to be caused by an infarction of the optic nerve due to the occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries. The current report presents a patient diagnosed with non-arteritic AION. In this report, the mfERG <b>findings</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> the results of the visual field test but those of the mfVEP did. After consideration of the visual electrophysiological and visual field results, the defect arises from neither the retina nor the visual pathway behind the optic chiasma.

A precise morphologic imaging assessment, along with clinical and histopathologic findings, is important for distinguishing patients with PH from those with congenital PSSs, which require different therapeutic approach. Expected findings in patients with PH are presence of ascites, multiple APSS, and a confirmed cause of portal flow obstruction.

Objective: To determine the prevalence of respiratory diseases in agate grinding workers and the associated factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 170 agate grinding workers from Mashhad, northeastern Iran, were examined. Medical and occupational history for respiratory illnesses was taken using respiratory questionnaire of the national program of silicosis control, lung examination, spirometry and chest radiography. Chest x-rays were interpreted according to the International Labor Office (ILO) classification system, 2000. Results: The mean±SD of age and work duration {{of the participants were}} 31. 2 ± 10. 1 and 13 ± 8. 2 years, respectively. The prevalence of silicosis among agate workers was 12. 9 % (95 % CI: 7. 9 %– 18. 0 %); 18 workers had simple and 4 had complicated silicosis. There was a significant (p< 0. 05) relationship between contracting silicosis and exposure duration. 20 (11. 7 %) workers had symptoms consistent with chronic bronchitis and 8 (4. 7 %) showed asthma and asthma-like symptoms. The most frequent disorder observed in spirometry was the restrictive pattern (n= 43, 30 %).

Obstructive uropathies represent the major part of fetal urologic abnormalities. Methods: The retrospective study included a group of neonates in whom isolated obstructive uropathies were found and consequently studied in Tertiary Ultrasound Center at the Department of Perinatology in Ljubljana since January 2002 to December 2006. The types and frequencies of isolated obstructive uropathies were described, the findings before and after birth were compared and the positive predictive value of sonographic measurement was calculated. Results: 52 neonates, all singletons, were included. The group consisted of 32 (61. 5 %) boys and 20 (38 %) girls. There were 21 pyelectasies and 8 hydronephroses. The findings matched completely in 22 (42. 3 %) cases and partially in 28 (53. 8 %) cases. In 2 (3. 8 %) cases the <b>findings</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>match.</b> We found spontaneous improvement after birth in 18 (62. 1 %) cases.

Conclusions: Sonographic examination of the fetal urinary tract has a good positive predictive value (82. 7 %). Obstructive uropathies appear more often in boys (61. 5 %). The clinical course is better in boys as spontaneous improvement of isolated renal pelvis dilatation occurs in 77. 8 % of boys and 36. 4 % of girls. Mostly only one or two sonographic follow-up examinations in the third trimester of pregnancy are sufficient. Karyotyping is not necessary with isolated obstructive uropathies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background tmRNA acts {{first as}} a tRNA and then as an mRNA to rescue stalled ribosomes in eubacteria. Two {{unanswered}} questions about tmRNA function remain: how does tmRNA, lacking an anticodon, bypass the decoding machinery and enter the ribosome? Secondly, how does the ribosome choose the proper codon to resume translation on tmRNA? According to the - 1 triplet hypothesis, the answer to both questions lies in the unique properties of the three nucleotides upstream of the first tmRNA codon. These nucleotides assume an A-form conformation that mimics the codon-anticodon interaction, leading to recognition by the decoding center and choice of the reading frame. The - 1 triplet hypothesis {{is important because it}} is the most credible model in which direct binding and recognition by the ribosome sets the reading frame on tmRNA. Results Conformational analysis predicts that 18 triplets cannot form the correct structure to function as the - 1 triplet of tmRNA. We tested the tmRNA activity of all possible - 1 triplet mutants using a genetic assay in Escherichia coli. While many mutants displayed reduced activity, our <b>findings</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> the predictions of this model. Additional mutagenesis identified sequences further upstream that are required for tmRNA function. An immunoblot assay for translation of the tmRNA tag revealed that certain mutations in U 85, A 86, and the - 1 triplet sequence result in improper selection of the first codon and translation in the wrong frame (- 1 or + 1) in vivo. Conclusion Our findings disprove the - 1 triplet hypothesis. The - 1 triplet is not required for accommodation of tmRNA into the ribosome, although it plays a minor role in frame selection. Our results strongly disfavor direct ribosomal recognition of the upstream sequence, instead supporting a model in which the binding of a separate ligand to A 86 is primarily responsible for frame selection. </p...|$|R
40|$|There is sex-difference {{in humans}} as regards aerobic efficiency, {{physical}} {{strength and endurance}} and the sex difference is greatly dependent upon differential concentration of testosterone during different phases of growth and development including the intrauterine phase or prenatal growth. Second-to-fourth digit lengths ratio (2 D: 4 D) is an putative indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure. Lower 2 D: 4 D indicates higher prenatal testosterone exposure and vice versa. Males generally have lower 2 D: 4 D than females. This cross-sectional study investigated {{the relationship between the}} fitness measures and 2 D: 4 D in young adult Polish males. The study included 118 Polish male students first course in General Kościuszko Military Academy of Land Forces in Wroclaw. Their mean (+SD) age was 20. 4 (+ 1. 60) years. Eurofit test set was employed to assess physical fitness. Apart from height, weight, second and fourth digit lengths, hand grip strength was also measured by a standard isometric dynamometer. The study showed a weak relationship between 2 D: 4 D of right hand and results of physical fitness tests. The smaller was the 2 D: 4 D, the better was the result of endurance and strength tests. This finding was in accord with reports by other studies, indicating that individuals with smaller 2 D: 4 D tend to perform better in these aspects of physical ability. However, we also found an opposite relationship with the results to agility tests. Male students with higher 2 D: 4 D scored better in 5 x 10 meters shuttle run.

MOOs are Internet-based virtual worlds in which {{people from all over the}} real world meet for synchronous textual conversations and can interact with asynchronous textual objects found there. Students who enjoy a MOO site may identify with its virtual target language community and find integrative motivation which the literature suggests is necessary for advanced language acquisition. This study focused on the affective nature of MOO. An experimental group of Israeli high school EFL (English as a Foreign Language) students experienced 12 academic hours at schMOOze University, a MOO site for students of English as a Second/Foreign Language. A control group employed normal EFL procedures, including reading comprehension passages, taped songs, class discussions, and grammar exercises. Using pretest and posttest questionnaires, participants indicated their anxiety about and motivation towards various EFL procedures and English class in general. (Motivation was divided into course-specific subconstructs: interest, relevance, expectation of success, and satisfaction.) The findings demonstrated some significantly positive attitudes towards using MOO as an EFL procedure, particularly for male students and those who felt proficient with computers. Nevertheless, the <b>findings</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> the enthusiasm found in various position papers about MOO in Second/Foreign Language instruction.

In view of the direct effect of the working methods on the quality of data in the laboratory, quality control of data and results in the Biochemistry Ward of Laboratory includes taking into account all the factors and variables relating to all the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical steps at this ward. The objective of this study was to examine the quality control of data and results in the biochemistry departments of hospital laboratories in universities of medical sciences in Tehran. Current study was a descriptive research, and 40 biochemistry laboratories in universities of medical sciences in Tehran constituted the settings of the study. Data were collected by a checklist and a questionnaire using observation and interview. Using the checklist, 33 effective factors in the pre-analytical step; 18 effective factors in the analytical step and 8 effective factors in post-analytical step were examined. The questionnaire included questions relating to biochemical factors in the laboratories, while the factors affecting the quality of the results were examined by using checklist. Data from questions and observations were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and by determining the absolute and relative frequencies. Results showed that in all settings of the study, 58 %, 68 % and 87 % of the factors affecting the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical data and results were taken into consideration respectively. However, the biochemistry directors remarked that they considered 77 % and 89 % of the first two groups of factors respectively, and the third groups of factors were considered only by observation. according to the findings by the checklists, sufficient attention was paid to 58 % of the factors effective on pre-analytical data quality (Identifying the patient; Labeling the sample while collecting the sample; etc.), 68 % of the factors effective on analytical data quality (Analyzing the samples during the 1 to 4 hours following the collection of the samples; Using control samples for evaluating the operation of instruments once in every 8 hours; etc.) and 87 % of the factors effective on the post-analytical data quality (Legibility of the hand-written reports; Similarity of the hand-written reports to the typewritten report, in terms of patient ID data record; etc.) while there is no enough attention paid to other factors in pre-analytical step (Preparing the patient; Paying attention to the physiological changes of the patient’s body; etc.), analytical step (availability of written guidelines for performing certain work where the samples are analyzed; Calibrating the instruments according to the standard program; etc.) and post-analytical step (precision in recording distinguishing features in real values).

This gender gap remained remarkably robust and constant when other learner characteristics were taken into account, such as education, age of arrival, length of residence and hours studying Dutch. For reading and listening skills in Dutch, no gender gap was found.

40|$|Background: Jiangsu Province is an {{economically}} booming area in East China, where soil zinc concentrations are low. Nutrition {{transition to a}} dietary pattern with more animal source foods may have improved zinc intake in this area. However, such a transition may also have increased the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as hypertension and obesity. Investigation of dietary patterns in relation to undernutrition and overnutrition could help to better address both problems. Objectives: The first aim of this thesis was to assess zinc status in Jiangsu Province using dietary zinc intake, serum zinc and stunting as indicators, as well to investigate the potential of biofortified rice to improve zinc intake. The second aim {{was to investigate the}} association between dietary patterns and high blood pressure, taking obesity into account. Methods: Data from the 2002 National Nutrition and Health Survey in Jiangsu Province were used to assess zinc intake in the population aged 4 - 89 years (n= 3, 867). Primary school children (n= 2, 268) were selected from three counties in the Province with relatively low soil zinc for assessment of stunting. Serum zinc was measured among children in the county where stunting was highest (n= 297).   Thirteen women were recruited in the same county for three test rounds with rice meals (zinc biofortified rice, zinc extruded fortified rice and control rice). Fractional zinc absorption (FAZ) was measured {{with the use of the}} double isotope tracer ratio method. Effect of biofortified rice with zinc, at a level of 2. 7 and 3. 8 mg/ 100 g, on zinc intake was simulated in adults (n= 2. 819). For adults, four distinct dietary patterns were identified, named “traditional”, “Macho”, “sweet tooth” and “healthy” pattern. Associations were assessed between the four dietary patterns and blood pressure in adults (n= 2, 518) by using Poisson regression analysis. Results: The overall prevalence of insufficient intake of zinc was 22. 9 %, with a higher prevalence in children (64. 6 %) and adolescents (64. 9 %), and in those with low socio-economic status (27. 3 %). Around 4 % of the primary school children were stunted, and the prevalence of zinc deficiency measured by serum and hair zinc was 0. 7 %, and 15. 2 %, respectively. Biofortified 70 Zn enriched rice with an intrinsic label was found to have higher fractional zinc absorption (FAZ) than extrinsically labeled fortified extruded rice. However, FAZ could not be accurately quantified because we could not determine the exact amount of isotope infused to subjects due to adhesion of zinc to the vial. When simulating zinc intake by replacing normal rice with zinc biofortified rice with either 2. 7 and 3. 8 mg/ 100 g of zinc, the prevalence of insufficient zinc intake decreased from 15. 4 % to 6. 5 % and 4. 4 %, respectively. The “traditional” dietary pattern in Jiangsu Province was most strongly associated with high blood pressure (P for trend = 0. 005). This pattern is characterized primarily by consumption of rice and fresh vegetable; secondary of pork and fish; and lastly of root vegetable and wheat flour, but also by high salt intake. Subjects with overweight and obesity were more likely to have high blood pressure than those with normal weight. Conclusion: Children and adolescents had low dietary zinc intake, in Jiangsu Province, where the soil is also deficient in zinc. However, these <b>findings</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> with the low prevalence of stunting and zinc deficiency based on serum zinc concentrations in primary school children from three rural areas of the Province. Zinc appears to be better absorbed from biofortified rice than from control rice or from extruded fortified rice, which needs further investigation. Simulated zinc intake from biofortified rice with zinc at a level of 2. 7 mg/kg has the potential to significantly improve zinc intake, especially in the “traditional” dietary pattern. However, this pattern is also related to high blood pressure, which may be due to high salt intake. High blood pressure is also positively and independently related to obesity. Nutrition education is required to improve knowledge and awareness of healthy diets in Jiangsu Province.  ...|$|R
40|$|This project uses corpus {{linguistics}} and geostatistics to {{test the}} sociolinguistic typological theory put forward by Peter Trudgill {{on the history of}} Norwegian. The theory includes several effects of societal factors on language change. Most discussed is the proposal that ‘intensive’ language contact causes simplification of language grammar. In the Norwegian case, the claim is that simplificatory changes which affected all of the Continental North Germanic languages (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian) but not the Insular North Germanic Languages were the result of contact with Middle Low German through the Hanseatic League. This suggests that those simplificatory changes arose in the centres of contact with the Hanseatic League: cities with Hansa trading posts and kontors. The size of the dataset required would have made it impossible for previous scholars to test this prediction, but digital approaches render the problem tractable. I have designed a 3. 5 m word corpus containing nearly all extant Middle Norwegian, and developed statistical methods for examining the spread of language phenomena in time and space. 	The project is made up of a series of case studies of changes. Three examine simplifying phonological changes: the rise of svarabhakti (epenthetic) vowels, the change of /hv/ > /kv/ and the loss of the voiceless dental fricative. A further three look at simplifying morphological changes: the loss of 1. sg. verbal agreement, the loss of lexical genitives and the loss of 1. pl. verbal agreement. In each case study a large dataset from many documents is collected and used to map the progression of the change in space and time. The social background of document signatories is also used to map the progression of the change through different social groups. 	A variety of different patterns emerge for the different changes examined. Some changes spread by contagious diffusion, but many spread by hierarchical diffusion, jumping first between cities before spreading to the country at large. One common theme which runs through much of the findings is that dialect contact within the North Germanic language area seems to have played a major role: many of the different simplificatory changes may first have spread into Norwegian from Swedish or Danish. Although these <b>findings</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> exactly <b>match</b> the simple predictions originally proposed from the sociolinguistic typological theory, they are potentially consistent with a more nuanced account in which the major centres of contact and so simplifying change were in Sweden and Denmark rather than Norway.

40|$|Due {{to memory}} loss, {{most people with}} {{dementia}} are increasingly disorientated in space, time, and identity, which causes profound feelings of insecurity, anxiety and homelessness. The built environment is expected to hold great potential for offering support in coping with the challenges resulting from disorientation. However, adequate architectural design knowledge is still lacking. Exploratory meetings with professional architects suggest that most research <b>findings</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> their approach to designing architecture for people with dementia. The aim of this PhD research is offering architects insights into the experiences of people with dementia to broaden knowledge on architectural design for them. The central research question is: how could architecture support or hinder people with dementia in orientating in space-time-identity? A novel approach is developed to inscribe this PhD research in current emancipatory discourses on housing and caring for people with dementia, and to bring the findings closer to the discipline of architecture. Starting epistemologically from a constructionist approach and theoretically from a phenomenological perspective, being oriented in space-time-identity is considered as having a sense of oneself situated within a spatial, temporal and social framework. The research is built up around three case studies: two private housing settings, and one residential care facility {{with a focus on}} three of its residents. In each case study ethnographic techniques are combined with an architectural analysis. The first case study highlights how architecture can support a person with dementia in orientating by accommodating places for privacy and togetherness, as well as places and objects for everyday activities. The everydayness of such places and objects, the case study suggests, can counter the alienating experience of being disoriented. This {{is important to keep in}} mind when designing residential care facilities, which only with great difficulty manage to transform their hospital-like character into the everydayness ofnbsp;environments. In the second case, the person with dementia finds support in creating ‘little worlds’, spaces that are narrow enough to provide a sheltering environment and that offer personal places where belongings are ready-to-hand. Also paramount is the importance of order, of creating spaces wide and light enough in which to move, rdquo; and think clearly. Unlike the tendency to associate architecture for people with dementia with traditional and primeval housing types, this suggests that they might as well benefit from architectural qualities often found in contemporary housing. Case study three reveals different ways in which people with dementia use and experience the same built environment. This study also highlights important challenges in designing architecture that supports orientation in the context of a residential carenbsp;articulating boundaries between different spatial entities and domains, articulating facets of residents’ lives, and taking into account the spatial aspect of social interaction. Together, the case studies show that architecture can support people with dementia in coping with the challenges of disorientation by articulating their relation to places, people, and their history, both on a smaller and larger scale. The smaller scale concerns the design of strategic places that allow people to be occupied with a daily life activity in a comfortable, more or less active way, and an architectural context that facilitates support from other people. On the larger scale, and particularly in case of a large and complex program of a residential care facility, it is important to consider to what extent the architecture reflects the presence of an overarching care organization and its logistic requirements, or also other facets of residents’ lives. Other points of attention are the social dynamics of people living together and the design of shared spaces and facilities. In this way, architectural design for people with dementia transcends the specificities of this group and includes a broader architectural program than – to put it bluntly – merely filling out theldquo;details” of projects that have been set in stone already to a great extent. The case studies give voice to people with dementia and provide insights into their experiences in a format that allows architects to develop affinity with their perspective. For care givers, this PhD research shows (part of) the repertoire that architects possess to design architecture for people with dementia. By linking insights into living with dementia with architects’ “core business” of form and spatial organization, this PhD research could enhance dialogues between architects and their clients, and broaden their view on possible roles of architecture in the daily lives of people with dementia.

Ao estabelecer a educação infantil como primeira etapa da educação básica, a Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Brasileira, Lei nº 9394 / 96, estabelece que a criança deve ser respeitada como cidadã, sujeito de direitos. Esta lei é incisiva em preconizar formação superior para o profissional que atua nesse nível de educação, apontando, assim, para exigências teóricas, profissionais que a educação das crianças requer. Neste contexto, elegemos as questões desta pesquisa: Que significados de educação infantil marcam o discurso de professoras e de famílias usuárias de creches? Que relações são apontadas entre ser mulher, ser mãe, ser professora de crianças de 0 a 6 anos? Estas perguntas se traduzem no objetivo da pesquisa: analisar significados que educadores e famílias usuárias de creches dão à educação infantil. A pesquisa molda-se como um estudo de caso, com abordagem qualitativa, realizado em uma creche estadual em Campina Grande-PB. Participaram da pesquisa dez professoras e dez integrantes de famílias usuárias da respectiva creche. Os dados foram coletados através de documentos oficiais, questionários e entrevistas, no período de outubro a dezembro de 2006. Os discursos foram analisados através da Análise de Conteúdo. Através do discurso das professoras e de famílias usuárias de creches, constatamos que a docência na educação infantil ainda envolve aspectos indicadores do assistencialismo marcante no final do século XIX e início do século XX, nessa atividade, época em que o profissional que lidava com as crianças eram cuidadoras ou crecheiras, sob o princípio da custódia. Para as professoras entrevistadas, a formação acadêmica para a educação infantil parece ser pouco significativa, contrariante à maternagem, que se mostrou norteadora de todo o processo educativo na creche onde trabalham. Esta referência se articula à idéia da educadora nata e a estereótipos que naturalizam atributos femininos. Os discursos de professoras e usuários da creche pesquisada parecem significar uma nova versão do que defendiam os conservadores, higienistas e religiosos do passado. Apreendemos, também, uma recorrente improvisação de professoras na creche pesquisada, o que leva a inferir descaso com educação infantil. Os parâmetros oficiais de qualidade para educação infantil e a prática dessa atividade estão em contradição. The current {{demands for}} education child coming of new educational policies, are causing heated {{discussions on the}} significance of this level of education and the new attitude of educators before the child integral development, proposed by a specific legislation. And in establishing the early childhood education as the first stage of basic education, the Law on Basic Education and the National Educational Guidelines and Brazilian Framework, Law no. 9394 / 96 establishes, too, that the child, at this level of education, must be respected as a citizen, subject of rights. this law is incisive, also, in advocating specific training for teacher who works at this level of education, pointing to requirements theoretical, profissonals that education of children requires. In this context, we elected the questions of this research: What meanings of early childhood education mark the speech of teachers and nurseries users families? What are relations between being identified, woman, mother, teachers for children from 0 to 6 years? These questions give meaning to the objective of the research: to examine meanings that educators and families users of nurseries will provide early childhood education. The search shapes as a case study, with qualitative approach, held in a State Nursery of Campina Grande-PB. The speeches were analyzed by analysis of Content. Took part in the reasearch ten teachers and ten users of the respective nursery. The data were collected through official documents, questionnaries and interviews. The search has seen, through the speech of teachers and families users of day care, that teaching in early childhood education also involves aspects that link the welfarism striking of the nineteenth century, this activity when the professional who deals with children were the "carers "or" nursery helpers, "with the principle to custody. For teachers, the academic training of vocational education child appears to be minor, and the motherhood the guiding point to the whole education process at the nursery where they work This reinforces or embodies the idea of "educator born": the wife / mother / teacher, or a child education shaped the shadow {{of the house and the}} teacher / parent. The speeches of teachers and users of the nursery searched, seem to mean a new version of the speeches of the conservatives, hygienists, religious. It was observed, the improvisation of teachers in this institution, which leads to an understanding of the disregard with this level of education. These <b>findings,</b> unfortunately, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>match</b> the parameters of quality education for children...|$|R
