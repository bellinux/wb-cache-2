40|$|Introduction Health assistants are {{important}} functionaries {{of the primary}} {{health care system in}} India. Their role is supervision of field-based services among other things. A quality assurance mechanism for these health assistants is lacking. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of developing a tool to assess the quality of health assistants in primary health centres (PHCs) and to assess their quality using this tool. Methodology Health assistants from three PHCs in the Wardha district of India were observed for a year using a tool developed from primary health care management Aavancement program modules. Data was collected by direct observation, interview, and review of records for quality of activities. Results Staff strength of health assistants was 87. 5 %. None of the health assistants were clear about their <b>job</b> <b>descriptions.</b> A supervisory <b>schedule</b> for providing supportive supervision to auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) was absent; most field activities pertaining to maternal and child health received poor focus. Monthly meetings lacked a clear agenda, and comments on quality improvement of services provided by the ANMs were missing. Conclusion Continuous training with sensitization on quality issues is required to improve the unsatisfactory quality...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to develop the {{theoretical}} bases for the classification and coding of economic information and the scientific justification {{of the content of}} information resources of an electronic commerce enterprise. The essence of information resources for management of electronic business entities is investigated. It is proved that the organization of accounting in e-commerce systems is advisable to be built on the basis of two circuits: accounting for financial flows and accounting associated with transformation of business factors in products and services as a result of production activities. There presented a sequence of accounting organization that allows to combine the both circuits in a single information system, which provides a possibility for the integrated replenishment and distributed simultaneous use of the e-commerce system by all groups of users. It is proved that the guarantee of efficient activity of the information management system of electronic commerce entities is a proper systematization of the aggregate of information resources on economic facts and operations of an enterprise in accordance with the management tasks by building the hierarchy of accounting nomenclatures. It is suggested to understand nomenclature as an objective, primary information aggregate concerning a certain fact of the economic activity of an enterprise, which is characterized by minimum requisites, is entered into the database of the information system and is to be reflected in the accounting system. It is proposed to build a database of e-commerce systems as a part of directories (constants, personnel, goods / products, suppliers, buyers) and the hierarchy of accounting nomenclatures. The package of documents regulating the organization of accounting at an enterprise should include: the provision on the accounting services, the order on the accounting policy, the <b>job</b> <b>descriptions,</b> the <b>schedules</b> of information exchange, the report card and the schedule for drawing up internal and external reporting forms...|$|R

A qualitative case {{study was conducted in}} order to understand how journalistic <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> and competencies change with digitalization and how these changes are experienced in terms of the quality of working life. The results suggest that changes in <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> can occur in different ways: by transferring tasks from one <b>job</b> <b>description</b> to another, by fusing two or more <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> or by adding new tasks to the traditional <b>job</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Changes in competencies were brought about by the digitalization of production technology, changes in <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> and the emergence of new media and new working practices. The <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> of journalists became more post-bureaucratic, whereas those of editors remained bureaucratic. Especially changes in competencies were experienced as stressful.

It is in the organizations’ interest to understand this phenomenon to make better decisions on how to present <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> in order to achieve qualified applicants and a desirable applicant pool size. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the impact of the quality of information of <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> on a <b>job</b> applicant’s decision to pursue a job. A model is developed to quantify <b>job</b> <b>descriptions.</b> The developed model contains three axes: i) x-axis – <b>job</b> <b>description</b> components, ii) y-axis – information quality dimensions, and iii) z-axis – job industries. This investigation analyzed 127 <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> for students majoring in accounting at the University of Waterloo to determine the relationship between the qualities of different components of the <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> with the corresponding number of applications. The results of this investigation suggest that information quality has a positive impact on job applicants’ decision to pursue a job.

This situation has therefore resulted in inadequate compensation for the incumbents of the position. In addition, the position offers only limited career advancement to these workers. The sum total of these problems has resulted in low morale and dissatisfaction among the workers.
