5|$|The game also {{features}} other modes: Color Edit, a palette swap editor {{that allows the}} player to customize nearly <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters, including buckles and hair; Training, in which a player can practice with (and against) computer-controlled opponents and Arcade, similar to the survival mode featured in other fighting games.|$|E
5|$|Almost <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle {{would be}} managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive {{and could not be}} built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E

5|$|The art {{team also}} spent {{a large amount}} of time on Covenant weaponry, in order to make them {{suitably}} alien yet still recognizable to players. At the same time, the designers wanted all aspects of Covenant technology, especially the vehicles, to act plausibly.

5|$|The {{organisation}} {{was founded}} in 1970 by Brother Jerome Kelly and students of Presentation Brothers College, Cork, {{to deal with the}} social issues of the time.

5|$|Evolution {{influences}} <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{form and}} behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations {{that are the}} outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to manage and}} change <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club, and took the decision to disassemble the club's scouting network to instead focus on local talent in Northumberland and Durham. His only major new signing of the 1974–75 season was Terry Cooper, a former Leeds United teammate. They adapted well to the First Division, finishing in seventh place, but would have finished fourth and qualified for Europe had Derby County not scored a last second goal against them {{on the last day}} of the season.|$|E

5|$|The altered {{bill was}} passed as an Act of Parliament in 1834. It was this act which founded the City of London School, which {{initially}} had around 400pupils. The act gave the Corporation of London {{a duty to}} maintain a school on the Honey Lane Market site and so gave control over almost <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school's running to the Corporation. A committee was also set up to manage the school, with Hale as chairman. Although the committee's powers were initially limited, they gained more control over time as they made important decisions for the school.|$|E
5|$|The game {{kicked off}} on January 1, 1998 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. From the opening kickoff, North Carolina {{dominated}} <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. In the first quarter, the Tar Heels scored 16points, matching {{the total number}} of first-quarter points they had scored in every game of the regular season combined. North Carolina added six points {{in the second and third}} quarters before Tech scored its first points of the game—a 40-yard field goal by kicker Shayne Graham. North Carolina set records for largest bowl game margin of victory, most points scored in a bowl game, and most touchdown passes in a bowl game.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal issues}} of Burger King include several legal {{disputes}} and lawsuits involving the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) as both plaintiff and defendant {{in the years}} since its founding in 1954. These have involved almost <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's operations. Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents, the company's responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences. The company's response to these various issues has drawn praise, scorn, and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original building except for color. Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize <b>every</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game as with And Then There Were None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E
