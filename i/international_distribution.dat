Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on 300, Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen.

Similar to his approach to 300, Snyder used the comic book as a storyboard. Following negotiations, Paramount, which had already spent $7 million in their failed project, earned the rights for <b>international</b> <b>distribution</b> of Watchmen and 25% of the film's ownership.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to bring {{together}} two distinct ensembles of evidence concerning, at macro level, <b>international</b> <b>distributions</b> of incomes and their dynamics, and, at micro level, the size distributions of firms and the properties of their growth rates. We also include an intermediate level of observation, namely the properties of sectoral growth. First, our empirical analysis provides a fresh look at the <b>international</b> <b>distributions</b> of incomes and growth rates by investigating more closely at the relationship between the two entities and the statistical properties of the growth process. Second, we take a first step at identifying those statistical properties which are invariant with respect to the scale of observation (country, sector or firm) and those that are instead scale specific. This exercise puts forward a few major interpretative challenges. ...|$|R
