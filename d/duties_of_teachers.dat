5000|$|In 2004, the German Supreme court {{denied a}} Muslim teacher {{the right to}} wear a {{headscarf}} in class, {{on the basis that}} she had to represent neutrality.

German courts rarely hold the freedom of religious and non-religious belief to be infringed, as freedom of religion is limited by the exertion of other basic rights (and duties) guaranteed by the Grundgesetz.

This paper examines how the efforts <b>of</b> mathematics <b>teacher</b> in educating <b>of</b> character to the students of Basic Education, especially in Junior High School through the application of Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) on the material of Social Arithmetic. Through presenting of the material of Social Arithmetic by RME learning model, students can be given a character education through the attitude of honesty, tolerance, discipline, cooperation, creative, independent, democratic, curiosity, love of peace, social care, responsibility, and so on.
