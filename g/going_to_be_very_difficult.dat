50|$|Kyle College {{was founded}} in 1996 and the concept was {{formulated}} between Mr. D. Jansen and Dr. E. Layard at an informal meeting in February of the same year. There was very wide consultation {{on the idea of}} establishing an Independent secondary School for the Masvingo Region and meetings were held in the Lowveld and the Masvingo areas.The initial plan was to put money into Victoria High School where many of the prominent persons in Masvingo had received their education. The idea did not materialize because the then Victoria High Headmaster advised them that there was very little chance that the school (Victoria High) would change its policy of getting students with very good passes as was the case then. This simply meant that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for some children from Masvingo to get places at the school. Those who were behind the project were advised to start a private school instead of their initial plan of pouring resources into Victoria High. As a follow up to this, there was an undertaking to find out from the residents of Masvingo if the idea of a private school would be a feasible one.|$|E

[...] In the summer of 2009, Jackson was a guest on Sid Roth's It's Supernatural! radio and television program which aired on Trinity Broadcasting Network, The Inspiration Network, GOD TV, Daystar and other regional television stations.

The angel did not tell me about those woes. But there was more emphasis on those woes than almost anything else that I was given."In a more recent web video series called [...] "The Perfect Storm Revisited", Jackson elaborated more on his original message. In this video, he clarified his earlier statements regarding the year 2012.

This was a tremendous opportunity for me and my decision to leave {{had nothing to do with}} the coaching staff or players. I miss my kids and need to be with them.” Coach Kreiner said he was disappointed but was sympathetic to Russell’s choice. “Darnellia’s decision to go back home is an understandable one but also a disappointing one. I had hoped that she would take a little more time to give it more of a chance but we are very happy to have provided her the best opportunity and situation we could for her to achieve her degree while playing at Lakehead University.

5000|$|In 2006 Sarah and Craig {{finally got}} {{together}} {{in what has}} been described as [...] "Shortland Street's Steamiest ever scene." [...] However, the two constantly argued and Craig cheated on Sarah with Huia Samuels (Nicola Kawana), impregnating her. Bartolomei believed Sarah would be devastated when she found out about the child and stated: [...] "He would be aware that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for Sarah but he would tell her {{what he was going to}} do and hope that it was going to work out. I think he will stand back and let things play their natural course, if that meant Sarah was no longer in his world... then so be it. I think he will stand back and say, 'well Sarah, how are you going to behave in this situation? If you are going to behave stupidly then let's call it quits'." [...] The two stayed together following the revelation of the baby but Huia ended up dying in an explosion whilst pregnant and Sarah broke it off once again. At the end of the year, Craig admitted his love before a short holiday but Sarah had a difficult time deciding between him and TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell). Billing described the conundrum, saying: [...] "Sarah is nervous about Craig’s return because she knows that he will be coming back to a situation that will be very different from the one that he left. In a lot of ways Sarah and Craig are still the hero couple but she is scared of him being angry and is worried that she is going to lose him."< Despite Billing labelling the couple as having; [...] "dynamic that is high voltage", she also believed; [...] "They’re not very good at being a couple together because they haven’t figured out how to work as a team." [...] Sarah ended up choosing TK over him. On her wedding day to TK in 2007, Sarah decided to call off the marriage, fearing she still loved Craig. She visited Craig but he insisted on driving her to the wedding himself. Sarah came back from her honeymoon early to help Craig, causing a feud with Craig's girlfriend Alice Piper (Toni Potter). In 2008 Craig diagnosed Sarah with Multiple Sclerosis. Upon resigning, Bartolomei commented on Craig's relationship with Sarah, stating: [...] "Craig and Sarah are your classic unrequited love story. That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned." [...] On screen Craig resigned from Shortland Street and admitted he would always love Sarah before the two shared a moment. He was murdered later that evening. Sarah sung an emotional song at his service, highlighting his personality and kindness. Billing believed that for several years, Craig was Sarah's one true love and was touched when she saw a hashtag '#ReunitedwithCraig' on Twitter concerning Sarah's death in 2014.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of pushing the performance envelope of disk drives {{continues to grow}} in the enterprise storage market. One of the most fundamental factors impacting disk drive design is heat dissipation, since it directly affects drive reliability. Until now, drive manufacturers have continued to meet the 40 % annual growth target of the internal data-rates (IDR) by increasing RPMs and shrinking platter sizes, both of which have counteracting effects on the heat dissipation within a drive. In this article, we shall show that we are getting to a point where it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to stay on this roadmap. We first present detailed models that capture the close relationships between capacity, performance, and thermal characteristics over time. Using these models, we quantify the drop-off in IDR growth rates over the next decade if we are to adhere to the thermal design envelope. We motivate the need for continued improvements in IDR by showing that the response times of real workloads can be improved by 30 – 60 % with a 10 K increase in the RPM for disks used in their respective storage systems. We then present two dynamic thermal management (DTM) techniques {{that can be used to}} buy back some of this IDR loss. The first DTM technique exploits the thermal slack between what the drive was intended to support and the currently lower operating temperature to ramp up the RPM. The second DTM technique assumes that the drive i...|$|E
40|$|Global {{airlines}} consume over 5 {{million barrels}} of oil per day, and the resulting carbon dioxide (CO 2) emitted by aircraft engines is of concern. This article provides a contemporary review of the literature associated with the measures available to the civil aviation industry for mitigating CO 2 emissions from aircraft. The measures are addressed under two categories – policy and legal-related measures, and technological and operational measures. Results of the review are used to develop several insights into the challenges faced. The analysis shows that forecasts for strong growth in air-traffic will result in civil aviation becoming an increasingly significant contributor to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Some mitigation-measures can be left to market-forces as the key-driver for implementation because they directly reduce airlines' fuel consumption, and their impact on reducing fuel-costs will be welcomed by the industry. Other mitigation-measures cannot be left to market-forces. Speed of implementation and stringency of these measures will not be satisfactorily resolved unattended, and the current global regulatory-framework does not provide the necessary strength of stewardship. A global regulator with ‘teeth’ needs to be established, but investing such a body with the appropriate level of authority requires securing an international agreement which history would suggest is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> If all mitigation-measures are successfully implemented, it is still likely that traffic growth-rates will continue to out-pace emissions reduction-rates. Therefore, to achieve an overall reduction in CO 2 emissions, behaviour change will be necessary to reduce demand for air-travel. However, reducing demand will be strongly resisted by all stakeholders in the industry; and the ticket price-increases necessary to induce the required reduction in traffic growth-rates place a monetary-value on CO 2 emissions of approximately 7 – 100 times greater than other common valuations. It is clear that, whilst aviation must remain one piece of the transport-jigsaw, environmentally a global regulator with ‘teeth’ is urgently required. <br/...|$|E
