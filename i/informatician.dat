40|$|Reams of data {{pertaining}} {{directly to}} the core health services research mission are accumulating in large-scale organizational and clinical information systems. Health services researchers who grasp the structure of information systems and databases and the function of software applications can use existing data more effectively, assist in establishing new databases, and develop new tools to survey populations and collect data. At the same time, <b>informaticians</b> are needed who can structure databases that {{serve the needs of}} health service research and who can design and evaluate applications that effectively improve health care delivery. As long as health services researchers and <b>informaticians</b> work in separate spheres, however, opportunities to use data from health care encounters to improve care, expand knowledge, and develop more effective policies will be missed. This paper provides a brief exploration of 1) existing successful collaborations between health services researchers and <b>informaticians</b> and 2) needs and opportunities for additional joint work in several core research areas...|$|R
40|$|Processes are {{regarded}} {{as a representative of}} all firm activities what is valid for Web-based Advisory Systems, too. Interpretation of processes from the both sides managers and <b>informaticians</b> is naturally different what is given by their scientific platforms and observed objectives. Managers have connected all firm processes with the firm prosperity and firm competition ability. Therefore they have followed understanding, modeling and regular improving of all processes what should stimulate and evoke using of process revisions (reengineering). The main role in such process understanding is thus committed to the firm management. The most professional computer process implementations are dominant objectives of <b>Informaticians.</b> In this conception all processes have been understood as real sequences of partial transactions (elementary firm activities) and data processed by them regardless of using of a structural or object process approach modeling. The process and transaction models, submitted by <b>informaticians,</b> are connected with process content orientation. This content has to be programmed. The firm management represents the main resource of the process knowledge used by <b>informaticians.</b> In addition to these two process conceptions there is a different approach based on a process description by a descriptive data. The descriptive data are not oriented to a process content but to its theoretical conception and real implementation. The descriptive data processing inside special algebra operations can bring a lot of very important and easily economically interpreted results...|$|R

40|$|Research is {{producing}} {{increasing amounts of}} important new evidence for health care, {{but there is a}} large gap between what this evidence shows can be done and the care that most patients actually receive. An important reason for this gap is the extensive processing that evidence requires before application. This article discusses a three-step model for bridging research evidence to management of clinical problems: getting the evidence straight, formulating evidence-based clinical policies, and applying evidence-based clinical policies at the right place and time. This model is purposely broad in scope and provides a framework for coordinating efforts to support evidence-based medical care. The authors' purpose is to represent the roles of health informatics {{in the context of the}} roles of all the key players, including health care researchers and practitioners, health care organizations, and the public. Health informatics has already made important contributions to bridging evidence to practice, including improving evidence retrieval, evaluation, and synthesis; new evidence-based information products; and computerized aids for facilitating the use of these products during clinical decision making. However, much more innovation and coordination are needed. The authors call for health <b>informaticians</b> to pay balanced attention to 1) the quality of evidence embodied in information innovations, 2) the performance of technologies and systems that retrieve, prepare, disseminate, and apply evidence, and 3) the fit of information tools to the specific clinical circumstances in which evidence is to be applied. Effective interdisciplinary teams that include health services researchers and other evidence experts, clinical practitioners, <b>informaticians,</b> and health care managers are needed to achieve success. <b>Informaticians</b> can make increasingly important contributions to the transfer of health care research by joining such teams...|$|R

50|$|In healthcare, CIT {{is used in}} {{situations}} where direct examination of clinical staff and researchers can help them better understand their roles and help them solve practical problems. CIT allows clinical staff to better understand their roles in the clinical setting. Another advantage is that it helps them gain better knowledge about their interactions with patients and other clinicians. It also helps clinical staff better understand their practice {{from a variety of}} roles (e.g., physician, nurse, clinical educator, nurse <b>informatician,</b> faculty member).
