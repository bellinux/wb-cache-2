This study examines <b>forestry</b> <b>funds</b> in 100 communities in three districts {{to assess how}} large {{they are and how}} they are utilized. The study finds that the income from community funds increases local development resources by about 25 %. This income is invested in schools, temples, roads, and water reservoirs, which bodes well for rural development. However, there are some critical problems with the 'pro-poor programme’, an effort to reduce poverty through the resources generated from community forestry. The study finds that timber is subsidized and the subsidies accrue mainly to the non-poor. Furthermore, income spent on loans tends to favor the non-poor. Overall some 74 % of the benefits of community <b>forestry</b> <b>funds</b> accrue to the non-poor while 26 % accrue to the poor in rural communities in Nepal. The study concludes that two actions may increase the benefits accruing to the poor: a) allowing all households to have an equal share in timber that is harvested; and b) increasing the participation of poor and less advantaged members in the executive committees that manage <b>forestry</b> <b>funds.</b> [SANDEE]Community <b>forestry</b> <b>funds,</b> Nepal, timber subsidies, loans, poverty...|$|R

40|$|Weak or {{inappropriate}} {{property rights}} {{can be a}} major impediment to efficient and sustainable use of natural resources. The system of property rights governs what landholders can do with their land and other resources and the incentives which exist to undertake tree growing activities. In the forest sector, the property rights regime is conditioned largely by the forest administration infrastructure, <b>forestry</b> <b>funding</b> arrangements and environmental policy. Often measures to make forestry more sustainable have unintended adverse impacts on the property rights of tree growers. In the Philippines (as in other countries, both developed and developing), various anomalies in property rights in forestry are often noted. These tend to discriminate against plantation forestry and, in particular, small-scale forestry. Reform of property rights in forestry is a challenging task...|$|R

Comprised into forest zones expanded in all historical provinces of the country, they are representing an important economic resource, an also an essential factor of the man-environment equilibrium. The organization of the rational exploitation of the <b>forestry</b> <b>fund,</b> adopted ever since the XIX Century, was abandoned after the forests nationalization, imposed by the communist regime in 1948. Urbanization and industrialization, held in view by this regime, did not take into account the ecological requirements and neither those linked to the renewal of the natural economic resources. The transition coming after the fall of communism, with pervert economic, psychological and sociological effects, has led to a savage exploitation of the <b>forestry</b> <b>fund,</b> the lack of some compensation measures (re-forestations, young forest protection), under the context of statal authority’s dissolution (after the excessive communist authoritarism), having catastrophic consequences: land slides, desertification, pollution.

In the empirical part of the paper, the author shows that the SGAFF portfolio has sufficient value to cover the expected costs of the credit guarantees and subsidies offered by the fund. The theoretical model looks at government interventions designed to decrease the credit rationing of farmers with high probability of success. The theoretical model shows that, with uniform non-targeted supports, the Czech government unambiguously prefers lump-sum guarantees to interest-rate subsidies. With support targeted wholly to disadvantaged farmers, the cost of lump-sum guarantees, proportional guarantees, and interest-rates subsidies are all equal. credit; guarantees; subsidies; transition...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the institutional support of agricultural loans and its role in Czech agriculture based on the dynamic optimal model. The dynamic optimization problem is solved by the Lagrange method. The application of the theoretical model shows that the lower is the interest rate paid by the farmer the lower is the optimal consumption and consequently the farmer is willing to employ higher part of the capital in the production. Thus, the initial capital is more effectively employed. The time series analysis shows that the SGAFFs activities significantly support the farmers investments. In spite of the problems in the setting of the SGAFFs policy, the role of the SGAFF in financing of agricultural activities can be regarded to be positive in the analyzed period.

40|$|This aim of {{this thesis}} is to tackle the {{effective}} use of risk management within private insurance for a selected agricultural company. The paper {{suggests that it is}} fundamental to identify such a risk and subsequently define it. Consequently, the identified risk is analysed along with the concept of insurance, which is also essential for work. After an analysis of agricultural insurance in the Czech Republic, the paper further compares the variety of insurance available as offered by local insurance companies. The state's point of view is scrutinized in relation to the variety of insurance offered, as the state provides the Support and Guarantee Fund and Agricultural and <b>Forestry</b> <b>Fund,</b> Inc., which provides subsidies to the farmers. Subsequently, the paper demonstrates the importance of the insurance broker, who acts as a mediator between the insurance company and the farmer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Through {{the last}} few years the State Forest Administration in Republic of Bulgaria was searching for the proper model and {{approach}} for reproduction, management and utilization of the Bulgarian forest, aiming sustainable long-term forestry sector development. Parallel with seeking for radical changes for reforming of the forestry sector, the management and expert sta,ff of the State Forest Administration (National Forestry Board - NFB, and its units) through all these years continuously searched for improvement of the acting legislative and budgetary regulations, documents and rules with one major purpose - discovering of optimal types of timber utilization and sales, for increasing the income in the forestry sector, and the opportunity for reinvestment of part of it. In this study different tendencies in the quantitative and value dimensions of separate legislatively postulated types of utilization, harvesting and round timber sales from the State <b>Forestry</b> <b>Fund</b> for the period 2002 - 2004, have been analyzed, and they are an indicator for the sustainable development of the forestry sector. Comprehensive analysis in years of the harvested and sold quantities of round timber, of the changes in single prices pei cubic meter*sold timber and of the income of these sales is presented in details. This publication is focused on growing of the timber utilization, of the harvesting and of the store sales, aiming to reach the foreseen quantities in the Forest Management Plan, and on building up of the relative share of timber sales on the road through {{the last few}} years. These two moments, together with the gradual timber prices lead to significant income increase in the forestry sector, which offers more and more opportunities for reinvestment in forest reproduction, technique and equipments, for constructions, forest roads' repair and maintenance and etc. РЕЗЮМЕ: Анализирани са тенденциите в количествените и стойностните изменения при различните нормативно регламентирани начини на ползване и продажба на дървесина от ДГФ в периода 2002 - 2004 година, както и изменението на ценовите равнища на дървесината при различните начини на ползване и на продажби.
