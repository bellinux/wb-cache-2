At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and <b>inlet</b> <b>separator</b> to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E

It seems that the EPCI contractor has not included closed outlet when sizing the PSVs for a gas blowby scenario. The PSVs for Alvheim/ 3 rd party <b>Inlet</b> <b>separator</b> and Glycol Flash drum are verified in this report by conservative calculations and simulations assuming a gas blowby scenario with closed outlets. The conservative computation does not verify that the PSVs for the 2 nd stage separator, the produced water degassing drum and the cargo tanks are sized for gas blowby. However, the dynamic simulation shows that the conservative scenarios are too conservative. The trivial dynamic simulation shows that the PSVs for the 2 nd stage separator are large enough to handle a gas blowby scenario with closed outlets. In spite of this result it is recommended that a more detailed dynamic simulation is to be designed to verify sufficient PSV capacity for these scenarios. First of all it is recommended to implement more details into the steady state simulation for the 2 nd stage separator and the degassing drum and investigate if it is possible to assume open liquid outlets even though the downstream pumps trip...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The concept of compact separation is attractive in a number of operating environments. These include offshore and arctic operations, where both space and weight are at a premium, and downhole processing where space is very limited. Compact separators often rely on centrifugal forces to enhance the separation process and are therefore highly dependent on inlet geometry. This paper investigates expanding the operational envelope of a compact Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone separator {{through the use of a}} novel inlet, which can be easily altered to respond to changing well conditions. To demonstrate the importance of inlet geometry, historical production from the Gloyd-Mitchell zone of the Rodessa Field in Louisiana was examined over a 40 -month period. As in most oil field production, there were significant changes in the water cut and GOR. This field data clearly shows that a compact separator equipped with single inlet geometry is not capable of performing effectively over the wide range of conditions exhibited in a typical oil field. This thesis considers the hydrodynamics of the <b>separator</b> <b>inlet.</b> Three different inlet geometries were investigated through the use of a changeable inlet sleeve. New experimental data were acquired utilizing a 7. 62 -cm I. D compact separator, which was 3. 0 m in height. The effect of <b>inlet</b> geometry on <b>separator</b> performance was investigated over a wide range of flow conditions. Fluid viscosities from 1 - 12 cp and the effect of fluid level within the separator were also examined. The results indicate that the operational envelope for liquid carry-over and gas carry-under can be expanded by more that 300 % by altering the inlet to respond to changing field conditions. A new model is proposed to define the operational envelope. This approximate method is simple to calculate, and offers a good approximation for the operability area for gas-liquid cylindrical cyclone compact separator.

The desire to further make improvements in gas turbine engine efficiency and high power-density is driving {{the research and development}} of thermal barrier coatings and the effort of improving their tolerance to fine foreign particulates that may be contained in the intake air. Both commercial and military aircraft engines often are required to operate over sandy regions such as in the Middle-East nations, as well as over volcanic zones. For rotorcraft gas turbine engines, the sand ingestion is adverse during take-off, hovering near ground, and landing conditions. Although, most of the rotorcraft gas turbine engines are fitted with <b>inlet</b> particle <b>separators,</b> they are not 100 percent efficient in filtering fine sand particles of size 75 microns or below. The presence of these fine solid particles in the working fluid medium has an adverse effect on the durability of turbine blade thermal barrier coatings and overall performance of the engine. Typical turbine blade damages include blade coating wear, sand glazing, Calcia-Magnesia-Alumina-Silicate (CMAS) attack, oxidation, plugged cooling holes, all of which can cause rapid performance deterioration including loss of aircraft. The objective of this research is to understand the fine particle interactions with typical ceramic coatings of turbine blades at the microstructure level.

ABSTRACT: Natural gas processing is a complex industrial process designed to reduce impurities from raw natural gas by separation process to produce gas which is known as pipeline quality dry natural gas. In Titas Gas Field (Location #A), natural gas process plant is mainly designed to separate {{the water from the}} raw gas and make the gas transmittable to the consumer. Natural gas dehydration for Titas Gas Field mainly includes the separation of water from gas by Glycol Dehydration Process. Besides, a little amount of condensate is also separated during the dehydration process. Condensate of Titas Gas Field mainly contents hydrocarbon of C 3 -C 4.

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} {{experimental}} evidence of slug mitigation via various devices. The slug mitigation {{potential of a}} number of mixers was tested using a laboratory scale air/water setup to compare their effect on the incoming slugs just upstream of the <b>separator</b> <b>inlet.</b> Dedicated methods and key performance indicators were developed to characterize the slug properties and evaluate the mixers effectiveness. Such mitigation is especially interesting for the purpose of producing oil and gas from thin oil rims, in which wells are often drilled following the geological structure of the oil-bearing layer. These wells consequently contain many long, near-horizontal sections, through which the transport of the oil gas mixture often takes the form of slug flow, i. e. Large volumes of liquid travelling at the velocity of the gas phase. As the gas cannot bypass the slugs, they are generally produced to the topside facilities, where they have a detrimental effect on the mechanical integrity of the equipment and on the metering accuracy due to their large volume. Mitigating slug flow has therefore great potential in optimizing the production from thin-oil rims on the short term. The present study shows that consistent reductions can be obtained on pressure fluctuations due to slugging, highlighting the benefit of these devices. It was observed that the slug speed could be significantly reduced, as well as the liquid hold-up within the slugs, especially when gas lift is used in conjunction with the devices. The physical mechanisms behind these effects are isolated, leading to optimization of the device geometry, for application to full scale. The demonstrated potential of the mixer devices can yield a quantifiable reduction of the impact of slugging on mechanical integrity and metering accuracy. As a consequence, production limitations due to slugging problems can be alleviated, resulting in potential for increase in oil production rates from thin oil rims...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of both federal and state storm water {{management}} regulations, state and municipal highway departments must consider {{a broad array of}} Best Management Practices (BMPs) for meeting storm water treatment objectives for both new road construction and roadway-improvement projects. In recent years, a number of manufacturers have entered the marketplace with a variety of proprietary devices for treating storm water. One of the most common types of devices is the hydrodynamic separator (also referred to as innovative water-quality <b>inlet,</b> particle <b>separator,</b> or swirl concentrator). Evaluating these technologies for application in the highway setting requires consideration of a number of factors relative to these devices’ treatment performance, inspection and maintenance requirements, and installation and operating costs. The Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway), under a cooperative agreement with the U. S. Geological Survey, recently conducted a detailed field study of water-quality inlets (WQIs) located on the Southeast Expressway in Boston. That study provided valuable lessons regarding storm water sampling protocols and data analyses used to evaluate hydrodynamic separators. (These products generally consist of refinements {{in the design of the}} standard WQI.) This paper discusses the lessons learned and offers recommendations for evaluating the performance of proprietary designs within this class of BMP. A variety of findings came out of the Southeast Expressway (SEE) Study that should be considered when evaluating “hydrodynamic separators. ” The study evaluated two separate WQIs, each of which received storm water discharges from deep-sump (four-foot) catch basins. It was found that the one continuously monitored deep-sump catch basin had an annual suspended sediment removal efficiency (SSRE) of 39 %, whereas the annual average SSRE for two WQIs was 32 % (based on the remaining load after flow through the catch basins). Captured sediments were comprised predominantly of sand-sized particles. Residence time was the primary factor controlling the SSRE. To a lesser degree, antecedent conditions and volume of rain also affected the SSRE. Other findings were that metals and nutrients tend to concentrate on particles smaller than sand and that sediment resuspension occurred in both the catch basin and the WQIs. In addition to the limited suspended sediment removal efficiency of the WQIs, the SEE Study found that the WQIs were ineffective at removing soluble pollutants, fine particles, floatable solids (debris and litter), and oils and grease. Prior to installing hydrodynamic separators, the operators of drainage systems and environmental regulators should obtain scientifically supportable data on the field performance of hydrodynamic separators. Based on the findings and experience obtained over the course of the SEE Study, MassHighway recommends the following key elements for validating the field performance of hydrodynamic separators: • Collect field data that is both representative of the range of rainfall events and that is applicable to the conditions (e. g., ambient particle-size distributions) under which the BMP likely will be installed; • When sampling, differentiate between the effects of “supernatant displacement” and active-particle removal by the separator (i. e., “hydrostatic” versus “hydrodynamic” separation). This requires flow-proportional sampling throughout each storm event; • Account for antecedent conditions, bypass flows, and resuspension when calculating the SSRE; • Sample a sufficient number of storms not only to obtain statistically significant data, but to include the full range of operating conditions to which the device will be subject; • Analyze treatment performance by “Summation of Loads,” which is the preferable method for accuracy and quality control; • Sample storms sequentially, to allow for a mass-balance calculation; • Include measurements of particle-size distribution in the sampling and analysis program to assess the removal efficiency of Total Suspended Solids (or, preferably, Suspended Sediment Concentration), as well as that of other contaminants associated with various particle-size fractions. Hydrodynamic separators should also be evaluated relative to other potential limitations. For example, if these underground structures function to contain fuel spills, then they have the potential to create an explosion hazard. In addition, according to the literature, hydrodynamic separators also may create conditions suitable for breeding mosquitoes and bacteria or conditions that result in liberating nutrients and metals from captured sediments. Based on its evaluation of WQIs and on the literature MassHighway has reviewed to date, further scientifically sound evaluation is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrodynamic separators as primary-treatment devices. Although MassHighway has documented the limitations of the WQIs used along the Southeast Expressway (e. g., low overall removal of suspended sediment, particularly fine particles), hydrodynamic separators may be appropriate for pre-treatment and retrofit applications where sand is the target contaminant and where the operator has adequate maintenance capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone (GLCC) {{separator}} {{is commonly}} used for the separation {{of oil and gas}} mixtures flowing from the well head. Similar to the design used by other separators, it has an inlet and two outlets for gas and liquid respectively. However, the <b>inlet</b> to the <b>separator</b> can either be single or dual type. The pipeline connection from the upstream preconditioning equipment (CFC) is inclined downwards and has a tangential inlet slot. The essence of having a downward inclination is to promote pre-separation of the fluid phases. On the other hand, a tangential inlet promotes circular fluid motion thereby inducing separation of the fluid phases by centrifugal forces. Due to the complex behaviour of the flow within the GLCC, liquid carry over (LCO) as drops into the gas phase pipeline and gas carry under (GCU) as bubbles into the liquid phase pipeline are inevitable. Both phenomena greatly reduce the purity of the fluid phases at the outlets. To overcome this challenge, it has been proposed from field experiments carried out by Chevron Energy Technology Company, to precondition the influent flow in an upstream vertical pipe before entrance to the GLCC. In order words, a suggested solution to overcoming liquid carry over (LCO) and gas carry under (GCU) is to precondition the oil/gas mixture by forcing small bubbles/drops of 3 - 5 mm in diameter to coalesce in an upstream vertical pipe. The upstream vertical preconditioner is known as a Churn Flow Coalescer (CFC). This is because the churn flow regime is the most suitable for the coalescence of both liquid and gas phases. Therefore, it is in the scope of this research work to carry out detailed preconditioning experiments within an upstream vertical pipe that serves the purpose of a Churn Flow Coalescer (CFC). All experiments in this research work have been carried out in the Chemical and Environmental Engineering L 3 laboratory at the University of Nottingham. Although, the churn flow regime is specifically the most suitable for the GLCC, the operational envelope for the initial set of experiments spans the bubble to churn regimes. This is because the experiments were performed with the aim of delineating the conditions for the inception of typical churn flow in a large diameter pipe. These set of experiments were conducted in a 121 mm internal diameter, 5. 3 m in length vertical pipe using air and water as the operating fluids. In these experiments, slug flow characterised by a Taylor bubble and a liquid slug was not observed. The churn flow regime is made up of two sub-regimes namely: liquid bridging of the gas core and formation of huge waves. The former is a phenomenon that occurs when the liquid phase forms a bridge as a result of radial coalescence of the wave crests flowing about the pipe centreline and momentarily blocks the entire pipe cross-section. The huge waves occur when the liquid phase flows as waves on the inner walls of the pipe and about the pipe centreline having large amplitudes. Between bubble to churn flow regimes in these experiments, four regimes were observed namely, discrete bubbly flow and spherical cap bubbly flow which make up the bubbly flow regime, churn turbulent regime (transition region) and typical churn flow regime. These experiments paved way for detailed experiments to be carried within the churn flow regime. Detailed churn flow experiments were then carried out in a large scale closed loop facility having an internal diameter of 127 mm and a longer vertical pipe of 11 m. The rationale for performing the experiments in this facility is because the facility offered a wider range of conditions within the churn flow compared to the first experimental rig facility. Data was acquired at L/D = 2. 4, 7. 1, 30. 7, 35. 4 and 82. 7 which represent different axial distances from the gas-liquid injection {{at the base of the}} test section. Air and water were also used as the operating fluids. The void fraction data acquired at different axial distance from the injection varies logarithmically with increase in axial distance. The flow can be considered to be developed at L/D = 82. 7 based on the void fraction. In addition, the frequency of liquid bridging of the gas core decays with increasing distance from the injection (downstream) while the frequency of the huge waves and liquid structures entrained in the gas core increases downstream from the injection due to coalescence. Finally, the effect of viscosity in the churn flow regime was investigated using air-glycerol/ water as the fluid pairs in the same large scale loop facility. Two glycerol/water mixtures were used having viscosities of 12. 2 cP and 16. 2 cP respectively. The data was acquired at a suitable axial distance from the injection at L/D = 65. 5. In this experimental campaign, the size and frequency of the liquid structures entrained in the gas core are larger compared to the liquid structures present when experiments were carried out using air-water as the operating fluids. As a result, this gives a bi-modal probability distribution for air-glycerol/ water compared to air-water. Similar to the air-water experiments, the liquid bridging operating condition gives a high degree of coalescence of both phases. The mechanism of entrained liquid structure formation has been proposed based on the comparative study to the air-water experiments. A model has also been developed that predicts the effective length of pipe for the Churn Flow Coalescer (CFC). Overall, the liquid bridging sub-regime of churn flow should be the prevailing condition in the CFC to enhance proper separation of gas and liquid phases in the downstream GLCC separator...|$|R
