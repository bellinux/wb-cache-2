50|$|A {{few minutes}} later, a double tanker (<b>fixed</b> <b>tank</b> plus a trailer-tanker) {{carrying}} gasoline {{arrived at the}} bottleneck. By chance, there was an empty bus following close behind it. The tanker hit the car, and then braked to a halt almost exactly halfway through the tunnel. The bus hit either the car, the tanker or both; the bus driver was thrown clear of his vehicle and killed. The bus continued driverless along the tunnel and crashed into a bridge column not far outside the exit portal.|$|E
50|$|Shipfitters fabricate, {{assemble}} and erect all {{structural parts}} of a ship, coordinate all <b>fixed</b> <b>tank</b> work performed on submarines and ships, and coordinate all sonar dome work. Shipfitters also use heavy machinery, such as plate planners, shears, punches, drill presses, bending rolls, bending slabs, plate bevelers, saws, presses up to 750 tons, angle rolls (vertical and horizontal), dogs and wedges. Shipfitters are responsible for hydro and air testing of tanks and compartments, as well as perform grinding, drilling and fit-up operations on submarines and surface crafts.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the accidents, CAL FIRE decided that better {{approach}} would be for the agency to own and operate its own helicopters. In 1981, CAL FIRE leased 12 excess UH-1F Hueys which had previously been used by the USAF in Vietnam. Nine helicopters were initially reconditioned, and were operated as non-certificated, public-use aircraft. The first helicopter was built up November, 1981 and was placed in service at Hemet-Ryan Helitack Base. Six more F Model Hueys were built up and placed in service at helitack bases throughout California in the summer of 1982. During the first two years CAL FIRE employed “Personal Service Contract” pilots. Each base was assigned a full-time pilot and a seasonal relief pilot who covered two bases. The majority of the contract pilots became state employees in 1984. The helitack unit was designed to be a cohesive unit which consisted of the helicopter and helitack crew. A typical configuration for the helicopter was a Helitack Fire Captain in the copilot's seat and a Helitack Fire Captain plus six fire-fighters in the passenger compartment. The water bucket was replaced in 1984 with a newly designed Canadian 324-gallon Bambi bucket. In the mid-1980s, fixed water dropping tanks were installed on several helicopters. Water bucket operations over ever-increasing populated regions in the urban interface areas of eastern Riverside County had been causing a concern. An accidental drop of a water bucket could cause catastrophic results, while a <b>fixed</b> <b>tank</b> reduced the exposure. In addition, some areas where the helicopters operated had few water sources from which a helicopter could fill its bucket. A <b>fixed</b> <b>tank</b> allowed the helicopter to obtain water from sources previously unobtainable with the bucket.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fixed</b> roof <b>tanks</b> are {{typically}} used with products that have relatively low volatilities and flash points. Using a <b>fixed</b> roof <b>tank</b> to store a product with high volatility {{can lead to}} product losses as vapors escape the enclosure.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fixed</b> roof <b>tank</b> {{is a type}} {{of storage}} tank, used to store liquids, {{consisting}} of a cone- or dome-shaped roof that is permanently affixed to a cylindrical shell. Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A breather valve (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many <b>fixed</b> roof <b>tanks,</b> allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. <b>Fixed</b> roof <b>tanks</b> without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a <b>fixed</b> roof <b>tank</b> can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, float gauges, and roof manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions.|$|R

The 748 is also widely used as a pure freighter with a typical max payload of about 12,000 lbs.

50|$|The roof has {{support legs}} hanging {{down into the}} liquid.

30|$|On one hand, a {{minority}} among the population show resignation and docility {{with respect to}} these “fables” and passively continue receiving water once every 14  days and buying water from roving tank owners to satisfy their needs. On the other hand, however, {{the majority of people}} are dissatisfied because they do not understand the reasons for the long delays in the execution, implementation and completion of the projects. In addition to the time it takes and the financial cost, the citizens living in multi-story buildings, ask the roving tank owners to undertake extra effort and dangerous work by climbing on the roof and dragging heavy water pipes to fill the <b>fixed</b> <b>tanks</b> on the roof. This valuable resource is costing them more than 35 cents per liter, which is excessively expensive for modest incomes (the wealthiest people are miles away from this crisis because their houses are equipped with several tanks and large built-in reservoirs).|$|R
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> roof <b>tanks</b> {{are meant}} for liquids with very high flash points, (e.g. fuel oil, water, bitumen etc.) Cone roofs, dome roofs and {{umbrella}} roofs are usual.

40|$|Storage {{of crude}} oil and {{petroleum}} products inevitably leads to evaporative losses. Those losses are important for the industrial plants mass balances, {{as well as for}} the environmental protection. In this paper, estimation of evaporative losses was performed using software program TANKS 409 d which was developed by the Agency for Environmental Protection of the United States - US EPA. Emissions were estimated for the following types of storage tanks: <b>fixed</b> conical roof <b>tank,</b> <b>fixed</b> dome roof <b>tank,</b> external floating roof tank, internal floating roof tank and domed external floating roof tank. Obtained results show quantities of evaporated losses per tone of stored liquid. Crude oil <b>fixed</b> roof storage <b>tank</b> losses are cca 0. 5 kg per tone {{of crude oil}}. For floating roof, crude oil losses are 0. 001 kg/t. Fuel oil (diesel fuel and heating oil) have the smallest evaporation losses, which are in order of magnitude 10 - 3 kg/tone. Liquids with higher Reid Vapour Pressure have very high evaporative losses for <b>tanks</b> with <b>fixed</b> roof, up to 2. 07 kg/tone. In case of external floating roof tank, losses are 0. 32 kg/tone. The smallest losses are for internal floating roof tank and domed external floating roof tank: 0. 072 and 0. 044, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that the liquid with low volatility of low BTEX amount can be stored in <b>tanks</b> with <b>fixed</b> roof. In this case, the prevailing economic aspect, because the total amount of evaporative loss does not significantly affect the environment. On the other hand, storage of volatile derivatives with high levels of BTEX is not justified from the economic point of view or from the standpoint of the environment protection...|$|R

40|$|This study {{applied a}} pilot-scale trickle-bed air {{biofilter}} (TBAB) system for treating waste gas emitted from the breather vent of a vertical <b>fixed</b> roof storage <b>tank</b> containing p-xylene (p-X) liquid. The {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentration of the waste gas was related to ambient temperature as well as solar radiation, peaking at above 6300 ppmv of p-X and 25000 ppmv of total hydrocarbons during the hours of 8 AM to 3 PM. When the activated carbon adsorber was employed as a VOC buffer, the peak waste gas VOC concentration was significantly reduced resulting in a stably and efficiently performing TBAB system. The pressure drop appeared to be low, reflecting that the TBAB system could be employed in the prolonged operation with a low running penalty. These advantages suggest that the TBAB system is a cost-effective treatment technology for VOC emission from a <b>fixed</b> roof storage <b>tank...</b>|$|R
