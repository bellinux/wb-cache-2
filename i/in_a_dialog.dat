Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer versions) such as [...] "talk to" [...] for communicating with characters and [...] "pick up" [...] for collecting items between commands and the world's objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dialog</b> tree; the game {{is one of the}} first to incorporate such a system. The in-game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes. Like other LucasArts adventure games, The Secret of Monkey Island features a design philosophy that makes the player character's death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes).|$|E

Gromyko entered the Politburo in 1973 and, from there on, gradually took over the decision making of Soviet foreign policy. During his peak of personal influence Gromyko's policy was being built on the very same qualities which had underpinned his early career. His memory, which has been described by many as [...] "phenomenal", had made him inflexible, un-imaginative and his total lack of a vision for the future led him to never think outside the box. As the Soviet economy was stagnating, Gromyko's diplomatic skills were of less importance as, during the leadership of Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, Gromyko had adopted a more hard-line position than his superiors.|$|E

50|$|In a second, {{narrower}} sense, {{the term}} anaphora denotes {{the act of}} referring backwards <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dialog</b> or text, such as referring to the left when an anaphor points to its left toward its antecedent in languages that are written from left to right. Etymologically, anaphora derives from Ancient Greek ἀναφορά (anaphorá, “a carrying back”), from ἀνά (aná, “up”) + φέρω (phérō, “I carry”). In this narrow sense, anaphora stands in contrast to cataphora, which sees the act of referring forward <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dialog</b> or text, or pointing to the right in languages that are written from left to right: Ancient Greek καταφορά (kataphorá, “a downward motion”), from κατά (katá, “downwards”) + φέρω (phérō, “I carry”). A proform is a cataphor when it points to its right toward its postcedent. Both effects together are called either anaphora (broad sense) or less ambiguously, along with self-reference they comprise the category of endophora.|$|E
