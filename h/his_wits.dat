5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of Ölvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl Páll, it also notes that Ölvir's ships were smaller. Ölvir brought his own ship {{up next to the}} earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, Ólafr Hrólfsson, attacked Ölvir's smallest ships, and cleared three of them in a short time. Ölvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl Páll's own ship. When he spotted Earl Páll, Ölvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl Páll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Ölvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Ölvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Ölvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Ölvir eventually recovered <b>his</b> <b>wits,</b> but was unable to rally his troops—the battle was lost. Earl Páll pursued Ölvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of Ölvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl Páll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl Páll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl Rögnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl Rögnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl Páll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E

25|$|Yamamoto practiced calligraphy. He and his wife, Reiko, {{had four}} children: {{two sons and}} two daughters. Yamamoto was an avid gambler, enjoying Go, shogi, billiards, bridge, mah jong, poker, and other games that tested <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> and {{sharpened}} his mind. He frequently made jokes about moving to Monaco and starting his own casino. He enjoyed the company of geisha, and his wife Reiko revealed to the Japanese public in 1954 that Yamamoto was closer to his favorite geisha Kawai Chiyoko than to her, which stirred some controversy. After his death, his funeral procession passed by Kawai's quarters {{on the way to}} the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|A {{professional}} Dutch diver {{was supposedly}} {{hired to do}} the salvage job, making his headquarters on the isle, with a store ship standing by. Upon discovering the wreck and entering he found the golden throne, on which was seated, a gigantic figure who rose and came towards him. When the diver grasped {{the hand of the}} figure, instead of a hand, he found that he was grasping a cloven hoof! He escaped the scene with his life and some of <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> intact, however no one has attempted further salvage attempts. One of the Masters of a Kilwinning Lodge was presented with a wooden mallet which had been made with wood from one of the Armada ships which had been wrecked on the Ayrshire coast.|$|E
25|$|McEachin played Mr. Turner, a tax {{collector}} for the I.R.S., {{and later a}} character called Solomon Jackson, a co-worker that Archie Bunker tries to recruit for his social club, on the television show All in the Family. He played the deejay Sweet Al Monte in Play Misty for Me (1971) with Clint Eastwood. In 1973, he starred as Harry Tenafly, the title character in Tenafly, a short-lived detective series about a police officer turned private detective who relied on <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> and hard work rather than guns and fistfights. He also appeared occasionally as Lieutenant Ron Crockett on Emergency!. In 1978, he played {{a police officer in}} Every Which Way But Loose. In 1979, he played the role of a jaded ex-marine high school baseball coach in an episode ("Out at Home") of The White Shadow.|$|E

25|$|Grant often {{displayed}} laddish, thrill-seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, {{gambling and}} living off of <b>his</b> <b>wits.</b> He became restless easily and actively sought {{the thrill of}} danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed sociopathic tendencies at times — impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an indifference to the feelings of others, particularly the women in his life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this {{was that he was}} one of the few people who offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness.|$|E
25|$|Nathan {{experienced}} a troubled youth– his father committed suicide, his three brothers died {{at an early}} age, he was twice expelled from school, and he ran away from home. After living by <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> as a translator for the Japanese during World War II, he completed his secondary education through a correspondence course, and then earned a diploma from the University of Malaya in Singapore in 1954. This {{was followed by a}} distinguished career in the Singapore Civil Service, which he joined in 1955. Between 1962 and 1966 he was seconded to the National Trades Union Congress, and then worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs. He was with the Security and Intelligence Division of the Defence Ministry when the Laju incident happened in 1974, and was among the government officers who agreed to accompany terrorists who had bombed petroleum tanks to Kuwait to secure the release of civilian hostages and ensure the terrorists' safe passage. He served as First Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Ministry from 1979 to 1982.|$|E

500|$|Hunter {{reports that}} Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, {{and it was}} Johnson that, [...] "on the first {{approaches}} of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned." [...] However, {{at no time did}} Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer." ...|$|E
500|$|The adaptations {{have had}} an {{influence}} {{on the work of}} the writer Mark Gatiss. Interviewed in 2008, Gatiss said that Lost Hearts is his favourite adaptation because it is the one that frightened him as a child and that [...] "I absolutely love The Treasure of Abbot Thomas. The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing <b>his</b> <b>wits.</b> He just says, rationally, 'It is a thing of slime, I think. Darkness and slime ...' There's also the fantastic scene where he thinks he's got away with it by putting the treasure back. The doctor is heading up the drive and he can't quite see him in the sunlight. Then it pauses to that amazing crane shot. ... Very spooky.|$|E

Cut off from his family's wealth and influence, he must use <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> to survive. As Booklist notes, [...] "his astonishing adaptability evident as he goes from captive to conspirator to slave to mercenary without losing his tactical influence".

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his career, Henry signed with sportswear giant Nike. In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Henry featured in Nike's [...] "Secret Tournament" [...] advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, along with 24 superstar football players including Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo, Francesco Totti, Roberto Carlos and Japanese star Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament [...] "referee." [...] In a 2004 advertisement, Henry pits <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> against football stars such as Claude Makélélé, Edgar Davids and Freddie Ljungberg in locations such as his bedroom and living room, which was partly inspired by Henry himself, who revealed that he always has a football nearby, even at home. In tandem with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Henry also featured in Nike's Joga Bonito campaign, Portuguese for [...] "beautiful game." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} also a {{deliberate}} effort to bring the series more back to reality, following the success of Moonraker in 1979. As co-writer Michael G. Wilson pointed out, [...] "If {{we went through the}} path of Moonraker things would just get more outlandish, so we needed to get back to basics". To that end, the story that emerged was simpler, not one in which the world was at risk, but returning the series to that of a Cold War thriller; Bond would also rely more on <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> than gadgets to survive. Glen decided to symbolically represent it with a scene where Bond's Lotus blows itself up and forces 007 to rely on Melina's more humble Citroën 2CV. Since Ken Adam was busy with Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion of Glen, Lamont created realistic scenery, instead of the elaborate set pieces for which the series had been known.|$|E
500|$|After On the Origin of Species was published, Darwin became {{involved}} in producing revised editions as well as working on Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication as {{the first part of}} his planned [...] "Big Book". By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at Hartfield, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of insectivorous plants. He investigated other botanical questions raised by his ideas of natural selection, including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas, and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting <b>his</b> <b>wits</b> against nature, and following lucky hunches. His theory was a {{way of looking at the}} world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, [...] "I am like a gambler, & love a wild experiment." ...|$|E
