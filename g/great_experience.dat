5|$|Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar {{thrived in}} Worcester's musical circles. He {{played in the}} violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one <b>great</b> <b>experience</b> was to play Dvořák's Symphony No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton. Elgar {{regularly}} played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.|$|E

25|$|The chalets were {{at first}} the {{production}} of builders with a <b>great</b> <b>experience</b> {{in the building of}} the eclectic style mansions for summer, but without the skills of a real technician. Nonetheless, the first generation of architects from Mar del Plata, led by young professionals like Auro Tiribelli, Alberto Córsico Piccolini, José V.

25|$|Ryti {{had proved}} to be a strong prime minister, in {{contrast}} to his predecessor Aimo Cajander. President Kallio suffered a stroke in August, and also he had no <b>great</b> <b>experience</b> in foreign policy, so the heavy responsibilities of state leadership were shared by Ryti, Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim, industrialist and general Rudolf Walden, and Tanner. Considering this and the fact Ryti had signed the peace treaty, Ryti became an acceptable figure for the post of president in December 1940 when Kallio resigned.|$|E

25|$|In January 1684, Morosini, {{having a}} {{distinguished}} record and <b>great</b> <b>experience</b> of operations in Greece, {{was chosen as}} the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force. Venice increased her forces by enrolling large numbers of mercenaries from Italy and the German states, and raised funds by selling state offices and titles of nobility. Financial and military aid in men and ships was secured from the Knights of Malta, the Duchy of Savoy, the Papal States and the Knights of St. Stephen of Tuscany, and experienced Austrian officers were seconded to the Venetian army. In the Venetian-ruled Ionian Islands, similar measures were undertaken; over 2,000 soldiers, apart from sailors and rowers for the fleet, were recruited. On 10 June 1684, Morosini set sail with a fleet of three galleys, two galleasses, and a few auxiliary vessels. On the way to Corfu he was joined by further four Venetian, five Papal, seven Maltese, and four Tuscan galleys. At Corfu they were united with the local naval and military forces, as well as forces raised by noble Greek families of the Ionian Islands.|$|E

Among the new sees was the Diocese of Philadelphia, which included the states of Pennsylvania and Delaware {{as well as the}} western and southern parts of New Jersey. Even before the diocese was created, Carroll had determined to recommend Egan for the post, writing to Rome that Egan [...] "was truly pious, learned, religious, remarkable for his great humility, but deficient, perhaps, in firmness and without <b>great</b> <b>experience</b> in the direction of affairs".|$|E
