Firstly, such employees {{remove a}} few DD leaves or DD books from stock and write them like a regular DD. Since they are insiders, they know the coding and punching of a <b>demand</b> <b>draft.</b> Such fraudulent demand drafts are usually drawn payable at a distant city without debiting an account. The draft is cashed at the payable branch. The fraud is discovered only when the bank's head office does the branch-wise reconciliation, which normally take six months, by which time the money is gone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{reading of}} {{handwritten}} cheque is a computationally complex process and it {{plays an important}} role in financial risk management. Machine vision and learning provide a viable solution to this problem. Research effort has mostly been focused on recognizing diverse pitches of cheques and <b>demand</b> <b>drafts</b> with an identical outline. However most of these methods employ templatematching to localize the pitches and such schemes could potentially fail when applied to different types of outline maintained by the bank. In this paper, the so-called outline problem is resolved by a cheque information tree (CIT), which generalizes the localizing method to extract active-region-of-entities. In addition, the weight based density plot (WBDP) is performed to isolate text entities and read complete pitches. Recognition is based on texture features using neural classifiers. Legal amount is subsequently recognized by both texture and perceptual features. A post-processing phase is invoked to detect the incorrect readings by Type- 2 grammar using the Turing machine. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using cheque and <b>demand</b> <b>drafts</b> of 22 different banks. The test data consists of a collection of 1540 leafs obtained from 10 different account holders from each bank. Results show that this approach can easily be deployed without significant design amendments.
