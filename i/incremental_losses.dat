A multinomial regression model will be applied to model the sign of the loss data, while the lognormal distribution is assumed for the loss magnitudes of negatives and positives.

Nowadays, <b>incremental</b> <b>losses</b> or computation of penalty factors has gained a new relevance allocating transmission losses among market participants being integrated in the spot pricing model. Nevertheless, vagueness in power injections from load demand and renewable resources has a fundamental influence on transmission incre-mental losses, and consequently affecting spot prices of the energy. This paper presents a new method to compute Incremental Transmission Loss (ITL) factors {{taking into account the}} effect of uncertainty on power injections due to measurement errors or future estimation. Fuzzy Set Theory is applied to deal with vagueness of information about power injections.

40|$|The {{process of}} loss {{development}} has been studied by casualty actuaries for many years. When an accident period is closed, the ultimate claim liabilities are unknown {{because many of the}} claims are still unreported and some that are reported remain unsettled.

Quantifying the uncertainty in estimates of IBNR is of great importance to the financial health of casualty insurance companies. Most of the current methods for estimating ultimate losses focus on estimation of loss development factors which relate the emergence of losses to the amount of losses already reported.

A liability rule, in the ordinary sense of the term, {{to be called a}} standard liability rule, is a rule which specifies the proportions in which the loss, in case of accident, is to be apportioned between the victim and the injurer as a function of their proportions of non-negligence. An incremental liability rule is a rule which specifies (i) which of the two parties, the victim or the injurer, is to be the non-residual liability holder; and (ii) the proportion of the <b>incremental</b> <b>loss,</b> which can be ascribed to the negligence of the non-residual party, to be borne by the non-residual liability holder. The necessary and sufficient conditions for an incremental liability rule to be efficient, derived in the paper, can be stated as follows: Let the party which is the residual liability holder when both parties are non-negligent be designated as r and the other party as nr. An incremental liability rule is efficient for every admissible application iff its structure is such that: (i) If party r is negligent and party nr is non-negligent, then party r must remain the residual liability holder.

Previous reports suggested that in the abnormal abdomen (aa) phenotype of Drosophila mercatorum, high levels of rDNA insertions (R 1) in conjunction with the under-replication locus (ur), enable the utilization of different ecological conditions via a population level shift to younger age. We have sequenced the R 1 and R 2 elements of D. mercatorum and show that the levels of R 1 - and R 2 -inserted rDNA units were inaccurately scored in the original studies of aa, leading to several misinterpretations. In particular, contrary to earlier reports, aa flies differentially underreplicate R 1 - and R 2 -inserted rDNA units, like other species of Drosophila. However, aa flies do not undergo the lower level of underreplication of their functional rDNA units (general underreplication) that is seen in wild-type strains. The lack of general underreplication is expected to confer a selective advantage and, thus, can be interpreted as an adaptation to overcome high levels of R 1 and R 2 insertions. These results allow us to reconcile some of the apparently contradictory effects of aa and the bobbed phenotype found in other species of Drosophila...|$|E

The BÃ¼hlmann-Straub credibility reserving (BSCR) model is a particular case of a CILI model where the risk parameter is only depending on i.

The model {{can be viewed as}} an extension of the BSCR model including random diagonal effects, which are often declared to be important in loss reserving but rarely are specifically modeled.

The results are illustrated by a numerical example and the estimators are tested by simulation. We find that the inclusion of random diagonal effects can be significant for the reserve estimates and, especially, for the evaluation of the MSEP.

ObjectivesTo develop a US-level model to estimate the effect of tumor misclassification on health care costs and patient quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). MethodsDecision {{analysis was used to}} estimate the number of patients with early-stage breast cancer (EBC) whose HER 2 status was misclassified in 2012. FP results were assumed to generate unnecessary trastuzumab costs and unnecessary cases of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. FN results were assumed to save money on trastuzumab, but with a loss of QALYs and greater risk of disease recurrence and its associated costs. QALYs were valued at $ 100, 000 under a net monetary benefit approach. ResultsAmong 226, 870 women diagnosed with EBC in 2012, 3. 12 % (n = 7, 070) and 2. 18 % (n = 4, 955) were estimated to have had FP and FN test results, respectively. Approximately 8400 QALYs (discounted, lifetime) were lost among women not receiving trastuzumab because of FN results. The estimated incremental per-patient lifetime burden of FP or FN results was $ 58, 900 and $ 116, 000, respectively.

Furthermore, while large-scale droughts may have the sufficient, immediate impact to draw the attention and concern of global actors, the increases in <b>incremental</b> <b>losses</b> associated with changes in the variability and unpredictability of climate conditions may have an equally great impact on vulnerable populations. Strategies for reducing this impact are, as a result, central to poverty alleviation and adaptation to climate change.

The case study explores both insurance mechanisms for spreading drought risk and, as an alternative, the development of groundwater irrigation for reducing such risk. The study draws attention toward approaches to drought mitigation that are based on integrated combinations of strategies, which may perform better than a single set of techniques or mechanisms. While the study is based on analysis within a relatively narrow case area, the results have more general implications for the development of effective strategies for responding to drought and other challenges associated with global climate change. Our analysis indicates that a strategic combination of irrigation, plus an insurance strategy, has higher return rates than either technique practiced on its own.

MethodsIn age- and gender-matched, untreated controls, four weeks of aldosterone/salt treatment (ALDO/salt, 0. 75 Î¼g/h + 1 % NaCl/ 0. 4 % KCl in drinking water), four weeks of ALDO/salt + furosemide (40 mg/kg in prepared food), and four weeks of ALDO/salt + furosemide + spironolactone (200 mg/kg/day in divided doses by twice-daily gavage), we monitored: 24 -h urinary Ca 2 +and Mg 2 +excretion; plasma-ionized [Ca 2 +]o and [Mg 2 +]o, K+, and parathyroid hormone (PTH); and bone mineral density (BMD) in the femur.

Plasma [Ca 2 +]o was reduced (p < 0. 05) at week 4 ALDO/salt + furosemide and was accompanied by hypokalemia (< 3. 4 mmol/l) that were rescued by spironolactone. Plasma PTH was increased (p < 0. 05) compared with controls (30 Â± 4 vs. 11 Â± 3 pg/ml, respectively), whereas BMD was decreased (p < 0. 05) with ALDO/salt and ALDO/salt + furosemide, but not with spironolactone co-treatment.

A number of factors [...] including the economic slowdown, a shift in business travel buying behavior, and the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks [...] contributed to these losses by reducing passenger and cargo volumes and depressing fares. To improve their financial position, many airlines cut costs by various means, notably by reducing labor expenditures and by decreasing capacity through cutting flight frequencies, using smaller aircraft, or eliminating service to some communities. Carriers have also reduced some airfares to encourage travel. Despite these efforts, several airlines filed for bankruptcy protection. It remains to be seen when the industry will emerge from this downturn. In response to the industry's financial condition, Congress has provided several forms of financial relief. In September 2001, Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which authorized payments of up to $ 4. 5 billion in pretax cash assistance to reimburse air carriers for losses incurred {{as a direct result of}} the 4 -day government shut-down of air traffic and <b>incremental</b> <b>losses</b> stemming from the terrorist attacks and also authorized up to $ 10 billion in loan guarantees to help airlines gain emergency access to capital. In January 2002, Congress appropriated $ 100 million for new or modified cockpit doors on commercial aircraft to improve security of the flight deck. In the fiscal year 2003 supplemental appropriations act, Congress appropriated $ 2. 4 billion in security cost relief for airlines. To provide information to Congress for its continuing deliberations about whether and, if so, how to provide additional help to the airline industry, we reviewed the payments of major commercial aviation taxes and fees over the last 5 years.

The approach taken to calculating probabilities of failure in the risk analysis model can have a significant influence on the magnitudes of key inputs to decisions about dam safety upgrades. Ignoring adjustment for common cause failure modes can lead to overestimation of the estimated total probability of failure and the annualised <b>incremental</b> <b>loss</b> of life, and underestimation of the cost per statistical life saved. A worked example is used to illustrate the importance of appropriate combination of probabilities in quantitative risk analysis...|$|R
40|$|Infection with HIV {{results in}} an <b>incremental</b> <b>loss</b> of T helper cell (TH) function, which can occur years before CD 4 cell numbers are {{critically}} reduced and AIDS is diagnosed. All TH function is not affected, however, because B cell activation and hypergammaglobulinema are also characteristic of this period. Recently, in a murine model of AIDS an early loss in production of the CD 4 cytokines IL- 2 and IFN-gamma was correlated {{with an increase in}} the B cell stimulatory cytokines IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10. We therefore assessed the production of IL- 4 generated by PBL from HIV-seropositive (HIV+) individuals who did not have AIDS, yet who exhibited different TH functional categories based on their IL- 2 production profiles. We observed that the decreases in recall antigen-stimulated IL- 2 production were accompanied by an increase in IL- 4 production. The loss of recall antigen-stimulated responses in HIV+ individuals could be reversed in vitro by anti-IL- 4 antibody. Our results suggest that the TH functions assessed by IL- 4 production replace the normally dominant TH function of antigen-stimulated IL- 2 production in the progression toward AIDS, and raise the possibility of cytokine cross-regulation in AIDS therapy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{demonstrate}} {{causal relationships}} between brain and behavior, investigators {{would like to}} guide brain stimulation using measurements of neural activity. Particularly promising in this context are electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), as they are linked by a reciprocity principle which, despite being known for decades, has not led to a formalism for relating EEG recordings to optimal stimulation parameters. Here we derive a closed-form expression for the TES configuration that optimally stimulates (i. e., targets) the sources of recorded EEG, without making assumptions about source location or distribution. We also derive a duality between TES targeting and EEG source localization, and demonstrate that in cases where source localization fails, so does the proposed targeting. Numerical simulations with multiple head models confirm these theoretical predictions and quantify the achieved stimulation in terms of focality and intensity. We show that constraining the stimulation currents automatically selects optimal montages that involve only a few (4 âˆ’ 7) electrodes, with only <b>incremental</b> <b>loss</b> in performance when targeting focal activations. The proposed technique allows brain scientists and clinicians to rationally target the sources of observed EEG and thus overcomes a major obstacle to the realization of individualized or closed-loop brain stimulation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an interactive graphics computational {{tool for the}} verification of prestressed concrete beams with post-tensioned bonded tendons to the serviceability limit state (SLS) stress check according to the Brazilian code NBR 6118 : 2014. The tool is an add-in for Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis Professional(r), {{which serves as a}} structural modeling platform. With data supplied by the user through a graphics user interface, the program here developed calculates all relevant prestress losses that occur throughout the structure's life-cycle, along with the prestress' equivalent loads during this period. The traditional calculation methods, obtained in the NBR 6118, are presented along with the modifications which had to be implemented in order to allow for <b>incremental</b> <b>loss</b> calculations. Usage examples and results are presented, validating the adopted methodology. At the end of the software's calculation, the user receives two outputs: the prestress' equivalent loads in the Robot model and an Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet contains the resultant stresses in the beam and warns whether these are greater than the permissible stresses in the SLS stress check. The loads may then be used in other calculations, such as shear reinforcement...|$|R
