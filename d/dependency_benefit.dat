40|$|We {{propose a}} class of Bayesian {{networks}} appropriate for structured prediction problems where the Bayesian network’s model structure {{is a function of}} the predicted output structure. These incremental sigmoid belief networks (ISBNs) make decoding possible because inference with partial output structures does not require summing over the unboundedly many compatible model structures, due to their directed edges and incrementally specified model structure. ISBNs are specifically targeted at challenging structured prediction problems such as natural language parsing, where learning the domain’s complex statistical <b>dependencies</b> <b>benefits</b> from large numbers of latent variables. While exact inference in ISBNs with large numbers of latent variables is not tractable, we propose two efficient approximations. First, we demonstrate that a previous neural network parsing model can be viewed as a coarse mean-field approximation to inference with ISBNs. We then derive a more accurate but still tractable variational approximation, which proves effective in artificial experiments. We compare the effectiveness of these models on a benchmark natural language parsing task, where they achieve accuracy competitive with the state-of-the-art. The model which is a closer approximation model of natural language grammar learning...|$|R

3000|$|With {{regard to}} young adults in receipt of {{benefits}} in particular, {{we have to take}} into account that growing up in poverty and welfare receipt can affect people’s aspirations and resources. At least this is argued by the “culture of poverty” thesis (Lewis 1968; Murray 1984; Wilson 1993), which states that long-term <b>benefits</b> <b>dependency</b> is a perceived phenomenon among a certain sub-population which is carried on by the next generation and which the activation of benefit policies cannot reach. The major argument of the culture of poverty thesis is that young people adopt a low work orientation during socialisation when they experience parental long-term unemployment and benefits receipt in their families (Bane and Ellwood 1994; Gebauer 2007). Young adults with low social background might then show in general a disengaged approach to training and employment as they might have learned to deal with benefits receipt while growing up. According to this view, it is assumed for the empirical analysis that young people with low social background should have few incentives to engage in any employment or training activities and exit <b>benefits</b> <b>dependency</b> (Hypothesis 3) [...]...|$|R

40|$|In 2005, the {{assistance}} {{for the long-term}} unemployed in Germany was restructured by the so-called „Hartz IV reform“. An {{important part of the}} reform was to replace the former different administrations by a single institution. However, in December 2007, the Federal Constitutional Court decided that the new institution is not consistent with the constitutional law of the Federal Republic of Germany. Thus, a reform of the institution or a change of the constitutional law is necessary. Different reform ideas have been proposed. However, all of them only solve the juristic problem. Not one single reform tries to improve the system. Therefore, the article introduces a new concept of incentive ethics. It shows how the <b>dependency</b> on <b>benefits</b> can be left out by allocating so-called moral goods to the long-term unemployed. A first empirical result supports the concept.
