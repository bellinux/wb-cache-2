5|$|At 06:00, Howell, who was {{in charge}} of a post to the right of the line, noticed the {{battalion}} on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie—who had assumed temporary command of the battalion—hurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the trench line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb fire. Forcing the Germans back along the trench, Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the trench firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhusting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into the trench wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, and when he was brought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed.|$|E
2500|$|Dieskau {{ordered his}} Canadians and Indians {{to follow up}} their success with an attack on Johnson's camp. However, with their morale already shaken {{by the loss of}} their leader, the Caughnawagas [...] "did not wish to attack an entrenched camp, the {{defenders}} of which included hundreds of their Mohawk kinsmen. The Abenakis would not go forward without the Caughnawagas, and neither would the Canadians". Hoping to shame the Indians into attacking, Dieskau formed his 222 French grenadiers into a column, six abreast, and led them in person along the Lake Road <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> where Johnson's camp was, around which Sir William had hurriedly constructed defensive barricades of [...] "wagons, overturned boats and hewn-down trees". Once the grenadiers were out in the open ground, the British gunners, crewing Johnson's three cannons, loaded up with grapeshot and cut [...] "lanes, streets and alleys" [...] through the French ranks. When Johnson was wounded and forced to retire to his tent for treatment, Gen. Phineas Lyman took over command. When Dieskau went down with a serious wound, the French attack was abandoned.|$|E
