25|$|As in a {{photographic}} lens, visual acuity {{is affected by}} the size of the pupil. Optical aberrations of the eye that decrease visual acuity are at a maximum when the pupil is largest (about 8mm), which occurs in low-light conditions. When the pupil is small (1–2mm), <b>image</b> <b>sharpness</b> may be limited by diffraction of light by the pupil (see diffraction limit). Between these extremes is the pupil diameter that is generally best for visual acuity in normal, healthy eyes; this tends to be around 3 or 4mm.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Image</b> <b>sharpness</b> {{is related}} to f/number through two {{different}} optical effects: aberration, due to imperfect lens design, [...] and diffraction {{which is due to}} the wave nature of light. The blur optimal f-stop varies with the lens design. For modern standard lenses having 6 or 7 elements, the sharpest image is often obtained around 5.6–8, while for older standard lenses having only 4 elements (Tessar formula) stopping to 11 will give the sharpest image. The larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations, allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower f-numbers. Even if aberration is minimized by using the best lenses, diffraction creates some spreading of the rays causing defocus. To offset that use the largest lens opening diameter possible (not the f/ number itself).|$|E

This paper presents results on the effects of camera-base distance (B) and JPEG coding on overall image quality, perceived depth, perceived sharpness, and perceived eye strain. In the experiment, two stereoscopic still scenes were used, varying in depth (three different camera-base distances: 0, 8, and 12 cm) and compression ratio (4 levels: original, 1 : 30, 1 : 40, and 1 : 60). All levels of compression were applied to both {{the left and right}} stereo image, resulting in a 4 × 4 matrix of all possible symmetric and asymmetric coding combinations. The observers were asked to assess <b>image</b> quality, <b>sharpness,</b> depth, and eye strain. Results showed that an increase in JPEG coding had a negative effect on <b>image</b> quality, <b>sharpness,</b> and eye strain, but had no effect on perceived depth. An increase in camera-base distance increased perceived depth and reported eye strain, but had no effect on perceived sharpness. Results on asymmetric and symmetric coding showed that the relationship between perceived image quality and average bit rate is not straightforward. In some cases, image quality ratings of a symmetric coded pair can be higher than for an asymmetric coded pair, even if the averaged bit rate for the symmetric pair is lower, than for the asymmetric pair. Furthermore, sharpness and eye strain correlated highly and medium, respectively, with perceived image quality...|$|R
