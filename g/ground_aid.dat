5000|$|Schoyer {{studied at}} Yale College, where {{he wrote and}} {{illustrated}} for campus humor magazine The Yale Record. The Residential College he was affiliated with was Pierson. After graduation in 1933, Schoyer taught English in Changsha, Hunan, for {{what was then the}} Yale-in-China Association, and returned to Yale to study Oriental literature and Chinese language. His return to China was cut short by the impending war. In 1940, he made a dramatic escape from Changsha. After the city had been bombed eight times, he led a group of twenty doctors, nurses, and wounded by junk to escape on the Xiang River after dark, only to be discovered and attacked on the river in the morning by a Japanese fighter plane. He managed to get the party out through Indo-China in six weeks. When the United States entered the war, he became a major in Air Intelligence, and created the Air <b>Ground</b> <b>Aid</b> Section (AGAS), which instructed airmen in how to evade or escape if downed behind enemy lines. He worked with Chinese guerrillas on several rescue operations. At the end of the war, he headed a mission to Shanghai to liberate seven thousand Allied prisoners being held in Japanese camps. For this work, Schoyer won the Legion of Merit and Soldier's Medal." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two different}} avionic systems which were designed and developed to provide guidance and control for two-segment noise abatement approaches. The {{concept of a}} low-cost retrofit avionic system evolved into a special-purpose two-segment computer which required a DME collocated with the ILS glide-slope transmitter. This system was evaluated in a Boeing 727 - 200 aircraft. The second system is an area navigation (RNAV) system modified to include the two-segment approach.

The methods for analysis of the dynamic electromagnetic and electromechanical processes in AEPS of the <b>ground</b> <b>aid</b> (GA) have been developed, imroved and generalized; the recommendations on the design of system element with improved mass-power and dynamic characteristics have been obtained. The efficiency criterium, synthesis methods, numerical algorithms and program complex for investigation of the electronmagnetic and electromechanical processes and determination of the rational structures in AEPS of perspective GA have been developed. The results have been used in the Special Design Department "Granat" and Design Department "Tochmash" at performing detail and conceptual design of the autonomous power supply systems. The design times of the power supply system for ground aids have been reduced.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the U. S. government's disaster recovery and reconstruction program for countries that have been devastated by hurricanes. GAO found that the Agency for International Development (AID) and other U. S. agencies are using the disaster recovery assistance to bring about economic recovery, improve public health and access to education, provide permanent housing for displaced families, and improve disaster mitigation and preparedness. To achieve these broad objectives, AID is funding infrastructure construction and repair, technical assistance and training, loans for farmers and small businesses, and some commodities. After initial start-up problems, the U. S. disaster recovery and reconstruction program is proceeding, and most activities are scheduled for completion on or before December 31, 2001, as AID and congressional staff had informally agreed. To help ensure that funds are spent as intended, AID has channeled much of the disaster recovery assistance funding through cooperating partners with proven track records, contracted with management and financial services firms to handle disbursement to vulnerable partners, and hired contractors to monitor project quality. Although some activities have not gone as smoothly as planned, the missions have responded to concerns as they arose. The {{bottom line is that}} AID lacked the mechanisms to quickly design and implement a large-scale infrastructure program with relatively short-range deadlines. The disaster recovery and reconstruction projects GAO examined are neither short-term emergency relief nor long-term development assistance [...] more typical AID programs. As a result, AID staff faced many challenges to get the program off the <b>ground.</b> <b>AID</b> has begun an agency-wide review of its disaster recovery efforts with emphasis on improving its planning for and delivery of disaster recovery assistance. ...|$|E

While active, {{there were no}} deaths linked to the storm.
