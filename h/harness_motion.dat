40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{increasing}} the weaving efficdency of power loom by reduclng warp breakage，we considered 	the warp strain in weaving and planned and made fIve different shedding tappets for plain weave. For 	them we tested on {{the relation between the}} heald <b>harness</b> <b>motion</b> and warp tension， and the break of warp 	in weaving. 	Following resultsare obtained. 	(1) The tension of lifted warp is smaller than the tension of depressed warp. 	(2) The variety of depressed warp tension is more sudden than the variety of lifted warp tension. 	(3) The tappet whose dwell of small radius is 0 °，moves　most smoothly and keeps the most smooth variety 	to the warp tension. 	(4) The tappet whose dwell is small，reduce sboth the warp tension and the variety of warp tension. But 	when the loom moves at h 1 gh speed，the upper side of shuttle touches the warp and consequently the breaks 	of warp are increaed. 	(5) When the dwell of tappet is equaI in slze， the motion of heald harness which reduce its speed in 	inverse propotion to the warp tension bring better effect than the harmonic motion...|$|E

40|$|Body sensor {{networks}} are increasingly popular in healthcare, sports, military and security. However, the power supply from conventional batteries {{is a key}} bottleneck {{for the development of}} body condition monitoring. Energy harvesting from human motion to power wearable or implantable devices is a promising alternative. This paper presents an airflow energy harvester to <b>harness</b> human <b>motion</b> energy from footsteps. An air bladder-turbine energy harvester is designed to convert the footstep motion into electrical energy. The bladders are embedded in shoes to induce airflow from foot-strikes. The turbine is employed to generate electrical energy from airflow. The design parameters of the turbine rotor, including the blade number and the inner diameter of the blades (the diameter of the turbine shaft), were optimized using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. A prototype was developed and tested with footsteps from a 65 kg person. The peak output power of the harvester was first measured for different resistive loads and showed a maximum value of 90. 6 mW with a 30. 4 Ω load. The harvested energy was then regulated and stored in a power management circuit. 14. 8 mJ was stored in the circuit from 165 footsteps, which means 90 μJ was obtained per footstep. The regulated energy was finally used to fully power a fitness tracker which consists of a pedometer and a Bluetooth module. 7. 38 mJ was consumed by the tracker per Bluetooth configuration and data transmission.

40|$|Two switchable, palindromically {{constituted}} bistable [3]rotaxanes {{have been}} designed and synthesized {{with a pair of}} mechanically mobile rings encircling a single dumbbell. These designs are reminiscent of a “molecular muscle” for the purposes of amplifying and <b>harnessing</b> molecular mechanical <b>motions.</b> The location of the two cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT^(4 +)) rings can be controlled to be on either tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) or naphthalene (NP) stations, either chemically (1 H NMR spectroscopy) or electrochemically (cyclic voltammetry), such that switching of inter-ring distances from 4. 2 to 1. 4 nm mimics the contraction and extension of skeletal muscle, albeit on a shorter length scale. Fast scan-rate cyclic voltammetry at low temperatures reveals stepwise oxidations and movements of one-half of the [3]rotaxane and then of the other, a process that appears to be concerted at room temperature. The active form of the bistable [3]rotaxane bears disulfide tethers attached covalently to both of the CBPQT^(4 +) ring components for the purpose of its self-assembly onto a gold surface. An array of flexible microcantilever beams, each coated on one side with a monolayer of 6 billion of the active bistable [3]rotaxane molecules, undergoes controllable and reversible bending up and down when it is exposed to the synchronous addition of aqueous chemical oxidants and reductants. The beam bending is correlated with flexing of the surface-bound molecular muscles, whereas a monolayer of the dumbbell alone is inactive under the same conditions. This observation supports the hypothesis that the cumulative nanoscale movements within surface-bound “molecular muscles” can be harnessed to perform larger-scale mechanical work...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Managing spinal {{deformities}} {{in young}} children is challenging, particularly early onset scoliosis (EOS). Surgical intervention is often required if EOS has been unresponsive to conservative treatment particularly with rapidly progressive curves. An emerging treatment option for EOS is fusionless scoliosis surgery. Similar to bracing, this surgical option potentially <b>harnesses</b> growth, <b>motion</b> and function of the spine along with correcting spinal deformity. Dual growing rods are one such fusionless treatment, which aims to modulate growth of the vertebrae. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain the extent to which semiconstrained growing rods (Medtronic, Sofamor, Danek, Memphis, TN) with a telescopic sleeve component, reduce rotational constraint on the spine compared with standard "constrained / rigid" rods and hence potentially provide a more physiological mechanical environment for the growing spine. METHODS Six 40 - 60 kg English Large White porcine spines served as a model for the paediatric human spine. Each spine was dissected into a 7 level thoracolumbar multi-segment unit (MSU), removing all non-ligamentous soft tissues and leaving 3 cm of ribs either side. Pure nondestructive axial rotation moments of ± 4 Nm at a constant rotation rate of 8 deg. s- 1 were applied to the mounted MSU spines using a biaxial Instron testing machine. Displacement of each vertebral level was captured using a 3 D motion tracking system (Optotrak 3020, Northern Digital Inc, Waterloo, ON). Each spine was tested in an un-instrumented state first and then with appropriately sized semi-constrained growing rods and rigid rods in alternating sequence. The rods were secured by multi-axial pedicle screws (Medtronic CD Horizon) at levels 2 and 6 of the construct. The range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ) size and stiffness (Nm. deg- 1) were calculated from the Instron load-displacement data and intervertebral ROM was calculated through a MATLAB algorithm from Optotrak data. RESULTS Irrespective of the order of testing, rigid rods significantly reduced the total ROM compared with semi-constrained rods (p< 0. 05) with in a significantly stiffer spine for both left and right axial rotation (p< 0. 05). Analysing the intervertebral motion within the instrumented levels 2 - 6, rigid rods showed reduced ROM compared with semi-constrained growing rods and compared with un-instrumented motion segments. CONCLUSION Semi-constrained growing rods maintain similar stiffness in axial rotation to un-instrumented spines, while dual rigid rods significantly reduce axial rotation. Clinically the effect of semi-constrained growing rods as observed in this study is that they would be expected to allow growth via the telescopic rod components while maintaining the axial flexibility of the spine, which may reduce occurrence of the crankshaft phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{significance of}} DNA is primarily attributed to its sequence information. On the other hand, the mechanical properties of DNA {{can play a}} critical role in a wide variety of biological processes. One prime example is DNA looping in the context of transcriptional regulation. The emergence of single molecule tracking techniques in the last two decades presents an unprecedented opportunity for studying looping kinetics. One such powerful technique, tethered particle <b>motion</b> (TPM), <b>harnesses</b> the Brownian <b>motion</b> of a microsphere as a means of reporting on the excursion of its tethered molecule, such as DNA. The present work focuses on a looping system found in Escherichia coli, which is mediated by the Lac repressor (LacI) protein. TPM is used to measure individual, real-time looping/unlooping events in DNA of various length and sequence characteristics. By monitoring the magnitude, frequency, and time interval of these features while tuning different parameters, such as LacI concentration, DNA length and DNA sequence, one can survey a host of important information about looping kinetics. A measurement of the LacI concentration dependence of looping probability was found to be in quantitative agreement with a simple thermodynamic model, which also led to the measurement of free energy of LacI-mediated looping, the first such measurement in a single molecule, in vitro setting. A quantitative characterization of free energy was obtained under conditions of different inter-operator spacing, systematically varied from 300 to 310 base pairs in one-base-pair increments. An important conclusion from this study is that free energy is modulated by DNA’s helical structure, yet the energy difference between the aligned and unaligned operator configurations is small compared to expectation from simple polymer physics. TPM measurements also revealed an additional looped state, lending support to the hypothesis that two distinct conformations of LacI, the closed and open forms, can coexist. This study also confirmed that the presence of certain DNA sequences, particularly TA pairs in the minor groove of the nucleosomal positioning sequence, makes DNA substantially softer than a corresponding random sequence. This provides direct support for the notion of sequence-dependent DNA elasticity. Finally, a surprising result is that loops as short as 100 base pairs-only two-thirds the persistence length of DNA-can form by LacI-DNA binding. Classical elasticity theory almost forbids this, suggesting that LacI itself plays a more direct role in the bending process, or classical understanding of DNA elasticity breaks down at length scales comparable to its persistence length...|$|R
