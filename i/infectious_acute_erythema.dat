40|$|To {{determine}} the clinical efficacy of combined vaccination with 23 -valent pneumococcal vaccine (PV) and influenza vaccine (IV) against pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases (CLD), we conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled study among 167 adults with CLD over a 2 -year period. Subjects {{were randomly assigned}} to a PV + IV group (n = 87) or an IV group (n = 80). The number of patients with CLD experiencing <b>infectious</b> <b>acute</b> exacerbation (P = 0. 022), but not pneumonia (P = 0. 284), was significantly lower in the PV + IV group compared with the IV group. When these subjects were divided into subgroups, an additive effect of PV with IV in preventing <b>infectious</b> <b>acute</b> exacerbation was significant only in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (P = 0. 037).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{widespread}} {{clinical use}} of cryogen spray cooling (CSC) {{in conjunction with}} laser dermatologic surgery, in vivo cutaneous effects have not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The authors characterize the in vivo cutaneous effects for Fitzpatrick skin types I through VI after CSC exposures of varying spurt durations and spurt delivery patterns (single vs. multiple spurts). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-seven normal human subjects were exposed to single cryogen spurts from 10 to 80 milliseconds, and multiple spurt patterns consisting of two 20 -millisecond spurts, four 10 -millisecond spurts, and eight 5 -millisecond spurts. Subjects were evaluated by clinical observation and photography at 1 hour, 1 day, and 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after CSC exposure. RESULTS: <b>Acute</b> <b>erythema</b> and urticaria (1 - 24 hours) were noted in 14 of 27 and 3 of 27 subjects, respectively. Transient hyperpigmentation occurred in 4 of 27 subjects (skin types III-VI) but resolved spontaneously without medical intervention in all subjects by 8 weeks. No permanent skin changes were noted in any subjects. Skin reactions were more common with longer single-spurt durations (50 milliseconds or greater) and multiple spurt patterns. CONCLUSION: <b>Acute</b> <b>erythema,</b> urticaria, and, less commonly, transient hyperpigmentation were observed after CSC exposure.

40|$|The {{wavelength}} dependence for UVA-induced {{cumulative damage}} {{was investigated in}} human skin. Epidermal changes (stratum corneum thickening, viable epidermal thickening sunburn cell production), as well as dermal alterations (lysozyme deposition, inflammation), were used as indices of cumulative photoperturbation. UVA wavelengths between 320 lint and 345 nm were more effective than longer wavelengths (360 – 400 nm) in inducing viable epidermal thickening. Similarly, the shorter wavelengths (320 – 345 nm) elicited more sunburn cells, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. All UVA bands were equally effective in inducing the dermal markers. At equal fluences, wavelengths > 400 nm produced no measurable cutaneous alterations. These findings suggest that (i) chronic epidermal and dermal damages have different spectral dependence and (ii) the action spectrum for dermal damage in the UVA is broad, extending up to 400 nm and {{is different from the}} <b>acute</b> <b>erythema</b> spectrum in humans...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac {{angiography}} produces one of {{the highest}} radiation exposures of any commonly used diagnostic x ray procedure. Recently, serious radiation induced skin injuries have been reported after repeated therapeutic interventional procedures using prolonged fluoroscopic imaging. Two male patients, aged 62  and 71  years, in whom chronic radiodermatitis developed one to two years after two consecutive cardiac catheterisation procedures are reported. Both patients had undergone lengthy procedures using prolonged fluoroscopic guidance in a limited number of projections. The resulting skin lesions were preceded, in one case, by an <b>acute</b> <b>erythema</b> and took the form of a delayed pigmented telangiectatic, indurated, or ulcerated plaque in the upper back or below the axilla whose site corresponded to the location of the x ray tube during cardiac catheterisation. Cutaneous side effects of radiation exposure result from direct damage to the irradiated tissue and have known thresholds. The diagnosis of radiation induced skin injury relies essentially on clinical and histopathological findings, location of skin lesions, and careful medical history. Interventional cardiologists should be aware of this complication, because chronic radiodermatitis may result in painful and resistant ulceration and eventually in squamous cell carcinoma.    Keywords: catheterisation; angiography; radiation; radiodermatitis; skin injur...|$|R

40|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>infectious</b> {{mononucleosis}} is {{a widespread}} viral disease, which most often manifests in childhood. The development of <b>acute</b> <b>infectious</b> mononucleosis is accompanied by the change of the CD 4 +/CD 8 + T-lymphocytes ratio and the increase of the virus-specific CD 8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocytes number. One of the T-lymphocytes number regulation mechanisms is the modulation of their progenitor cells apoptosis. The death receptor CD 95 takes part in the regulation of T-lymphocytes apoptosis, including naïve T-cells. We studied the effect of CD 95 receptor activation on apoptosis of naïve CD 4 + and naïve cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes in healthy children and children with <b>acute</b> <b>infectious</b> mononucleosis. In this study children with <b>acute</b> <b>infectious</b> mononucleosis {{at the age of}} 9 to 16 years were included. For comparison healthy children of the same age with no clinical and laboratory signs of the disease were used. Naïve CD 4 + and naïve cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes were isolated by negative magnetic immunoseparation. The analysis of naïve T-cells apoptosis and the CD 95 receptor surface expression density was performed by using the flow cytometry analysis. The analysis of T-cells was performed in three variants: freshly isolated naïve CD 4 + T-lymphocytes and naïve cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes, and also cells after 24 hours of the cultivation with anti-CD 95 monoclonal antibodies or without them. In healthy children both CD 95 – and CD 95 + naïve CD 4 + T-lymphocytes underwent apoptosis. In children with <b>acute</b> <b>infectious</b> mononucleosis CD 95 – naïve CD 4 + T-lymphocytes lost their susceptibility to apoptosis induction. In healthy children and children with <b>acute</b> <b>infectious</b> mononucleosis CD 95 – naïve cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes were resistant to apoptosis in contrast to CD 95 + naïve CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. In healthy children CD 95 receptor did not induce apoptosis of isolated naïve CD 4 + T-lymphocytes and naïve cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes. In children with <b>acute</b> <b>infectious</b> mononucleosis CD 95 receptor was involved in inhibition of apoptosis of naïve cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes and did not effect on the level of apoptosis of naïve CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. We suggest that CD 95 -dependent suppression of naïve cytotoxic CD 8 + T-lymphocytes apoptosis is a protective mechanism for the maintenance of a sufficient number of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in the blood for the realization of effective antiviral immune response...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Forty-one patients included in this study, during (17) or after (24) their radiation treatment for head and neck (26), breast (9), gynecological (3) or other (3) cancer. Skin fibroblasts were established and radiosensitivity was measured. The surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF 2) was calculated and compared to the maxi-mum grade of <b>acute</b> (<b>erythema,</b> desquamation, mucositis, ulceration) and late reactions (atrophy, fibrosis, xerostomia, telangiectasia). Follow-up ranged between 12 and 178 months (median 30). Results: SF 2 ranged between 0. 16 and 0. 56 (mean 0. 34). The inter-patients coefficient of variation (CV) was 26 %. The intra-patient CV was 18 %. There was a statisti-cally significant correlation between fibroblasts SF 2 and the maximum grade of late (p = 0. 012; 40 patients), but not acute complications (p = 0. 70; 36 patients). There was no correlation between acute and late reactions (p> 0. 05; 34 patients).
