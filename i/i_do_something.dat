500|$|Boycott and Denness {{did not get}} on well, {{and at the end}} of {{the tour}} they clashed over Boycott's {{preference}} for a one-day match over a three-day game against Bermuda. Boycott recalled in his autobiography that when Denness confronted him on the issue he replied [...] "Get out of here before <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> I'll regret." [...] Boycott had [...] "no confidence in Denness's professional ability and no respect for him as a man and another tour like the previous one to the West Indies was the last thing I wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 8, 2007, {{during the}} concert in St. Louis, {{two people in}} the crowd who {{attended}} the show suffered burns after pyrotechnics meant for the stage tumbled into the audience; Knowles visited them in the hospital after the show. During the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] at the Orlando, Florida show on July 24, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs. Her heel got caught in the bottom on her long coat and she tripped down; she quickly picked herself up and carried on with the show. After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although she knew they would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World. A spokesperson for the singer said she was not injured during the fall, which she described as a [...] "mere spot on an otherwise sensational, flawless show" [...] adding, [...] "Miss Knowles picked herself right up, without missing a beat, showing to all that she is the best." [...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like that I always perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they got a really good show in the end." [...] During her performance in Toronto on August 25, while performing [...] "Déjà Vu", Knowles had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer revealed that the speculations weren't true, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the incidents, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect. A tumble down the stairs onstage in Orlando and a subsequent 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “ They {{are both}} great players and they {{achieved}} {{a great deal}} in their careers but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different. They are all focused on their results. They want to win, they want to achieve their goals, and of course so do I. The difference is that I put my focus elsewhere. Bushido teaches that to walk [...] "The Path" [...] is a goal in itself. Results are places on the road that will happen as you take the journey, but they are not the focus. The process is where my focus is and it is where I differ from every other Danish Player in history.” - speaking of fellow country-men Anders Boesen and Kenneth Johnassen after the 2002 European Championships.|$|E

2500|$|Yorke {{wrote of}} meeting Donwood at university: [...] "He {{had a better}} hat and suit on than me. That pissed me off. So I figured I'd either end up really not liking this person at all, or working {{with him for the}} rest of my life." [...] Donwood said his first {{impression}} of Yorke was that he was [...] "mouthy. Pissed off. Someone I could work with." [...] Whereas Donwood, in his own words, has a [...] "tendency towards Virgo-like detailing and perfectionism", Yorke is [...] "completely opposed, fucking everything up ... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>something,</b> then he fucks it up, then I fuck up what he’s done … and we keep doing that until we’re happy with the result. It’s a competition to see who 'wins' the painting, which one of us takes possession of it in an artistic way."

2500|$|Jo Ann Compton's {{daughter}} Laurie Ann {{was stabbed}} to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. [...] "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in," [...] she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He {{asked her if she}} thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain—and Compton said no. [...] "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," [...] Phil continued. [...] "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." [...] After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: [...] "I never thought of it that way." [...] Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: [...] "She continues to stay alive every time <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> positive." [...] Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said [...] "She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation." ...|$|E
