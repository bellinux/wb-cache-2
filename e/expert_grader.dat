40|$|PURPOSE. We {{examined}} {{agreement among}} {{experts in the}} assessment of corneal subbasal nerve tortuosity. METHODS. Images of corneal subbasal nerves were obtained from investigators at seven sites (Auckland, Boston, Linkoping, Manchester, Oslo, Rostock, and Sydney) using laser-scanning in vivo confocal microscopy. A set of 30 images was assembled and ordered by increasing tortuosity by 10 <b>expert</b> <b>graders</b> from the seven sites. In a first experiment, graders assessed tortuosity without a specific definition and performed grading three times, with at least 1 week between sessions. In a second experiment, graders assessed the same image set using four focused tortuosity definitions. Intersession and intergrader repeatability for the experiments were determined using the Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS. <b>Expert</b> <b>graders</b> without a specific tortuosity definition had high intersession (Spearman correlation coefficient 0. 80), but poor intergrader (0. 62) repeatability. Specific definitions improved intergrader repeatability to 0. 79. In particular, tortuosity defined by frequent small-amplitude directional changes (short range tortuosity) or by infrequent large-amplitude directional changes (long range tortuosity), indicated largely independent measures and resulted in improved repeatability across the graders. A further refinement, grading only the most tortuous nerve in a given image, improved the average correlation of a given graders ordering of images with the group average to 0. 86 to 0. 90. CONCLUSIONS. Definitions of tortuosity specifying short or long-range tortuosity and considering only the most tortuous nerve in an image improved the agreement in tortuosity grading among a group of expert observers. These definitions could improve accuracy and consistency in quantifying subbasal nerve tortuosity in clinical studies. uj</p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy and tolerability {{of using a}} 4 % hydroquinone/ 0. 05 % tretinoin skin care system compared with standard treatment of cleanser plus healing ointment to enhance aesthetic outcomes resulting from electrodesiccation and curettage treatment for superficial truncal basal cell carcinomas. Design: Multicenter, investigator-masked, randomized, parallel-group study. Patients received either the hydroquinone/tretinoin system or the standard treatment twice daily for three weeks before and after electrodesiccation and curettage (postelectrodesiccation and curettage, lesions received standard treatment until reepithelialization was > 75 percent; assigned treatment regimens then resumed). Setting: Patients attending academic, institutional, and private dermatology clinics. Participants: 51 patients with 1 to 3 superficial truncal basal cell carcinomas. Measurements: The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of treatment success for scar cosmesis, defined as a global assessment of excellent or good wound appearance (on a scale of excellent, good, fair, and poor), as evaluated by the investigators. After {{the end of the}} study, seven <b>expert</b> masked <b>graders</b> (dermatologists or plastic surgeons) reviewed the photographs from all of the lesions and also evaluated global assessment. Results: The incidence of treatment success in the hydroquinone/tretinoin and standard treatment groups was 72 percent versus 63 percent according to the masked investigators and 45 to 68 percent versus 20 to 44 percent, respectively, according to the seven <b>expert</b> masked <b>graders.</b> All the <b>expert</b> <b>graders</b> reported a higher incidence of treatment success with the hydroquinone/ tretinoin system than with standard treatment and this difference was statistically significant for five of the seven graders. Conclusion: The adjunctive use of the hydroquinone/tretinoin skin care system may offer enhanced aesthetic results postelectrodesiccation and curettage compared with standard treatment.

40|$|Homework is {{frequently}} {{viewed as a}} necessary evil—one of the least exciting parts of teaching, but absolutely essential if students are to learn the material. There are many reasons for this attitude. Reusing the same assignments year after year invites cheating (Gehringer 2004) and devising challenging new work is time consuming. Grading is drudgery for faculty or teaching assistants, especially if the class is large. Finally, since each student is given the same assignment, their efforts are largely redundant. Everyone answers the same questions or solves the same problems with negligible long-term benefits. By contrast, assignments such as essays, design projects, or research reports should present an opportunity for individual expression, but evaluation {{of these kinds of}} projects must respond personally to each student's work to be effective. In such cases instructors and TAs rarely have enough time to give sufficient feedback. Peer review offers a solution to some of these problems and promises important advantages for students, whether they are acting as assessors or assessees. As assessors, students spend time reviewing, summarizing, diagnosing misconceived knowledge, and considering deviations from the ideal (Van Lehn et al. 1995). As assessees, students write for an audience where they have the burden of making themselves understood, rather than depending on an <b>expert</b> <b>grader</b> to decipher their intentions. Their peers are likely to give them more feedback than they would receive from an overworked TA or instructor. Many studies of pee...|$|E

Dyschromia and fine lines/wrinkles are common clinical manifestations of photodamaged skin. Purpose: This single-center clinical trial {{was conducted to}} assess the efficacy and tolerability of a new multifunctional facial primer (camouflage, broad-spectrum SPF 50, and a treatment for hyperpigmentation) when used by females with mild-to-moderate facial hyperpigmentation and fine lines due to photoaging over a course of 12 weeks. Patients and methods: Subjects were provided test material (Even Up-Clinical Pigment Perfector) and supporting products to use on their face and neck. Products were used according to specific application instructions. Clinical grading for efficacy and tolerability assessments were performed by an <b>expert</b> <b>grader</b> at baseline, baseline (post-application primer), week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 12 (post-application primer). Standardized digital photographs were taken, and self-assessment questionnaires were conducted. Results: Twenty-eight female subjects completed the 12 -week trial. The facial primer improved scores for the appearance of hyperpigmentation and other photoaging parameters immediately after the first application. The treatment also showed a progressive improvement in the clinical assessment of hyperpigmentation and other photoaging parameters over the 12 -week trial. These long-term benefits {{can be attributed to}} an improvement in the underlying skin condition. The facial primer was well tolerated.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} atypical retardation patterns (ARP) on detection of progressive retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) loss using scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (VCC). DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: The study included 377 eyes of 221 patients with a median follow-up of 4. 0 years. Images were obtained annually with the GDx VCC (Carl Zeiss Med, itec Inc, Dublin, California, USA), along with optic disc stereophotographs and standard automated perimetry (SAP) visual fields. Progression {{was determined by the}} Guided Progression Analysis software for SAP and by masked assessment of stereophotographs by <b>expert</b> <b>graders.</b> The typical scan score (TSS) was used to quantify the presence of ARPs on GDx VCC images. Random coefficients models were used to {{evaluate the}} relationship between ARP and RNFL thickness measurements over time. RESULTS: Thirty-eight eyes (10 %) showed progression over time on visual fields, stereophotographs, or both. Changes in TSS scores from baseline were significantly associated with changes in RNFL thickness measurements in both progressing and nonprogressing eyes. Each I unit increase in TSS score was associated with a 0. 19 -mu m decrease in RNFL thickness measurement (P <. 001) over time. CONCLUSIONS: ARPs had a significant effect on detection of progressive RNFL loss with the GDx VCC. Eyes with large amounts of atypical patterns, great fluctuations on these patterns over time, or both may show changes in measurements that can appear falsely as glaucomatous progression or can mask true changes in the RNFL.

The quality (i. e. {{the appearance of the}} leaves, and the color and flavor of the infusion) of 69 samples was evaluated by <b>expert</b> <b>graders,</b> and samples were grouped into four quality grades. Using descriptive analysis sensory profiles of the rooibos samples were developed and 121 aroma, flavor, taste, and mouthfeel descriptors were generated. A rooibos sensory wheel was created by selecting 27 flavor, taste and mouthfeel attributes and grouping these terms together to form a logical, convenient and user-friendly overview of the sensory descriptors associated with rooibos. The most frequently occurring descriptors were selected to compile a rooibos sensory lexicon of 14 flavor, taste and mouthfeel attributes along with a definition and reference standard for each term. It was found that the term "characteristic" rooibos flavor may be described as a combination of honey, woody and herbal-floral notes with a slightly sweet taste and subtle astringency. Also, differences in the sensory characteristics between and within different quality grades were established with low-quality tea often being associated with green, hay-like and musty flavors and a bitter or sour taste. High-quality tea was generally associated with pleasant rooibos attributes including honey, woody, floral and caramel notes and a sweet taste.

The need for screening has been demonstrated in industrialized and developing nations alike. Populations of particular interest for macular screening services include individuals {{at high risk for}} diabetes, not just diagnosed diabetics, since a significant proportion of those with diabetes do not realize it. Individuals who know they have diabetes are frequently not examined at the recommended intervals. Related populations include patients with a high likelihood of retinal vascular disease and high blood pressure. A second population is older individuals, who are at risk for age-related macular degeneration and degenerative myopia, key causes of vision loss depending upon geographic location and ethnicity. Images showing the complexity of lesions from diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and degenerative myopia illustrate the challenges of screening and classification. A third population to be screened is the large pediatric one. While many children are at risk for developing myopia, which could lead to high myopia, the risk of myopia and retinal damage is far more common in individuals who had low birth weight or premature birth. A variety of types of screening instrumentation are discussed in terms of practicality of use and cost. The technical challenges in populations with dark eyes, small pupils, and poor anterior-segment media are discussed. We discuss the wealth of screening strategies, from permanent sites with trained staff and <b>expert</b> <b>graders</b> to planned campaigns that target specific populations. Successful screening systems include instrumentation that is used within its limits, feedback and supervision during screening and grading, and clear pathways for referral for a complete examination or treatment.

40|$|International audienceMany eye fundus images present strong {{variations}} of contrast {{which can be}} a limitation to the diagnosis of the retinopathy. Either some lesions are not taken into account or only a limited part of the domain of the image can be read. Graders have to manually adjust the contrast, which is tedious and not easily reproducible. We have developed an automatic system, which standardises the colour contrast across the whole domain of the image. The method is consistent with the physical principles or image formation and ensures that the colour aspect of lesions such as micro-aneurysms or anatomical structures such as veins are similar. It is more powerful than the existing grey level methods. We have tested our approach on several thousand images acquired in good or in harsher conditions. Some were bright while others were dark. <b>Expert</b> <b>graders</b> have checked the enhanced images. Diagnosis becomes more obvious and the grading more comfortable. Another limitation for the diagnosis is that images of the same patient acquired for different examinations cannot be directly superimposed. Indeed, the eye of the patient is never in the exact same position, the image is a projection of a 3 D scene into the plane of the sensor, the optics of the camera creates a radial deformation and the colour of the image may have changed. We have developed an automatic method to superimpose eye fundus images acquired in the same position (nasal or macular). It is based on contrast standardisation, matching of salient points and a deformation model taking into account two radial distortions. We have performed tests for 69 patients with pairs of retinal examinations acquired in good conditions at an interval of one year with and without the same camera. A similar test has been performed on 5 patients with 20 pairs acquired in harsher conditions. A minimum of 96 % of pairs were correctly superimposed.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{evaluate}} and compare rates {{of change in}} neuro-retinal rim area (RA) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements in glaucoma patients, those with suspected glaucoma, and normal subjects observed over time. METHODS. In this observational cohort study, patients recruited from two longitudinal studies (Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study-DIGS and African Descent and Evaluation Study-ADAGES) were observed with standard achromatic perimetry (SAP), optic disc stereophotographs, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT- 3; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), and scanning laser polarimetry (GDx-VCC; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA). Glaucoma progression {{was determined by the}} Guided Progression Analysis software for standard automated perimetry [SAP] and by masked assessment of serial optic disc stereophotographs by <b>expert</b> <b>graders.</b> Random-coefficients models were used to evaluate rates of change in average RNFLT and global RA measurements and their relationship with glaucoma progression. RESULTS. At baseline, 194 (31 %) eyes were glaucomatous, 347 (55 %) had suspected glaucoma, and 88 (14 %) were normal. Forty-six (9 %) eyes showed progression by SAP and/or stereophotographs, during an average follow-up of 3. 3 (+/- 0. 7) years. The average rate of decline for RNFLT measurements was significantly higher in the progressing group than in the non-progressing group (- 0. 65 vs. - 0. 11 mu m/y, respectively; P < 0. 001), whereas RA decline was not significantly different between these groups (- 0. 0058 vs. - 0. 0073 mm(2) /y, respectively; P = 0. 727). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves used to discriminate progressing versus nonprogressing eyes were 0. 811 and 0. 507 for the rates of change in the RNFLT and RA, respectively (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS. The ability to discriminate eyes with progressing glaucoma by SAP and/or stereophotographs from stable eyes was significantly greater for RNFLT than for RA measurements.

Drusen identification and measurement {{play a key role in}} clinical studies of this disease. Current manual methods of drusen measurement are laborious and subjective. Our purpose was to expedite clinical research with an accurate, reliable digital method. Methods An interactive semi-automated procedure was developed to level the macular background reflectance for the purpose of morphometric analysis of drusen. 12 color fundus photographs of patients with age-related macular degeneration and drusen were analyzed. After digitizing the photographs, the underlying background pattern in the green channel was leveled by an algorithm based on the elliptically concentric geometry of the reflectance in the normal macula: the gray scale values of all structures within defined elliptical boundaries were raised sequentially until a uniform background was obtained. Segmentation of drusen and area measurements in the central and middle subfields (1000 μm and 3000 μm diameters) were performed by uniform thresholds. Two observers using this interactive semi-automated software measured each image digitally. The mean digital measurements were compared to independent stereo fundus gradings by two <b>expert</b> <b>graders</b> (stereo Grader 1 estimated the drusen percentage in each of the 24 regions as falling into one of four standard broad ranges; stereo Grader 2 estimated drusen percentages in 1 % to 5 % intervals). Results The mean digital area measurements had a median standard deviation of 1. 9 %. The mean digital area measurements agreed with stereo Grader 1 in 22 / 24 cases. The 95 % limits of agreement between the mean digital area measurements and the more precise stereo gradings of Grader 2 were - 6. 4 % to + 6. 8 % in the central subfield and - 6. 0 % to + 4. 5 % in the middle subfield. The mean absolute differences between the digital and stereo gradings 2 were 2. 8 +/- 3. 4 % in the central subfield and 2. 2 +/- 2. 7 % in the middle subfield. Conclusions Semi-automated, supervised drusen measurements may be done reproducibly and accurately with adaptations of commercial software. This technique for macular image analysis has potential for use in clinical research. </p...|$|R
40|$|As {{automated}} scoring {{of complex}} constructed-response examinations reaches operational status, {{the process of}} {{evaluating the quality of}} resultant scores, particularly in contrast to scores of <b>expert</b> human <b>graders,</b> becomes as complex as the data itself. Using a vignette from the Architectural Registration Examination (ARE), this paper explores the potential utility of classification and regression trees (CART) and Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) as tools to facilitate subject matter expert (SME) examination of the fine-grained (feature level) quality of automated scores for complex data, with implications for the validity of the resultant scores. The paper explores both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, the former being represented by CART (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984) and the latter by SOM (Kohonen, 1989). Three applications comprise this investigation, the first of which suggests that CART can facilitate efficient and economical identification of specific elements of complex solutions that contribute to automated and human score discrepancies. The second application builds on the first by exploring CART’s value for efficiently and accurately automating case selection for human intervention to ensure score validity. The final application explores th...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} the GDx Variable Corneal Compensation (VCC) Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) software for detecting glaucomatous progression. Design: Observational cohort study. Participants: The study included 453 eyes from 252 individuals followed for an average of 46 +/- 14 months as part of the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study. At baseline, 29 % of the eyes were classified as glaucomatous, 67 % of the eyes were classified as suspects, and 5 % of the eyes were classified as healthy. Methods: Images were obtained annually with the GDx VCC and analyzed for progression using the Fast Mode of the GDx GPA software. Progression using conventional methods was determined by the GPA software for standard automated achromatic perimetry (SAP) and by masked assessment of optic disc stereophotographs by <b>expert</b> <b>graders.</b> Main Outcome Measures: Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) for detection of glaucoma progression using the GDx GPA were calculated with SAP and optic disc stereophotographs used as reference standards. Agreement among the different methods was reported using the AC(1) coefficient. Results: Thirty-four of the 431 glaucoma and glaucoma suspect eyes (8 %) showed progression by SAP or optic disc stereophotographs. The GDx GPA detected 17 of these eyes for a sensitivity of 50 %. Fourteen eyes showed progression only by the GDx GPA with a specificity of 96 %. Positive and negative LRs were 12. 5 and 0. 5, respectively. None of the healthy eyes showed progression by the GDx GPA, with a specificity of 100 % in this group. Inter-method agreement (AC 1 coefficient and 95 % confidence intervals) for non-progressing and progressing eyes was 0. 96 (0. 94 - 0. 97) and 0. 44 (0. 28 - 0. 61), respectively. Conclusions: The GDx GPA detected glaucoma progression in a significant number of cases showing progression by conventional methods, with high specificity and high positive LRs. Estimates of the accuracy for detecting progression suggest that the GDx GPA could be used to complement clinical evaluation in the detection of longitudinal change in glaucoma.

40|$|Seismic {{shear waves}} emitted by {{earthquakes}} can be modelled as plane (transverse) waves. When entering an anisotropic medium {{they can be}} split into two orthogonal components moving at different speeds. This splitting occurs along an axis, the fast direction, that {{is determined by the}} ambient tectonic stress. Shear wave splitting is thus a commonly used tool for examining tectonic stress in the Earth’s interior. A common technique used to measure shear wave splitting is the Silver and Chan (1991) method. However, there is little literature assessing the robustness of this method, particularly for its use with local earthquakes, and the quality of results can vary. We present here a comprehensive analysis of the Silver and Chan method comprising theoretical derivations and statistical tests of the assumptions behind this method. We then produce an automated grading system calibrated against an <b>expert</b> manual <b>grader</b> using multiple linear regression. We find that there are errors in the derivation of certain equations in the Silver and Chan method and that it produces biased estimates of the errors. Further, the assumptions used to generate the errors do not hold. However, for high quality results (earthquake events where the signal is strong and the earthquake geometry is optimal), the standard errors are representative of the spread in the parameter estimates. Also, we find that our automated grading method produces grades that match the manual grades, and is able to identify mistakes in the manual grades by detecting substantial inconsistencies with the automated grades...|$|R

40|$|The {{pineapple}} {{maturity level}} also referred as pineapple maturity index {{is based on}} the percentage of yellowish that appears on the pineapple’s skin. In pineapple industry to determine the level of maturity, human experts adopt methods based on their subjective assessment of skin color. To this day, the pineapple maturity sorting process is still performed manually by <b>expert</b> human <b>grader.</b> So in order to reduce errors caused by human factors, {{there is a need to}} automate this process to an automated inspection system. The matured fruit harvested for the purposes of local sale or export is complete fruit with crown, fruit body and stump. However, in determining the pineapple maturity index, the main thing to be considered is only the pineapple fruit without crown. Fruit without crown also represents the actual size of the pineapple. Therefore the percentage of yellowish must be proportional to the size of the pineapple. Having extensive search of literatures found that studies of the size of the fruit, especially pineapple are very limited and only been started in recent years. To obtain the actual size of the fruit, the detection Region of Interest (ROI) is using segmentation method called minimum symmetrical edge distance. This minimum symmetrical edge distance algorithm wills geometrical rotated the pineapple images which to align with horizontal axis. Then the shortest vertical distances of the edge is calculated and converted to a background pixel, the largest region (fruit body) is maintained and the small region (crown) was abolished. The performance of segmentation algorithms are calculated using misclassification error that provides the rate of image pixels are incorrectly misclassified into the wrong segment. The results reveal that the algorithm used to achieve overall accuracy up to 99. 05 %. ROI that has been identified lengthened for feature extraction on the skin color of pineapple. Statistical based features namely minimum, maximum, arithmetic average and standard deviation were extracted from each image channels within detected ROI to represent pineapple skin color's tendency and dispersion. Next, classification index to determine the pineapple maturity level has been applied which are linear classification using thresholding value and artificial neural network adopting pattern recognition method. The results show that the classification using artificial neural network (pattern recognition) involving feature vectors arithmetic average and standard deviation for all channels R, G and B give the average correct classification rate of 88. 89 %...|$|R
