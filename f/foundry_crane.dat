40|$|This article {{describes}} a specific expertise and evaluation process relating to a <b>foundry</b> <b>crane,</b> which is {{installed in a}} steel production factory. The main task was to analyse a possibility to increase lifting speed of the crane lifting mechanism {{in order to improve}} efficiency of the production process. The steel supporting structure of the given <b>foundry</b> <b>crane</b> was considered by means of the performed experimental measurements and calculations. The presented {{article describes}} the special experimental/analytical methodology, which was used for evaluation of the crane steel construction and crane mechanisms, namely the lifting mechanisms and travelling mechanisms. There are also explained the required modifications of the individual crane construction parts...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to design and to calculate chosen parts of a crab of a foundry travelling crane according to assigned parameters. The <b>foundry</b> <b>crane</b> provides transport of a casting ladle, which is hanged with a girder on a double hook of the main stroke. Except the main travel, the crane crab includes more an auxiliary stroke. The whole work is divided to two parts. The first part (calculating) is aimed mainly to calculation of both strokes and a travel. The second one (drawing) contains a drawing of the crane crab and drawings of a rope drum of the main stroke...|$|E
50|$|Iron {{produced}} at the Crane Iron Company {{was used in}} a number of products, many of which were made elsewhere in Catasauqua. The neighbouring company of John Fritz's Iron <b>Foundry</b> used <b>Crane</b> iron to build the first American-made cast-iron construction columns, while the nearby Davies and Thomas <b>Foundry</b> turned <b>Crane</b> iron into pipes and tunnel tubes. Among the still-existing structures which were created using Crane iron are the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in New York City.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is {{the frame of}} the <b>foundry</b> trolley <b>crane</b> 330 / 65 / 20 t. The crane crab is used for {{handling}} with molten metal. The frame is analyzed by strength inspection and fatigue strength inspection. The process is according to ČSN EN 13001. The analyses are made by using finite element method on a beam and shell models. The diploma thesis was made in cooperation with the Královopolská a. s. company...|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Day (1855 in London - 1946) is {{a little-known}} English {{engineer}} {{who developed the}} extremely widely used crankcase-compression two-stroke petrol engine,as used for small engines from lawnmowers to mopeds and small motorcycles. He trained as an engineer at the Crystal Palace School of Engineering at Crystal Palace in London, began work at Stothert & Pitt in Bath, and in 1889 designed the crankcase-compression two-stroke engine as it is widely known today (in contrast to the two-stroke engine designed by Dugald Clark), the Valve-less Two-Stroke Engine. In 1878 he started his own business, an iron <b>foundry</b> making <b>cranes,</b> mortar mills and compressors amongst other things.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of mechanical threshing machines, which {{could do the}} work of many men, further threatened the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmworkers. Following poor harvests in 1828 and 1829, farm labourers faced the approaching winter of 1830 with dread. The Swing Riots [...] - [...] which had begun in Kent in June 1830 [...] - [...] finally broke out in Andover and the surrounding parishes on 19 November 1830, coinciding with the Annual Fair when the town was full with labourers. Over the next two days gangs of labourers set fire to haystacks and destroyed threshing machines while demanding an increase in wages and a reduction in rents. On the afternoon of 20 November a mob of 300 labourers set off from the Angel Inn public house and attacked the Waterloo Ironworks in Anna Valley on the outskirts of the town, pulling down walls and part of the roof, smashing some half-made ploughs and damaging the <b>foundry's</b> <b>crane</b> and waterwheel. The town's magistrates wrote to the Home Secretary, Lord Melbourne on 20 and 21 November requesting military support to restore order. By 15:00 on 21 November, The Times reported, [...] "an immense multitude" [...] had assembled in the town centre and, [...] "flushed with liquor" [...] proceeded to break down the gates of the gaol and release one of their leaders who had earlier been arrested. Armed with clubs, staves and flails they threatened to burn down the properties of anybody who refused to give them money, saying that they had been [...] "starving with their wives and families on potatoes and bread long enough." [...] On 22 November the 9th Lancers were deployed to Andover and the riots were quelled by 23 November. By 29 November, Winchester gaol was full to capacity with arrested labourers, and more prisoners were being held under guard by the Lancers in their barracks.|$|R

Lagan Engineering is a jute machinery manufacturing company {{set up in}} 1955 in Angus in Champdani. The machinery it has manufactured has been functioning well in numerous jute mills. It has been modernising to keep abreast with the latest technological developments. It was initially {{set up by the}} Northern Ireland based-James Mackie & Sons, run for a short period by the Government of India, which subsequently divested its shares to Murlidhar Ratanlal Exports Ltd.Braithwaite’s Angus Works was set up at Champdani in 1960 for manufacturing <b>cranes,</b> <b>foundry</b> products and machinery components etc. In 2010, the administrative control of Braithwaite & Co. was taken over by the [...] Ministry of Railways.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} as Braithwate in 1913 as the Indian Subsidiary of Braithwaite & Co. Engineers Limited (U.K.), for undertaking fabrication of Structural Steel Works. In 1930 it was incorporated as Braithwaite & Co (India) Ltd at Calcutta. In 1960 Braithwaite's Angus Works located at Champdani {{was set up}} for manufacture of <b>cranes,</b> <b>foundry</b> products, machinery components etc. The Project Division at Calcutta was established in 1978 to execute turnkey projects for material handling plants. In 1987 Victoria Works was taken over, which is equipped with all facilities for the manufacture of pressure vessels, railway wagons and heavy structurals for bridges and other engineering applications. In 1976 company {{was taken over by}} government of India, as a fully owned public sector company.|$|R
