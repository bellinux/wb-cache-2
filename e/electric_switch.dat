25|$|Middlebury President Paul Dwight Moody {{began the}} American {{tradition}} of a National Christmas Tree in 1923 when the College donated a 48-foot balsam fir for {{use at the}} White House. The tree was illuminated when Calvin Coolidge, a Vermont native {{in the first year}} of his presidency, flipped an <b>electric</b> <b>switch.</b> The Bread Loaf School of English, Middlebury's graduate school of English, was established at the College's Bread Loaf Mountain campus in 1920. The Bread Loaf Writers' Conference was established in 1926. In 1978, the Bread Loaf School of English expanded to include a campus at Lincoln College, Oxford University. In 1991, the School expanded to include a campus at St. John's College in New Mexico, and to the University of North Carolina, Asheville, in 2006. The C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad began in 1949 with the school in Paris; they now host students at 38 sites in Argentina, Brazil, China, Cameroon, Chile, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Mexico, Russia, Spain, and Uruguay. The Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies was founded as an educational charity in 1975 by Drs John and Sandy Feneley in Oxford, England, establishing a facility at St. Michael's Hall in 1978, including the Feneley Library, and close links with Keble College, Oxford; in 2014, CMRS became part of Middlebury College Schools Abroad as Middlebury-CMRS, offering U.S. undergraduates an Oxford Humanities Research Program and Middlebury Museum Studies in Oxford. In 1965, Middlebury established its Environmental Studies program, creating the first undergraduate Environmental Studies program in the U.S. Nationally affiliated fraternities were abolished in 1990; some chose to become co-educational social houses which continue today.|$|E
40|$|Embodiments of the {{invention}} relate to a DC-to-DC converter with a first DC voltage gate, a second DC voltage gate, and a storage inductor. The storage inductor is coupled {{between the first}} DC voltage gate and the second DC voltage gate by means of <b>electric</b> <b>switching</b> elements. The DC-to-DC converter is designed such that a direction of a current flow through the storage inductor reverses at least once during a switching period of the <b>electric</b> <b>switching</b> elements. The DC-to-DC converter is further designed to track or correct a switching frequency of the <b>electric</b> <b>switching</b> elements when operating parameters of the DC-to-DC converter change such that a directional change of the current flow through the storage inductor is ensured during a switching period of the <b>electric</b> <b>switching</b> elements...|$|R

2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an <b>electric</b> <b>switch</b> that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the crew}} had loaded and aimed the launcher, {{they had to take}} cover [...] away to avoid the exhaust flames, and would fire the rockets with an <b>electric</b> <b>switch.</b> After firing, however, a long streak of smoke was visible from a {{considerable}} distance, leaving the Nebelwerfer vulnerable to counter-battery fire. It was therefore necessary to relocate the launcher and crew as soon as possible after firing. The loud, shrill howling noise of the incoming rockets led Allied soldiers in the Sicily campaign to give it the nicknames [...] "Screaming Mimi" [...] and [...] "Moaning Minnie".|$|E
2500|$|Captain Karl Friesenhahn was the {{technical}} or bridge commander and {{in charge of}} the demolition charges. He had earlier requested [...] of military explosives, but at 11:00 am on 7 March he received only half the amount requested, [...] Worse, he found he been sent [...] "Donarit", a much weaker ammonium nitrate-based industrial explosive used in mining. With no other option, he placed all [...] on the eastern pier of the bridge. At 2:00 pm, as the first elements of the U.S. forces came close to the western approach, he detonated a charge under the stone archway that connected the approach embankment with the bridge, blowing a [...] crater in the road bed, hoping it would slow down tanks and infantry. Scheller and Bratge entered the railroad tunnel where the <b>electric</b> <b>switch</b> controlling the detonators was located. Friesenhahn followed them, but before he could get to the tunnel, the concussion from an exploding shell knocked him unconscious. He regained his senses 15 minutes later and continued towards the tunnel. Bratge yelled at Friesenhahn to blow up the bridge. Friesenhahn replied they had to get the order in writing from Scheller, who was {{at the other end of}} the [...] tunnel that curved at almost 90° under Erpeler Ley. Bratge ran to find Scheller, got the order in writing, and when he returned to tell Friesenhahn to detonate the charges, Friesenhahn in turn required Bratge to give him the order in writing.|$|E
