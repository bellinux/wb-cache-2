30|$|From {{the above}} results, we {{observed}} that {{being in an}} urban area as compared to a rural area {{as well as being}} a male as compared to a female increased the odds of receiving formal training. Similarly, increased education level as compared to no education and having received technical education as compared to not receiving any technical education increases the odds ratio of receiving formal training. Further, an <b>ever-married</b> <b>person</b> has a lesser chance of getting formal training as compared to a single person.|$|E
30|$|The {{relative}} log odds {{of receiving}} informal training {{as well as}} formal training will increase if the respondent belongs to an urban area as compared to a rural area. With the increase in age, the relative log odds of receiving formal or informal training will decrease. In the case of gender, the relative log odds of receiving informal training increase for females as compared to their male counterparts while it decrease for the females {{in the case of}} formal training. In the case for formal training, relative log odds increase with increase in level of education while in the case of informal training, there was no clear trend but it decreases at higher levels of education. The relative log odds will decrease for an <b>ever-married</b> <b>person</b> as compared to a single person but the difference is significant only for formal training.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Household {{measures}} of socioeconomic position may better {{account for the}} shared nature of material resources, lifestyle, and social position of cohabiting persons, but household {{measures of}} education are rarely used. We aimed to evaluate the association of combined educational attainment of married couples on mortality and life expectancy in Switzerland. METHODS The study included 3 496 163 <b>ever-married</b> <b>persons</b> aged ≥ 30 years. The 2000 census was linked to mortality records through 2008. Mortality by combined educational attainment was assessed by gender-age-specific HRs, with 95...|$|R
30|$|The {{widowhood}} method {{originally developed}} by Hill and Trussell (1977) estimates adult mortality from {{information about the}} survivorship status of the respondents’ spouses. The rationale behind the method is that proportions of <b>ever-married</b> <b>persons</b> (classified by age) whose first spouse is still alive {{can be used to}} estimate adult survivorship probabilities. To establish the widowhood status of respondents, all ever-married respondents are asked whether their first spouse is still alive, with the possible answers being ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘do not know’ (United Nations 1983). To avoid problems of remarriage, the data collected refer only to the survival status of the first spouse of each respondent. The length of exposure to the risk of dying is estimated from the current age of the respondent and a measure of the average age at marriage for all respondents. The method assumes that mortality and nuptiality have remained constant in the recent past. The input data required for this method include number of ever-married male or female respondents with the first spouse alive or dead classified by the 5 -year age group, total number of ever-married male or female respondents by the 5 -year age group, number of ever-married male or female respondents who did not declare or did not know the survivorship status of their first spouse by the 5 -year age group, and the singulate mean age at marriage (SMAM) for both males and females.|$|R
