25|$|In 1992, Lennart Meri, {{together}} with 9 Baltic Ministers of Foreign Affairs and an EU commissioner, founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the <b>EuroFaculty.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Baltic {{struggle}} for independence 1989–1992, a personal friendship developed between the (at that time unrecognized) Baltic ministers of foreign affairs and the Nordic ministers of foreign affairs. This friendship {{led to the creation}} of the Council of the Baltic Sea States in 1992, and the <b>EuroFaculty</b> in 1993.|$|E
50|$|The Danish {{economist}} Gustav N. Kristensen subsequently became {{director of}} a mature and successful <b>EuroFaculty,</b> which in spite of financial difficulties would reap the fruits of systematic work during many years. In their capacity as observer countries of the CBSS, the Netherlands joined the <b>EuroFaculty</b> and provided teachers. Likewise, the U.S. made a highly efficient support to the <b>EuroFaculty</b> by its Fulbright Program.|$|E
50|$|As the EuroFaculty’s first director, the Estonian-Canadian Professor Toivo Miljan had {{to build}} up the <b>EuroFaculty</b> from the very bottom. The <b>EuroFaculty</b> {{suffered}} from a lack of legality which could only be ignored during the pioneering period. He ended up being forced away by the European Commission because of his anti-bureaucratic attitude. New waves changed the rules, and the idea that the EU would support the <b>EuroFaculty</b> in line with the Baltic Sea donor countries was subsequently derailed. Toivo Miljan’s successor was the Norwegian Professor Arild Saether. During his time as director real academic progress became apparent, as the <b>EuroFaculty</b> students performed brilliantly internationally and the <b>EuroFaculty</b> gained increasing prestige. The <b>EuroFaculty</b> became recognized as the strongest institution for substantial pan-Baltic cooperation. However, Arild Saether was caught up in a Sisyphus fight with the many-headed donor corps composed of national states, which, good in will, but weak in action, made his job feel impossible to cope with and to implement, and consequently he decided to leave office.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>EuroFaculty</b> {{successfully}} {{attracted a}} large number of outstanding Baltic students to its programs and made {{a significant impact on the}} Baltic university system. A former <b>EuroFaculty</b> student, Kaspars Balodis, became Dean of Law at the University of Latvia in 2002 and later, in 2006, Judge at the Constitutional Court in Latvia. Another <b>EuroFaculty</b> student, Vytautas Nekrošius, became Dean of Law at Vilnius University in 2003. [...] The <b>EuroFaculty</b> delivered highly qualified staff to the national banks and the Central Administration in the Baltic states, as well as to the World Trade Organization and the World Bank.|$|E

50|$|The <b>EuroFaculty</b> had its Headquarters at the University of Latvia in Riga, and was besides {{organized}} with sections, {{at each of}} {{the universities}} in Tartu, Riga, and Vilnius. Connected to the <b>EuroFaculty</b> project were the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga and the Riga Graduate School of Law.|$|E
50|$|Several {{members of}} the Baltic parliaments are former <b>EuroFaculty</b> students. One of the EuroFaculty’s first students, Nils Ushakovs became Mayor of Riga in 2009. Baiba Rivža became Minister of Education and Science in Latvia in 2006. Vjačeslavs Dombrovskis, Latvian Minister of Education and Science, is also a <b>EuroFaculty</b> alumni and former Teaching Assistant.|$|E
50|$|However, the CBSS {{as well as}} the <b>EuroFaculty</b> were decided upon without {{subsequent}} parliamentary approval, {{and without}} an official legal status, thus being, broadly speaking, based on the personal friendships which developed among MFAs during the fight for freedom of the Baltic states. Unfortunately, the core group of MFAs behind the CBSS (and the <b>EuroFaculty)</b> left office within a year after the creation of the CBSS.|$|E
50|$|Outside the EU a <b>EuroFaculty</b> {{was later}} {{established}} in Kaliningrad (2000-2007) and in Pskov (2009 and onwards).|$|E

50|$|In 1992, Genscher, {{together}} with his Danish colleague Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, took the initiative to create the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the <b>EuroFaculty.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, as EU commissioner, Christophersen {{together}} with 10 Baltic Ministers of Foreign Affairs founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the <b>EuroFaculty.</b>|$|E
50|$|In May 2004, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania became {{members of}} the European Union. This new {{structure}} led to the closing down of the <b>EuroFaculty</b> Tartu-Riga-Vilnius in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The <b>EuroFaculty,</b> {{created by}} the CBSS to support reforms at the {{universities}} in Tartu, Riga, and Vilnius, was organized with its headquarters at the University of Latvia, 1993-2005.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Lennart Meri, {{together}} with 9 Baltic Ministers of Foreign Affairs and an EU commissioner, founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the <b>EuroFaculty.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{major reason}} {{for the success of}} the <b>EuroFaculty</b> was the fascination in Western Europe and America for the three Baltic states and the enthusiasm {{surrounding}} their regained independence.|$|E
50|$|The faculty, {{under the}} name <b>EuroFaculty,</b> was (like the CBSS) {{established}} by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) in the enthusiastic atmosphere surrounding the regained independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.|$|E

50|$|Foreign Professors {{came from}} Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, the U.S., the Netherlands, and Germany. Including local Teaching Associates, Student Teaching Assistants, Student Research Assistants and three Vice-directors, the <b>EuroFaculty</b> {{annually}} employed around 100 people.|$|E
50|$|The {{board of}} the <b>EuroFaculty</b> (the Steering Committee) was {{composed}} of members representing the EU and the CBSS member countries, and was chaired by (among others) the Danish Professor Nikolaj Petersen and later by the Latvian Professor Baiba Rivža.|$|E
50|$|During the Baltic {{struggle}} for independence 1989-1992, a personal friendship developed between the (at that time unrecognized) Baltic ministers of foreign affairs and the Nordic ministers of foreign affairs. This friendship {{led to the creation}} of the Council of the Baltic Sea States in 1992, and the <b>EuroFaculty</b> in 1993.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea about}} {{creating}} a “Euro-faculty” was saved by the personal engagement of Franz Peter Küpper from the European Commission, who guided the <b>EuroFaculty</b> to obtaining EU support in the first years. It was also helpful that the German contribution came through Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, (DAAD), which was efficient as donor due to its position as (relatively) independent of political changes.|$|E
50|$|Paavo Väyrynen was {{critical}} to the active support given by the Danish Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and the Icelandic Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson to the Baltic states in their fight to regain independence. In 1992, however, Paavo Väyrynen together with 9 other Ministers of Foreign Affairs from the Baltic Sea area, and an EU commissioner founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the <b>EuroFaculty,</b> as Finland actively supported.|$|E

Thorvald Stoltenberg was also the UN witness at the signing of Erdut Agreement.|$|E
50|$|A strong {{supporter}} of NATO and the European Union based upon his belief in Western cohesion led to many political battles with the left-wing opposition. Several times the opposition tried to topple him on issues of solidarity within NATO, but he survived. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen succeeded in convincing {{a majority in the}} Danish Parliament, Folketinget, to actively support the US led coalition against Iraq during the Gulf War. Furthermore, he led the Danish recognition of the renewed independence of the three Baltic countries in 1991, when Denmark was the first country to re-establish diplomatic relations with the three countries.

50|$|He was {{appointed}} Minister for Foreign Affairs from 25 January 1993 to 21 December 2000 in the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen I, II, III, and IV (except {{for the last}} part of the IV cabinet). When the European Union's Maastricht Treaty was rejected by the Danish people in 1992, it was accepted after a referendum in 1993 adding certain opt-out concessions for Denmark. As the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Niels Helveg Petersen had to work to implement those concessions, although he had been a long supporter of greater internationalisation of Danish foreign policy. When he left the position of Foreign Minister in 2000, the official reason given was that he could no longer accept the opt-outs.He joined the newly created Council of the Baltic Sea States, which in 1993 successfully established the <b>EuroFaculty</b> in Tartu, Riga, and Vilnius, of which he became an active supporter.|$|E
40|$|First of all I {{would like}} to thank my {{supervisor}} Professor Frank Aarebrot at the Department of Comparative Politics at the University of Bergen. His guidance and support throughout the writing process have been of indispensable value for me. Several other persons have helped on the way. I {{would like to}} express my gratitude to Charles Woolfson, Director at the ECOHSE centre at the University of Glasgow. He shared from his great insight and gave me inspiration through conversations in Vilnius. My thanks go to Hans Petter Svege. His office at the University of Tartu in Estonia was always open to conversations that have been very instructive to me. I {{would also like to thank}} Kjetil Duvold and Professor Sten Berglund, then at the <b>EuroFaculty</b> in Vilnius, for inspiring me in Vilnius. Kjetil, Hans Petter, Frank and Terje Knutsen at the Department of Comparative Politics have given me the opportunity to be an observant in interesting workshops and conferences in Kaunas, Tartu and Bergen. I would like to express my gratitude to Guri Tyldum and Anette Brunovskis at the Fafo Institute for Applied Social Science for introducing me to the Norbalt 1 and 2 living condition surveys...|$|E
