500|$|The {{wide-band}} {{nature of}} waffle-iron filters finds applications in satellite communications. [...] A satellite earth station may have multiple diplexers {{connected to a}} multi-band antenna feeder. [...] Each <b>diplexer</b> delivers a wide-band signal in a different band and {{it is essential that}} its signal does not contain out-of-band components, particularly harmonics. [...] These can seriously interfere with, or even stop entirely, communication in another band. [...] The <b>diplexer</b> must therefore have a stopband that is even wider than the passband. [...] For this reason, {{as well as the other}} advantages of waffle-irons, these diplexers are commonly made to a waffle-iron design.Manuilov et al., 2009, p.526 ...|$|E
500|$|A <b>diplexer</b> is {{a device}} used to combine two signals occupying {{different}} frequency bands {{into a single}} signal. [...] This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a <b>diplexer</b> is called a duplexer.) The same device {{can be used to}} separate the signals again {{at the far end of}} the channel. [...] The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals. [...] Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output. [...] This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the output impedance of source B thus causing mismatch. [...] These problems could be overcome with the use of a [...] directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.|$|E
500|$|For diplexers {{dealing with}} {{contiguous}} passbands proper {{account of the}} crossover characteristics of filters needs {{to be considered in}} the design. [...] An especially common case of this is where the <b>diplexer</b> is used to split the entire spectrum into low and high bands. [...] Here a low-pass and a high-pass filter are used instead of band-pass filters. [...] The synthesis techniques used here can equally be applied to narrowband multiplexers and largely remove the need for decoupling resonators.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the use of}} dual-composite right-left-handed (D-CRLH) {{transmission}} lines is proposed {{for the design of}} <b>diplexers.</b> The D-CRLH <b>diplexers</b> present advantages over conventional <b>diplexers</b> such as smaller size (especially in the ultra high frequency band). The design procedure and the design equations are presented in this paper. The non-linear phase response of a D-CRLH transmission line has been used to design <b>diplexers</b> at any arbitrary frequencies. Finally, two <b>diplexers</b> have been designed and manufactured: one for quite near frequencies and the other for further ones. The simulation results show good agreement with the measurements. A sensitivity analysis has been provided to show the robustness of this kind of circuits...|$|R

50|$|At {{long wave}} {{broadcasting}} sites <b>diplexers</b> are normally not used since these stations usually broadcast {{on only one}} frequency. A realization of <b>diplexers</b> for long wave broadcasting stations may be difficult, as the ratio of bandwidth (9 kHz) to transmission frequency is high.|$|R
500|$|Multi-channel, multi-octave {{multiplexers}} {{were investigated}} by Harold Schumacher at Microphase Corporation, and his results {{were published in}} 1976. [...] The principle that multiplexer filters may be matched when joined together by modifying the first few elements, thus doing away with the compensating resonators, was discovered accidentally by E. J. Curly around 1968 when he mistuned a <b>diplexer.</b> [...] A formal theory for this was provided by J. D. Rhodes in 1976 and generalised to multiplexers by Rhodes and Ralph Levy in 1979.|$|E
500|$|Multiplexers {{were first}} {{described}} by Fano and Lawson in 1948. [...] Pierce {{was the first}} to describe multiplexers with contiguous passbands. [...] Multiplexing using directional filters was invented by Seymour Cohn and Frank Coale in the 1950s. [...] Multiplexers with compensating immittance resonators at each junction are largely the work of E. G. Cristal and G. L. Matthaei in the 1960s. [...] This technique is still sometimes used, but the modern availability of computing power has led to the more common use of synthesis techniques which can directly produce matching filters without the need for these additional resonators. [...] In 1965 R. J. Wenzel discovered that filters which were singly terminated, rather than the usual doubly terminated, were complementary—exactly what was needed for a <b>diplexer.</b> [...] Wenzel was inspired by the lectures of circuit theorist Ernst Guillemin.Fano & Lawson (1948)|Pierce (1949)|Cristal & Matthaei (1964)|Wenzel (1969)}} ...|$|E
500|$|A {{directional}} filter is {{a device that}} combines the functions of a directional coupler and a <b>diplexer.</b> [...] As {{it is based on}} a directional coupler it is essentially a four-port device, but like directional couplers, port 4 is commonly permanently terminated internally. [...] Power entering port 1 exits port 3 after being subject to some filtering function (usually band-pass). [...] The remaining power exits port 2, and since no power is absorbed or reflected this will be the exact complement of the filtering function at port 2, in this case band-stop. [...] In reverse, power entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1, but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4. [...] Figure 15 shows one possible waveguide implementation of a {{directional filter}}. [...] Two rectangular waveguides operating in the dominant TE10 mode provide the four ports. [...] These are joined together by a circular waveguide operating in the circular TE11 mode. [...] The circular waveguide contains an iris coupled filter with as many irises as needed to produce the required filter response.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this work, two topologies for realizing compact {{microwave}} <b>diplexers</b> in dual-mode cavities are presented. The first topology is {{a classical}} one, where the common port is coupled to two resonators in separate paths. The second topology is original {{because of the}} excitation of a single resonator by the common port. The interest of the second topology is demonstrated on dual-mode cavity <b>diplexers</b> by eliminating spurious cross-polarized modes which appear when using a classical topology. The proposed topologies have been validated by the design of coupled dual-mode cavity <b>diplexers</b> for satellite applications...|$|R

2500|$|The main FM antenna (the {{four large}} {{elements}} {{seen at the}} top of the mast in both outdoor pictures on this page) recently belonged to WZGC FM 92.9 ("Dave FM"), while a smaller antenna still carries backup signals for that station and previously for WVEE FM 103.3 ("V-103"), both owned by CBS Radio. [...] WWWQ FM 100.5 ("Q100", now WNNX FM [...] "Rock 100.5") first used the same antenna when it moved to Atlanta, before it upgraded and relocated within the city, but it has since switched back. WSTR FM 94.1 ("Star 94") also shared the main FM antenna with 92.9 when it was originally installed, with the power from both stations' transmitters being combined into a single antenna through a <b>diplexer.</b> [...] Both WSTR and WZGC still list this as their allotment location.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>diplexer</b> is a {{different}} device than a passive combiner or splitter. The ports of a <b>diplexer</b> are frequency selective; the ports of a combiner are not. There is also a power [...] "loss" [...] difference - a combiner takes all the power delivered to the S port and equally divides it between the A and B ports. A <b>diplexer</b> does not.|$|E
50|$|In split {{sound system}} a high power <b>diplexer</b> is {{used at the}} output of the RF amplifiers. Such diplexers are {{expensive}} and bulky. In intercarrier system where the combining is achieved at a low level stage no <b>diplexer</b> is used.|$|E

50|$|Voltage driven filters {{must start}} with a series element and current driven filters must {{start with a}} shunt element. These forms are useful {{in the design of}} <b>diplexers</b> and multiplexers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diplexers</b> are {{not used}} at VLF transmitters. In this {{frequency}} range their realization is very difficult because of the very high voltages {{that occur in the}} huge tuned loading coils that are used in the antenna feed.|$|R
50|$|Diplexers {{are also}} {{commonly}} used where a multi-band antenna {{is used on}} a tower, with a common feedline. The <b>diplexer</b> will split the two bands inside the building (such as VHF and UHF systems combined with a <b>diplexer</b> onto a common antenna).|$|E
50|$|In this application, {{there would}} be a <b>diplexer</b> on the roof that joins the {{satellite}} dish feed and the TV antenna together into a single coaxial cable. That cable would then run from the roof into the house. At a convenient point, a second <b>diplexer</b> would split the two signals apart; one signal would go to the TV set and the other to the IRD of the DBS set-top box. These usually have an antenna input and a <b>diplexer,</b> so that the antenna signal is also distributed along with the satellite.|$|E
50|$|A <b>diplexer</b> allows two {{different}} devices {{to share a}} common communications channel. Typically, the channel is a long coaxial cable, and a <b>diplexer</b> is often used {{at both ends of}} the coaxial cable. The plan is feasible if the two devices operate on different frequencies. The plan is economical if the diplexers cost less than running a second cable.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>diplexers</b> for ECRH has been pursued {{at a number}} of institutes because of their attractive variety of applications: Power combination, non-mechanical, electrically controlled switching (of combined beams) between launchers with tens of kHz, and discrimination of low-power ECE signals from high-power ECRH is feasible. In a first part, this paper reports on plasma experiments with a ring resonator (Mk IIa) at ASDEX Upgrade. Commissioning experiments on fast switching between two launchers for synchronous stabilization of neoclassical tearing modes, as well as in-line ECE measurements have been performed, and experimental issues and first results are discussed. A clear influence of the switching phase on the amplitude of the 3 / 2 NTM mode was measured, complete stabilization could, however, not be demonstrated yet mainly due to imperfect resonator control. Concepts for improved tracking of the <b>diplexers</b> to the gyrotron frequency are presented. In a second part, the design of <b>diplexers</b> with ring resonators matched to HE 11 fields is briefly discussed; these devices can be connected to corrugated waveguides without any mode converters. A compact version (MQ IV) is under investigation, which is compatible with the ITER ECRH system (170 GHz, 63. 5 mm waveguide, vacuum tight casing), with the final goal of high-power tests at the 170 GHz gyrotron facility at JAEA in Naka, Japan.

50|$|Diplexers are {{typically}} used with radio receivers or transmitters on different, widely separated, frequency bands. A single city radio tower {{might have a}} police department antenna on 460 MHz and a fire department antenna on 156 MHz. A <b>diplexer</b> at the top combines the two antenna signals to the single coaxial feedline, and a second identical <b>diplexer</b> inside the building separates the feedline signals to the two dispatch radios.

50|$|Diplexing is used {{to prevent}} {{intermodulation}} and keep reflected power (VSWR) to a minimum for each input transmitter and frequency. While <b>diplexers</b> can combine a relatively wide bandwidth, the major limitation comes with the antenna itself, which must be sufficiently wideband to accept all of the signals being passed through it, and transfer them to the air efficiently.|$|R
