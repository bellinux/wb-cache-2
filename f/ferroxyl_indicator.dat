50|$|Onset of rusting {{can also}} be {{detected}} in laboratory {{with the use of}} <b>ferroxyl</b> <b>indicator</b> solution. The solution detects both Fe2+ ions and hydroxyl ions. Formation of Fe2+ ions and hydroxyl ions are indicated by blue and pink patches respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferroxyl</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{solution}} containing potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) and phenolphthalein. It turns blue {{in the presence of}} Fe2+ ions, pink in the presence of hydroxide ions, {{it can be used to}} detect metal oxidation. It is often used to detect rusting in various situations.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{ferricyanide}} is {{also one}} of two compounds present in <b>ferroxyl</b> <b>indicator</b> solution (along with phenolphthalein) which turns blue (Prussian blue) in the presence of Fe2+ ions, and which can therefore be used to detect metal oxidation that will lead to rust. It is possible to calculate the number of moles of Fe2+ ions by using a colorimeter, because of the very intense color of Prussian blue Fe4Fe(CN)63.|$|E
