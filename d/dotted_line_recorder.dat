Within the <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> box in Fig. 4 c, the color of Ti changes from orange in interior to green in exterior. It can be inferred that the concentration of Ti 3 SiC 2 is decreasing gradually. These results suggest that the Cu phase and Ti 3 SiC 2 phase are closely bound and Cu and Ti 3 SiC 2 have high wettability [27].|$|R
