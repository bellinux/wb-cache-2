Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop {{to think about what}} they're doing or why, and the story of Malik <b>is</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this.|$|E

And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she <b>is</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|On Harry Potter's {{birthday}} in 1992, the Dursley family—Harry's uncle Vernon, aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley—hold {{a dinner party}} for a potential client of Vernon's drill-manufacturing company. Harry is not invited, but <b>is</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> spend the evening quietly in his bedroom, although he is upset that his school friends have not sent cards or presents. However, {{when he goes to}} his room a house-elf named Dobby warns him not to return to Hogwarts and admits to intercepting Harry's post from his friends. Having failed to persuade Harry to voluntarily give up his place at Hogwarts, Dobby then attempts to get him expelled by using magic to smash Petunia's dessert on a dinner party guest and framing it on Harry, who is not allowed to use magic out of school. Uncle Vernon's business deal falls through, but Harry is given a second chance and allowed to return {{at the start of the}} school year.|$|E

25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return <b>is</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E

In March 1947, Joe Reichler wrote a nationally syndicated story for the Associated Press about the influx of Major League Baseball players into the newly formed professional basketball leagues. Reichler cited Gee, Howard Schultz, and Frankie Baumholtz as the first group to make the jump.

The Eleventh Doctor, now alone, begins to muse about retiring to become the museum's curator, when he is interrupted by the museum's actual curator.

At the moment, Heaven <b>is</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> leave Hell alone {{as long as}} it does not transgress its {{boundaries}} or harm the innocent. When that does happen, the Church's Catholic Corps is the means by which Heaven fights a proxy war. While preceded by earlier miracle workers and martial saints, the Corps has its roots in 1066 with the creation of the first Areala and later in 1212 when Pope Gregory VII authorized a new order to train those blessed by God with power to either use them as miracle workers or as warriors. The Corps is the most visible sign of the Church and by extension God on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Don Carlos {{has been}} imprisoned. Posa arrives and tells Carlos that he (Posa) has saved Carlos from being executed, by {{allowing}} himself (Posa) to be incriminated by the politically sensitive documents {{which he had}} obtained from Carlos earlier (Aria, part 1: [...] "C'est mon jour suprême" [...] / [...] "Per me giunto è il dì supremo"). A shadowy figure appears--one of the Grand Inquisitor's assassins--and shoots Posa in the chest. As he dies, Posa tells Carlos that Elisabeth will meet him at Saint-Just the following day. He adds that he <b>is</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> die if his friend can save Flanders and rule over a happier Spain (Aria, part 2: [...] "Ah, je meurs, l'âme joyeuse" [...] / [...] "Io morrò, ma lieto in core"). At that moment, the King enters, offering his son freedom, as Posa had arranged. Carlos repulses him for having murdered Posa. The King sees that Posa is dead and cries out in sorrow.|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Stuart Tave {{noted that}} a major theme of Austen's novel is propriety, as she both mocks those who cling {{outwardly}} to propriety, often in a self-righteous manner without understanding what it really means and praises those who really live up to it. Those who really understand propriety in Austen's novel take into account both the feelings of others and draw the appropriate conclusions. Tave argued that the play Lover's Vows is {{a test of the}} character's commitment to propriety. The priggish Mrs. Norris sees herself as the guardian of propriety and is trusted by Sir Thomas before he leaves for Antigua to uphold propriety, a task she fails at completely by letting Lover's Vows be put on. Edmund objects to the play, as he knows it violates propriety in some way, but he fails to make the point, as bases his objections in specific matters rather the universal one of propriety. Only Fanny understands this point as she knows that playing the characters will also impact on the amateur actors, but she is not strong enough to persuade the others of her viewpoint. As the rehearsals continued, Fanny could clearly see the sexual tension and attraction between Edmund and Mary as they play the part of the two lovers, which fills her with misery and jealousy. Tave wrote about Price and the play: [...] "Excluded from the gaiety and busy employment of others, alone, sad, insignificant, seeing Mrs. Grant promoted to consequence and honor because Mrs. Grant accepted the character she herself refused, Fanny is in some danger of envying her. What distinguishes Fanny here, and throughout, is that she is capable of thought and recovery, and in this instance, reflection brings better feelings, showing her that even if she could have received the greatest respect she would never have been easy. It would have been easier to join a scheme, which considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether". Finally, Tave suggests that when Sir Thomas shuts down Lover's Vows, this demonstrates the hypocrisy and myopic character of Sir Thomas as he <b>is</b> <b>content</b> <b>to</b> destroy the set and props without considering just what had led his children into putting on Lover's Vows in the first place as he is only concerned with the external aspects of people, not what really drives them.|$|E
