50|$|Endogenous retroviruses (or ERVs) are remnant {{sequences}} in {{the genome}} left from ancient viral infections in an organism. The retroviruses (or virogenes) are always {{passed on to}} the next generation of that organism that received the infection. This leaves the virogene left in the genome. Because this event is rare and random, finding identical chromosomal positions of a virogene in two different species suggests common ancestry. Cats (Felidae) present a notable instance of virogene sequences demonstrating common descent. The standard phylogenetic tree for Felidae have smaller cats (Felis chaus, <b>Felis</b> silvestris, <b>Felis</b> <b>nigripes,</b> and <b>Felis</b> catus) diverging from larger cats such as the subfamily Pantherinae and other carnivores. The fact that small cats have an ERV where the larger cats do not suggests that the gene was inserted into the ancestor of the small cats after the larger cats had diverged. Another example of this is with humans and chimps. Humans contain numerous ERVs that comprise a considerable percentage of the genome. Sources vary, however, 1% to 8% has been proposed. Humans and chimps share seven different occurrences of virogenes, while all primates share similar retroviruses congruent with phylogeny.|$|R

40|$|African black-footed cats (<b>Felis</b> <b>nigripes)</b> are {{endangered}} wild felids. One {{male and}} full-sibling female African black-footed cat developed vision deficits and mydriasis {{as early as}} 3 months of age. The diagnosis of early-onset progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) was supported by reduced direct and consensual pupillary light reflexes, phenotypic presence of retinal degeneration, and a non-recordable electroretinogram with negligible amplitudes in both eyes. Whole genome sequencing, conducted on two unaffected parents and one affected offspring was compared to a variant database from 51 domestic cats and a Pallas cat, revealed 50 candidate variants that segregated concordantly with the PRA phenotype. Testing in additional affected cats confirmed that cats homozygous for a 2 base pair (bp) deletion within IQ calmodulin-binding motif-containing protein- 1 (IQCB 1), the gene that encodes for nephrocystin- 5 (NPHP 5), had vision loss. The variant segregated concordantly in other related individuals within the pedigree supporting the identification of a recessively inherited early-onset feline PRA. Analysis of the black-footed cat studbook suggests additional captive cats are at risk.

To date, 81 carnivoran specimens have been identified at this site including members of the families Canidae, Viverridae, Herpestidae, Hyaenidae and Felidae. Of note is the presence of the extinct taxon Dinofelis cf. D. barlowi that may represent the last appearance date for this species. Extant large carnivores are represented by specimens of leopard (Panthera pardus) and brown hyaena (Parahyaena brunnea). Smaller carnivores are also represented, and include the genera Atilax and Genetta, as well as Vulpes cf. V. chama. Malapa may also represent the first appearance date for <b>Felis</b> <b>nigripes</b> (Black-footed cat). The geochronological age of Malapa and the associated hominin taxa and carnivoran remains provide a window of research into mammalian evolution during a relatively unknown period in South Africa and elsewhere.

40|$|Abstract. A high {{prevalence}} of systemic amyloidosis was {{documented in the}} black-footed cat (<b>Felis</b> <b>nigripes)</b> based on a retrospective review of necropsy tissues (n 5 38) submitted as part of ongoing disease surveillance. Some degree of amyloid deposition was present in 33 of 38 (87 %) of the examined cats, and amyloidosis {{was the most common}} cause of death (26 / 38, 68 %). Amyloid deposition was most severe in the renal medullary interstitium (30 / 33, 91 %) and glomeruli (21 / 33, 63 %). Other common sites included the splenic follicular germinal centers (26 / 31, 84 %), gastric lamina propria (9 / 23, 39 %), and intestinal lamina propria (3 / 23, 13 %). Amyloid in all sites stained with Congo red, and in 13 of 15 (87 %) cats, deposits had strong immunoreactivity for canine AA protein by immunohistochemistry. There was no association with concurrent chronic inflammatory conditions (P 5. 51), suggesting that amyloidosis was not secondary to inflammation. Adrenal cortical hyperplasia, a morphologic indicator of stress that can predispose to amyloid deposition, was similarly not associated (P 5. 09) with amyloidosis. However, adrenals were not available from the majority of cats without amyloidosis; therefore, further analysis of this risk factor is warranted. Heritability estimation suggested that amyloidosis might be familial in this species. Additionally, tissues from a single free-ranging black-footed cat had small amounts of amyloid deposition, suggesting that there could be a predilection for amyloidosis in this species.

50|$|Among {{mammalian}} carnivores {{the bulk}} of predatory incidents have reportedly involved mongooses. Common, social species from savanna-edge such as the 710 g yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and the 725 g meerkats (Suricata suricatta) have been attacked, as well as larger, shy forest dwellers such as the 2500 g Jackson's mongoose (Bdeogale jacksoni). An adult Meller's mongoose (Rhynchogale melleri) weighing about 2200 g which was taken by a Verreaux's eagle-owl on the wing represents the second heaviest known object successfully flown with this species after the aforementioned half-grown vervet monkey. Other smallish carnivores known to fall prey to Verreaux's eagle-owls include the 292 g African striped weasel (Poecilogale albinucha) and its larger cousin, the 817.5 g striped polecat (Ictonyx striatus), which in one nest from {{the border of the}} Kalahari represented the sole prey species for a pair of eagle-owls. In southern Africa, both the cape genet (Genetta tigrina), averaging 1732 g, and the 1600 g black-footed cat (<b>Felis</b> <b>nigripes),</b> the smallest felid in Africa, have been included amongst their prey. The Verreaux's eagle-owl is thought to be a threat to even larger carnivores, including the 4150 g bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis) and the 10000 g aardwolf (Proteles cristata), although whether healthy adults of the latter are in danger is doubtful. An scientifically-observed attack on an adult African wildcat (Felis silvestris cafra), which averages about 4000 g, was aborted after the eagle-owl apparently deemed that the felid was too heavy to take flight with. However, domesticated cats of any size may fall prey to Verreaux's eagle-owl. At Lake Baringo Country Club in Kenya, this eagle-owl has apparently taken to habitually hunting outdoor cats, reportedly making the cats on the grounds highly skittish.|$|R
50|$|Smaller {{carnivores}} {{are common}} across the country, and two species, the black-backed jackal and the caracal, are {{seen by some}} as pest species, often taking livestock such as sheep and goats, as lion, leopard, cheetah, African wild dog, and both species of hyena have been largely extirpated outside of protected areas. The serval is a rodent specialist and often occurs in marshy areas. Bat-eared foxes, Cape foxes and small felids such as the black-footed cat (<b>Felis</b> <b>nigripes)</b> and Southern African wildcat (Felis sylvestris cafra) are widespread, although there are concerns about the genetic purity of the African wild cat, as it breeds readily with both domestic and feral domestic cats (Felis sylvestris catus), which dilutes the African wild cat's gene pool. There are many species of mongoose, such as the meerkat, yellow mongoose and water mongoose. There are two genet species, the common genet and the large spotted genet. There are relatively few mustelid species in South Africa, as it appears that most niches taken by mustelids {{elsewhere in the world}} are taken up by vivverids and herpestids in sub-Saharan Africa (only seven species are native to Africa south of the Sahara). Two species of otter are native to South Africa, both inhabiting freshwater habitats and the Cape clawless otter ranging into the sea at the coast. The honey badger is probably the best known mustelid native to the region; aside from the otters, two other species occur, the African striped weasel and the striped polecat - their black-and-white fur serves the same function as that of skunks. The only seal native to the region is the brown fur seal, which breeds in large colonies off Namibia and South Africa.|$|R
40|$|The black-footed cat (<b>Felis</b> <b>nigripes)</b> is the rarest, {{smallest}} wild felid {{species of}} southern Africa and is categorized as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List 2012 (Sliwa 2008). These cats are solitary, nocturnally active predators {{with a high}} metabolic rate. In order to fuel this metabolism they hunt all night, catching and consuming approximately one fifth of their body weight. In order to facilitate research studies and sample collection a reliable, safe, fully reversible anaesthetic drug combination {{for use in the}} field is imperative to enable the cats to resume their hunting as quickly as possible post anaesthesia. Both the captive and the free-ranging populations face many survival challenges, including renal amyloidosis, and the use of an anaesthetic drug combination that does not compromise renal function would be of major benefit. To date, there is no published data on the physiological effects of any anaesthetic protocol in this species. The butorphanol-medetomidine-midazolam combination has been safely and successfully used in a variety of domestic and other wild animal species, and recently it has been used in black-footed cats in the field and zoo setting. We used the butorphanol-medetomidine-midazolam drug combination to anaesthetise blackfooted cats, both in captivity and in the wild. As the drug doses currently used in wild freeranging animals are approximately twice as high as those required in captive animals, concerns have been raised regarding the physiological safety of using a higher dose of this anaesthetic combination in these animals. My aim was to document, evaluate and compare the anaesthetic and physiological effects induced by the use of two different doses of the butorphanol-medetomidine-midazolam combination to effectively and safely anaesthetise captive and free-ranging black-footed cats. Due to the differing physiological stressors associated with the capture methods in the freeranging black-footed cats these animals were divided into two groups, namely those that were dug out of burrows, and those that had been caught after a short intense chase. Once captured, all the cats were hand injected into a hind limb muscle group with the anaesthetic drug combination. Injections for different mass categories had been prepared prior to capture and the doses that were given were based on quick visual estimates of an animal s mass. In total, 23 black-footed cats, nine captive and 14 free-ranging, were anaesthetised. Times to induction, quality of anaesthesia and times to recovery after reversal {{of the effects of the}} anaesthetic drugs were recorded. Physiological variables recorded every 10 minutes during anaesthesia were heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO 2, ETCO 2, rectal temperature, systolic, mean and diastolic non-invasive blood pressures. Three central venous blood samples, taken at 20 - minute intervals during anaesthesia, were analyzed for pH, lactate and glucose concentrations and cTCO 2 and base excess were determined. Anaesthetic induction and recoveries were quick, smooth and uneventful with mean times of 5. 9 minutes and 4. 5 minutes respectively. We determined that even higher doses than our original target doses were required for induction and maintenance of a 45 minute anaesthesia. The quality and depth of anaesthesia were optimal for the minor sampling procedures performed, with the majority of cats maintaining a deep level of anaesthesia (Score 5) for 45 minutes before the antagonist combination was administered. Cardiac variables remained within normal physiological limits throughout the anaesthesia. Mild hyperventilation, moderate hypoxaemia and a mild to moderate lactic acidosis were initially recorded in the chased freeranging animals. The respiratory and acid-base variables in the other two groups of cats were within clinically acceptable limits. A gradual decrease in body temperature, despite the animals being placed on hot water bottles, was recorded in all the cats and thus a better means to mitigate this heat loss is recommended. Hyperglycaemia was recorded in all black-footed cats, and the fear, anxiety and exertion of the chase would have contributed to the hyperglycaemia induced by the use of the ? 2 adrenoreceptor-agonist medetomidine in the anaesthetic drug combination. Intramuscular injection of butorphanol, medetomidine and midazolam in black-footed cats induces rapid and smooth induction and is a safe and effective anaesthesia in both captive and free-ranging animals, despite higher doses used in free-ranging animals. The method used to capture free-ranging animals had a greater influence on the physiological stability of the anaesthetised animals than did the dose of drugs used. If black-footed cats exert themselves during a chase, before they receive this anaesthetic drug combination, they develop mild to moderate hypoxaemia, tissue hypoxia and metabolic lactic acidosis during the anaesthesia. Therefore, oxygen supplementation during anaesthesia is recommended in black-footed cats if they are chased directly before induction.
