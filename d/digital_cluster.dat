40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>cluster</b> {{is a new}} {{business}} model for the cooperation building among enterprises, which combines the strategy of industrial cluster and application of information technology to fulfill the mission of cluster by the network platform of electronic commerce. The goal of <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> aims to introduce local features {{to the world and}} enhance the competitiveness by the cooperation among enterprises. In spite of the aims <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> desires to reach, the key to success in terms of whether <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> can strive for a long run lies on what enterprises see in <b>digital</b> <b>cluster.</b> The purpose of this research is to investigate and discuss the practical experiences and views of corporate users about the application of <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> based on technology acceptance model (TAM). By the means of questionnaire survey and {{based on the results of}} analyses of 176 valid samples, here conclude several findings as follows: (1) The viewpoints of corporate users about digital cluster: Most corporate users think <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> not only can increase the public exposure but also is helpful for promotion, though it cannot significantly enhance sale volume or low down the cost. Even it's not very difficult for corporate users to learn how to use the platform of <b>digital</b> <b>cluster,</b> it is still not so flexible that the they cannot adjust its functions freely. More corporate users have positive perceptions on <b>digital</b> <b>cluster,</b> but the intention of application inclines to be low to some extents. Most of the enterprises indicate that they will keep participating in <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> in the future, but less frequent and proactive move will be taken place. (2) The status quo of corporate users', application of digital cluster: The frequency and time of spending on <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> for corporate users are ranked on medium-low degree. For the application of platform functions of <b>digital</b> <b>cluster,</b> corporate users employ it to present information most frequently, then to interact with customers on the Internet, and less for the order taking or databank building of customers. (3) Analyzing the influential factors of acceptance based on TAM: The degree of how corporate users feel about <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> is critical to their continuous application in the future. To promote the usage of enterprises, it is necessary to first enhance the perceived usefulness of <b>digital</b> <b>cluster.</b> 數位群聚是一新型態的企業合作之商業經營模式，係結合了群聚策略與資訊科技的應用，將群聚藉由電子商務的網路平台落實，希冀將在地化區域特色推向全球，並藉此讓企業互相合作提升競爭力。然不論數位群聚欲達成之目的為何，推動上最重要的是探析企業對數位群聚所抱持的觀感，才是數位群聚是否得以長久經營並達成目的的關鍵，故本研究之研究目的為探討企業目前使用數位群聚的情形與觀感。 本研究在經問卷調查後，針對有效樣本進行統計分析，並根據結果歸納出結論如下： 1. 企業對數位群聚的觀感： 企業認為數位群聚可協助增加企業曝光度，亦有助於其宣傳，然無法明顯提升其營業額或降低成本；數位群聚網站的學習與操作介面並無太大困難，然在網站的功能調整上較缺乏彈性；企業在數位群聚認同度上較高，但喜歡使用傾向則較低；多數企業表示在未來會持續參與數位群聚，然未來在主動性和使用頻率等意向則較低。 2. 企業導入數位群聚的使用情形： 企業對數位群聚的使用頻率和使用時間上以中低程度居多。在網站功能的運用上，企業多使用數位群聚來呈現資訊，其次為用以與顧客線上互動，較少以此接收訂單或建立會員資料庫。 3. 以科技接受模式分析影響因素： 企業知覺數位群聚有助益的程度，是影響其後續使用行為的關鍵因素，若欲提升企業使用行為，應從知覺有用性著手。第一章	緒論	 1 第一節	研究動機	 1 第二節	研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻探討	 4 第一節	群聚的意涵及群聚效應	 4 第二節	電子商務及其經營模式	 9 第三節	數位群聚的意涵及其實務探討	 15 第四節	科技接受模式及其相關研究	 23 第三章	研究方法	 32 第一節	研究架構與假設	 32 第二節	研究變項的操作型定義	 33 第三節	研究對象與抽樣方法	 39 第四節	資料分析分法	 40 第四章	資料分析與討論	 42 第一節	研究調查之描述	 42 第二節	樣本特性分析	 46 第三節	企業對數位群聚的觀感分析	 50 第四節	企業導入數位群聚之使用情形分析	 60 第五節	科技接受模式各概念變項的驗證與解釋力分析	 67 第五章	結論與建議	 71 第一節	研究結論	 71 第二節	研究限制與建議	 74 參考文獻	 76 附錄一 正式問卷	 81 附錄二 專家效度說明	 86 附錄三 專家檢證修正	 96 附錄四 預試問卷	 10...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{findings}} of a study into aggregated procurement in digitally clustered organisations. It brings together key principles including business clustering, e-procurement, aggregation and buyer-seller relationships. The paper identifies complexities associated with conducting reverse auctions for clustered organisations. Design/methodology/approach – A case study of a reverse auction carried out by an independent intermediary forms the basis of the paper. Data presented and analysed include pre-auction and auction performance of participants. Findings – Aggregating company spend and sourcing through reverse auctions poses several challenges. These include a selection of suitable products and services, the behaviour of buyers and sellers in a clustered environment and the identification of a suitable business model for the independent intermediary. It also indicates that not all participants may benefit or benefit significantly from clustered auctions. Research limitations/implications – Understanding of participant behaviour before, during and after e-reverse auctions in single and clustered organisations needs to be better understood. Differences in the mechanisms between single buyer and multiple buyer auctions also need more clarity. Practical implications – For clustered reverse auctions, there is a need to identify products with low build complexity and significant value-add. Otherwise, it may be necessary to form “clusters within the cluster” in order to attain true aggregation. Originality/value – This study examines participant actions in intermediary-facilitated multi-buyer and multi-seller e-reverse auctions. It identifies a number of behavioural issues that relate to this context and that impact on the success of auctions in a <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> context...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCONVENIENT is {{a project}} where {{prediction}} and integrated control are applied on several subsystems with electrified actuators. The technologies developed in this project are applied to a long-haul tractor and semi-trailer combination. A Volvo truck meeting the Eu 6 emission standard is rebuilt {{with a number of}} controllable electrified actuators. An e-Horizon system collects information about future road topography and speed limits. Controllable aerodynamic wind deflectors reduce the wind drag. The tractor is also equipped with a full <b>digital</b> <b>cluster</b> for human machine interface development. A primary project goal is to develop a model-based optimal controller that uses predictive information from the e-Horizon system in order to minimize fuel consumption. Several energy buffers are controlled in an integrated and optimal way using model predictive control. Several buffers are considered, such as the cooling system, the battery, and the vehicle kinetic energy. This paper presents details on the model predictive controller of the battery system and of the cooling system. Another project goal is to reduce fuel consumption by using adaptive aerodynamics. Controllers are developed that automatically sets an optimal roof deflector angle and the optimal side deflector angle. The results presented in this paper are encouraging. A third focus is the human machine interface and especially the communication between the driver and the control system during driving. This project develops a driver interface that encourages the driver to use the adaptive cruise controller when appropriate. The CONVENIENT project will be finalized this year.
