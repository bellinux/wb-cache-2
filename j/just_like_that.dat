As part of the two-leg playoff, Espanyol won the first leg at home 1-0 in Barcelona; but in front of a sell-out crowd at the Lluis Sitjar, RCDM would not be beaten, and won the playoff on goals from the feet of two local boys: Nadal and Vidal. The celebration carried on into the night and was absolutely spectacular.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{original}} description and early {{work on this}} species in the 1990s, other field work has revealed some instances of L. schismatica flowers that were unisexual. The closely related species Triuris brevistylis was discovered to be mostly dioecious but a few individuals were located that had bisexual flowers with the flower arrangement inverted, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the normal L. schismatica flowers. This discovery led {{the authors of the}} study to conclude that the inverted floral morphology evolved before L. schismatica and T. brevistylis diverged. Isolated populations during the Quaternary Period (around five million years ago) when temperatures in the Lacandon lowland rainforest were six to eight °C (10.8 to 14.4 °F) cooler than today. This hypothesis is supported by the geographic distribution where L. schismatica is restricted to the warmer lowlands and T. brevistylis has a distribution in the cooler highlands.|$|E

Watson also observes, [...] "Because of the presumption of White being better, the juncture of the game at which Black frees his game or neutralizes White's plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality, even though in dynamic openings, the exhaustion of White's initiative very often means that Black has seized it with advantage." ...|$|E

However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments. For financial and scripting reasons, the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back, with filming concluding in June 2010. After completing the final film he said: [...] "I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene, with us jumping through a fireplace, and then it was over.

500|$|Although Clements and Musker had {{originally}} intended to hire animator Glen Keane to animate Ursula due to his history of animating Disney villains, Keane specifically requested that he be allowed to animate Ariel after hearing Benson sing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for the first time.
