It was moved to its current location in 2015 from the previous position {{at the entrance to}} the airport where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> 50 years. The replica was apparently used as a static display in Reach for the Sky.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in his {{previous}} congressional term, when Weaver entered the 49th United States Congress, {{he was the only}} Greenback member. The new president, Democrat Grover Cleveland, was friendly to Weaver, and asked his advice on Iowa patronage. As <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> years, Weaver's chief concern was with the nation's money and finance, and the relationship between labor and capital.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{situation}} in the North Sea in late 1918 remained much as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the previous four years—with the Grand Fleet maintaining its endless watch over the High Seas Fleet—the war on the Western Front was rapidly drawing to a close. Operation Michael, the last German offensive, had been stopped in late summer, and with the aid {{of hundreds of thousands of}} American doughboys, the Allies had begun to overwhelm the German Army. On 3 October, Prince Max of Baden replaced Georg von Hertling as Chancellor of Germany, and immediately asked President Woodrow Wilson to arrange an armistice.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 2005, {{eight months}} after the release of Doom 3, id Software {{released}} an expansion pack for Doom 3 on Windows. The expansion, entitled Resurrection of Evil, was developed by Nerve Software, a company that had partnered with id Software on several other projects, including Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the Xbox conversion of Doom. Once again published by Activision, a Linux version was released on May 24, 2005, and an Xbox version followed on October 5, 2005. The expansion featured a new twelve-level single player campaign, set two years after the original storyline, as well as three new weapons, one of which is geared towards manipulating the physics in the game. Several new enemy characters were also introduced. Multiplayer gameplay was enhanced, officially increasing the player limit to eight and adding new game modes such as capture the flag. Resurrection of Evils reception was not as positive as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> Doom 3, but still received generally favorable reviews from the industry's critics.|$|E

It was also during his tenure in Westminster that Pope John Paul II made an historic visit to England in 1982.|$|E
25|$|A second {{structural}} change that undermined monetary management was {{the decline of}} U.S. hegemony. The U.S. {{was no longer the}} dominant economic power <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> more than two decades. By the mid-1960s, the E.E.C. and Japan had become international economic powers in their own right. With total reserves exceeding those of the U.S., higher levels of growth and trade, and per capita income approaching that of the U.S., Europe and Japan were narrowing the gap between themselves and the United States.|$|E

Wasps captain, Reeves, refused to continue loading until the fault had been fixed on some tanks and then agreed to perform the remaining work with his own personnel. This fault had been notified to the British authorities as it had affected Calendar and its recurrence was a serious embarrassment.|$|E

25|$|Traditional folk music, {{having been}} in a slow decline from {{mainstream}} popularity since the 1970s, began to enjoy a resurgence in the 1990s, benefiting from the more general interest in World music. The arrival, and sometimes mainstream success, of acts like Kate Rusby, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Eliza Carthy, Runrig and Capercaillie, all largely concerned with acoustic performance of traditional material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of British folk music. This {{was reflected in the}} adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000 and the profile for folk music was as high as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> over thirty years.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is widely}} thought that Another World {{expansion}} to 90 minutes was a cause of ratings erosion, the decision to expand the show was made {{at a time when}} its ratings (and that of NBC's other serials) were already in steady decline. During the period when Another World ran daily for 90 minutes it remained NBC's highest-rated soap opera, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> a decade. In the second half of 1980, after the show returned to 60 minutes, Another World and fellow NBC serials Days of our Lives and, most dramatically, The Doctors, experienced a collapse in ratings from which NBC's daytime lineup never fully recovered. It would not be until 1983 that both Days of Our Lives and Another World would recover some of their lost ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{river was}} subject to a {{repeated}} cycle of concerns being raised, improvements being made, euphoria at the result, and decline through neglect. However, in 1635 Owersby-based local landowner Sir John Monson was granted powers to construct a new river for drainage purposes. He removed most of the meanders, {{to create a new}} straight channel from Bishopbridge to Ferriby. The patent under which the work was carried out was again chiefly concerned with drainage, although there was a requirement to make sure that any new works did not make the river less useful for the passage of boats than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the previous seven years. At Ferriby, where there had been a bridge since 1312, a sluice was constructed, to control the deposition of silt from the Humber. It had three arches and 24 doors, but {{there is no mention of}} how boats could pass through it.|$|E

25|$|The {{system of}} {{alternating}} succession {{broke down in}} 1764, when Álvaro XI, a Kinlaza, drove out the Kimpanzu king Pedro V and took over the throne. Pedro and his successor in Luvata maintained a separate court at Sembo, and never acknowledged the usurpation. A regent of Pedro's successor claimed the throne in the early 1780s and pressed his claims against a José I, a Kinlaza from the Mbidizi Valley branch of the royal family. José won the showdown, fought at São Salvador in 1781, a massive battle involving 30,000 soldiers on José's side alone. To show his contempt for his defeated rival, José refused to allow the soldiers of the other faction to receive Christian burial. José's power was limited, as he had no sway over the lands controlled by the Kinlaza faction of Lemba and Matari, {{even though they were}} technically of the same family, and he did not follow up his victory to extend his authority over the Kimpanzu lands around Luvota. At the same time, the lands around Mount Kibangu, Pedro IV's original base, was controlled—as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> the whole eighteenth century—by members of the Água Rosada family, who claimed descent from both the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza.|$|E
