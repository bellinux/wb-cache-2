40|$|Minimal access {{procedures}} in surgery offer benefits of reduced patient recovery time and less pain, {{yet for the}} surgeon the task is more complex, as both tactile and visual perception of the working site is reduced. In this paper, experimental evidence {{of the performance of}} a novel sensing system embedded in an actuated flexible digit element is presented. The digit represents a steerable tip element of devices such as endoscopes and laparoscopes. This solution is able to discriminate types of contact and tissue interaction, and to feed back this information with the shape of the flexible digit. As an alternative to this information, force level, force distribution, and other quantifiable descriptors can also be evaluated. These can be used to aid perception in processes such as navigation and investigation of tissues through palpation. The solution is pragmatic, and by virtue of its efficient mechanical construction and a polymer construction, it offers opportunities for a <b>disposable</b> <b>element</b> with suitability for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scanning environments. By using only four photonics sensing elements, full perception of tissue contact and the shape of the actuated digit can be described in the feedback of this information. The distributive sensory method applied to the sensory signals relies on the coupled values of the sensory data transients of the four deployed sensing elements to discriminate tissue interaction directly in near real time...|$|E

Devices such as three-dimensional (3 D) printed, bespoke guides and orthopaedic robots are extensively described in the literature and {{have been shown to}} enhance prosthesis placement accuracy. These technologies, however, have significant drawbacks, such as logistical and temporal inefficiency, high cost, cumbersome nature and difficult theatre integration. A new technology for the rapid intraoperative production of patient specific instrumentation, which overcomes many of the disadvantages of existing technologies, is presented here. The technology comprises a reusable table side machine, bespoke software and a <b>disposable</b> <b>element</b> comprising a region of standard geometry and a body of mouldable material. Anatomical data from Computed Tomography (CT) scans of 10 human scapulae was collected and, in each case, the optimal glenoid guidewire position was digitally planned and recorded. The achieved accuracy compared to the preoperative bespoke plan was measured in all glenoids, from both a conventional group and a guided group. The technology was successfully able to intraoperatively produce sterile, patient specific guides according to a pre-operative plan in 5 minutes, with no additional manufacturing required prior to surgery. Additionally, the average guide wire placement accuracy was 1. 58 mm and 6. 82 ◦ degrees in the manual group, and 0. 55 mm and 1. 76 ◦ degrees in the guided group, also demonstrating a statistically significant improvement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Disposable</b> {{mechanical}} <b>elements</b> with extremely short {{lives are}} widely used in the aerospace and defense fields. To reliably evaluate the life of <b>disposable</b> mechanical <b>elements,</b> many attentions were concentrated in the fatigue properties of <b>disposable</b> mechanical <b>elements.</b> According to the different meanings of static strength for metals, <b>disposable</b> mechanical <b>elements</b> are {{divided into two groups}} with different fatigue properties: extremely low cycle fatigue module for Type I with ultimate strength as design stress and low cycle fatigue module for Type II with yield strength as design stress. The Kuroda model and a cumulative damage model consisting of the Miner’s rule and the sequential law are used in the fatigue design process of the Type I. To the Type II, the Manson-Coffin model is suitable for conventional applications but more attempts are still conducted to further improve stress levels. The Type II with increasing load sequences are specially treated, since the cyclic yield strength of certain materials under pulsating stress closing to the yield strength increase with the deepening of fatigue damage. Consequently, under the increasing pulsating cyclic loading, the later load whose amplitude is higher than the initial yield strength will be permitted.

40|$|There {{are many}} fuel quality {{standards}} introduced by national organizations and fuel producers. Usual techniques for measuring fuel parameters like cetane number, cetane index, fraction composition, viscosity, density, and flash point, require relatively complex and expensive laboratory equipment. On the fuel user side, fast and low cost sensing of useful state of biodiesel fuel is important. The main parameters of diesel fuel compatibility are: density, viscosity and surface tension. These three parameters define indirectly {{the quality of}} the fuel atomization process and the injected portion of energy that affect {{the quality of the}} fuel. In the presented paper the purposefulness of fuel testing using measurements of separable parameters is discussed. On this base, a sensor which enables the examination of relation of the mentioned parameters in one arrangement is proposed, analyzed and tested. The sensor uses the dynamic capillary rise method with photonic multichannel data reading in an inclined capillary. The principle of the sensor’s operation, the construction of the sensor head, and the experimental results are presented. The capillary is a <b>disposable</b> <b>element.</b> The sensor testing was performed with freshly prepared biodiesel fuels, and fuels stored for 2 years. We conclude that the proposed construction may be in future the base of low cost commercially marketable instruments for basic fuel classification: fit for use or not.

Therefore, the proposed sensor is intended to use in fuel buying/selling point rather than used as part of a diesel engine automated system...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} Structuralism {{influenced}} {{the work of the}} Japanese Metabolists. In 1960, the Metabolists stepped onto the international architectural scene with the presentation of their manifesto Metabolism 1960 at the World Design Conference in Tokyo. Throughout the 1960 s, they proposed a series of urban schemes where the city was envisioned as a growing and changeable organism constituted by two parts: a primary long-life ever-expanding infrastructure which supports secondary <b>disposable</b> <b>elements</b> necessary for urban life such as prefabricated housing capsules. Their schemes were characterized by an impressive use of technology and mega-structural scale. Obvious similarities can be observed between Metabolism’s and Structuralism’s design strategies such as, the use of identifiable repetitive elements, the allowance for growth and change, a distinction between primary structures with long-life cycle and secondary in-fills with shorter life cycles. However, the application of such methods and principles of design is not necessarily grounded in the theory of Structuralism. In their texts, the Metabolists argue that their theory and practice are firmly grounded in Japanese history and culture. Still, they were surely informed about the Structuralist ideas of Team 10; if not directly then through their mentor Kenzo Tange, who attended the 1959 CIAM in Otterlo and underpinned his Tokyo Bay Plan (1960) with a structuralist analysis. This paper examines Metabolist writings, projects and built works and observes the transition of concepts from texts to drawings to buildings. It detects the disparities between Metabolists theory and practice, tests the claims of the Metabolists of a purely Japanese architecture and thus draws conclusions on the influence of Structuralism on Metabolism in theory and practice...|$|R

40|$|After Sanofi {{acquired}} {{intellectual property}} (IP) from bankrupt Pelikan Technologies it desired to leverage the IP {{to identify a}} product concept to enhance the company's portfolio. To facilitate the project, a structured opportunity identification process was utilized. This process consisted of four major steps: Problem Framing, Idea Search, Screen, and Refine. Problem Framing formulated the innovation challenge. Idea Search sourced over two dozen potential opportunities that spanned markets and industries. Using a tournament selection approach, the Screen step filtered the opportunities according technical and strategic objectives. This selected an integrated blood measurement device as the opportunity of focus. This leverages the IP to simplify at-home blood testing while simultaneously reducing pain. The Refine step evaluated the opportunity using a framework that assessed markets, product, competitiveness, economics, and risk. The beachhead market is the diabetes market and potential follow-on markets are oncology, multiple sclerosis, rare diseases, and cardio-metabolic diseases. Key technology elements were assembled {{into a variety of}} conceptual approaches and evaluated according to market fit. This identified a conceptual approach that integrates all <b>disposable</b> <b>elements</b> (i. e. lancet and blood test element) into a single disposable cartridge that can be inserted into an electronically actuated meter. The projected financial returns in the beachhead market have a positive nominal NPV. NPV sensitivity was calculated based on estimated cost and revenue item variations. In all cases the NPV remains positive, but this highlighted key drivers of economic performance along with risks that need to be resolved in future development work. With key assumptions identified, Sanofi is in an excellent position {{to decide whether or not}} to pursue the identified opportunity. In addition, this project acts as a pilot for a structured opportunity identification process within the company and it is recommended that Sanofi adopt a similar process as part of its product development workflow. Finally, the company should adjust resources and financial commitment to ensure full cross-functional teams can be staffed to execute opportunity identification work.

The effectiveness of DPFs and DFEs in removing aerosols by number was strongly influenced by engine operating mode.

Tests were conducted in the NIOSH Diesel Laboratory at the Lake Lynn Laboratory experimental mine, a facility developed to allow evaluation {{of these and other}} control technologies directly in an underground environment. The aforementioned technologies are evaluated by comparing the aerosol and gas measurements in the mine air 60 m downstream of the exhaust from a naturally aspirated, mechanically controlled engine fitted with the tested systems or muffler and operated at four steady-state engine speed and power modes. The tested DPF and HT DFE systems caused a 10 -fold reduction in total mass concentrations of aerosols. The size distribution and number concentration measurements showed that all tested DPF systems and HT DFE elements effectively removed accumulation mode aerosols (D 50 > 30 nm) for all test modes. An increase in peak number concentrations of nucleation mode (D 50 > 30 nm) diesel aerosols is evident for some of tested DPF systems when engine was operated at high-load modes. The effects of uncatalyzed DPFs on nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations are found to be minor. A four-fold increase in percentages of NO 2 in total nitrogen oxides (NOx) over baseline case was observed for the DOC when the engine was operated at high-load modes.

In 1962, Judson's son, Tom, was diagnosed with leukemia. His physician was able to have Tom admitted to the Clinical Center of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). On admission, they showed Judson a procedure to remove white blood cells from a patient. It was laborious. They would remove two units (450 ml) of blood, spin them in a bucket centrifuge, express the plasma into a satellite bag, and the white cells into another satellite bag. The packed red cells and the plasma would be recombined and administered to the patient. This would be repeated over and over. Judson, being an engineer, suggested {{that this could be}} done on a continuous-flow basis. He was sent to see Dr. Emil J. Freireich who expressed enthusiasm for the project. Judson returned to IBM and asked for a year's leave of absence to work on his ideas. IBM gave him the one-year leave with pay and provided engineering assistance. His work {{led to the development of}} the NCI Blood Cell Separator and later to the IBM 2990 Blood Cell Separator which could harvest white blood cells from blood donors, to support leukemia patients to keep them alive. The subsequent development of the machine as the IBM 2997, essentially a continuous centrifuge which separated the blood into red blood cells, white blood cells, and blood plasma (used in plasmapheresis), was picked up by IBM's Systems Supplies Division (SSD) which was already ready marketing the IBM 2991 Blood cell Processor.

40|$|Magnetic biosensors are an {{important}} part of biomedical applications of magnetic materials. As the living tissue is basically a “soft matter. ” this study addresses the development of ferrogels (FG) with micron sized magnetic particles of magnetite and strontium hexaferrite mimicking the living tissue. The basic composition of the FG comprised the polymeric network of polyacrylamide, synthesized by free radical polymerization of monomeric acrylamide (AAm) in water solution at three levels of concentration (1. 1 M, 0. 85 M and 0. 58 M) to provide the FG with varying elasticity. To improve FG biocompatibility and to prevent the precipitation of the particles, polysaccharide thickeners—guar gum or xanthan gum were used. The content of magnetic particles in FG varied up to 5. 2 wt % depending on the FG composition. The mechanical properties of FG and their deformation in a uniform magnetic field were comparatively analyzed. FG filled with strontium hexaferrite particles have larger Young’s modulus value than FG filled with magnetite particles, most likely due to the specific features of the adhesion of the network’s polymeric subchains on the surface of the particles. FG networks with xanthan are stronger and have higher modulus than the FG with guar. FG based on magnetite, contract in a magnetic field 0. 42 T, whereas some FG based on strontium hexaferrite swell. Weak FG with the lowest concentration of AAm shows a much stronger response to a field, as the concentration of AAm governs the Young’s modulus of ferrogel. A small magnetic field magnetoimpedance sensor prototype with Co 68. 6 Fe 3. 9 Mo 3. 0 Si 12. 0 B 12. 5 rapidly quenched amorphous ribbon based element was designed aiming to develop a sensor working with a <b>disposable</b> stripe sensitive <b>element.</b> The proposed protocol allowed measurements of the concentration dependence of magnetic particles in gels using magnetoimpedance responses in the presence of magnetite and strontium hexaferrite ferrogels with xanthan. We have discussed the importance of magnetic history for the detection process and demonstrated the importance of remnant magnetization in the case of the gels with large magnetic particles...|$|R
40|$|Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) {{technologies}} entail the miniaturization of analytical systems, and {{the reduction}} of required sample and reagent volumes. LOC devices offer compact alternatives to classical instrumentation while delivering comparable performance and disposable formats. These aspects make disposable LOC a clear candidate to support distributed chemical sensing applications; however, the need of accessory services and readout obstructs the materialization of pervasively distributed LOC solutions. In this thesis methods and devices {{to solve this problem}} are investigated. A distinctive aspect of this work is the pursuit of solutions based on <b>disposable</b> LOC <b>elements</b> specifically conceived to exploit ubiquitous infrastructure for readout and evaluation. Consumer electronic devices, such as cell phones are ubiquitous platforms with residual capabilities {{that can be used for}} chemical sensing, if properly interfaced. This work investigates elements and tools needed to empower cell phones as readers of disposable LOC devices and commercial disposable tests. Access to flexible fabrication of LOC devices at low cost is an important requisite for testing ideas and implementing customized solutions. A first contribution in this thesis is the development of a platform for mask less fabrication of 3 D microstructures, which coexists on a routine fluorescence microscope. This microscope projection lithography system (MPLS) is capable of controlled 3 D micro structuring, including cavities and cantilever geometries, and the sealing of monolithic micro cavities to glass substrates as well as the connection to large scale service areas. This fabrication platform and other fabrication methods were used along this thesis to provide disposable optical and fluidic components. Besides custom-made LOC solutions there are well-established commercial disposable devices, which are essentially compatible with decentralized diagnosis, except for the use of specialized readers that confine them to medical centers. The implementation of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging with standard cell phones, using the phone screen to control exposure, shows that sensitivity and resolution can be boosted to permit robust evaluation of this type of disposable tests, in decentralized scenarios. Solutions employing commercial tests, which have not been designed for cell phone evaluation, are typically suboptimal and the investigation of customized LOC components occupies a central role in this thesis. Accordingly, one important aspect to evaluate LOC devices in compact configurations is to be able to image the LOC at a close distance from the phone camera, a condition for which phones cameras are not able to focus. In addition, different phone brands and models have different optical specifications, and a practical refocusing solution should adapt to all of them. In this work an adaptive lens concept, complemented by phone time-lapse acquisition, which can be integrated in disposable LOCs, is demonstrated. The implementation of sensitive detection methods, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which is compatible with label free protocols that simplify sample conditioning, is central to the materialization of ubiquitous LOCs readable with cell phones. In this thesis a disposable optical coupler, conditioning illumination taken from the phone screen, is used to create an angle resolved SPR signal from a LOC, which is read with the phone front camera. Tested performance is comparable with commercial compact SPR modules and detection of β 2 microglobulin, which is an established marker for cancer, inflammatory disorders, and kidney disease, is within the diagnostics range for blood and urine. Finally, fluorescence detection within classical LOC devices is tailored to be detectable with consumer cameras. In this case a disposable optical coupler and fluidics is designed to condition laser illumination into total internal reflection excitation, while DSLR and phone cameras capture optically separated fluorescence. The system configuration supports a broad dynamic range and HDR imaging enables localized resolution boost at selected detection ranges. Detection of free fucose, a diagnostic marker for liver cirrhosis and several cancer forms, is shown feasible with a HDR implementation, as one last example of practical LOC detection schemes for decentralized scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to design and {{fabricate}} all purpose, positioning-tolerant and efficient interconnects between single-mode fibers and integrated waveguides out of polymers. The developed structures are part of the optical packaging of integrated optical chips. Integrated optics have gathered tremendous interest throughout recent years from research {{as well as from the}} industry, and most likely the demand will further grow in the future. Today’s trend is to establish optical data communication not only in far-distance transmission but also in end-user or so called fiber-to-home configurations, or, in the near future, also on board or even chip level. In addition, integrated optical sensors are gaining more and more importance. In the future, lab-on-a-chip systems may be able to simplify and accelerate analysis methods within health care or allow for a continuous monitoring of almost any environmental variable. All these applications call for robust optical packaging solutions. Many integrated optical chips are using a silicon-on-insulator design. Technologies which were originally intended for the manufacturing of integrated circuits can be utilized for the fabrication of such silicon-on-insulator chips. Point-of-care testing, which is a considerable part of bio-sensing, in some cases only allows the use of <b>disposable</b> transducer <b>elements.</b> The fabrication of these transducers, also including almost all other system parts, may be possible using polymers. Alternative fabrication methods like nanoimprint lithography can be applied for the patterning of polymers. With these, the extension of already known working principles or even entirely new device architectures become feasible for mass production. The direct patterning of polymers by means of nanoimprint was used to fabricate interconnects for integrated waveguides. In contrast to conventional lithography approaches, where a patterned resist layer is used as a masking layer for subsequent process steps, direct patterning allows the immediate use of the structures as functional elements. Firstly, nanoimprint allows diffraction-unlimited patterning with nanometer resolutions as well as the replication of complex three-dimensional patterns. These unique properties were used within this work to pattern shallow gratings atop an integrated waveguide within only one single manufacturing step. The gratings are used as coupling elements and can be utilized either to couple light from external elements to the chip or vice versa. Considerations regarding the optical effects on single-mode polymer waveguides as well as grating couplers were obtained from simulation. They are specific to the chosen design and the used polymer and cannot be found elsewhere so far. Compared to similar designs and fabrication strategies proposed in literature, the ones followed here allow for a higher efficiency. The dimensions and process windows obtained from simulation did serve as a basis for the subsequent fabrication of the grating couplers. All steps which are necessary to turn the calculated design into reality, ranging from master fabrication, to working mold cast and imprint, are shown in detail. The use of a working mold strategy is of crucial importance for the fabrication process and is discussed in detail. The use of a working mold preserves a costly master and further allows for a cost-efficient production. Parameters which are relevant for the production as well as for the final polymer patterns were analyzed and discussed. On the basis of the obtained data, a process optimization was performed. The optical characterization was also part of the presented work. A comparison with the results obtained from simulation is included and additional effects were revealed. Most of them may be subject to further improvement in future designs. In summary, the present work contributes to the field of optical packaging. It shows a viable route for the design and fabrication of interconnects of single-mode polymer waveguides. The presented design can be used as a building block which can be placed at almost any positions within an integrated optical chip. The fabrication method includes a minimum number of process steps and is still able to increase performance compared to similar approaches. Moreover, all process steps allow for scaling and are potential candidates for mass production...|$|R
