In contrast, FilmsAsia reviewer Soh Yun-Huei panned its use of political satire, which she felt [...] " [...] the film to be devoid of innocence and replaced with a sense of agenda and manipulation".|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, {{there was}} a {{consensus}} that [...] "The giant center of Michigan practically stands in a class by himself at the pivot position". [...] University of Chicago star Walter Eckersall, said: [...] "Schulz, of Michigan, easily outshone his opponents in every game. [...] He is finely built, runs fast, snaps accurately, tackles hard, and <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the field in every play". [...] One writer referred to Schulz in 1907 as a [...] "human catapult" [...] and said: [...] "Schulz of Michigan is a very heavy man, weighing over 200pounds, yet he is strikingly fast on his feet and is unusual on that account. [...] He propels his massive frame at a rate of speed that terrifies opponents.... The acknowledged prowess of Schulz makes him an especial object of unfair attack in scrimmages by opponents who hope, by disabling him, to weaken the Michigan team".|$|E
500|$|... "Love Somebody" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is written in the key of D♭ major and its {{instrumentation}} consists of piano and guitar. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described the song's synth hook as the Sly Stone-meets-Eurythmics. According to Chris Payne of Billboard, Tedder and Zancanella's influence <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the song and inches through the verses [...] "before bubbling over just before the chorus kicks in." [...] Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly {{in a review of}} the album, wrote that the song together with [...] "Daylight" [...] have [...] "thickly" [...] produced choruses. Lyrically, [...] "Love Somebody" [...] equates love and physical intimacy, with Levine singing: [...] "I really wanna love somebody [...] I really wanna touch somebody". Nate Chinen of The New York Times described the lyrical theme of the song as [...] "a plea for salvation on the dance floor or some other horizontal surface".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers found the album overly long, while others felt Feldmann {{was too much}} of an influence. Mike Damante at the Houston Chronicle said [...] "Feldmann's style <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the record, as most tracks sound too formulaic, similar and run together. Other tracks are way too commercial, even for a band the size of blink.... California is {{ultimately}} a step back, rather a throwback." [...] David Anthony from The A.V. Club gave the album a C-, commenting, [...] "California is the sound of Blink-182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity. [...] is another homogenous addition to Feldmann's growing résumé. But this time he unintentionally removed the soul of pop-punk's clown princes in the process." [...] Nina Corcoran from Consequence of Sound was similarly negative: [...] "When not cranking the compression on the vocals, Feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks: the piano interludes, the stiffened handclaps, the sappy title track." [...] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian, focusing on the album's turbulent history regarding the departure of DeLonge, deemed the album [...] "a tired – and tiring – work." ...|$|E

500|$|Mars {{revealed}} to Billboard in September 2012 on {{a preview of}} his cover story that he recorded an album that represented his freedom. On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and what he stands for, mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 55, based on 14 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Billboard was positive toward the album, writing that {{the album is}} [...] "a must-heard recording rich with pleasantly surprising depth". In a mixed review, E! Online wrote, [...] "If she had just shown up and sang her ass off, Stripped would've been a better show". Josh Kun from Spin commented, [...] "As an artistic statement, Stripped <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the placeit's a move toward hip-hop, it's a move toward rock, it's ghetto, it's Disney". Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone provided a three-out-of-five-stars rating for the album, calling it [...] "almost" [...] an album for grown-ups, yet criticized its lack of musical concentration. Blender wrote a mixed review, yet commenting {{that it is better}} than Britney Spears' works. Writing for BBC Music, Jacqueline Hodges said that the album [...] "is as full-on bold and over the top as most of Christina's outfits... much of this seems to be an exercise in stretching the vocal chords to weak backing tracks". Jim Wirth for NME commented that Stripped is a Mariah Carey album. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the album is [...] "so overproduced and overwrought that it could easily pass for a Janet album".|$|E
500|$|In the Billboard {{magazine}} {{review of}} the album, contributor Katy Kroll wrote that Timberlake [...] "claims to be bringing 'sexy' back to pop music, and indeed he is. You can almost feel beads of sweat rolling off the title track and 'SexyBack' featuring Timbaland". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Timbaland, producer of the song, writing that Timbaland offers [...] "tougher, trickier rhythms, minimal live playing, a plethora of hip-hop cameos, and a self-consciously hard, edgy club sensibility" [...] to [...] "SexyBack". Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, [...] "The producer's angular synthesizer crunch <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> it [...] at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back. PopMatters' contributor Quentin B. Huff wrote that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was the [...] "fraternal twin" [...] to Nelly Furtado's 2006 song [...] "Promiscuous". Andrew Murfett of The Age wrote that the song was a [...] "raunchy club banger that slyly suppresses" [...] Timberlake's customary falsetto. He continues, [...] "it's introduced a new phrase into the pop cultural lexicon". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday was complimentary towards the song, writing that it was [...] "Timberlake at his best, mainstreaming {{a combination of the}} wild, edgy dance-pop style of Basement Jaxx with Missy Elliott's more experimental hip-hop to create a boldly inventive sound that still pleases the masses." ...|$|E

500|$|In a May 2012 interview, Whedon {{said that}} it was his {{decision}} to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. [...] "He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [...] was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were {{some of the most important}} texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'" [...] An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the Angel episode, [...] "A Hole in the World". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, [...] "went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events," [...] which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz {{disliked the}} two {{original}} ballads, [...] "Christmas Time Is In the Air Again" [...] and [...] "One Child", describing them [...] "both thick with gooey orchestration", but praised [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] and [...] "When Christmas Comes" [...] for their uptempo melodies. However, she was {{confused by the}} re-recording of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", saying that [...] "It's {{hard to figure out}} what's 'extra festive, and quipped that it is [...] "far easier to determine what's wrong with 'Auld Lang Syne' (an awkward dance beat)". Ganz concluded with [...] "the LP's warm heart is in the right place." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half stars}} our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey’s sequel to 1994’s buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable." [...] While he continued to label it as an [...] "incredibly adventureless album," [...] he also wrote that it is a [...] "remarkably comforting listen". He felt that Merry Christmas II You was not a sequel, or a remake, but rather an attempt at rewinding time on Carey's part. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of Merry Christmas II You. He described [...] "One Child" [...] as a [...] "needless retelling", [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] as trying too hard and too difficult to sing along to and [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)" [...] as a desperate attempt at Carey canonising herself for re-recording her own song. [...] "The near-crazed desperation to please listeners for her own sake <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Merry Christmas II You: A [...] "gift" [...] to her fans (or so she claims) that they, of course, must pay for, it's her fascinating, career-long saga of self-obsession in a nutshell." ...|$|E
500|$|Grey's Anatomy {{has been}} well {{received}} among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site. The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows {{in the quality of}} the hit medical drama saying, [...] "The quality arc for the show <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six" [...] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, [...] " [...] I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." [...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." [...] The site lauded the show saying, [...] "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." ...|$|E
