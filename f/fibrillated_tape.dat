40|$|Photodegradation {{of three}} types of {{polyethylene}} twines namely, polyethylene <b>fibrillated</b> <b>tape</b> twine, polyethylene flat tape twine and polyethylene monofilament twines were studied by exposing them to sunlight and artificial UV radiation. The percentage residual strength varied in the samples, the monofilament with the highest residual strength followed by <b>fibrillated</b> <b>tape</b> twine and flat tape twine. A plot {{of the difference between}} the breaking strengths of the <b>fibrillated</b> <b>tape</b> twine and the mono filament twines against any given period of exposure exhibited a linear relationshi...|$|E
40|$|Development of a Braided Polypropylene Rope Using Polypropylene Tape Yarns is {{a journal}} article. Traditionally, braided ropes are {{manufactured}} using either staple yarns or multifilament yarns. This study therefore sought {{to break this}} traditional paradigm by uniquely and economically manufacturing braided polypropylene ropes using polypropylene tape yarns. A recipe made up of virgin polypropylene granules, calcium carbonate and black masterbatch was used to produce a polypropylene plastic sheet, which was extruded on a Barmag machine. Tape yarns with a width of 22 mm on average were produced. Count, width, thickness, elongation and tensile strength of the tape yarns used to produce the rope were tested. The elongation and tensile strength tests were done on a Micro 500 Testometric strength-testing machine. Test results on the tape yarns revealed that they have properties that fall within the standard range of <b>fibrillated</b> polypropylene <b>tape</b> yarns. Sorptive properties of both the tape yarns used and the braided rope developed revealed {{a slight increase in}} water absorbance to approximately 0. 15 % compared to standard water absorbance of less than 0. 1 %. This increment in water absorbance, however, did not change the floating properties of both the tape yarns and the braided rope as they both remained with their positive buoyancy. Also, no signs of microbial attack were seen on the tape yarns and the braided rope by naked eyes after exposing the samples to water. The resultant braided rope produced was made up of 12 X 4973 denier polypropylene tape yarns with a 9200 -denier polypropylene bailer twine as the core. The count and diameter of the resultant rope were found to be close to those of hazard barrier and hydro-pulling ropes and were also analogous to those of 5 mm cotton braided ropes produced...|$|R
