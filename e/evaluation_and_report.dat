40|$|Sustainable {{management}} and conservation of the world’s oceans requires effective monitoring, <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting.</b> Despite the growing {{political and social}} imperative for these activities, there are some persistent and emerging challenges that marine practitioners face in undertaking these activities. In 2015, {{a diverse group of}} marine practitioners came together to discuss the emerging challenges associated with marine monitoring, <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting,</b> <b>and</b> potential solutions to address these challenges. Three emerging challenges were identified: (1) the need to incorporate environmental, social and economic dimensions in <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> reporting; (2) the implications of big data, creating challenges in data {{management and}} interpretation; and, (3) dealing with uncertainty throughout monitoring, <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> activities. We point to key solutions to address these challenges across monitoring, <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> activities: 1) integrating models into marine management systems to help understand, interpret, and manage the environmental and socio-economic dimensions of uncertain and complex marine systems; 2) utilising big data sources and new technologies to collect, process, store, and analyse data; and 3) applying approaches to evaluate, account for, <b>and</b> <b>report</b> on the multiple sources and types of uncertainty. These solutions point towards a potential for a new wave of evidence-based marine management, through more innovative monitoring, rigorous <b>evaluation</b> <b>and</b> transparent <b>reporting.</b> Effective collaboration <b>and</b> institutional support across the science–management–policy interface will be crucial to deal with emerging challenges, and implement the tools and approaches embedded within these solutions. </p...|$|R

We report on the key abstractions offered by the platform and report on its use for developing two IoT applications involving spontaneous device interaction: 1) mobile phones and public displays, and 2) a web-based sensor actuator network portal called Sense Tecnic (STS). We discuss how the MB 2 abstractions and implementation have evolved over time to the current design.

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{providing}} topic driven access to full text documents. The methodology we propose is a combination of topic segmentation and information retrieval techniques. By segmenting the text into topic driven segments, we obtain small and coherent documents {{that can be used in}} two ways: as a basis for automatically generating hypertext links, and as a visualization aid for the reader who is presented with a small set of focused and restricted text snippets. In the presence of a concept hierarchy, or ontology, information retrieval techniques can be used to connect the segments obtained to concepts in the ontology. In this paper we concentrate on the text segmentation phase: we describe our approach to segmentation, discuss issues related to <b>evaluation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>report</b> on preliminary results...|$|E

40|$|Web {{accessibility}} evaluations {{are significantly}} different from document validations; they are not based on determining conformance with specifications of formal grammars but are often more rule-based methodologies encompassing sequences of atomic tests to determine conformance to guidelines. While some of these tests may not be automatable by current computer technology and require human judgment to determine the results, evaluation tools often vary considerably in their coverage and reliability for tests that are automatable. These differences in tool performances are probably unavoidable in practice; however, they cause notable discrepancies in the efficiency {{and quality of the}} conformance evaluations. This paper discusses the practical implications of the <b>Evaluation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Report</b> Language; a vendor neutral vocabulary to facilitate the aggregation of test results generated by different evaluation tools in order to maximize the benefit from their respective features.
