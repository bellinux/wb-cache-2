awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor

hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me

and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better <b>I</b> <b>havent</b> even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was

didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending

5000|$|The Midnight Organ Fight {{found itself}} in several [...] "must have" [...] lists that were {{compiled}} by various music publications, networks, and other media {{in the years following}} its release. Bill Cummings of God Is in the TV opined that the band had managed to, [...] "step up to embrace a more luscious sound showcasing their unique ability (unlike many bands) to make personal experience connect on an almost anthemic, universal level. Scott’s songs convey candid tales of ordinary folk with a wry, acerbic wit via an eloquent, emotive, modern garage-pop aesthetic." [...] Drowned in Sound ranked the album at number two in their [...] "Best Albums of 2008" [...] list with Alexander Tudor writing, [...] "Fact: Casual Listeners will buy what they’re told, if it’s got tunes and a catchphrase, which means the airwaves are always polluted with inanities, and we assume the norm is natural. But Word-of-Mouth means something, it means youre kept listening, maybe it means you loved that album, you felt like it was yours, and the votes you chose to send-in tell us the Not-So-Casual listener does care for the words s/he listens to; in this case, an album about breaking-up and f*cking-up, with the grisliest imagery since Arab Strap, and a moral complexity eclipsing Belle & Sebastian." [...] It ranked at number twenty seven on The Flys end-of-year album list, with Stephen Brolan stating, [...] "The Midnight Organ Fight may be a bitter, bitter account of relationships ending, but {{it is also one of}} the years most sheerly loveable and entertaining albums. Pop brilliance and emotional turmoil perfectly synthesised." [...] The Midnight Organ Fight also appeared in NMEs end-of year list at number thirty six, as well as being included in their [...] "Greatest Albums of the Decade" [...] article. In the latter, Barry Nicholson opined, [...] "It’s a dark tunnel, but this record is worth it." [...] Finbarr Bermingham of The Skinny named the album as the fourth best in Scotland between 2000-2009. He noted, [...] "Trying to pick an album highlight has been an exercise in futility. Over the course of 18 months, any one of ten tracks has suggested itself as a contender. The song-writing here is accumulative: borrowing from a range of styles to create a near perfect whole; a flawless indie-pop record." [...] American magazine Treble, while including the album in their [...] "Best Albums of the 00s" [...] list, said that the band, [...] "blew the doors wide open with the epic, emotionally charged, The Midnight Organ Fight. If theres an album from 2008 with more fantastic melodies, <b>I</b> certainly <b>havent</b> heard it. To paraphrase their own lyrics, theyre much better than ever." [...] The album also received end-of-year inclusions from various other media including Alternative Ulster, The A.V. Club, Magnet, Lost at Sea, Pitchfork Media, and The Village Voice.|$|R

he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before

enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry

winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to

hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do

Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for I he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want

40|$|Sweet potato Cue: Sweet {{potatoes}} {{have a lot}} of enemies. Pests {{and diseases}} can be extremely destructive, causing huge losses if not controlled. Weeds are not usually regarded as such as serious problem, although if allowed to grow unchecked, can reduce final harvests by more than half. One advantage sweet potatoes have over other root crops, such as yams and cassava, is that their stems and leaves spread quickly, shading the soil and preventing weed growth. The most important time for weeding, therefore, is early {{in the life of the}} crop, when the soil around the plants is bare. To find out more about when, and how to weed, Patrick Mphaka visited a crop research centre close to the city of Blantyre in Malawi, where new types, or cultivars of sweet potato are being developed. IN:		?Sweet potato is increasingly becoming ? OUT:		?are acceptable to the end-users. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 05 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Thumbiko Mkandawire of Bvumbwe Agricultural Research Station in Malawi. Transcript Mphaka	Sweet potato is increasingly becoming an important crop in Malawi and the region. This is so because of its drought resistant characteristic in the face of the current unreliable rains which continuously affect the production of other crops such as maize. To revamp the growing of the crop, Bvumbwe Agricultural Research Station Root Crop Commodity Team has been doing some research on various Sweet Potato varieties. One of the important aspects of any crop is weed control. To find out how weeds can effectively be controlled in Sweet potatoes, I had a chat with Mr Thumbiko Mkandawire, an Agricultural Research Scientist of the Root Crop Commodity Team. I caught up with him in a plot of sweet potatoes. Thumbiko	In here we have got different varieties of sweet potato. Some are the released varieties, some are still under experimentation. Some are very promising compared to the local varieties. Mphaka	Could we focus on weed control, how do you control the weeds in here? Thumbiko	In here, normally once we have started irrigating the crops or using the rain fed, weeds start to emerge. Most of the times, weeds tend to grow faster than the clones. So in the first place we use the hoe, then later on we use the hand weeding because if we tend to use the hoe, we may end up cutting the vines hence in the end, we may predispose the vines to the disease-causing organisms. Hence we end up losing the varieties. Mphaka	What you have just said, is it something which the farmers do practise or its something which they have not been practising but it?s something which you tell them to be practising because of the advantages you have just outlined? Thumbiko	Farmers are very knowledgeable. If you go to their fields you will find that two to three weeks after planting, if they have observed that the weeds are growing faster than the desired crop, you will find that farmers will take a hoe and weed, and remove the weeds. Once the plant has developed fully, and it has started putting up some of the roots into the soil, the farmers normally they do not use a hoe. They use the hands because they are running away from predisposing the crop from the disease-causing organisms as well as the soil insects. Mphaka	Now, what would you say is commonly practised: as you have done growing just sweet potatoes on a piece of land, or inter-cropping? Thumbiko	In other areas, the farmers do intercrop with other crops, but in other areas, the farmers they just grow one particular field with sweet potatoes as you know that in Malawi we have got a problem of land especially in the Southern Region. Therefore the farmers normally do portion a piece of land to a specific crop. Mphaka	If you look at the two scenarios, which area becomes more problematic when it comes to weeds? Thumbiko:	This one depends on how knowledgeable the farmer is. But in most cases in terms of labour use and minimisation of labour costs to the farmers, they tend to intercrop the sweet potato with other crops. But at times it might bring about competition for nutrients and other aspects, hence in the end, you may find that there might be a reduction in the yield in both crops. But if the crop can be grown in pure state, you find that yield returns tend to be higher than in the intercrop. Mphaka	We have noticed that some of the farmers start growing their sweet potatoes towards the end of the rainy season, while others, at the same time as they are growing the maize. Now, if you look at the two methods, which one is correct, and which one would control the weeds much better? Thumbiko	The first one is a better approach in weed control management than the delayed one, because you will be able to control the weeds before they flower; you end up reducing their mechanism for multiplication in terms for seed production. And at the same time you may end up getting a lot of yield returns than if you delay in planting because even though the sweet potatoes are drought tolerant crops, but also they do require a lot of moisture for their growth and development so they should be able to put up a lot of bigger roots. But if they delay in planting, that means they will be losing some vegetative growth hence in the end they may end up having lower returns. Mphaka	There is a lot of development nowadays and you can use chemicals to control weeds. How far have we gone in that area in Malawi? Thumbiko	As far as <b>I</b> know, we <b>haven?t</b> yet come up with that research because our research focuses on the smallholder farmers, and we know that smallholder farmers, most of them they are resource poor, and if you develop that technology, the rate of adoption will not be as high as expected. Therefore, our main focus of attention in terms of research development is towards developing technologies that will be easily adopted, and appropriate to the targeted group, in this case the smallholder farmers. That is why the main focus of our research in terms of root crop development in Malawi, is to develop cultivars that are disease resistant to major diseases and pests, and also, developing the cultivars that tend to produce or give more yields, and at the same time, varieties that are acceptable to the end-users.
