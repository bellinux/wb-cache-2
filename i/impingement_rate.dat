50|$|The {{interest}} of growing a smooth and defect-free surface requires a combination set of physical conditions throughout the process. Such conditions are bond strength, temperature, surface-diffusion limited and supersaturation (or <b>impingement)</b> <b>rate.</b> Using KMC surface growth method, following pictures describe final surface structure at different conditions.|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} {{procedure for}} {{the calculation of}} <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> distribution and simultaneously the transmission probabil-ity in pores under Knudsen diffusion conditions is introduced. It is based on a combination of the finite difference method and a projection approach. Pore entrance and exit effects, and the influence of the pore length on diffusive fluxes are investigated. Later on, it is applied for a simultaneous Knudsen and surface flow system. In the model, the equation system is built without the independent flow and adsorption-desorption equilibrium as-sumptions. For the conditions investigated, the results indicate that if the surface flow rate is substantial, the independent flow and adsorption equilibrium assumptions become improper esti-mates for the behaviour of the system. The surface and gas flow rates, the <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> distribution and the surface cover-age behave much more complex than the characteristics found with such assumptions...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the monomer-dimer surface reaction without surface diffusion for various dimer adsorption mechanisms, described below. After a dimer impinges 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 end on 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 at an empty site, its bottom atom remains there while its top atom searches N 1 sites, {{either in a}} local neighborhood (N-local models), or randomly located on the surface (N-random models), to find a second empty site. If one is found, the dimer can then adsorb dissociatively. The N-local models have a reactive window of finite width in the relative <b>impingement</b> <b>rates,</b> bordered by poisoning transitions, whereas the N-random models exhibit true bistability. As N increases, the reactivity is either strictly or effectively confined to relative <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> close to the stoichiometric ratio.

40|$|To {{establish}} the accuracy and applicability of analytical expressions for the steady state rate of binary nucleation, we numerically solved the birth-death equations for the vapor-to-liquid transition. These calculations were performed using rate coefficients {{that are consistent}} with the principle of detailed balance and a new self-consistent form of the equilibrium distribution function for binary cluster concentrations. We found that the customary saddle point and growth path approximations are almost always valid and can fail only if the nucleating solution phase is significantly nonideal. For example, problems can arise when the vapor composition puts the system on the verge of partial liquid phase miscibility. When this occurs for comparable monomer <b>impingement</b> <b>rates,</b> nucleation still occurs through the saddle point, but the usual quadratic expansion for the cluster free energy is inadequate. When the two <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> differ significantly, however, the major particle flux may bypass the saddle point and cross a low ridge on the free energy surface. The dependence of the saddle point location on the gas phase composition is also important in initiating or terminating ridge crossing nucleation...|$|R
40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for {{the prediction of}} ice accretion on an aircraft flying through clouds of supercooled liquid water is the accurate determination of the water <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> on various components of the aircraft. For this purpose, a droplet impingement module has been developed using the datastructure of the unstructured Navier-Stokes solver TAU. Since nowadays large computational grids are common practice, an efficient algorithm for determination of the droplet trajectories on such grids had to be implemented. This paper describes the physics and details of the implemented numerical algorithm. It summarizes lessons learned during development.

40|$|An {{empirical}} relation {{has been}} obtained {{by which the}} change in drag coefficient caused by ice formations on an unswept NACA 65 AO 04 airfoil section can be determined from the following icing and operating conditions: icing time, airspeed, air total temperature, liquid-water content, cloud droplet impingement efficiencies, airfoil chord length, and angles of attack. The correlation was obtained by use of measured ice heights and ice angles. These measurements were obtained {{from a variety of}} ice formations, which were carefully photographed, cross-sectioned, and weighed. Ice weights increased at a constant rate with icing time in a rime icing condition and at progressively increasing rates in glaze icing conditions. Initial rates of ice collection agreed reasonably well with values predicted from droplet impingement data. Experimental droplet <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> obtained on this airfoil section agreed with previous theoretical calculations for angles of attack of 40 or less. Disagreement at higher angles of attack was attributed to flow separation from the upper surface of the experimental airfoil model...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been devised for high-volume, {{high-velocity}} surface deposition of protective metallic coatings on otherwise vulnerable surfaces. Thermal spraying is used whereby {{the material to}} be deposited is heated to the melting point by passing through a flame. Rather than the usual method of deposition from the jet formed from the combustion products, this innovation uses non-steady combustion (i. e. high-frequency, periodic, confined bursts), which generates not only higher temperatures and heat transfer rates, but exceedingly high impingement velocities {{an order of magnitude}} higher than conventional thermal systems. Higher <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> make for better adhesion. The high heat transfer rates developed here allow the deposition material to be introduced, not as an expensive powder with high surface-area-to-volume, but in convenient rod form, which is also easier and simpler to feed into the system. The nonsteady, resonant combustion process is self-aspirating and requires no external actuation or control and no high-pressure supply of fuel or air. The innovation has been demonstrated using a commercially available resonant combustor shown in the figure. Fuel is naturally aspirated from the tank through the lower Tygon tube and into the pulsejet. Air for starting is ported through the upper Tygon tube line. Once operation commences, this air is no longer needed as additional air is naturally aspirated through the inlet. A spark plug on the device is needed for starting, but the process carries on automatically as the operational device is resonant and reignites itself with each 220 -Hz pulse...|$|R

By varying the deposition temperature and <b>impingement</b> <b>rate,</b> we have explored the surface roughening transition in a nonequilibrium situation and the conditions under which normal, lateral, and step flow growth occurs. The results show that reentrant oscillation occurs {{as a result of the}} variation of surface diffusion length with deposition temperature, and that it is a natural phenomenon in kinetic thin film deposition on substrates with permanent steps. We have also examined the morphological instability in step flow growth and found that it is related to the step height. Steps with multi-atomic layers are seen to be less stable in a surface diffusion field, due to a decrease in the attachment rate of growth units from the upper terrace...|$|E

Non-dimensional parameters for reactor design and process control are proposed, and the theory describing molecular <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> {{as a function of}} these parameters is presented. An experimental, industrial-scale reactor and experimental methods, including naphthalene sublimation, have been developed to investigate the flow dynamics. Pulses of known volume and pressure N 2 were delivered into the reactor at timed intervals, while monitoring the resulting reactor pressure and molecular flux field.

40|$|The {{amount of}} water in cloud droplet form {{ingested}} by a full-scale supersonic nose inlet with conical centerbody was measured in the NACA Lewis icing tunnel. Local and total water <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> on the cowl and centerbody surfaces were also obtained. All measurements were made with a dye-tracer technique. The range of operating and meteorological conditions studied was: angles of attack of 0 deg and 4. 2 deg, volume-median droplet diameters from about 11 to 20 microns, and ratios of inlet to free-stream velocity from about 0. 4 to 1. 8. Although the inlet was designed for supersonic (Mach 2. 0) operation of the aircraft, the tunnel measurements were confined to a free-stream velocity of 156 knots (Mach 0. 237). The data are extendable to other subsonic speeds and droplet sizes by dimensionless impingement parameters. Impingement and ingestion efficiencies are functions of the ratio of inlet to free-stream velocity as well as droplet size. For the model and range of conditions studied, progressively increasing the inlet velocity ratio from less than to greater than 1. 0 increased the centerbody impingement efficiency and shifted the cowl impingement region from the inner- to outer-cowl surfaces, respectively. The ratio of water ingested by the inlet plane to that contained in a free-stream tube of cross section equal to that at the inlet plane also increased with increasing inlet velocity ratio. Theoretically calculated values of inlet water (or droplet) ingestion are in good agreement with experiment for annular inlet configurations...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the operational range of existing small icing tunnels, the use of truncated airfoil sections has been suggested. With truncated airfoils, large-scale or even full-scale wing-icing-protection systems could be evaluated. Therefore, experimental studies were conducted in the NACA Lewis laboratory icing 'tunnel with an NACA 651 - 212 airfoil section {{to determine the effect}} of truncating the air-foil chord on velocity distribution and impingement characteristics. A 6 -foot-chord airfoil was cut successively at the 50 - and 30 -percent-chord stations to produce the truncated airfoil sections, which were equipped with trailing-edge flaps that were used to alter the flow field about the truncated sections. The study was conducted at geometric angles of attack of 00 and 40, an airspeed of about 156 knots, and volume-median droplet sizes of 11. 5 and 18. 6 microns. A dye-tracer technique was used in the impingement studies. With the trailing-edge flap on the truncated airfoil deflected so that the local velocity distribution in the impingement region was sub-stantially the same as that for the full-chord airfoil, the local im-pingement rates and the limits of impingement for the truncated and full-chord airfoils were the same. In general, truncating the airfoils with flaps undeflected resulted in a subs'tantially altered velocity distribu-tion and local <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> compared with those of the full-chord airfoil. The use of flapped truncated airfoils may permit impingement and icing studies to be conducted with full-scale leading-edge sections, ranging in size from tip to root sections...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} characteristics under {{a single}} turbulent confined slot jet were determined experimentally. New enhancement techniques for the <b>impingement</b> heat transfer <b>rate</b> are proposed and tested experimentally. The results from each enhancement technique are compared with those for a smooth slot nozzle configuration with the same apparatus. The <b>impingement</b> heat transfer <b>rate</b> was observed to increase due to internal finning of the slot nozzles. Both rectangular and triangular fins were tested. The fins acted as roughness elements. Experimental results with the "rough" nozzle show that the stagnation and average heat transfer rates can be enhanced by up to 15 % and 10 %, respectively. However, an increase in pressure drop across the nozzles is also noted. Use of inclined confinement surfaces of 10 ° and 20 ° angles accelerate the exit flow provides average <b>impingement</b> heat transfer <b>rates</b> comparable with those for parallel wall confinement. Experimental results show no {{significant change in the}} heat transfer distribution for the inclination angle of 10 °, while the average heat transfer coefficient is in fact decreased slightly for the inclination angle of 20 ° at high jet Reynolds numbers. It was found that insertion of a single turbulence generator in the jet flow provides superior impingement heat transfer without any increase in the system pressure drop. Two types of turbulence generators (square rod and thin plate) were investigated. Both turbulence generators provide the same level of average heat transfer enhancement (up to 15 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Conductive nitride {{films are}} {{conventionally}} prepared by reactive sputtering using nitrogen as a reactive gas. Replacing nitrogen with air as a reactive gas allows {{the process to}} be conducted at high base pressures, i. e., low vacuum, which can reduce substantially the processing time. In this study, TiN films were selected as a model system for the investigation. As the air/Ar flow ratio reached 0. 10 - 0. 15, the films revealed the characteristic rock-salt structured TiN. The N/Ti of the films was 0. 80 - 0. 83 with 9 - 13 atom % of oxygen. The determined resistivities and hardnesses of the films were {{in the range of}} 110 - 130 lX_cm and 26 - 27 GPa, respectively. All obtained data fulfill the characteristics of TiN films. Kinetic formation apparently prevails over thermodynamic predictions at low air/Ar ratios. In such plasma, the dissociation energy of nitrogen is much smaller than that of oxygen, leading to the high <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> of nitrogen. The dissolution of oxygen in the TiN films seems also to stabilize the nitride structure...|$|E
40|$|For finite adspecies mobility, the lattice-gas monomer-dimer (A+B 2) surface {{reaction}} model exhibits a discontinuous {{transition from a}} stable reactive steady state to a stable A-poisoned steady state, as the <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> PA for A increases above a critical value P*. The reactive (poisoned) state is metastable for PA just above (below) P*. Increasing the surface mobility of A enhances metastability, leading to bistability {{in the limit of}} high mobility. In the bistable region, the more stable state displaces the less stable one separated from it by a planar interface, with P* becoming the equistability point for the two states. This hydrodynamic regime can be described by reaction-diffusion equations (RDE’s). However, for finite reaction rates, mixed adlayers of A and B are formed, resulting in a coverage-dependent and tensorial nature to chemical diffusion (even in the absence of interactions beyond site blocking). For equal mobility of adsorbed A and B, and finite reaction rate, the prediction for P* from such RDE’s, incorporating the appropriate description of chemical diffusion, is shown to coincide with that from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for the lattice-gas model in the regime of high mobility. Behavior for this special case is compared with that for various other prescriptions of mobility, for both finite and infinite reaction rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface stress}} induced during the {{formation}} of alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold from the vapor phase was measured using a micromechanical cantilever-based chemical sensor. Simultaneous in situ thickness measurements were carried out using ellipsometry. Ex situ scanning tunneling microscopy was performed in air to ascertain the final monolayer structure. The evolution of the surface stress induced during coverage-dependent structural phase transitions reveals features not apparent in average ellipsometric thickness measurements. These results show that both the kinetics of SAM formation and the resulting SAM structure are strongly influenced both by the surface structure of the underlying gold substrate and by the <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> of the alkanethiol onto the gold surface. In particular, the adsorption onto gold surfaces having large, flat grains produces high-quality self-assembled monolayers. An induced compressive surface stress of 15. 9 ± 0. 6 N/m results when a c(4 × 2) dodecanethiol SAM forms on gold. However, the SAMs formed on small-grained gold are incomplete and an induced surface stress of only 0. 51 ± 0. 02 N/m results. The progression to a fully formed SAM whose alkyl chains adopt a vertical (standing-up) orientation is clearly inhibited {{in the case of}} a small-grained gold substrate and is promoted {{in the case of a}} large-grained gold substrate...|$|E

The plume <b>impingement</b> heating <b>rates</b> on these surfaces were measured using thin film heat transfer gages. Results indicate the engine simulation is a reasonable approximation to the two engine configuration, but more tests are needed to verify the plume model of the main engine configuration.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{modelled}} the diffusive transport of a dilute gas along arrays of randomly distributed, vertically aligned nanocylinders (nanotubes or nanowires) {{as opposed to}} gas diffusion in long pores, which is described by the well-known Knudsen theory. Analytical expressions for (i) the gas diffusion coefficient inside such arrays, (ii) the time between collisions of molecules with the nanocylinder walls (mean time of flight), (iii) the surface <b>impingement</b> <b>rate,</b> and (iv) the Knudsen number of such a system were rigidly derived based on a random-walk model of a molecule that undergoes memoryless, diffusive reflections from nanocylinder walls assuming the molecular regime of gas transport. It can be specifically shown that the gas diffusion coefficient inside such arrays is inversely proportional to the areal density of cylinders and their mean diameter. An example calculation of a diffusion coefficient is delivered for a system of titanium isopropoxide molecules diffusing between vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. Our findings are important for the correct modelling and optimisation of gas-based deposition techniques, such as atomic layer deposition or chemical vapour deposition, frequently used for surface functionalisation of high-aspect-ratio nanocylinder arrays in solar cells and energy storage applications. Furthermore, gas sensing devices with high-aspect-ratio nanocylinder arrays {{and the growth of}} vertically aligned carbon nanotubes need the fundamental understanding and precise modelling of gas transport to optimise such processes...|$|E

The study included spheres, ellipsoidal forebodies of fineness ratios of 2. 5 and 3. 0, and a conical forebody of 300 included angle and covered {{a range of}} angles of attack from 0 ? to 60 and rotational speeds up to 1200 rpm. The data were obtained at an airspeed of 157 knots and are correlated by dimensionless impingement parameters. In general, the experimental data show that the local and total impingement rates and impingement limits of bodies of revolution are primarily functions of the modified inertia parameters, the body shape, and fineness ratio. Both the local <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> and impingement limits depend upon the angle of attack. Rotation of the bodies had a negligible effect on the impingement characteristics except for an averaging effect at angle of attack. For comparable diameters the bluffer bodies had the largest total impingement efficiency, but the finer and sharper bodies had the largest values of maximum local impingement efficiency and, in most cases, the largest limits of impingement. In most cases, the impingement characteristics were less than those calculated from theoretical trajectories; in general, however, fairly good agreement was obtained between the experimental and theoretical impingement characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Slurry erosion {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a serious problem in many industrial applications. In slurry flows, the estimation {{of the amount of}} incident kinetic energy that transmits from particles suspended in the fluid to the containment structures is a key aspect in evaluating its abrasive potential. This work represents a systematic investigation of particle impact energy measurement using acoustic emission (AE), as indicated by a sensor mounted on the outer surface of a sharp bend, in an arrangement that had been pre-calibrated using controlled single and multiple impacts. Particle size, free stream velocity, and nominal particle concentration were varied, and the amount of energy dissipated in the carbon steel bend was assessed using a slurry impingement flow loop test rig. Silica sand particles of mean particle size 225 ? 650 ?m were used for impingement on the bend with particle nominal concentrations between 1 and 5 % while the free stream velocity was changed between 4. 2 and 14 ms? 1. The measured AE energy was found, in general, to scale with the incident kinetic energy of the particles, although the high arrival rate involved in the slurry impingement flow loop poses challenges in resolving individual particle impact signatures in the AE record. The results have been reconciled with earlier work by the authors on sparse streams where there are few particle overlaps and good control over particle kinetic energies, by extending their model to account for different particle carrier-fluids and to situations where arrivals cannot necessarily be resolved. The outcome is a traceable methodology whereby a quantitative assessment of particle <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> can be made in practical situations...|$|E

The particle trajectory and icing computations were performed using the new "block-to-block" collection efficiency method which has been incorporated into the LEWICE 3 D Version 3 software. The E(sup 3) was developed by NASA and GE in the early 1980 s as a technology demonstrator and is representative of a modern high bypass turbofan engine. The E(sup 3) flow field was calculated using the NASA Glenn ADPAC turbomachinery flow solver. Computations were performed for the low pressure compressor of the E(sup 3) for a Mach 0. 8 cruise condition at 11, 887 m assuming a standard warm day for three drop sizes and two drop distributions typically used in aircraft design and certification. Particle trajectory computations {{were made for}} water drop sizes of 5, 20, and 100 microns. Particle trajectory and ice shape predictions were made for a 20 micron Langmuir-D distribution and for a 92 mm Super-cooled Large Droplet (SLD) distribution with and without splashing effects for a Liquid Water Content (LWC) of 0. 3 g/cu m and an icing time of 30 min. The E 3 fan and spinner combination {{proved to be an}} effective ice removal mechanism as they removed greater than 36 percent of the mass entering the inlet for the icing cases. The maximum free stream catch fraction for the fan and spinner combination was 0. 60 while that on the elements downstream of the fan was 0. 03. The non-splashing trajectory and collection efficiency results showed that as drop size increased <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> increased on the spinner and fan leaving less mass to impinge on downstream components. The SLD splashing case yielded more mass downstream of the fan than the SLD non-splashing case due to mass being splashed from the upstream inlet lip, spinner and fan components. The ice shapes generated downstream of the fan were either small or nonexistent due to the small available mass and evaporation except for the 92 m SLD splashing case. Relatively large ice shapes were predicted for internal guide vane # 1 and rotor # 1 for the 92 m SLD splashing case due to re-impingement of splashed mass...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact to}} the fishery of Navigation Pool No. 9 of the Mississippi River from {{impingement}} and entrainment processes by two Dairyland Power Cooperative power stations in Genoa, Wisconsin, was determined. Impingement samples were taken once each {{week for a}} 24 hour period from 8 August 1978 through 30 June 1980 at both plants. Sampling devices, comprised of galvanized hardware cloth, were used to strain screen wash water to determine <b>impingement</b> <b>rates.</b> Entrainment sampling was conducted once each week for a 24 hour period from 26 February 1979 through 10 September 1979 and 6 February 1980 through 30 June 1980. Entrainment rates were determined by straining water from tapped intake pipes with plankton nets. Impingement survival tests, stress tests, and ichthyoplankton surveys were also taken to further define the impact of entrainment and impingement. An estimated 8, 390 (127. 1 kg) and 54, 349 (2915. 7 kg) fish were impinged during this study at La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor. (LACBWR) and Genoa # 3 (G- 3), respectively. The two power stations collectively impinged representatives of 53 species and 19 families of fish. The most frequently impinged species of fish were bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens)., gizzard shad(Dorosoma cepedianum) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Young-of-the-year fish density, behavioral responses of some species of fish and intake structure design were determined {{to be the most}} influential factors causing impingement at these plants. The impact to the Pool 9 fishery from impingement by these two power stations was judged insignificant. Greater than 11 x 106 larval fish were entrained by G- 3 during this study. Freshwater drum and Morone sp. larvae were the most frequently entrained species of fish. Other larval fish taxa entrained were Dorosoma sp., Hiodon sp., Pomoxis sp., cyprinids and catostomids. The impact to the Pool 9 fishery from entrainment was probably insignificant {{with the possible exception of}} freshwater drum. Recommendations for modification of screen washing procedures and intake structures at the present plants were offered to the power company to reduce the impact of entrainment and impingement. Placement of intake structures in areas of lowest fish density was recommended to the power company for their future power plants...|$|R

40|$|The aim {{with this}} thesis work was to better {{understand}} transient phenomena involved in the low-temperature oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons by oxygen over typical oxidation catalysts. Supported platinum catalysts were prepared and carefully studied under transient conditions by means of flow-reactor experiments, different in situ spectroscopic (FTIR and XANES) methods in combination with mass spectrometry and mean-field kinetics simulations. The results show that deliberate manipulations of the reactant gas composition, so-called periodic operation, can enhance the low-temperature oxidation activity for both CO and hydrocarbons (propene and propane) over Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. In the case of CO and propene oxidation, the improved activity {{is due to a}} reactant adsorption induced change in the adsorbate coverage, i. e. reduced self-poisoning by CO and propene, respectively, favouring the reaction rate. For propane oxidation, however, the enhanced activity is instead connected with an optimum reaction rate for gas compositions close to the stoichiometric value, which can be approached by periodic operation. Moreover, this thesis provides new insight into the detailed bistable kinetics of CO oxidation over Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts in oxygen excess at atmospheric pressure. It is shown that a platinum oxidation and reduction mechanism must complement the conventional three-step Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction scheme in order to explain the extinction process and the observed reaction rate in the high active state. In this state the reaction rate was found to be several orders of magnitude lower than the CO <b>impingement</b> <b>rate,</b> which is at variance with the conventional mechanism. However, with the new mean-field kinetics model presented here, including CO interaction with a fully developed surface-oxide overlayer, such low reaction rates may be predicted...|$|E

A second system combining cantilever-based sensing and ellipsometry was also designed and built, capable of yielding simultaneous in situ surface stress and film thickness measurements. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with molecular resolution was also performed ex situ in order to characterize {{the structure of the}} resulting SAMs. The complementary use of these tools has provided an all-around view of the self-assembly process. These measurements were performed in order to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in the self-assembly process and into the origins of the associated surface stress. Moreover, these studies were used to characterize and optimize the response of cantilever-based sensors based on functionalized SAM technology in terms of reliability, sensitivity, and reproducibility. The evolution of the surface stress induced during alkanethiol SAM formation reveals features associated with coverage-dependent structural phase transitions. These results show that both the kinetics of SAM formation and the resulting SAM structure are strongly influenced by the surface structure of the underlying gold substrate, by the <b>impingement</b> <b>rate</b> of the alkanethiol molecules onto the gold surface, and by the cleanliness of the gold surface. In particular, it was found that a minimum gold grain size is necessary in order for the SAM to achieve the standing-up phase, for which large compressive surface stresses (~ 10 N/m) are measured. In addition, these results show that alkanethiol SAMs can become kinetically trapped in metastable intermediate states (lying-down phase) for formation on small-grained gold surfaces and/or at low alkanethiol vapor concentrations. Theoretical modeling of the origins of the induced surface stress reveals that inter-molecular Lennard-Jones interactions and electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed species play minimal roles {{in the development of the}} surface stress. Changes in the electronic structure of the underlying gold substrate are more likely to account for the large compressive surface stresses observed during alkanethiol SAM formation...|$|E
40|$|Recent trends {{towards an}} {{increase}} in the stiffness of the acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) insulation material used {{in the construction of the}} redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) propellant inhibitors prompted questions about possible effects on RSRM performance. The specific objectives of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) task included: (1) the definition of pressure loads to calculate the deformed shape of stiffer inhibitors, (2) the calculation of higher port velocities over the inhibitors to determine shifts in the vortex shedding or edge tone frequencies, and (3) the quantification of higher slag <b>impingement</b> and collection <b>rates</b> on the inhibitors and in the submerged nose nozzle cavity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this two-year study was to document the occurrence of impingement and entrainment of fishes at two of Dairyland Power Cooperative's cooling water intakes on Navigation Pool 5 of the Upper Mississippi River during 1979 and 1980. Impingement at the 208 MW Alma units 1 - 5 intake during 1979 - 1980 consisted of 33 species from 13 families. During 1979 sampling, 586 fishes were impinged. During 1980 sampling at Alma 1 - 5, 1165 fishes were impinged. The weekly 24 -hour impingement samples were used to project the two-year annual mean impingement of 10, 735 fishes. Gizzard shad(40. 0 %) and black crappie (23. 1 %) were the most commonly impinged species during the study. The annual entrainment of larval fishes at Alma 1 - 5 was estimated at 125, 000 during 1980. Impingement studies at the 350 MW J. P. Madgett Station intake began with its operation in November 1979 and continued through 1980. IMring sampling, 29 species from 9 families were impinged, including 3 crystal darters (ammocrypta asprella), which had not been previously recorded in Pool 5. A total of 3980 impinged fishes were sampled during the 11 months of the study. The weekly 24 -hour impingement samples were used to project the total impingement of 33, 791 fishes for the J. P. Madgett intake during the study period. Gizzard shad comprised 63. 8 % of the total numbers and 14. 0 % were freshwater drum. Annual variations in impingement were attributed to varying densities of juvenile fishes {{in the vicinity of}} the intakes. This was likely influenced primarily by spawning success. Over 90 % of all fishes impinged were juveniles. A fish mortality study at the J. P. Madgett intake showed that survival of impinged fishes was species-specific. Survival of all fishes impinged during sampling was 16. 6 %. The efficiency of removal of fishes from the fish trays on the vertical traveling screens by the low pressure spray jets was calculated to be approximately 96 %. The combined estimated total biomass of fishes impinged at both intakes during 1980 represented approximately 0. 4 % by weight of the total annual harvest of Pool 5. Both intake structures were located in areas that were not conducive to high fish densities. Differences between <b>impingement</b> <b>rates</b> at the two intake structures was likely due, in part, to the larger surface area and greater intake volume at the J. P. Madgett intake...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{dislocation}} {{of the hip}} is a {{safe and}} established technique for treating femoroacetabular <b>impingement.</b> The complication <b>rate</b> is low, and if the correct technique that respects the blood supply is used, femoral head necrosis does not occur. The most frequent complications are minor ectopic bone formation and nonunion of the greater trochanter. Surgical treatment includes the correction of femoral and acetabular pathology. Clinically, in approximately 75 - 80 % of cases a good-to-excellent result can be obtained. However, patients with advanced degenerative changes (exceeding stage 1 osteoarthritis using the Tönnis score) have worse outcomes.

40|$|The {{trajectories of}} {{droplets}} i n the air flowing past a 36. 5 -percent-thick Joukowski airfoil at zero {{angle of attack}} were determined. The amount of water i n droplet form impinging on the airfoil, the area of droplet <b>impingement,</b> and the <b>rate</b> of droplet <b>impingement</b> per unit area on the airfoil surface were calculated from the trajectories and cover a large range of flight and atmospheric conditions. With the detailed impingement information available, the 36. 5 -percent-thick Joukowski airfoil can serve the dual purpose of use as the principal element in instruments for making measurements in clouds and of a basic shape for estimating impingement on a thick streamlined body. Methods and examples are presented for illustrating some limitations when the airfoil is used as the principal element in the dye-tracer technique...|$|R
