25|$|Colloidal {{lithography}} is {{inexpensive and}} can be used to create surfaces with controlled heights and diameters. Nanocolliods are used as an etch mask by spreading them along the material surface, and then ion beam bombardment or film evaporation is used to <b>etch</b> <b>away</b> around the nanocolliods, creating nanocolumns and nanopits, respectively. The final surface structure can be controlled by varying the area covered by colloids and the colloid size. The area covered by the colloids can be changed by modifying the ionic strength of the colloid solution. This technique is able to create large patterned surface areas, which is necessary for tissue engineering applications.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{collision}} events result in atoms being ejected (sputtered) from the surface, and thus ion implantation will slowly <b>etch</b> <b>away</b> a surface. The effect is only appreciable for very large doses.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} of sputtering is to <b>etch</b> <b>away</b> the target material. One such example occurs in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), where the target sample is sputtered {{at a constant}} rate. As the target is sputtered, the concentration and identity of sputtered atoms are measured using Mass Spectrometry. In this way {{the composition of the}} target material can be determined and even extremely low concentrations (20 µg/kg) of impurities detected. Furthermore, because the sputtering continually etches deeper into the sample, concentration profiles as a function of depth can be measured.|$|E

50|$|The film pull {{technique}} {{is a means}} of recovering carbonaceous compression fossils for study under transmitted light microscopy. An acid is applied {{to the surface of the}} rock to <b>etch</b> <b>away</b> the matrix from the surface, leaving carbonaceous tissue protruding. (Surfaces not to be etched can be coated in a wax (e.g. Vaseline) or grease.) This is usually accomplished by placing the rock upside-down in a weak, continually stirred acid, so that any debris can be washed away. Nitrocellulose is then painted on to the fossil-bearing surface, and once dry may be peeled from the rock, or the rock dissolved in hydrofluoric acid.|$|E

Single sheets of graphene are mechanically extracted from bulk graphite crystals onto a silicon substrate and are contacted with Cr/Au metal electrodes. Hydrogen silsesquioxane is spun onto the samples to form an etch mask and then oxygen plasma is used to <b>etch</b> <b>away</b> the unprotected graphene.|$|E

50|$|Philco used a {{patented}} process of applying two tiny electrochemical jet streams of liquid indium sulfate (electrolyte solution) {{on opposite sides}} of a thin strip of N-type germanium base material. This process would <b>etch</b> <b>away</b> and form circular well depressions {{on each side of the}} N-type germanium base material, until the germanium base material was ultra thin and having a thickness of approximately a few ten-thousandths of an inch. After the etching process was finished, the polarity applied to the electrolyte was reversed, resulting in metallic indium being electroplated into these etched circular well depressions, forming the transistor's emitter and collector electrodes. The Philco surface-barrier transistor was the world's first high-frequency transistor was developed and produced at the Lansdale Tube Company-division of Philco Corporation, which was capable of obtaining frequencies up to 60 MHz.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of a model}} strained metal film with oxygen is studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. Two monolayers of copper on Ru(0001) present a well-defined dislocation network composed of threading dislocations and Shockley partial dislocations separating areas of fcc and hcp stacking. We find that oxygen first reacts with these threading dislocations. Then, for exposures up to ~ 0. 4 L O 2, new threading dislocation arrays appear on the surface. With the addition of more oxygen, the mesoscopic structure of the film changes from a striped array of Shockley partials to a disordered array of triangular fcc regions bounded by dislocations, as oxygen proceeds to <b>etch</b> <b>away</b> the hcp areas of the copper film. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.
