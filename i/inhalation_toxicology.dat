Second, are the mechanisms involved applicable to humans? If so, should the mode of action be considered to result in a linear or nonlinear dose–response? These questions will be addressed within the context of the agency’s new cancer guidelines and with regard to how the answers might affect a revised IRIS assessment for EGBE...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inhalation</b> <b>toxicology</b> {{studies with}} {{chrysotile}} asbestos {{have in the}} past been performed at exceed-ingly high doses without consideration of fiber number or dimensions. As such, the exposures have exceeded lung overload levels, making quantitative assessment of these studies difficult if not impossible. To assess the cellular and pathological response in the rat lung to a well-characterized aerosol of chrysotile asbestos, a 90 -day subchronic <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicology</b> study was performed using a commercial Brazilian chrysotile (CA 300). The protocol was based on that established by the European Commission for the evaluation of synthetic vitreous fibers. The study was also designed to assess the potential for reversibility of any such changes and to permit association of responses with fiber dose in the lung and the influence of fiber length. Wis-tar male rats were randomly assigned to an air control group and to 2 CA 300 exposure groups at mean fiber aerosol concentrations of 76 fibers L> 20 µm/cm 3 (3413 total fibers/cm 3; 536 WHO fibers/cm 3) or 207 fibers L> 20 µm/cm 3 (8941 total fibers/cm 3; 1429 WHO fibers/cm 3).

40|$|In {{the field}} of <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicology,</b> {{progress}} {{in the development of}} in vitro methods and efficient exposure strategies now offers the implementation of cellular-based systems. These can be used to analyze the hazardous potency of airborne substances like gases, particles, and complex mixtures (combustion products). In addition, the regulatory authorities require the integration of such approaches to reduce or replace animal experiments. Although the animal experiment currently still has to provide the last proof of the toxicological potency and classification of a certain compound, in vitro testing is gaining more and more importance in toxicological considerations. This paper gives a brief characterization of the CULTEX® Radial Flow System exposure device, which allows the exposure of cultivated cells as well as bacteria under reproducible and stable conditions for studying cellular and genotoxic effects after the exposure at the air–liquid or air–agar interface, respectively. A commercial bronchial epithelial cell line (16 HBE 14 o-) as well as Salmonella typhimurium tester strains were exposed to smoke of different research and commercial available cigarettes. A dose-dependent reduction of cell viability was found in the case of 16 HBE 14 o- cells; S. typhimurium responded with a dose-dependent induction of revertants.

40|$|Knowledge {{regarding}} {{particle deposition}} {{processes in the}} nasal cavity is important in aerosol therapy and <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicology</b> applications. This paper presents a comparative study of the deposition of micron and submicron particles under different steady laminar flow rates using a Lagrangian approach. A computational model of a nasal cavity geometry was developed from CT scans and the simulation of the fluid and particle flow within the airway was performed using the commercial software GAMBIT and FLUENT. The air flow patterns in the nasal cavities and the detailed local deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles were presented and discussed. It {{was found that the}} majority of micron particles are deposited near the nasal valve region and some micron particles are deposited on the septum wall in the turbinate region. The deposition patterns of micron particles in the left cavity are different compared with that in the right one especially in the turbinate regions. In contrast, the deposition for nanoparticles shows a moderately even distribution of particles throughout the airway. Furthermore the particles releasing position obviously influences the local deposition patterns. The influence of the particle releasing position is mainly shown near the nasal valve region for micron particle deposition, while for submicron particles deposition, both the nasal valve and turbinate region are influenced.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of biobanks to store human lung cells and tissues from patient {{donations}} and from the procurement of medical waste tissues, {{it is now possible}} to integrate (both spatially and temporally) cells into anatomically-correct and physiologically-functional tissues. Modern <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicology</b> relies on human data on exposure and adverse effects, to determine the most appropriate risk assessments and mitigations for beneficial respiratory health. A point in case is the recapitulation of airway tissue, such as the bronchial epithelium, to investigate the impact of air pollution on human respiratory health. The bronchi are the first point of contact for inhaled substances that bypass defences in the upper respiratory tract. Animal models have been used to resolve such <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicology</b> hazards. However, the access to medical waste tissues has enabled the Lung Particle Research Group to tissue-engineer the Micro-Lung (TM) and Metabo-Lung(TM) cell culture models, as alternatives to animals in basic research and in the safety testing of aerosolised consumer goods. The former model favours investigations focused on lung injury and repair mechanisms, and the latter model provides the element of metabolism, through the co-culturing of lung and liver (hepatocyte) cells. These innovations represent examples of the animal-free alternatives advocated by the 21 st century toxicology paradigm, whereby human-derived cell/tissue data will lead to more-accurate and more-reliable public health risk assessments and therapeutic mitigations (e. g. exposure to ambient air pollutants and adverse drug reactions) for lung disease...|$|E

40|$|Scientists {{routinely}} {{work within}} the three R's principles of 'Reduction, Refinement and Replacement' of animal experiments. Accordingly, viable alternatives are regularly developed, and in the specific case of the human lung, in vitro models for <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicology</b> that mimic in vivo toxic events that may occur in the human lung, are welcomed. This is especially warranted given the new EU regulations (i. e. REACH) coming into force for the handling of chemicals {{and the advent of}} nanotoxicology. Furthermore, recent advances in human tissue-engineering has made it feasible and cost effective to construct human tissue equivalents of the respiratory epithelia, as in-house models derived from primary cells. There is an urgent need for engineered tissue equivalents of the lung given the increase in pharmaceutically valuable drugs, toxicity testing of environmental pollutants and the advent of nanotoxicology. Given the well-known problems with 2 -dimensional (2 -D) cell cultures as test beds, more realistic 3 -D tissue constructs are required, especially for preclinical stages of cell- and tissue-based, high-throughput screening in drug discovery. The generation of high-fidelity engineered tissue constructs is based on the targeted interactions of organ-specific cells and intelligent biomimetic scaffolds which emulate the natural environment of their native extracellular matrix, in which the cells develop, differentiate and function. The proximal region of the human respiratory system is a critical zone to recapitulate for use as in vitro alternatives to in vivo <b>inhalation</b> <b>toxicology.</b> Undifferentiated normal human bronchial epithelia cells can be obtained from surgical procedures or purchased from commercial sources and used to establish 3 -D, differentiated, organo-typic cell cultures for pulmonary research...|$|E
