40|$|Abstract. The name “high {{strength}} brass ” {{is given}} to the wrought and cast alloys indicating their particular virtue of high strength, which can be achieved by additions of Al, Fe, Mn and Sn. Forgings made from copper base alloys offer a number of advantages over products made by other processes. However, because for forging more heat must be applied to the ingot which was solidified once, there are some disadvantages in the economy of energy and time. In this study, we investigated the microstructures and mechanical properties of high strength brass made by semi solid forging and compared them with those of conventionally forged product and gravity die casting. No shrinkage or <b>gas</b> <b>hole</b> was found in semi solid forgings. Fine equiaxed crystals developed at the center of semi solid forgings, while grains in the corner of semi solid forgings were elongated perpendicular to the pressure direction. The grains of semi solid forgings were smaller than those of conventional forgings and gravity die castings. It is suggested that a rapid heat transfer condition due to applied pressure is responsible for grain refinement. Tensile and yield strengths of semi solid forgings were as high as those of hot forgings but elongation was positioned between that of conventional forgings and gravity die castings...|$|E

40|$|Most old {{globular}} clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy are observed to have internal chemical abundance spreads in light elements. We discuss a new GC formation scenario based on hierarchical star formation within fractal molecular clouds. In the new scenario, {{a cluster of}} bound and unbound star clusters (`star cluster complex', SCC) that have a power-law cluster mass function with a slope (beta) of 2 is first formed from a massive gas clump developed in a dwarf galaxy. Such cluster complexes and beta= 2 are observed and expected from hierarchical star formation. The most massive star cluster (`main cluster'), which is the progenitor of a GC, can accrete gas ejected from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars initially in the cluster and other low-mass clusters before the clusters are tidally stripped or destroyed to become field stars in the dwarf. The SCC is initially embedded in a giant <b>gas</b> <b>hole</b> created by numerous supernovae of the SCC so that cold gas outside the hole can be accreted onto the main cluster later. New stars formed from the accreted gas have chemical abundances that {{are different from those}} of the original SCC. Using hydrodynamical simulations of GC formation based on this scenario, we show that the main cluster with the initial mass as large as [2 - 5]x 10 ^ 5 Msun can accrete more than 10 ^ 5 Msun gas from AGB stars of the SCC. We suggest that merging of hierarchical star cluster complexes can play key roles in stellar halo formation around GCs and self-enrichment processes of GCs.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that cause overpressure can be broadly classified into two categories: loading and unloading. This study looks at eight wells from the deepwater Niger Delta; the wells were evaluated with three aims in mind. The first {{aim was to}} determine shale pore pressure with the density log using the equivalent depth approach. The second aim, using depth profiles of density, velocity, resistivity, and vertical effective stress, and cross-plots, was to infer the overpressure mechanism. The third aim was to validate underbalanced drilling zones identified on the pressure-depth plot with indications observed on the drilling report, mudlog, and other post-drilling data. To discriminate clean shales intervals, a density-velocity transform based on Gardner’s (1974) relationship and GR filters were applied to the well logs. Measured pore pressures, log data, temperature data, drilling data, and mudlog data, including the end-of-well-report, were analysed for selected wells. Based on pressure-depth plots, the top of overpressure in the wells lies in the range 500 – 1200 TVDml. The equivalent depth method using the density log, when properly calibrated with measured pore pressures, can give reliable pressure prediction results, especially in the shallow section at temperatures 75 °C, the equivalent depth method is unreliable. It was also noted that shale intervals may provide vertical permeability barriers and create pressure compartments {{in some of the}} wells. The predominant overpressuring mechanism in the shallow section, as evident from density and velocity reversals and, was found to be disequilibrium compaction. At greater depths (temperatures > 75 °C), a combination of disequilibrium compaction and unloading mechanisms appears to be responsible for overpressure in the wells. Evidence for unloading mechanisms includes formation temperatures of 80 °C or greater, indications of smectite-to-illite conversion on density-sonic cross-plots, rapid increases in mud weight that sometimes approached fracture gradient, and depressed density reversals relative to velocity reversals. Finally, intervals identified as being drilled underbalanced on pressure-depth plots are consistent with drilling data, mudlog data, and information in the end-of-well reports. Specifically, increased gas (connection gas and background <b>gas),</b> <b>hole</b> washout, high torque, drilling break, and decreased D-exponent trend show strong association with zones of underbalanced drilling on pressure-depth plots...|$|E

To produce good quality aluminum cast wheels, defects must be minimized and the quality of each production step must be controlled. The main topic {{of this study was to}} investigate the production line of a big aluminum wheel foundry and improve the quality of production using quality control tools. The production parameter data and real-time x-ray inspection results have been collected. Parameters of the machines that are involved with the production and the results of testing equipment and thermal analyzer have been recorded. To obtain effective feedback during process, a proposed flow chart of the wheel production line was developed.

The giant Zeeman effect induces a significant spin splitting even at very small {{values of the}} applied field. Several methods of measuring the carrier density (Hall effect, filling factors of the Landau levels at high field, various manifestations of Moss-Burstein shifts) are described and calibrated. The value of the spin splitting needed to fully polarize the <b>hole</b> <b>gas,</b> evidences a strong enhancement of the spin susceptibility of the <b>hole</b> <b>gas</b> due to carrier-carrier interaction. At small values of the spin splitting, whatever the carrier density (non zero) is, photoluminescence lines are due {{to the formation of}} charged excitons in the singlet state. Spectral shifts in photoluminescence and in transmission (including an "excitonic Moss-Bustein shift") are observed and discussed in terms of excitations of the partially or fully polarized <b>hole</b> <b>gas.</b> At large spin splitting, and without changing the carrier density, the singlet state of the charged exciton is destabilized in favour of a triplet state configuration of holes. The binding energy of the singlet state is thus measured and found to be independent of the carrier density (in contrast with the splitting between the charged exciton and the neutral exciton lines). The state stable at large spin splitting is close to the neutral exciton at low carrier density, and close to an uncorrelated electron-hole pair at the largest values of the carrier density achieved.

40|$|The {{temperature}} and magnetic field dependences of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) are studied in Mn delta-doped semiconductor heterostructures with a two-dimensional <b>hole</b> <b>gas</b> in a quantum well {{interacting with the}} Mn layer. The analysis of experimental data reveals four distinct temperature ranges differing {{in the behavior of}} AHE. The Mn layer induces an inhomogeneity of the <b>hole</b> <b>gas</b> leading to an interplay between the hopping and drift conductivities. It is shown that at sufficiently low temperatures, hopping conductivity favors the mechanisms of AHE related to the geometric (Berry-Pancharatnam) phase. Comment: 5 pages, Revtex...|$|R
40|$|The nanopatterning of Si/SiGe layers by PFOTS (perfluorooctyl trichlorosilane) -aided AFM (atomic force microscopy) {{lithography}} is demonstrated. We use self-assembled PFOTS monolayers as a resist for AFM {{exposure and}} then transfer patterns in to underlying SiGe layers by a two-step selective wet etching. Minimum linewidths of 100 nm {{can be achieved}} with improved uniformity and repeatability compared to AFM lithography without PFOTS. This lithography technique was used to pattern the carrier supply layer in Si/SiGe 2 -D <b>hole</b> <b>gases</b> to localize <b>holes</b> for epitaxially passivated quantum dot applications...|$|R
