40|$|To the Editor: I {{read with}} some disbelief the {{statement}} cited by Lyus et al 1 that “almost half ” of American women will {{have had an}} abortion. Following the first reference (to the Guttmacher In-stitute website), the national overview presently states: “At current rates, about one in three American women will have had an abortion {{by the time she}} reaches age 45. ” 2 There is an obvious bias to inflate figures about abor-tion in an article on abortion! Nevertheless, I was caught by surprise to find abortion so prevalent, as this statistic does not match what my patients either have had, or perhaps, are willing to reveal to me. While New York State data were the referenced source, there are significant regional differences. In fact, the abortion rate for New York state in 2005 was almost exactly twice the national average, whereas <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Texas</b> our rate was lower than the national average. 2,...|$|E
40|$|As some of {{the first}} known objects to exist in the Universe, Lyman alpha {{emitting}} galaxies (LAEs) naturally draw a lot of interest. First discovered over a decade ago, they have allowed us to probe the early Universe, as their strong emission line compensates for their faint continuum light. While initially thought to be indicative of the first galaxies forming in the Universe, recent studies have shown them to be increasingly complex, as some fraction appear evolved, and many LAEs appear to be dusty, which one would not expect from primordial galaxies. Presently, much interest resides in discovering not only the highest redshift galaxies to constrain theories of reionization, but also pushing closer to home, as previous ground-based studies have only found LAEs at z > 3 due to observational limitations. In this review talk I will cover everything from the first theoretical predictions of LAEs, to their future prospects for study, including the HETDEX survey <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Texas.</b> Comment: 15 pages; Invited Review to "Frank N.
