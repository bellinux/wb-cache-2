5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, {{it was the first time}} a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E
500|$|Despite another lockout {{beginning}} on 15 September 2012, the Sedins {{decided that they}} would only return to Modo, now managed by former teammate Markus Näslund, if the entire 2012–13 season wound up cancelled. Instead, the shortened season begun on January 2013, and during it Henrik passed Näslund as the franchise's all-time leading scorer with 757 points. After scoring the record-setting point, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes, the play stopped and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a commercial break, the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Näslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. In {{the final game of}} the season, Head Coach Alain Vigneault wanted to rest his regulars ahead of the playoffs. However, he played Henrik in the game though only for 22 seconds; he left the bench after just one shift. For his part, Henrik told Vigneault that [...] "he would be okay with sitting out the game" [...] and to him the streak is just [...] "a number in the paper." [...] Vigneault responded by telling Sedin that [...] "he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that breaks the streak", and he gave him the choice to remain on the bench or return to the locker room. Sedin felt remaining on the bench would have been a further distraction and chose to leave. Henrik finished the season with 11 goals and 45 points in 48 games.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} game as a Canuck, Roy tallied an assist helping Vancouver to a 4–0 win. The win moved the Canucks passed Minnesota for the {{division}} lead. The shutout marked Schneider's fourth of the season, which doubled his career total. Two games later, Schneider registered his fifth shutout {{of the season in}} a 2–0 over the Coyotes, tying him for the League lead. The game also marked the return of Kesler, who scored the game-winning goal. Minnesota slumped {{towards the end of the}} season and the Canucks won their fifth-straight Northwest Division title with a 2–1 victory over the Blackhawks. In the game, Schneider suffered a groin injury and was unable to play the last two games of the season; he was listed by the Canucks as day-to-day with a [...] "body" [...] injury. With Schneider out, the Canucks lost their final two regular season games. In their final loss, Vigneault rested many of his regulars, though he received criticism for playing Henrik Sedin for only 22 seconds. Furthermore, Sedin left the bench after his one shift. The Los Angeles Times Helene Elliott called it a cheap way of keeping Sedin's ironman streak intact. For his part, Henrik Sedin told Vigneault that [...] "he would be okay with sitting out the game" [...] and to him the streak is just [...] "a number in the paper." [...] Vigneault responded by telling Sedin that [...] "he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that breaks the streak," [...] and he gave him the choice to remain on the bench or return to the locker room. Sedin felt remaining on the bench would have been a further distraction and chose to leave. By season's end, the Sedin twins' point production dropped from the previous years. Henrik's point points-per-game average was the lowest it had been since 2007–08, while Daniel's was his worst since 2003–04. The Cauncks' power play also struggled throughout the year dropping from fourth in 2011–12 to 23rd in the League.|$|E

2500|$|The {{author of}} an article, {{the history of}} {{education}} spending in Pakistan since 1972, argues that this policy target raises a fundamental question: What extraordinary {{things are going to}} happen that would enable Pakistan to achieve within six years what it has been unable to lay a hand on in the past six decades? The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972–73 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if linear trend were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but {{it is not going to}} be of godly nature. Instead, it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> of political nature because it has to be [...] "invented" [...] by those who are at the helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an [...] "unconventional" [...] approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed fiscal space or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can [...] "invent" [...] the miracle of raising education expenditure to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first of}} two {{recording}} sessions for [...] "Fixing a Hole" [...] was at Regent Sound Studios in London on 9 February 1967, in three takes.

Also present at the session was a man who had arrived at McCartney's house in St John's Wood, shortly before McCartney was due to depart for the studio, and introduced himself as Jesus Christ. McCartney later recalled: [...] "I thought, Well, it probably isn't. But if he is, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to turn him away ...
