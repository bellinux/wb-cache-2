The study of <b>detecting</b> the road crack is the key to insure the security of accurately <b>detect</b> the road quality in transportation system. In this paper, we come up with a fixed way of road undersized rift image detection by using cellular neural networks. By image processing, building rift networks and details networks and adding the model of similarity undersized rift networks. It can avoid the problem that can not accurately <b>detect</b> undersized crack by only taking the crack feature value.

5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was <b>detected</b> afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also <b>detected</b> Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar <b>detected</b> an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data.
