40|$|Purpose: To {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} and epidemiological characteristics {{of patients with}} uveitis in an <b>emergency</b> <b>eye</b> care center. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients with active uveitis admitted between May 2012 and July 2012 to an <b>emergency</b> <b>eye</b> care center. Results: The majority of patients were male (63. 2 %), {{with a mean age}} of 43. 2 years; 66. 2 % patients were of mixed ethnicity, 22. 5 % were Caucasian, and 11. 3 % were black. Anterior uveitis was observed in 70. 1 % patients, posterior uveitis in 26. 5 %, and panuveitis in 3. 4 %; no patient was diagnosed with intermediate uveitis. All patients had a sudden and acute presentation. The most frequent symptoms were ocular pain (76. 9 %), redness (59. 8 %), and visual blurring (46. 2 %). The majority of patients had unilateral disease (94. 9 %) with a mean symptom duration of 6. 2 days. Diffuse and anterior uveitis were associated with ocular pain (p< 0. 001). Scotomata and floaters were more frequent in patients with posterior uveitis (p= 0. 003 and p= 0. 016, respectively). Patients with anterior uveitis presented with better visual acuity (p= 0. 025). Granulomatous keratotic precipitates were more frequent in patients with posterior uveitis (p= 0. 038). An etiological diagnosis based on the evaluation at the emergency center was made in 45 patients (38. 5 %). Conclusions: Acute anterior uveitis was the most frequent form of uveitis. Initial patient evaluation provided sufficient information for deciding primary therapy and aided in arriving at an etiological diagnosis in a considerable number of patients...|$|R

5000|$|Prolonged {{contact with}} {{propylene}} glycol is essentially non-irritating to the skin. Undiluted propylene glycol is minimally irritating to the eye, producing slight transient conjunctivitis; the eye recovers after the exposure is removed. Exposure to mists may cause eye irritation, {{as well as}} upper respiratory tract irritation. Inhalation of propylene glycol vapors appears to present no significant hazard in ordinary applications. [...] However, limited human experience indicates that inhalation of propylene glycol mists could be irritating to some individuals. It is therefore recommended that propylene glycol {{not be used in}} applications where inhalation exposure or human eye contact with the spray mists of these materials is likely, such as simulated fogs for theatrical productions, or antifreeze solutions for <b>emergency</b> <b>eye</b> wash stations.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{training}} that accident and emergency (A&E) senior house officers (SHOs) receive {{in dealing with}} <b>eye</b> <b>emergencies,</b> their own perceived level of confidence and competence in managing such cases, {{and the availability of}} appropriate equipment in their departments. METHODS: Prospective telephone survey using a standardised structured questionnaire. One SHO from each United Kingdom A&E department listed in the BAEM directory of 1993 was chosen at random and interviewed. RESULTS: 226 A&E departments were contacted and 192 SHOs were successfully interviewed (response rate 84. 9 %); 26. 0 % received no training in the management of <b>eye</b> <b>emergencies,</b> 68. 8 % had only a little or no confidence in dealing with these cases, and 42. 2 % worked in A&E departments which had no slit lamp. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of adequate basic ophthalmic training for A&E SHOs, leading to a lack of confidence on their part in the management of <b>eye</b> <b>emergencies.</b> In just over 40 % of A&E departments in the United Kingdom, the management of these cases may be less than optimal because of the absence of a slit lamp...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} the study is to {{determine}} the validity of an original patient symptom diary in recording symptoms of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, all patients presenting to the Hotel Dieu hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>eye</b> clinic between September 2008 and July 2009 diagnosed with acute PVD were offered enrollment in the study. Patients were given the Queen’s University posterior vitreous detachment patient diary at the initial visit after detailed eye examination, assessment of risk factors for retinal tears and detachments and a thorough explanation of their presenting complaints to record their symptoms related to PVD. At a random point during their six-week follow up, the patients were verbally asked the same questions being recorded in the diary over the phone. At the six-week follow up visit, the diaries were collected and the verbal results were compared with the written results. ResultsThere was substantial to near perfect agreement between the verbal questions and written answers. Cohen’s kappa scores for flash frequency, flash intensity, floater frequency, and floater type were 0. 6229, 0. 6389, 0. 6495, and 0. 8603, respectively. ConclusionsThe Queen’s University posterior vitreous detachment patient diary is a useful tool for investigating the quantity, quality and change in symptoms of patients presenting with PVD in the first 6 weeks of initial presentation...|$|R
