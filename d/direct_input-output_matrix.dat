30|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is twofold. First, we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for deriving and constructing the innovation <b>input–output</b> <b>matrix,</b> which must be differentiated from the technology and commodity <b>input–output</b> <b>matrices.</b> Second, based on the former matrix, we conduct an empirical analysis of innovation backward and forward linkages and test policy effectiveness in our data. This paper distinguishes itself from the existing literature in this field by proposing a new innovation <b>input–output</b> <b>matrix.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this essay is to develop and {{implement}} a methodology {{for the construction of a}} regional <b>input-output</b> <b>matrix</b> using a bottom-up approach and compare it to the one made using a top-down approach, using as a case study the state of Sonora in México. We assume that the regional matrix, constructed with using a top-down approach, is inadequate for the comprehension of regional economic behavior and its structural economic and spatial attributes, and therefore it becomes necessary to rely on a bottom-up approach for the construction of regional <b>input-output</b> <b>matrices.</b> Our main concern is to develop a bottom-up methodology for the construction of regional <b>input-output</b> <b>matrices</b> and to show differences and similarities with the top-down approach, through a statistical assessment based on the statistical association between census data of both regional and national economic structures. Therefore, the main outcomes of this research are: 1) a review of the main methodological features of the debate for the construction of a regional input-output matrix; 2) a methodological proposal for the construction of a regional <b>input-output</b> <b>matrix,</b> using a bottom-top approach, and 3) an statistical assessment of the main differences and similarities between the construction of regional <b>input-output</b> <b>matrices</b> using both approaches, using as a case study the state of Sonora, Mexico...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the methodology of <b>Input-Output</b> <b>matrices</b> estimation, at basic prices, based on preliminary data from the Brazil’s National Accounts. The same is tested for the year 2005, and the results obtained from <b>input-output</b> <b>matrix</b> (final version), available in IBGE site, and the matrix estimated buy this method are compared. The results of the analysis consist of employment and production multipliers and interrelated sectors rates from Rasmussen-Hirschman, economic indicators based on the theory of input-output. It follows that the series of economic indicators of the matrix and the matrix released by the IBGE are no different, based on statistical analysis (correlation coefficients). Therefore, the proposed methodology {{can be used for}} the estimation of national <b>input-output</b> <b>matrices</b> for periods when there are only preliminary data.

30|$|Although {{we could}} start our {{empirical}} evaluation from the innovation version of the <b>input–output</b> <b>matrix</b> (innovation <b>input–output</b> <b>matrix,</b> hereafter) without specifying the underlying theoretical model, this would conceal its implicit assumptions. Therefore, to lay down the micro-foundation of the matrix, we first develop the general equilibrium model behind the matrix. After deriving this matrix, we estimate innovation linkages in East Asian countries and draw implications for growth strategies in the East Asian region and in the USA. In particular, {{we are interested in}} measuring innovation backward and forward linkages.|$|R

This general equilibrium model allows for job, income and added value generation policies, necessary for state development, built on an input-output framework. Based on results from the <b>input-output</b> <b>matrix,</b> indicators of sector linkages in Pernambuco's economy, effects of demand shocks on jobs, income and added value, as well as impacts of a import substitution policy are presented. Results presented are intended {{to be used in the}} rational making of public policies for regional planning by policy makers. ...|$|R

Our empirical examination favors unbalanced as opposed to balanced growth and identifies core and bottleneck sectors that are the targets of the unbalanced growth strategy. In particular, we found that sectors with high innovation backward and forward linkages {{are likely to become}} bottlenecks.|$|R

This article presents the multipliers of employment, household-income and production for the case of an increase in public spending resulting from oil surpluses in the year 2008.

Thus, it is an important feature in the planning process. However, the construction is costly and the publication, sometimes, is made with a lag. Therefore, this paper upgrades the <b>input-output</b> <b>matrix</b> for Minas Gerais State and the rest of Brazil (BDMG and FIPE, 2002) for the period between 1997 and 2003. Based on those matrices, {{it will be possible to}} analyze the changes occurred on Minas Gerais and in the rest of Brazil.

In a former paper, we have investigated the facet structure of the 0 / 1 -polytope associated with the linear ordering problem. Here we report on a new algorithm that is based on these theoretical results. The main part of the algorithm is a cutting plane procedure using facet defining inequalities. This procedure is combined with various heuristics and branch and bound techniques. Our computational results compare favorably with the results of existing codes. In particular,we could triangulate all <b>input-output</b> <b>matrices,</b> of size up to 60 x 60, available to us within acceptable time bounds. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to present and to analyze a {{methodology}} to estimate Input-Output Matrices using preliminary data from the Brazilian National Accounts. This methodology is tested for the years of 1994 and 1996, where the results obtained from the <b>input-output</b> <b>matrices</b> (definitive version) available from IBGE are compared with the matrices estimated using the proposed methodology. The results analyzed refer to: a) type I production multipliers; b) Rasmussen-Hirschman backward and forward linkages; and c) Pure backward and forward linkages. Based on statistical methods (correlation indexes), the results show that the estimated matrices are similar to the ones released by IBGE. As so, this methodology can be used to estimate Brazilian national <b>input-output</b> <b>matrices</b> for the time periods where there are only preliminary data, and the economic structural analysis made with the estimated matrices are valid for the years analyzed. ...|$|R
