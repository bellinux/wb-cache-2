40|$|ASEE 2015 This {{project was}} created to control and monitor movable parts on the {{conveyor}} belt by a Human Machine Interface (HMI). In our application, we separate metallic and non-metallic objects. This application {{could be used in}} pharmaceutical, electronic industries or any industry which deals with metals/plastic. An eye sensor and a proximity sensor have been used to detect the non- metallic and metallic objects respectively. According to that the counter counts non-metallic and metallic objects and display the value on the HMI, whenever a metallic object is detected Air cylinder pushes it out of the conveyor belt and allows non-metallic objects to reach till the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>conveyor.</b> PLC with series FX 3 U- 16 MR/ES manufactured by Mitsubishi is used in this project. This logic can handle a series of metallic and non-metallic objects. To control the speed of the conveyor VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) is programmed and used. E-Designer- 7 software is used to design the screen. GX Developer software has been used to create PLC logic...|$|E

5|$|The two establishments were {{constructed}} in South East Northumberland {{as part of}} an incentive to lower the high unemployment numbers. The site was also chosen because of the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery sunk in 1909, with Lynemouth Colliery sinking 18 years later. However, in 1968, the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift had no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the washery at Lynemouth by conveyor belt. The power station was constructed nearby the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conveyor</b> belt.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Drag {{conveyors}} are {{the most}} efficient medium of material handling for conveying higher volume {{from one place to}} another. In horizontal condition drag chain conveyors can handle material up to 45 - 50 % of cross sectional area of the trough. In between the drive and non drive <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> drag <b>conveyor</b> an endless chain, having wide links carrying projection or wings are drags a bed of bulk material from feeding end to discharge end. Drag conveyor chains are work under the very extreme conditions such as high tensile load, friction and some time hazardous operating environment (e. g. presence of humidity, chemicals). Due to versatile application various failures are occurred in the drag conveyor chain and causes loss of productivity and corrective maintenance in the system.

5000|$|An {{elevator}} {{composed of}} a rotating rack of open frames (similar to an industrial toaster) catches the candlepins and hauls them towards {{the top of the}} machine, and then turns 90 degrees to bring the pins horizontally across, bringing the pins past ten conveyors each wide enough to hold pins in a lengthwise orientation. Unlike the pinspotters used for tenpins and duckpins, since candlepins have identical [...] "ends" [...] to them, the machine does not have to orient the candlepins in one particular direction. The pins fall off the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conveyors</b> into spotting tubes, mounted at their base onto the plate that forms {{the main part of the}} spotting table. As the sweep nears the forward <b>end</b> <b>of</b> its travel, and then begins its ascent to its resting position, the table drops to the metal plate pindeck at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the lanebed, and release a set of pins, and then ascends to its own resting position, ready to be filled with pins once more.|$|R
50|$|The men {{who worked}} at the staithes were known as teemers and trimmers. Teemers would open the doors {{on the bottom of the}} wagons to allow the coal to fall into hoppers under the rail deck on top of the staithes, or in the case of drops, {{directly}} into the hold of the collier. The trimmers worked in the hold, spreading and levelling the coal with shovels and rakes so that its weight would be evenly distributed. Skilled trimmers could stand with their shovel under the stream of coal coming from a spout or the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>conveyor</b> and angle it so the coal would ricochet off into the part of the hold they wanted to fill. This was a dangerous job, as the holds could fill with firedamp given off by the coal, resulting in an explosion. More modern systems are designed to be able to evenly distribute the coal without the need for men working in the holds of the ships.|$|R

Nowadays, the industries are using the crane systems to load the bagasse into the tippers, which is a very slow task and causing more dust.

50|$|The final circuit, {{dealing with}} ash, was located under the boiler.

The deposit located under the downspouts, in other words, at the beginning <b>of</b> the grate <b>conveyor,</b> collected the pieces of coal that fell off the conveyor during distribution. The deposit located in the middle collected partly burned coal that had fallen off the conveyor due to the boiler’s vibrations. The coal recovered from these deposits was sent to Praça do Carvão, back to the boilers’ feed system to be reused. Finally, the third deposit located at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the grate <b>conveyor</b> collected the coal ash and consisted of a crusher with water injection to cool and soften the ash. The ash was then carried in trolleys to the outside and deposited in a silo called the “ash skip”, located in Praça de Carvão.|$|R

40|$|Pears {{have a very}} {{sensitive}} epidermis and are prone to signal mechanical blemishes, which result in reduced visual quality and low consumer acceptance. The objective of this work was to identify critical points and the magnitude of impact forces on a packing line at a commercial packinghouse. The effect of injuries on ripening and quality of ´Packham´s Triumph´ pears was also evaluated after cold storage. The packing line was scrutinized on its transfer points, fruit drop heights and cushioning overlays, which allowed to acquire the maximum accelerations on each spot. The maximum acceleration forces were reproduced in the lab with ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears to evaluate the effects on fruit quality after cold storage. Four critical points were noticed on the packing line: at the transfer from the conveyor belt to the lifting rollers, at the transfer from the lifting rollers to the washing ramp with rotatory brushes, {{at the entrance to}} the singulator at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conveyor</b> belt and at the drop from the sizer to the packing stalls. Ripening of ‘Packham’s Triumph’ pears invariably came about during cold storage, and independently of the imposed impacts.

The system comprises a conveying unit, illumination and capturing unit, and sorting unit. Physical and mechanical features were extracted from the samples provided, and the detection algorithm was designed accordingly. An index based on color features was defined to detect Date samples. Date fruits were fed on a conveyor belt in a row. When they were {{at the center of the}} camera’s field of view, a snapshot was taken, the image was processed immediately and the maturity stage of the Date was determined. When the Date passed the sensor, positioned at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conveyor</b> belt, a signal was sent to the interface circuit and an appropriate actuator, driven by a step motor, was actuated, leading the Date toward an appropriate port. For validation of proposed system performance, entire samples were again sorted by experts visually. Detection rate of the system for Tamar and Khalal was satisfactory. Although the detection rate was insufficient for the Rotab stage, there was no a significant difference between system accuracy and that obtained by the experts.
