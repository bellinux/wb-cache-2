Nonetheless, the potential for future problems was real. Gouverneur Morris asked the Common Council for a means of protecting the necessary actions of the surveyors, but, for political reasons, the council could not agree on a solution, and passed the buck, again, to the state legislature.

40|$|On his {{departure}} from office in April 1835, Sir Robert Peel delivered {{a very personal}} tribute to, and testament of faith in, the House of Commons. Members from {{all sides of the}} House cheered the outgoing Conservative Prime Minister as he said: For himself, the whole of his political life had been spent in the House of Commons—the remainder of it would be spent in the House of Commons; and whatever might be the conflicts of parties, he, for one, should always wish, whether in a majority or in a minority, to stand well with the House of Commons. 1 Peel’s career as a ‘Commons man’ has rarely been explored. 2 In the period after 1835, however, not only did he fulfil his duties as Leader of the Opposition and engage fully with the business of the House, he also emerged as a pugnacious champion of the Commons’ privileges when these came under attack later in the decade. 3 This article focuses on his Controverted Elections Act of 1839, which ensured that the House retained the privilege of adjudicating cases where a petition had been presented against a return, alleging some breach of electoral law. The first two sections examine why this issue became so controversial and the arguments for and against Peel’s measure. A third section briefly examines Peel’s contribution to the concurrent debates around the Stockdale v.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the responses, as articulated in language, {{of the trade}} union movement in the UK (especially, the TUC) to changes in labour legislation introduced by the Conservative Government between 1979 and 1990. The research attempts to identify and interpret key words, themes and repertoires within union discourse by analysis of TUC pamphlets, 'campaign' literature, policy documents and speeches at the annual Congress, supplemented by information obtained from informal interviews with several union figures involved in constructing {{a response to the}} legislation. The nature and extent of changes in patterns of union language are explored through consideration of the materials over two distinct time periods - 1979 - 1983 and 1986 - 1990 - thus allowing examination of the rhetorical responses of the TUC/unions throughout the duration of the Thatcher Government. In order to place such responses in context, and to examine {{the extent to which the}} vocabulary of the unions was both shared with and shaped by other participants in the policy process, consideration has also been given to the language of Government in documents such as Green Papers and in Parliamentary debates, in addition to that of 'New Right' commentators who may have influenced the making of policy on labour legislation. Particular attention is paid to the way in which the characterisation of union <b>immunities</b> <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> liability as 'privileges' shaped the linguistic response of the unions and their strategy towards the presence of law in industrial relations. Union language during the period 1979 - 1990 is found to exhibit characteristics both of change and continuity. Those alterations which occured are considered in the light of theories of Thatcherism as a hegemonic project and in the context of wider changes in the discourse of the Left.

5000|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} consists partly of {{the ruined}} remains of institutions, and in finds of inscriptions {{and the long}} cyst burials that are characteristic of post-Roman Christian Britons. These long cyst burials occur in the southern Scottish lowlands, Wales, and the West Country of England. The grave is lined with stones, there are no grave goods, they often have an east-west orientation, and they date from a time before churches were commonly attached to cemeteries. They contrast with Anglo-Saxon burials, which followed a different inhumation custom.

Landed proprietorship was the basis of support and income for all clerical communities, exploiting agriculture (crops), herding (sheep, pigs, goats), infrastructure (barns, threshing floors), and employing stewards to supervise the labour. Lands that were not adjacent to the communities provided income in the form of (in effect) a business of landlordship. Lands under clerical proprietorship were exempt from the fiscal demands of kings and secular lords. They had the power of nawdd (protection, as <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> <b>process)</b> and were noddfa (a [...] "nawdd place" [...] or sanctuary). Clerical power was moral and spiritual, and this was sufficient to enforce recognition of their status and to demand compensation for any infringement on their rights and privileges.|$|R
40|$|A {{century ago}} Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., {{examined}} {{the history of}} negligence {{in search of a}} general theory of tort. He concluded that from the earliest times in England, the basis of tort liability was fault, or the failure to exercise due care. Liability for an injury to another arose whenever the defendant failed 2 ̆ 2 to use such care as a prudent man would use under the circumstances. ” A decade ago Morton J. Horwitz reexamined the history of negligence for the same purpose and concluded that negligence was not originally understood as carelessness or fault. Rather, negligence meant 2 ̆ 2 neglect or failure fully to perform a pre-existing duty, whether imposed by contract, statute, or common-law status. ” Because the defendant was liable for the breach of this duty regardless of the reason for his nonfeasance, Horwitz argues, the original standard of tort liability was not fault but strict liability. He maintains that the fault theory of negligence was not established in tort law until the nineteenth century by judges who sought 2 ̆ 2 to create <b>immunities</b> <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> liability and thereby to provide substantial subsidies for those who undertook schemes of economic development. 2 ̆ 2 The modern notion of negligence, then, was incorporated into tort law by economically motivated judges for the benefit of businessmen and business enterprises. The question whether tort liability for personal injuries originally was fault or strict liability probably will never be answered. Moreover, whether liability was negligence or strict liability, with notable exceptions, was not an issue in tort cases prior to the nineteenth century. This Article therefore proposes a different conceptual approach to the early history of tort. It tries to explain early tort cases in their own context, rather than within the modern paradigm of fault versus strict liability. This approach focuses on the principles and policies that judges explicitly used to decide the scope of tort liability and to determine the rules of decision they applied in tort cases...|$|R

Airlines have developed {{standard operating procedures}} (SOP) for normal, abnormal, and emergency operations. These procedures serve as a script for crews to follow. These procedures are designed by airlines to ensure that aircraft are operated in the (1) most safe, (2) most efficient, and (3) most on-time manner. For the most part pilots will comply with SOP, but when they (1) don 9 t agree with SOP, (2) don 9 t understand SOP or {{the risks associated with}} not complying with SOP, or (3) don 9 t feel adequately trained to know what SOP is, it is difficult to motivate them to comply. Airlines have the means to measure compliance through Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) and Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA). The purpose of this research is to determine if increased understanding, knowledge and awareness of the risk of noncompliance with SOP increase airline pilots’ compliance with SOP. This research explores data from line checks at a major US airline that was gathered in pursuit of understanding what drives SOP compliance. Baseline data was gathered and analyzed to determine the top 12 noncompliant items. The airline provided training during the Human Factors module in each pilots recurrent training on Pilot Intentional Non Compliance (PINC). The training including developing pilots’ understanding that while most Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) reports grant pilots <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> action, if a violation is labeled PINC, ASAP protections do not apply. Further line checks were conducted after the pilots received the PINC training.

Significant improvement in SOP compliance was found in six of the 12 items tested. The results established that training pilots on the risk of PINC did significantly increase SOP compliance...|$|R

40|$|For over a generation, {{academic}} jurisprudence {{and constitutional}} theory {{have attempted to}} reconcile, on the one hand, {{the rule of law}} and the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s fundamentality with, on the other hand, the fact that legal and constitutional rules frequently do not produce determinate answers to concrete controversies. The approach of radical democrats who would abandon judicial review is unacceptable to all those who believe that some judicially enforceable limits on politics are needed to prevent majoritarian tyranny. At the same time, however, constitutional theories that attempt to justify judicial review have limited utility; at best they strike a compromise between the tyranny of the majority and the counter-majoritarian difficulty. Academic jurisprudence faces a parallel dilemma. Under close scrutiny, both positivism and its principal alternative turn out to adopt the same strategy for coping with legal indeterminacy: each claims that the law 2 ̆ 7 s areas of ambiguity are small; yet neither theory nor any of the leading approaches to constitutionalism proposes concrete measures to minimize the impact of legal indeterminacy. Drawing inspiration <b>from</b> the <b>Legal</b> <b>Process</b> approach of Hart and Sacks, this Article proposes that instead of devising justifications for judicial review or explanations of the task of judges, theorists would do better to design institutions that reduce the domain of legal indeterminacy. Where Hart and Sacks proposed deference to politically accountable actors, however, this Article advocates deep collaboration with the other institutions of government. Departing <b>from</b> the <b>Legal</b> <b>Process</b> assumption that courts must defer to one of a fixed menu of institutions, this Article develops a model of 2 ̆ 2 experimentalist 2 ̆ 2 courts and agencies that are always in transition. That model is based in part on the explosive emergence of 2 ̆ 2 problem-solving courts 2 ̆ 2, nominally judicial bodies that are more akin to decentralized administrative agencies than to conventional adjudicators.

40|$|Peer {{review is}} {{the process by which}} clinicians {{evaluate}} and assist one another in better serving their patients. Essentially, there are five components of an effective traditional peer review process that must be in place for edification and learning to exist: I) direct observation of physician performance, 2) an effective case screening system, 3) a way to capture those cases that fail screening, 4) a definitive exception analysis at the clinical department level, and 5) an aggregation of individual events into a composite picture. At Northern Cochise Community Hospital (NCCI-J), this process may be in need of revision. My project has two objectives: I) to evaluate the medical staff peer review process currently in place for the NCCH hospital providers and 2) to offer recommendations for improving that process, with the ultimate goal of resolving perceived problems. I will accomplish these objectives by first, discussing peer review in general, second, outlining the process as it exists at NCCH, third, explaining the process as it exists at other facilities, and finally, providing recommendations for improvement. In order to understand peer review at NCCH, I interviewed 7 NCCH physicians, 3 hospital administrators, and I physician assistant. I solicited their personal definitions of peer review, their perceptions of the NCCH process, and their recommendations for improvement. By far, the overwhelming majority of NCCH clinicians believe that the current peer review remains a negative process. The two most prevalent negative aspects are communication barriers and varied opinions on medical practices. Such negativity creates an atmosphere of contention, which blocks education and shuns quality improvement. In order to help identify other areas in need of improvement within the peer review process at NCCH, I visited 9 hospitals, impartial to this project, to solicit information and advice. For the purposes of creating a more positive peer review experience, NCCH clinicians would like to see several short-term changes instituted. However, the long-term goals should be to focus on evidence-based medicine (EBM) and patient outcomes, encourage open reporting of medical error by providing <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>legal</b> discovery and non-punitive reporting approaches, and institute data standardization and interprovider analyses that might yield insights into methods to maximize patient safety and minimize error.
