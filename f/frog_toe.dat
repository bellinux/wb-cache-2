This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Previous work using an {{atomic force microscope}} in nanoindenter mode indicated that the outer, 10 - to 15 -lm thick, keratinised layer of tree <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> pads has a modulus of elasticity equivalent to silicone rubber (5 – 15 MPa) (Scholz et al. 2009), but gave no information on the physical properties of deeper structures.

5000|$|European {{tree frogs}} are small; males range from 32 - 43 mm in length, and females range from 40 - 50 mm in length. They are slender, with long legs. Their dorsal skin is smooth, while their ventral skin is granular. Their dorsal skin can be green, gray, or tan {{depending}} on the temperature, humidity, or their mood. Their ventral skin is a whitish color, and the dorsal and ventral skin is separated by a dark brown lateral stripe from the eyes to the groin. Females have white throats, while males have golden brown throats with large (folded) vocal sacs. The head of H. arborea is rounded, the lip drops strongly, the pupil has {{the shape of a}} horizontal ellipse, and the tympanum is clearly recognizable. The discs on the <b>frog's</b> <b>toes,</b> which it uses to climb trees and hedges, is a characteristic feature of H. arborea [...] Like other frogs, their hind legs are much larger and stronger than the fore legs, enabling the frogs to jump rapidly.|$|R

40|$|The <b>toe</b> pads of <b>frogs</b> {{consist of}} soft {{hexagonal}} structures and a viscous liquid contained between {{and within the}} hexagonal structures. It has been hypothesized that this configuration creates adhesion by allowing for long range capillary forces, or alternatively, by allowing for exit of the liquid and thus improving contact of the toe pad. In this work we suggest interaction between viscosity and elasticity as a mechanism to create temporary adhesion, {{even in the absence}} of capillary effects or van der Waals forces. We initially illustrate this concept experimentally by a simplified configuration consisting of two surfaces connected by a liquid bridge and elastic springs. We then utilize poroelastic mixture theory and model <b>frog's</b> <b>toe</b> pads as an elastic porous medium, immersed within a viscous liquid and pressed against a rigid rough surface. The flow between the surface and the toe pad is modeled by the lubrication approximation. Inertia is neglected and analysis of the elastic-viscous dynamics yields a governing partial differential equation describing the flow and stress within the porous medium. Several solutions of the governing equation are presented and show a temporary adhesion due to stress created at the contact surface between the solids. This work thus may explain how some frogs (such as the torrent frog) maintain adhesion underwater and the reason for the periodic repositioning of frogs' toe pads during adhesion to surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Tree frogs are {{remarkable}} for {{their capacity to}} cling to smooth surfaces using large toe pads. The adhesive skin of tree <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> pads is characterized by peg-studded hexagonal cells separated by deep channels into which mucus glands open. The pads are completely wetted with watery mucus, which led previous authors to suggest that attachment is solely due to capillary and viscous forces generated by the fluid-filled joint between the pad and the substrate. Here, we present evidence from single-toe force measurements, laser tweezer microrheometry of pad mucus and interference reflection microscopy of the contact zone in Litoria caerulea, that tree frog attachment forces are significantly enhanced by close contacts and boundary friction between the pad epidermis and the substrate, facilitated by the highly regular pad microstructure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{removing}} extracellular Ca ions or of adding the organic calcium channel antagonist, nitrendipine, were tested on twitches and tetani (1 00 Hz for 2 sec) in <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> muscles. Under conditions {{that did not}} reduce or that potentiated twitches, both procedures reduced {{the size of the}} tetanic responses. This depression was seen as an inability to maintain the maximum tetanic tension for more than 0. 5 sec. Intracellular microelectrode recordings showed that the muscle fibers were depolarized (mean about 23 mV) during the stimulus train and the fiber only slowly repolarized after the train. The latter effect is the “late negative afterpotential ” and it is produced by the accumulation of K ions in the t-tubules during the action potential train.

By decreasing the ionic strength the curve relating the peak {{tension of the}} K contractures to the log [K] was reversibly shifted to lower [K]. Increasing the [Ca] from 1 to 4 mM almost abolished this effect. The resting uptake of 4 Ca was increased more than two times by decreasing the ionic strength from 0. 125 to 0. 039. It was not increased significantly by raising [Ca] from 1 to 4 mM at low or normal ionic strength. The additional uptake of 4 Ca during contractures provoked by 120 m K was not significantly different at the two levels of ionic strength. The rate of emergence of 45 Ca from muscles loaded with 46 Ca at reduced ionic strength, was decreased.

40|$|ABSTRACT Using {{area under}} the {{contracture}} curve to quantitate contrac tures, the diffusion coefficient of calcium ions within the <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> muscle during washout in a calcium-free solution and subsequent recovery after reintroduction of calcium to the bathing solution was calculated {{to be about}} 2 X 10 - 6 cm 2 /sec. The diffusion coefficient measured during washout {{was found to be}} independent of temperature or initial calcium ion concentration. During recovery it was found to decrease if the temperature was lowered. This was likely due to the repolarization occurring after the depolarizing effect of the calcium-free solution. The relation between contracture area and [Ca] was found to be useful over a wider range than that between maximum tension and [Ca]o. The normalized contracture areas were larger at lower calcium concentrations if the contractures were produced with cold potassium solutions or if NOs replaced C 1 in the bathing solutions. Decreasing the potassium concentration of the contracture solution to 50 mM from 115 mM did not change the relation between [Ca]o and the normalized area.

The muscles had been fixed with an oxalate-containing osmium solution at rest at room temperature, at rest at 4 °C, during relaxation following K+ depolarization or after prolonged depolarization. From 6 to 39 per cent of K+ contracture tension was produced during fixation. The grains in the autoradiographs were always concentrated in the center 0. 2 to 0. 3 µ of the I band and {{the region of the}} overlapping of the thick and thin filaments. The greater the tension produced during fixation, the greater was the concentration in the A band and the smaller the concentration in the I band. Autoradiographs of two muscles fixed by freeze-substitution resembled those of muscles which produced little tension during osmium fixation. Muscles which shortened during fixation produced fewer grains. In the narrow (< 2. 0 µ) sarcomeres of the shortened muscles, grain density decreased with decreasing sarcomere width.

40|$|If {{you step}} outside {{on a warm}} evening after rain, {{you are likely to}} {{experience}} a unique nocturnal chorus. This chorus is the combined calls of breeding male frogs intent on attracting a female, and is a sound familiar to all Australians. Imagine if this were to disappear… [...] Australia has a rich and diverse frog fauna, which is unusual considering how much of the country is dry. There are over 220 known species of frogs in Australia. There are over 20 species under threat in NSW, of which eight used to be found in Western NSW. The surveys conducted by the Darling Riverine Plains Project have recorded 18 different species of frogs in the bioregion. FROG HABITAT Frogs are found in many different environments and climates throughout Australia, ranging from rainforests to deserts. One third of Australia’s frogs burrow to escape dry conditions. During the Darling Riverine Plains biodiversity surveys frogs were found in a variety of microhabitats including soil cracks, in tree hollows, on, in and under logs, under bark, on roads and in waterholes. Frogs are specially adapted to the habitat they live in, and their appearance will commonly provide clues to their lifestyle. For example: · Burrowing frogs have short, powerful legs and hard lumps called tubercles on the base of their feet used for digging. · Tree-dwelling frogs are more slender, with suction cap-like toe pads used for clinging to smooth surfaces. The amount of webbing between <b>frogs</b> <b>toes</b> indicates how much of its life is spent in aquatic environments. An essential element for frog habitat is a source of water, as few frogs can survive without moisture...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Autoradiographs {{have been}} {{prepared}} from <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> muscles soaked in Ca 4 ' and fixed with an osmium-oxalate solution. A majority of the grains over the A bands were over the myofibrils. The grain density over the I bands was greatest over {{the space between the}} myofibrils. The significance of this distribution is discussed in the light of previous information about the longitudinal distribution of Ca 4 " in skeletal muscle. An attractive hypothesis for the coupling of excitation with contraction in skeletal muscle is that depolarization of the membrane causes the release of calcium from some intracellular store. This calcium then initiates the interaction of the contractile filaments. Several different types of evidence support such a mechanism. Muscle models such as isolated myofibrils, glycerolextracted fibers, and muscle fibers from which the membrane has been removed contract when the calcium concentration is increased to greater than 10 - 7 M (1 - 3). The endoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells contains a system which accumulates calcium and relaxes contracted muscle models simultaneously (4, 5, 11). This system can lower the calcium concentration of a solution to less than 10 - 7 M. The depolarization of the surface membrane is conducted to the cell interior along tubular invaginations which lie within a few hundred Angstrom units of the endoplasmic reticulum (6 - 9). In an autoradiographic study of the location of calcium in frog skeletal muscle it was shown that most of the exchangeable calcium is localized to the center 0. 2 to 0. 3 pu of the I band and the part of the A band where the thick and thin contractile filaments overlap (10). The relative concentration of calcium in the two regions could be related to the amount of tension that the muscle was exerting at the time of histological fixation. The greater the tension the greater was the localization to the A band and the smaller the localization to the I band. In these studies {{it was not possible to}} distinguis...|$|E
40|$|Tree frogs {{adhere to}} {{surfaces}} using their toe pads. These pads secrete a fluid which {{enables them to}} adhere using a temporary adhesive mechanism known as wet adhesion. In keeping with the principles that govern this type of mechanism, the toe pads should be capable of adhering sufficiently and detaching effortlessly. However, {{the vast majority of}} research in this area has centred on static experiments, thus giving no real indication of the dynamic activity of the animal. Therefore, one aspect of this PhD project was to investigate the biomechanics of tree frog locomotion, focussing particularly on the kinematics and forces involved during toe pad detachment. Tree <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> pads do indeed possess a rapid, efficient detachment mechanism, the toe pads simply peeling off of the surface from the rear, requiring very little force. The impact of this at higher scales was reflected in the force profiles of individual limbs, and in the global kinematics of the frog during locomotion. In addition to this, the wet adhesive mechanism itself was investigated by assessing the performance of tree frogs in a range of challenging conditions, including on overhangs and flooded surfaces. The latter condition compromises a key component of the wet adhesive mechanism; however, torrent frogs perpetually clamber across wet rocks in the vicinity of waterfalls, and yet are able to maintain their attachment. Therefore, the second aspect of this project was to compare the adhesive capabilities of tree- and torrent frogs, and propose explanations for the differences in their performance. Whilst comparable on dry, smooth surfaces, the adhesion of torrent frogs on rough, flooded substrates was far superior to that of tree frogs. Several explanations for this are offered, including the utilisation of a greater proportion of their ventral contact area, and a toe pad morphology that is optimised for such conditions. The results of this PhD project may provide a functional and morphological ‘blueprint’ for the development of toe pad mimics that can adhere in wet conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|As modern {{technology}} demands for miniaturized structures with higher surface {{area to the}} volume ratio, the design and synthesis of materials with tailored surfaces is becoming more important. Moreover, some emerging technologies require materials with smart surface properties that can be controlled remotely, and work adaptively in “on” and “off” states when stimulated externally. Fascinating surface structures and adaptive functionalities {{that can be found}} in biological systems have provided great inspirations to researchers for fabrication of synthetic biomimetic assemblies. While the fabrication of materials with non-smart bio-inspired surface structures has been greatly accomplished, the mimicking of adaptive functionalities of the living systems is less investigated. Thus, there is a great zeal in developing materials with smart and adaptive biomimetic structured surfaces. The objective of this dissertation is to design and develop materials with smart biomimetic micro/nanostructured surfaces that can show desirable responses when remotely stimulated. First, an experimental study on the integration of a dissipative material (resembling the dissipative and wet nature of the tree <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> pads) to an elastic fibrillar interface (resembling the dry and fibrillar nature of the gecko foot pads) is carried out. Accordingly, a new type of functionally graded adhesive is developed, which is composed of an array of elastic micropillars at the base, a thin elastic intermediate layer and a viscoelastic top layer. The results showed that the new proposed graded structure has remarkable adhesive properties in terms of pull-off force, work of adhesion, and structural integrity (i. e., inhibited cohesive failure). Second, muscle-driven actuation of biomimetic microfibrillar structures is achieved using integrative soft-lithography on a backing splayed liquid crystal elastomer or networks (LCEs/LCNs). Variation in the backing LCE layer thickness yields different modes of thermal deformation from a pure bend to a twist-bend. The muscular motion and dynamic self-cleaning of gecko toe pads are mimicked via this mechanism. Finally, the self-peeling of gecko toes is mimicked by the integration of film-terminated fibrillar adhesives to hybrid nematic LCN cantilevers. A soft gripper is developed based on the gecko-inspired attachment/detachment mechanism. Performance of the fabricated gripper for transportation of thin delicate objects is evaluated by the optimum mechanical strength of the LCN and the maximum size of the adhesive patch...|$|E
40|$|Every week {{it seems}} I am {{approached}} by a reporter on the unpaid internship situation. I feel drawn into the witches’ coven of Endor watching poison’d entrails, fenny snake, eye of a newt, and <b>frog</b> <b>toes</b> being thrown into the cauldron only to roil the unpaid brew to a higher boil. The snakes entering the pot are venomous {{in the form of}} the Black Swan, Harper Bazaar (thank goodness it wasn’t Harpers Bizarre as I was feelin groovy), and Charlie rose court cases. The interesting aspect of two of these cases is that both “interns, ” looking for experience in a new field of endeavor, have been out of school for several years and engaged in work. The same law firm has filed all the legal motions. These actions only scratch the surface of the efforts to change the landscape of the internship experience; one attempt being to eliminate unpaid work by students. The recipe for the unpaid brew may have been confounded by a case in the 6 th District, U. S. Court of Appeals. Solis v. Laurelbrook, decided on April 28, 2011, basically confirmed a lower court finding that the DOL Six Criteria “…is a poor method for determining employee status in a training or educational setting. ” Using the Laurelbrook school situation specifically, the court gave a general ruling by concluding that “…the proper approach for determining whether an employment relationship exists in the context of a training or learning situation is to ascertain which party derives the primary benefit from the relationship. ” Since the courts will be engaged for some time in straightening out the legalities of the unpaid internship, the fate of unpaid internships probably rests upon perceptions played out in the media. And in this venue the challenges appear daunting for colleges and universities. Take for example the recent forum in the NY Time...|$|R

40|$|Tree frogs {{have evolved}} {{specialised}} toe pads which {{allow them to}} efficiently climb vertical surfaces. The toe pad stick by using ‘wet adhesion’ – a combination of forces produced by {{a thin layer of}} fluid between the pad and the surface which provide temporary adhesion to allow quick attachment and detachment for climbing. Most studies on tree frogs have been based on their adhesive capabilities on surfaces which are flat, clean and dry (usually glass). However, climbing tree frogs in the wild will come across a variety of surfaces which could affect their adhesive abilities. This PhD investigated whether tree frog adhesion is affected by various ‘challenging’ surfaces, which reflect conditions that tree frogs may encounter whilst climbing. These include rough surfaces, wet conditions, surfaces with loose particulate and hydrophobic surfaces. Experiments were predominantly conducted using a force transducer to measure adhesive and frictional forces of single toe pads, as well as whole animal attachment experiments involving a rotating tilting board. The toe pads of tree frogs were shown to possess a self-cleaning mechanism, whereby the pads will remove contaminants (and subsequently recover adhesive forces) through repeated use, thanks to shear movements of the pad and the presence of pad fluid which aids contaminant deposition. To investigate how torrent frogs (frogs which inhabit waterfalls) can adhere to rough and flooded surfaces, the performance of torrent frogs species Staurois guttatus was compared to a tree frog species (Rhacophorus pardalis). Torrent frogs could produce higher adhesive forces than tree frogs with their toe pads, and possess a specialised toe pad morphology (directional fluid channels on the pad periphery) which may contribute to better performance in flooded conditions. Torrent frogs utilise large areas of ventral skin to stay attached on overhanging surfaces, while tree frogs display a reduction in contact area resulting in a failure to stay attached. This combination of ability and behaviour will help torrent frogs to stay attached on the rough and flooded surfaces that make up their waterfall habitat. On rough surfaces, tree frogs showed improved (compared to smooth surface performance) performance on smaller scale roughness (asperity size < 10 µm), and poorer performance on the larger scale roughnesses tested (30 – 425 µm). Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) revealed that larger asperities result in pad fluid being unable to fill the larger gaps of such surfaces, which was confirmed by adding water to rough surfaces to improve attachment performance. The soft pad does however aid in conforming to some rough surfaces, which could account for the better performance on the smaller scale roughness. Many plant surfaces exhibit hydrophobic properties, and so the adhesive performance of tree frogs on hydrophobic surfaces was compared to that on hydrophilic surfaces. It was found that the toe pads could produce similar adhesive and frictional forces on both surfaces. The pad fluids contact angles were then measured on hydrophobic surfaces using IRM, where droplets of pad fluid formed lower contact angles (and are therefore exhibiting higher wettability) than water. Though the exact composition of pad fluid is unknown, some form of surfactant must be present which aids wetting of surfaces (either a surface modification or detergent present in the fluid) to allow wet adhesion to occur - goniometer experiments of water on dried footprints on hydrophobic surfaces confirmed this. The ability to stick in a variety of conditions could provide inspiration for ‘smart’ adhesives, which mimic the adaptable adhesion of tree <b>frog</b> <b>toe</b> pads...|$|E

40|$|Tree <b>frogs</b> use {{adhesive}} <b>toe</b> pads for {{climbing on}} a variety of surfaces. They rely on wet adhesion, which is aided by the secretion of mucus. In nature, the pads will undoubtedly get contaminated regularly through usage, but appear to maintain their stickiness over time.

We compared adhesive forces prior to and after contamination of (1) the whole animal on a rotatable platform and (2) individual toe pads in restrained frogs mimicking individual steps using a motorised stage. In both cases, the adhesive forces recovered after a few steps but this took significantly longer in single toe pad experiments from restrained frogs, showing that use of the pads increases recovery.

40|$|Cryo-scanning {{electron}} microscopy (cryo-SEM) and {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) offer new avenues {{for the study of}} the morphology of tree <b>frog</b> adhesive <b>toe</b> pads. Using these techniques, we compare toe pad microstructure in two distantly related species of tree frog, Litoria caerulea, White (Hylidae) and Rhacophorus prominanus, Smith (Rhacophoridae), in which the toe pads are considered to be convergent. AFM demonstrates the extraordinary similarity of both surface microstructures (largely hexagonal epithelial cells surrounded by deep channels) and nanostructures (an array of nanopillars, ca. 350 nm in diameter, all with a small dimple at the apex). The cryo-SEM studies examined the distribution of the fibrillar cytoskeleton within the different layers of the stratified toe pad epithelium, demonstrating that the cytoskeletal elements (keratin tonofilaments) that lie at an angle to the surface are relatively poorly developed in L. caerulea, clearly so in comparison to R. prominanus. Cryo-SEM also enabled the visualization of the fluid layer that is critical to a toe pad's adhesive function. This was achieved by examination of the frozen fluid residues left behind after removal of a toe within the cryo-SEM's experimental chamber. Such ‘toeprints’ demonstrated the presence of a wedge of fluid surrounding each toe pad, as well as fluid filling the channels that surround each epithelial cell. Cryo-SEM was used to examine epithelial cell shape. In a sample of 582 cells, 59. 5 % were hexagonal, the remainder being mainly pentagonal (23. 1 %) or heptagonal (16. 1 %). The distribution of differently-shaped cells was not random, but was not associated with either pad curvature or the distribution of mucous pores that provide fluid for the frogs' wet adhesion mechanism. Our main finding, the great similarity of toe pad structure in these two species, has important implications for biomimetics, for such convergent evolution suggests a good starting point for attempts to develop adhesives that will function in wet conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the previously studied Zn 2 +, low concentrations (about 0. 5 mM) of Be 2 +, Ba 2 +, Cd 2 +, Ni 2 +, Cu 2 +, Pt 4 + and, outstandingly, 0. 5 µM of UO 22 +, potentiate the twitch of <b>frog</b> sartorius and <b>toe</b> muscles by prolonging the active state of contraction. The degree of potentiation is a roughly S-shaped function of p(metal 2 +), suggesting that each metal binds to a ligand of the muscle fiber, representative apparent affinity constants being: UO 22 +, 5 x 106; Zn 2 +, 2. 8 x 105; and Cd 2 +, 2 x 104. UO 22 + potentiation effects are rapidly reversed by PO 4, and Zn 2 + and Cd 2 + effects by EDTA, PO 4, and cysteine. The rapidity of these reversals by the nonpenetrating EDTA and PO 4, {{and the fact that}} heavy metal ions evidently potentiate by prolonging the action potential, indicate that the metal potentiators exert their primary action at readily accessible (i. e. plasma and T tubular) membrane sites. The relatively slow kinetics of development of potentiation, and the even slower reversal of it in pure Ringer's solution, indicate that the metal ions are bound to connective tissue, as well as to muscle fibers. The binding effects at the readily accessible membrane sites evidently impairs delayed rectification and thus modifies the action potential and excitation-contraction coupling so as to cause potentiation. SH is excluded, and PO 4 and imidazole are possibilities, as the membrane ligand binding the potentiating metal ions...|$|R

Good [condition] [...] several areas of surface wear on black design. " [...] Description from the Museum catalog. "Joy Navasie, {{also known as}} "Frog Woman," {{is among the most}} famous of the Hopi-Tewa potters. She was an active potter from 1935 - 1995. Her mother, Paqua Naha, (ca. 1890 - 1955) was the first Frog Woman and it was Paqua who taught Joy to make pottery. Joy began signing her pots with a hallmark Frog design around 1939. She drew her frog signature with webbed feet while her mother drew the <b>frog</b> with short <b>toes.</b> Joy worked in a style called black and red on white. She credits her mother Paqua with developing the style in the early 1950 s. After her mother passed away three years later, Joy continued the whiteware tradition and the Navasie and Naha families have specialized in whiteware pottery ever since. Her sister-in-laws Eunice (Fawn) Navasie (ca. 1920 - 1992) and Helen Naha (Feather Woman) (1922 - 1993) were also famous potters. Hopi potters who have made whiteware pottery consider it the most difficult to make. When firing white clay pots the fire has to be very hot. The delicate white slip must also be protected from smudging so instead of using potsherds to cover and protect the pots during firing the Navasie family uses slates or slabs of asbestos. Joy has made many different types of pottery including jars, bowls, wedding vases, bird effigy bowls, lidded sugar jars & creamers and lamp bases. Her designs were inspired by the Sikyatki style with rain, clouds, parrots and feathers among her favorites. An excellent color photograph of Joy surrounded by her whiteware pottery was featured on the inside cover of the May 1974 special Southwestern Pottery Today issue of Arizona Highways magazine. Her pottery has won countless awards including many from the Santa Fe Indian Market and the Gallup Intertribal Ceremonial. Collections of her work can be found in several museums including the Museum of Northern Arizona and the Heard Museum in Phoenix. Now in her mid-eighties, and no longer potting, Joy's works have become highly prized. She passed on the whiteware tradition by teaching the art to her children Marianne, Leona Navasie, Natelle Lee, Maynard, Loretta Navasie Koshiway and Grace Lomahquahu who have all become well-known potters. She also taught her grandson Charles Navasie Martin to make fine pottery. " [...] From the Morgan Collection of Southwest Pottery website. Gifted by John A. Morgan; 2002...|$|R
