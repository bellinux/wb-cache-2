5|$|Season one {{revolves}} around two main events: Coach Eric Taylor beginning {{as head coach}} and the injury and paralysis of star quarterback Jason Street {{in the first game}} of the season. Coach Taylor's career depends on his ability to get the Dillon Panthers to the state championship, despite the loss of Street. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> suffers a losing streak, he knows his family will no longer be welcome in Dillon.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the {{remainder}} of the series was under threat. Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
50|$|The tie was contested {{over one}} leg, just like <b>the</b> last edition. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> could still not be separated, then extra time {{would have been}} played with a penalty shootout (taking place <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> were still level after that).|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> end <b>the</b> {{season in}} a points tie, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> with <b>the</b> most goals on {{aggregate}} will win (for a two-team competition, this {{is equivalent to}} goal differential). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> are tied on aggregate goals, the current holders retain the Cup for another year.|$|R
50|$|Counter-Strike Source: This event {{consists}} of 18 rounds.

5|$|Double Dare 2000 {{introduced}} the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed {{a team to}} make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
5|$|He {{was named}} {{manager of the}} team in 1905, but did not receive {{additional}} pay; he was, however, offered a bonus <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> didn't lose money. In 1905, Tenney tried to sign William Clarence Matthews, an African-American middle infielder from Harvard University, to a contract. Tenney later retracted his offer due to pressure from MLB players. Defensively, he led the majors in errors committed by a first baseman and finished second in most putouts for any position. Tenney led the 1906 Beaneaters to a 49–102 record. For the second straight year, the Boston team lost more than 100 games.|$|E
50|$|The {{rules for}} the final were {{exactly the same as}} for the {{previous}} knockout rounds. The tie was contested over two legs with away goals deciding <b>the</b> winner <b>if</b> <b>the</b> two <b>teams</b> were level on goals after <b>the</b> second leg. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> could still not be separated at that stage then extra time would have been played with a penalty shootout taking place <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> were still level after that.|$|R

5|$|When {{a player}} under {{contract}} with a Nippon Professional Baseball team wishes to play in Major League Baseball, he must notify his current team's management and request that they make him available for posting during the next posting period (November 1 – March 1 through the 2013 season, and November 1 – February 1 in the current agreement). The NPB team can reject this request, and the player will not be posted. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> consents, the player is presented to the MLB Commissioner, who then notifies all MLB teams of the posted player.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, McCaw started {{attempts}} to sell either Orca Bay or the Grizzlies, {{and at first}} negotiated an agreement with Dennis Washington, owner of Seaspan, who had {{a large portion of}} his operations in Vancouver. Washington initially agreed to purchase 50% of Orca Bay, with the intent of keeping the teams in Vancouver. Instead, McCaw used Washington's bid to leverage a higher sales price with Bill Laurie, who offered US$148million for the Grizzlies, and a US$52million bonus <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> ultimately relocated to St. Louis. The announcement was made in September1999, one month after Laurie had bought the NHL team St. Louis Blues and their home venue Kiel Center (now Scottrade Center). St. Louis had not been the home of an NBA franchise since the Hawks franchise relocated to Atlanta in 1968. Kiel Center had annual sell-out for 15 to 17 basketball games for the Saint Louis University Billikens.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of an NBA team, {{and led by}} Mayor Mick Cornett, who had successfully lobbied for the previous temporary relocation of the New Orleans Hornets to Oklahoma City, the voters of that city approved a $120 million renovation of the Ford Center on March 3, 2008, including {{construction of a new}} NBA practice facility. After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a subcommittee of three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of the Ford Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide tax breaks and other incentives <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> relocated.|$|E

5|$|Football {{had been}} played at St James' Park {{as early as}} 1880, the ground being {{occupied}} by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of Newcastle West End F.C. in 1886. Its lease was then bought by Newcastle East End F.C. in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, {{and the rest of the}} ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity all-seater stadium. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,420. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,420 people, but club owner Mike Ashley would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.|$|E

25|$|Quicksand: A {{variation}} of penalizing overtricks, a team who exactly makes their contract gets full value. Overtricks subtract 10 points each from that value, and teams {{who do not}} make their contract subtract 10 points for each missed trick. For instance, consider a bid of 7 tricks. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> made exactly 7 tricks, they would earn the full 70 points. If they only took 5 tricks, they would lose 20 points. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> made 9 tricks, they would earn the 70 points, −20 points for the two overtricks, resulting in a score of 50 points.|$|E
25|$|During the season, the Rays and Kazmir {{agreed on}} a {{four-year}} contract extension which guaranteed the lefty $28.5 million and had a maximum value of approximately $39.5 million <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> picked up his option for the 2012 season.|$|E
25|$|In league, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> in {{possession}} fails to score before {{a set of}} six tackles, it surrenders possession.

25|$|Oh Hell Variation: Like Oh Hell, {{partnerships}} {{must take}} exactly {{the number of}} tricks bid. If they have overtricks, the team is penalized and the contract is broken. Some play where <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> bids 5 tricks and wins exactly 5 tricks, the contract is honored no matter which player made how many tricks, while others force each player to exactly meet their contract.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of bad weather, the side batting second must have batted a minimum of 20 overs for a result to be {{declared}} (if the match was not otherwise won, for example <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> batting second was dismissed before the completion of 20 overs). In {{the event of}} interrupted matches (due to rain or some other factor), the Duckworth-Lewis method was applied to determine the result or revised target.|$|E
50|$|In each {{semifinal}} and in <b>the</b> final, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> {{are tied}} {{on the number}} of aggregate goals scored in the series {{at the conclusion of the}} second game, <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> were to play a 30-minute extra time period. As in the quarterfinal, the golden goal rule was not in effect. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> were still locked in a draw following the extra time period, the winner of the series was to be determined by a penalty shootout.|$|R
50|$|The final {{was played}} on a home-and-away two-legged basis. Unlike the quarterfinals and semifinals, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> two <b>teams</b> are tied after both legs, the match goes to extra-time and, if necessary, a shootout. There is also no away goals rule and <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> seed in <b>the</b> {{classification}} does not matter <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teams</b> tie on aggregate.|$|R
