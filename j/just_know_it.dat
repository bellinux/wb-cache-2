5000|$|The Amish {{blueprint}} for expected behavior, called the Ordnung, regulates private, public, and ceremonial life. Ordnung does not translate readily into English.

A member noted: The order is not written down. The people <b>just</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> that's all. Rather than a packet of rules to memorize, the Ordnung is the understood behavior by which the Amish are expected to live. In {{the same way that}} the rules of grammar are learned by children, so the Ordnung, the grammar of order, is learned by Amish youth. The Ordnung evolved gradually over the decades as the church sought to strike a delicate balance between tradition and change.

5000|$|Captain Jack's {{music was}} stylized {{as a form}} of {{military}} training mixed with Europop and dance pop music. They were musically influenced by the eurodance genre that was popular in Europe, Oceania and South America in the 1990s. The style of eurodance was dance music with a female singer and a male rapper to follow a traditional verse-chorus structure. Captain Jack are best known for dance tracks like [...] "Captain Jack", [...] "Drill Instructor" [...] or [...] "Little Boy". Although they also made slower tracks such as [...] "Back Home", [...] "7 Days" [...] and [...] "I Feel" [...] that strayed from the europop genre. There are also some Ace of Base influenced reggae pop songs like [...] "Soldier, Soldier" [...] on their early albums. Captain Jack covered numerous of songs such as A-ha's [...] "Take On Me", Queen's [...] "Another One Bites the Dust" [...] or Madonna's [...] "Holiday". They also sampled classical elements like Edvard Grieg's [...] "In the Hall of the Mountain King" [...] in their dance song [...] "Dream a Dream" [...] or Johann Pachabel's [...] "Canon in D major" [...] in their ballad [...] "Children". During the early 2000s Captain Jack changed their musical style from eurodance pop to summer vibe tunes, following the styles of the previous single releases [...] "Soldier, Soldier" [...] and [...] "Holiday". They covered numerous well-known famous summer songs, such as Chico Buarque's [...] "A Banda" [...] (in their version, [...] "Get Up"), Captain Sensible's [...] "Say Captain, Say Wot", Huey Smith & The Clowns's [...] "Don't You <b>Just</b> <b>Know</b> <b>It</b> (Don't Ha Ha)" [...] or KC and the Sunshine Band's [...] "Give It Up". They continued that style til the band's hiatus in 2005. In 2008 Captain Jack returned with a different new musical direction consisting of more matured dance techno sound with more R&B, Hip Hop and Oriental influences, such as [...] "Turkish Bazar".|$|E

40|$|One of the {{questions}} that pops out in our minds once we have started learning a second language is: “Will I ever speak as well as native speaker does?” Teachers and students at the Foreign Language Department at the University of El Salvador may think it as an impossible goal. I am sure the reason of this failure is the emphasis we confer to grammar rules and consciously learned linguistic knowledge while we are performing in the second language. In contrast, native speakers performance, our aim to keep in mind, is based on Language Intuition. Intuition is the component of our minds, which directs the access to linguistic knowledge with no intermediate stages and “tells” the performer whether he is being accurate in his language production or not. They do not know this because of consciously learned knowledge of grammar rules. They <b>just</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> intuitively. Near native speakers may also develop such a sense for the target language in order to perform as well as a native speaker without the constant consultation of consciously learned grammar rules that take too much of time...|$|E
40|$|Randomness is {{a notion}} which {{everyone}} {{is familiar with}} in a practical, day-to-day manner—we learn how to identify it and cope with it {{as a matter of}} course, just through the need to exist in a world full of uncertainty and unpredictability. It’s not something that most people think too hard about—we <b>just</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> when we see it. However, when we try to rigorously define what it means for something to be “random”, we find that it is actually rather difficult to pin down. What properties should hold in a random system? What structure would one expect to find? What structure would one not expect to find? What should you be able to predict about such a system? It turns out that these questions are not easy to answer definitively—the inquisitive among us {{have come up with a}} surprising number of ways to define randomness, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, strengths and limitations. In the following discussion, we will consider one such notion of randomness, that of “Fourier Pseudorandomness”, which provides a measure of randomness for subsets of ZN. We will • Define and prove the existence (in fact abundance) of Fourier Pseudorandom sets; • Explore some of the nice properties of this type of randomness; and • Discuss how Fourier Pseudorandomness is limited as a definition of randomness...|$|E
