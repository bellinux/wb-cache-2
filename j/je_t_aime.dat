Phenolic compounds, total anthocyanins, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity (DPPH, FRAP, ABTS and ORAC assays) in FJP methanolic extract and JE were measured. Specific phenolics (ellagic and gallic acids) and anthocyanin (cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside) were measured by LC-DAD-ESI/MS. In the biological assay thirty-six Wistar rats were divided in six groups: AIN- 93 M normal control diet; HFF (obese control) feed a high-fat and fructose diet; Prevention FJP (P. FJP) and Treatment FJP (T. FJP) feed HFF diet with 2 % of FJP powder, for 12 and 6 weeks respectively; Prevention JE (P. JE) and Treatment <b>JE</b> (<b>T.</b> <b>JE)</b> were feed with HFF diet {{and the water}} was substituted by JE, for 12 and 6 weeks, respectively. FRAP, TSARS, GSH and antioxidant enzymes (GPx, GR, CAT and SOD) were determined in the plasma and liver. The limit of significance was set at P < 0. 05. The FJP methanolic extract showed higher levels of total phenolics and anthocyanins, ellagic acid and DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assay, but JE showed higher levels of cyanidin- 3 -O-glucoside, gallic acid and ABTS assay. Antioxidant potential of the FJP and JE were confirmed by important markers in animals, such as TBARS and GSH levels and CAT activity, but not by FRAP assay, and SOD, GR and GPx enzymes. Thus, FJP and JE showed an important antioxidant effect in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Japanese {{encephalitis}} (JE) virus (JEV) is {{an important}} cause of encephalitis in children of South and Southeast Asia. However, the majority of individuals exposed to JEV only develop mild symptoms associated with long-lasting adaptive immunity. The related flavivirus dengue virus (DENV) cocirculates in many JEV-endemic areas, and clinical data suggest cross-protection between DENV and JEV. To address the role of T cell responses in protection against JEV, we conducted the first full-breadth analysis of the human memory T cell response using a synthetic peptide library. Ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses to JEV in healthy JEV-exposed donors were mostly CD 8 (+) and targeted nonstructural (NS) proteins, whereas IFN-gamma responses in recovered JE patients were mostly CD 4 (+) and targeted structural proteins and the secreted protein NS 1. Among patients, a high quality, polyfunctional CD 4 (+) T cell response was associated with complete recovery from <b>JE.</b> <b>T</b> cell responses from healthy donors showed {{a high degree of}} cross-reactivity to DENV that was less apparent in recovered JE patients despite equal exposure. These data reveal divergent functional CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell responses linked to different clinical outcomes of JEV infection, associated with distinct targeting and broad flavivirus cross-reactivity including epitopes from DENV, West Nile, and Zika virus...|$|R
40|$|For {{efficient}} non-destructive {{ultrasonic inspection}} in plate/shell structures, {{the development of}} a guided-wave based method using transducers having good beam directivity, high power and little dispersion is important. To this end, a damage inspection strategy using a set of specially-designed magnetostrictive patch transducers capable of generating beam-focused, non-dispersive shear-horizontal waves is proposed. In the present ultrasonic pitch-catch inspection, only a few single transducers need to be installed around an inspection area. To convert measured wave signals by the transducers into two-dimensional images, a relatively simple yet effective data-processing technique suitable for the employed transducer setting is developed. Sets of experiments were conducted on rectangular plates having one or two circular holes with a diameter of 1 mm or 3 mm. For all experiments, the Gabor-shaped ultrasonic pulses having the center frequencies of 250 kHz and 360 kHz were used.

40|$|The French phrase Je t’aime is {{frequently}} {{to be found}} written on everyday items or used as a leitmotiv in commercial music. It {{is believed to be}} more or less translatable in all languages irrespective of context. This paper attempts to deal with the linguistic implications of these and other distinctive features that make Je t’aime such an unusual linguistic object. The first part is devoted to an attempt at translating Je t’aime in Japanese and Hungarian. It comes out that there exist at least three classes of interpretation, three ways of producing equivalent utterances based on a translation of the verb aimer. The second part focuses on the French phrase per se; it examines some famous accounts of Je t’aime by Paul Valéry, Roland Barthes and Jean-Luc Marion and tries to grasp and emphasize their linguistic meaning. The results of the morphology and syntax-driven analysis in Part 1 prove also relevant without modification of the surface formal structure. As a conclusion, we propose three interpretative patterns with their own grammatical features and even pragmatic outcomes; the pseudo-universal motto of French amour is but one of them. 要旨フランス語の <b>Je</b> <b>t</b> 2 ̆ 7 aime（英I love you）は、日用品のデザインや歌謡曲のライトモチーフなどに頻繁に使われる文である。この文はほとんどの言語に翻訳することができると考えられる。本稿はJe t 2 ̆ 7 aimeを言語学的に分析し、非常に独特な言語学的特徴をもつことを明らかにする。前半は、Je t 2 ̆ 7 aimeを日本語とハンガリー語に翻訳し、３通りに解釈ができることを明らかにする。つまり動詞aimerは３通りの異なった発話に翻訳されるのである。論文の後半は、この文を用いたことで有名な、ポール・ヴァレリー、ロラン・バルト、ジャン＝リュック・マリオンのそれぞれの考えをまとめ、彼らの用いる言語的な意味を比較する。主に前半部で行った形態論と統語論分析が、表層構造を変形せずにそのまま有効であることが示される。結論としてJe t 2 ̆ 7 aimeには異なる３つの文法的特徴と語用論的解釈があり、誰もが知っているフランス語のamourとの関連性は、その３つのうちの１つであることを主張する...|$|R

Six- to eight-week-old male Balb/c mice that received one or two intraperitoneal inoculations with these JE vaccine candidates at a dose of 1 × 107 PFU per mouse produced neutralizing antibody and antibodies to the envelope (E) and nonstructural 1 (NS 1) proteins as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation. Immunization with either of these vaccine candidates also induced <b>JE</b> virus-specific <b>T</b> lymphocytes that proliferated in response to stimulation with infectious virus and/or noninfectious viral antigens. Mice maintained detectable levels of neutralizing antibody and <b>JE</b> virus-specific memory <b>T</b> cells for at least 6 months after immunization with NYVAC-JEV and for 4 months after immunization with ALVAC-JEV.

40|$|Japanese {{encephalitis}} (JE) virus (JEV) causes severe epidemic encephalitis across Asia, {{for which}} the live attenuated vaccine SA 14 - 14 - 2 is being used increasingly. JEV is a flavivirus, and {{is closely related to}} dengue virus (DENV), which is co-endemic in many parts of Asia, with clinically relevant interactions. There is no information on the human T cell response to SA 14 - 14 - 2, or whether responses to SA 14 - 14 - 2 cross-react with DENV. We used live attenuated JE vaccine SA 14 - 14 - 2 as a model for studying T cell responses to JEV infection in adults, and to determine whether these T cell responses are cross-reactive with DENV, and other flaviviruses. We conducted a single arm, open label clinical trial (registration: clinicaltrials. gov NCT 01656200) to study T cell responses to SA 14 - 14 - 2 in adults in South India, an area endemic for JE and dengue. Ten out of 16 (62. 5 %) participants seroconverted to JEV SA 14 - 14 - 2, and geometric mean neutralising antibody (NAb) titre was 18. 5. Proliferation responses were commonly present before vaccination in the absence of NAb, indicating a likely high degree of previous flavivirus exposure. Thirteen of 15 (87 %) participants made T cell interferon-gamma (IFNγ) responses against JEV proteins. In four subjects tested, at least some T cell epitopes mapped cross-reacted with DENV and other flaviviruses. JEV SA 14 - 14 - 2 was more immunogenic for T cell IFNγ than for NAb in adults in this JE/DENV co-endemic area.

The thesis proposes {{to address the}} mind-body problem, and specif- ically the {{question}} of scienti c explanation of consciousness, in terms of language and meaning. First, {{the core of the}} mind- problem is identi ed with Kant's transcendental unity of apper- ception and the distinction between empirical and transcendental consciousness is emphasized. Empirical consciousness, as con- sciousness of something, is assumed to be best approached by a higher-order theory of consciousness. Then various aspects of meaning, intentionality and language in use are discussed to pre- pare ground for the conclusion that transcendental conditions of consciousness are entailed by conditions of being a genuine speaker of language. Thus language can be said to be constitutive consciousness not only {{in the sense that the}} behavioural criteria for attributing consciousness are essentially linguistic, but also in the sense that consciousness comes with the ability to speak.

The broad aim of {{this thesis}} is to clarify the {{relationship}} between syntax and semantics, mainly in connection with languages with exactly speci ed structure. The main questions we raise are: What is it that makes a semantic concept genuinely semantic? What exactly makes a merely semantic characterization of such a concept inadequate? What is the decisive step {{we have to make}} if we want to start speaking about the meaning-side of language? We approach these questions indirectly: via an analysis of a typically semantic concept, namely that of truth. Our principal question then becomes: What conceptual resources are required for a satisfactory de nition of truth? To investigate the concept of truth and di erent ways in which it can be de ned, we have chosen three individual systems: (a cumulative version of) Russell's rami ed theory of types, Zermelo's second-order set theory and Carnap's logical syntax. Each of the systems is studied in considerable detail. The presented thesis is, in e ect, a collection of three case-studies into {{the ways in which the}} concept of truth is explicitly de nable and into the requisite conceptual background, each study forming a more or less closed unity. It should be noted that we are not interested in a historically faithful representation of these systems; our goal is to get [...] .

These PBMC were examined for proliferative responses against live JE virus, a glutaraldehyde-fixed lysate of cells infected with JE virus, and extracellular particles (EPs; subviral membrane vesicles released from cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding the JE virus premembrane and envelope proteins). Japanese encephalitis virus-specific T cell proliferation was demonstrated with PBMC from both patients and vaccinees after stimulation with infectious JE virus or the lysate of JE virus-infected cells. Proliferating PBMC included CD 4 + T lymphocytes and CD 8 + T lymphocytes in responses to either form of JE viral antigens. Responses to EPs were observed only with PBMC from some American vaccinees whose PBMC also responded to the virus and lysate.

The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{investigation}} of a binary operator, 4, that models the standard symmetric di erence of sets. This operator is studied both separately (in Chapter II) and with the supplementary lattice structure (Chapter III and the rest). The class ODL is introduced {{and some of its}} basic properties are investigated. Then there is exhibited the class HOR. The class HOR is a subclass of ODL which is closely related to the class of Boolean algebras. In the last Chapter there is described the construction of free orthocomplemented di erence lattice with two generators. 3 Katedra logikyDepartment of LogicFaculty of ArtsFilozofická fakult...|$|R

W dalszych częściach niniejszej rozprawy omówione będą kolejno kształtujące się od końca XIX w. modele filomatyzmu, powstałe w określonych warunkach społeczno-politycznych i kulturowych. Znajdą się tam rozdziały poświęcone sposobowi ujmowania poszczególnych członków organizacji filomackiej, a także recepcji utworu, który uznano za program organizacji wileńskiej — Ody do młodości. Prezentowana praca ma za zadanie przedstawienie koncepcji filomatyzmu jako zespołu pewnych wartości, które dostrzegano w działalności grup młodzieży wileńskiej w omówionym okresie w kręgu opinii pozytywistycznej, wypowiadanej zarówno w badaniach naukowych, jak i publicystyce. The paper {{presents}} {{the reception of}} the Wilno students' movement by the „Warsaw positivists", who formed their own conception of the objectives and activities of the Wilno organization, based on the sources available in th eir time. The conception differed from the patriotic legend functioning in the social conscioussness, which included the movement under discussion to the tradition of national struggle for independence. The positivists maintained th a t the Wilno Univers ity organization had been of non-political character. Therefore, both in their studies regarding the- origins of the organization and in their characterization of {{the objectives of the}} Wilno students' activities the positivists indicated chiefly those values which could be included in the positivistic legalism. They emphasized the students' interest in the social issues, their eagerness for self-improvement, and their belief in gradual remodelling of the social conscioussness. The positivists — who believed in political realism — neglected the reasons of the secrecy of the Wilno oi'ganization, and they belittled the role of the movement and its consequences. Their opinions illustrated the tendency to demythicize the „national ma r tyrdom''. This attitude was the expression of opposition to the national legend and also to the opinions contained in Nowosilcow's report, and the judgements of some Russian historians who shared his attitude. While approving of the movement — in accordance with the spirit of the epoch the positivists at the same time aimed at shaping a model that could be materialized in the sphere of the current social experience. They created a model member of the Wilno^ secret organization, who would realize the principles of the positivistic pedagogics, {{as well as those of}} the ethics which was a continuation of the Enlightenment theories. The p attern had two aspects, according to whether it was formulated by conservatists or liberals. It, was Bolesław Prus who suggested the most coherent conception of the movement, after J. Kallenbach had edited Adam Mickiewicz's Unknown Works (1817 — 1823). In the essay The Poet as the Nation's Teacher, published in 1910, Prus emphasized mainly the utilitarian character of the movement.

Anti-E and anti-NS 1 antibodies were elicited in most vaccinees inoculated with NYVAC-JEV and in some vaccinees inoculated with ALVAC-JEV. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from approximately one half of vaccines showed positive proliferation in response to stimulation with live JE virus. Cytotoxic assays demonstrated the presence of JE virus-specific CTLs in in vitro-stimulated PBMCs obtained from two NYVAC-JEV and two ALVAC-JEV vaccinees.

Eufemije u Kamporu na otoku Rabu. U portretnom polju prikazan je bračni par, tj. dekurion T. Baebius T. f. Iustus i njegova supruga Tettia Volsonis f., što se doznaje iz prigodnoga komemorativnog natpisa. Obiteljski spomen postavio <b>je</b> <b>T.</b> Baebius T. f. Iustus ili Iustinus, koji je vjerojatno njihov sin. Premda su na spomeniku izrađeni portreti pokojnika, autor drži da spomenik nije nadgrobna portretna stela, nego ugradbeni grobni reljef. Toj vrsti spomenika pripadaju i dva ulomka s djelomice sačuvanim portretima pokojnika iz iste zbirke. Budući da su pronađeni na lokalitetu Miral kod rta Kaštelina, a tu je pronađen i spomenik obitelji Baebius, autor zaključuje da pripadaju istoj obitelji koja je na prostoru Kamporske drage imala svoje imanje. Opisane grobne reljefe autor datira u razdoblje od sredine do u drugu polovicu 1. st. nakon Krista. Onomastička i epigrafska analiza natpisa sa spomenom obitelji Baebius iz Kampora, također i podatci s dva ranije poznata natpisa sa spomenom članova iste porodice (CIL III, 10121 i 13293), daju dovoljno argumenata za zaključak da su Baebii među vodećim lokalnim porodicama autohtonog podrijetla, čiji pripadnici obnašanjem magistratura i članstvom u municipalnom vijeću vode upravu rimskodobne Arbe. In {{this article}} the author {{describes}} and analyses {{a fragment of}} the tombstone featuring the portraits of the deceased members of the Baebius family. The fragment is {{one part of the}} museum collection in the Franciscan monastery of St. Eufemia in Kampor on the island of Rab. In the portrait field of the fragment is presented a married couple, decurion T. Baebius T. f. Iustus and his wife Tettia Volsonis f. which can be read from the commemorative inscription. It is most likely that the family tombstone was placed by their son. Although on the monument there are the portraits of deceased members of the family, the author thinks that the monument is not the grave portrait stela but {{it is more likely that}} it was an embedded grave relief. The same sorts of monuments are also on the other two fragments with partially preserve portraits of the deceased which belong to the same collection. They were found in the locality of Miral near to the cape of Kaštelina where the tombstone of the Baebius family was also found. From this the author concludes that these monuments belonged to the same family which had their property around Kampor. The author believes that the described grave relieves were made in the period between the middle and second half of the 1 st Century BC. The onomastic and epigraphic analysis of the Baebius family tombstone from Kampor, as well as the date from the other two fragments found earlier where the members of the same family were mentioned (CIL III, 10121 and 13292), give us enough reasons to conclude that the Baebii were one of the leading local indigenous families. The family’s members were officers in the magistrate and had the right to participate in the municipal government’s board during Roman Arbe (today’s Rab). Der Autor analysiert in diesem Artikel den Bruchstück eines Grabmals mit den Porträts der Gestorbenen aus der Familie Baebius, das im Lapidarium der Museumsammlung des Franziskanerklosters der hl. Eufemia in Kampor auf der Insel Rab bewahrt wird. Im Porträtfeld wird ein Ehepaar dargestellt, bzw. Dekurion T. Baebius T. f. Iustas oder Iustinianus und seine Frau Tettia Volsonis f., was die anlässlich der Kommemoration geschriebene Inschrift beweist. Dieses Familiendenkmal hatte Baebius T. f. Iustus oder Iustinus (wahrscheinlich ihr Sohn) aufgestellt. Obwohl an dem Denkmal die Porträts der Gestorbenen dargestellt sind, meint der Autor, dass es sich hier nicht um eine Grabmalstele handelt, sondern um ein Einbau-Grabrelief. Dieser Denkmälerart gehören auch zwei Bruchstücke mit teilweise bewahrten Porträts der Gestorbenen aus dergleichen Sammlung. Da sie auf der Lokalität Miral, bei der Spitz Kaštelina gefunden wurden (und hier wurde auch ein Denkmal mit Erwähnung der Familie Baebius entdeckt) schließt der Autor Folgerung, dass sie dergleichen Familie gehören die auf dem Gebiet der Kaporska Draga ihren Besitz hatte. Die beschriebenen Grabreliefe datiert der Autor auf den Zeitabschnitt von der Mitte bis zur zweiten Hälfte des 1. Jahrhunderts nach Christi. Die onomastische und epigraphische Analyse der Inschrift mit der Andenkung an die Familie Baebius aus Kampor, sowie Daten aus zwei vorhererwähnten Inschriften mit der Andenkung an die Mitglieder dieser Familie (CIL III, 10121 und 13293) geben genug Argumente für die Schlussfolgerung, dass die Baebii der führenden heimischen Familie ursprünglicher Herkunft gehörten.

REBCO tape, assembled in a Roebel cable, was selected as conductor. The developed REBCO tape has reached a record engineering critical current density, at 4. 2 K and 18 T of 956 A/mm^ 2. Roebel cable carried up to 13 kA at 20 K when tested in a small coil (FeatherM 0. 4). Then a first dipole magnet, wound with two low-grade Roebel cables of 25 m each, was assembled and tested. The dipole reached the short sample critical current of 6 kA generating more than 3 T central field at about 5. 7 K, with indications of good current transfer among cable strands and of relatively soft transition.
