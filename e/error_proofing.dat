40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that lean manufacturing audits are {{an effective way}} to measure improvements in operational performance was tested using 64 manufacturing sites owned by a FTSE 100 company. Commonly-used lean characteristics were evaluated: policy deployment, standardised work, visual management and housekeeping, quick changeover techniques, total productive maintenance, continuous improvement (kaizen), <b>error</b> <b>proofing,</b> cultural awareness, material control, and levelling (heijunka). Operational performance was assessed employing commonly-used operational performance measures: on-time-delivery, inventory turns, and direct labour utilisation.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of lean principles and practices to industrialized housing in Sweden are examined, taking the production culture into consideration. The factory production of industrialized housing shows apparent similarities to manufacturing, but areas related to fully integrated lean production practices, such as <b>error</b> <b>proofing</b> and standardized work floor and equipment maintenance, are scarce. Hence, {{applicability of}} lean principles and practices to industrialized housing production is clearly {{influenced by a}} production culture that has similarities to a traditional construction culture. Setting up industrialized housing production thus requires careful implementation of lean principles if workers from traditional building are moved into factories, and managers still adhere to the prevailing site-based production mentality. However, {{the influence of the}} traditional construction project culture is not solely a constraint; flexible teams that take their own responsibility are also important in a lean culture. Hence, retaining parts of the existing construction mentality, context and way of working is also central when discussing lean applicability in industrialized housing. Lean production, lean construction, industrialized housing, culture,...|$|E
30|$|Customers and {{organization}} cannot compromise {{on health and}} safety issues. Some health and safety issues are externally (outside the company premises) related to the customers and some related to the internal employees. Customers expect that the products or services should not land them in dangerous position or situations. In this paper, {{the focus is on}} the internal health and safety issues related to employees during manufacturing. The practices in health and safety bundle consists of five S, Six S, Poka Yoke (<b>error</b> <b>proofing),</b> visual management, standardised work, ergonomic work station or cell design and total productive maintenance (TPM). These practices create the safe working environment and work place organization on the shop floor where safety is very important. It ensures streamlined flow of information and material with minimum strain on workers. Clearly, it is evident that the creative and innovation capability is the prerequisite for implementing health and safety practices. For example, ergonomic work station or cell design has to consider the movements of body elements and strain on it while performing certain task. Similarly, designing the Poka Yoke devises, Visual Management, five S, Six S and Standardised work needs application of creative and innovative minds. Once the organization acquires the capability in creativity and innovation then it can work on the third phase of Lean journey simultaneously along with the second phase. This development is clearly shown in Fig.  6 (Framework for Lean implementation) as partial overlapping of creative and innovation practices along with health and safety practices on time scale.|$|E
40|$|MSc (Enginnering), Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentIn {{recent years}} {{companies}} have made {{increased use of}} Lean Manufacturing audits to measure the degree of Lean Manufacturing implementation within their organizations. Thereafter, a gap analysis highlights areas for improvement, which leads to increased Operational Performance. This approach may be flawed. The audit may measure Lean Manufacturing characteristics that are not beneficial or the Lean Manufacturing audit may be inaccurate due to auditor bias or inadequate scope. The result is frustration {{and a lack of}} belief in the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing as a competitive strategy. This study tests the hypothesis that “Lean Manufacturing audits drive improvements in Operational Performance. ” A sample company comprising sixty four organizations operating in a job shop and Batch operations management environment is used as a case study. The organizations manufacture and service high value added products for heavy industry. The Lean Manufacturing audit developed to assess the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing audits in driving Operational Performance uses Lean Manufacturing characteristics commonly used in previous research. These characteristics include policy deployment, standardized work, visual management and housekeeping, quick changeover techniques, total preventative maintenance, continuous improvement, <b>error</b> <b>proofing,</b> cultural awareness, material control and level production. Commonly used Operational Performance measures such as On-Time-Delivery, Inventory turns and Direct Labour Utilization are used to assess Operational Performance. A range of independent auditors were used to gather data on the extent of implementation of Lean Manufacturing and Operational Performance measures. Structural Equation Modelling is used to relate the results of the Lean Manufacturing audits to Operational Performance. This is the first known paper to use Structural Equation Modelling in measuring the extent of implementation of Lean Manufacturing to Operational Performance. Lean Manufacturing audit results have a significant correlation to Operational Performance but {{with a high degree of}} variation in Operational Performance not accounted for by the results of the Lean Manufacturing audit. This variation is caused by the inadequate scope of the audit relative to Operational Performance measures as well as auditor bias. Lean Manufacturing audits are effective in driving improvements in Operational Performance provided that the scope of the audit is expanded to include office functions, supplier networks and customer and branch distribution networks. A recommended audit framework is suggested in this research. A large scale study of a number of different companies should be conducted to verify the results of this research using the audit framework developed...|$|E

Preinfection of Vero cells with HCMV enhanced reactivation of UV-irradiated herpes simplex virus more significantly than did treatment with UV or methylmethanesulfonate alone. A similar enhancement by HCMV was observed in human embryonic fibroblasts, but not in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP 12 BE) cells. It was also found that HCMV infection enhanced hydroxyurea-resistant DNA synthesis induced by UV light or methylmethanesulfonate. Alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis revealed an enhanced rate of synthesis of all size classes of DNA in UV-irradiated HCMV-infected Vero cells. However, HCMV infection did not induce repairable lesions in cellular DNA and did not significantly inhibit host cell DNA synthesis, unlike UV or methylmethanesulfonate.
