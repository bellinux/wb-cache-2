Given that nonelite runners, particularly those with a competitive motive, have a higher risk for injury than experienced elite runners, {{it is important for}} physicians to understand the training program and features that might distinguish running performance and injury rates in this population. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that nonelite runners who qualify for the Boston Marathon (&ldquo;qualifiers&rdquo;) would have higher running volumes, more running sessions per week, lower injury rates, and lower body mass index (BMI) than nonqualifying runners. Study design: A cross-sectional Web-based survey of runners (convenience sample) at 1 month (n = 50) and 6 months (n = 41) after participation in the 2008 Twin Cities Marathon (TCM) that acquired data on anthropometric measures, demographic data, finishing time, premarathon/current training program, and self-reported injury. Results: Thirteen of 50 initial survey respondents were classified as a &ldquo;qualifier&rdquo; based on their finishing time. Mean BMI was significantly lower in the qualifiers at 1 month (22. 0 versus 23. 9 kg/m 2, P = 0. 0267) but not 6 months postmarathon. There {{were no significant differences in}} training volume (running <b>frequency,</b> <b>run</b> length, or cross-training volume) or injury rates between qualifiers and nonqualifiers. Prior to the 2008 TCM, 54 % of runners included cross-training in their exercise program, which increased significantly to 74 % 1 month postmarathon (P = 0. 0039) and 71 % 6 months postmarathon (P = 0. 0325). There was no association between cross-training and injury rates. Conclusions: Nonelite marathon runners had a high degree of cross-training in their training program. Qualifiers for the Boston Marathon did not significantly differ in running <b>frequency,</b> <b>run</b> length, or cross-training volume compared with nonqualifiers. Whether changes in the training program at an individual level might facilitate a change in qualifying status remains to be determined. Keywords: training, marathon, cross-training, BM...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking (TS) and {{illicit drug}} use (IDU) are of public health {{concerns}} especially in developing countries, including Bangladesh. This paper aims to (i) identify the determinants of TS and IDU, and (ii) examine the association of TS with IDU among young slum dwellers in Bangladesh. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data on a total of 1, 576 young slum dwellers aged 15 - 24 years were extracted for analysis from the 2006 Urban Health Survey (UHS), which covered a nationally representative sample of 13, 819 adult men aged 15 - 59 years from slums, non-slums and district municipalities of six administrative regions in Bangladesh. Methods used include <b>frequency</b> <b>run,</b> Chi-square test of association and multivariable logistic regression. The overall prevalence of TS in the target group was 42. 3 %, of which 41. 4 % smoked cigarettes and 3. 1 % smoked bidis. The regression model for TS showed that age, marital status, education, duration of living in slums, and those with sexually transmitted infections were significantly (p< 0. 001 to p< 0. 05) associated with TS. The overall prevalence of IDU was 9. 1 %, dominated by those who had drug injections (3. 2 %), and smoked ganja (2. 8 %) and tari (1. 6 %). In the regression model for IDU, the significant (p< 0. 01 to p< 0. 10) predictors were education, duration of living in slums, and whether infected by sexually transmitted diseases. The multivariable logistic regression (controlling for other variables) revealed significantly (p< 0. 001) higher likelihood of IDU (OR =  9. 59, 95 % CI =  5. 81 - 15. 82) among users of any form of TS. The likelihood of IDU increased significantly (p< 0. 001) with increased use of cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Certain groups of youth are more vulnerable to TS and IDU. Therefore, tobacco and drug control efforts should target these groups to reduce the consequences of risky lifestyles through information, education and communication (IEC) programs...|$|E

30|$|Both {{the second}} and third heat pumps chosen are {{variable}} speed heat pumps. The compressor can operate at a variety of speeds because it is driven by an inverter. The inverter is an electronic device capable of providing an alternating current within a range of frequencies instead of just the usual 60 Hz used in North America. At higher <b>frequencies</b> the compressor <b>runs</b> faster, and at lower <b>frequencies</b> it <b>runs</b> more slowly. This allows the heat pump to run continuously by matching the heat output to the heating needs of the home. Consequently, the indoor temperature can be maintained more closely and efficiencies are usually higher than with a single-stage or two-stage heat pump.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to the unsupervised detection of affixes, that is, to extract a set of salient prefixes and suffixes from an unlabeled corpus of a language. The underlying theory makes no assumptions on whether the language uses a lot of morphology or not, whether it is prefixing or suffixing, or whether affixes are long or short. It does however make the assumption that 1. salient affixes have to be frequent, i. e occur much more often that random segments of the same length, and that 2. words essentially are variable length sequences of random characters, e. g a character should not occur in far too many words than random without a reason, such as {{being part of a}} very frequent affix.
