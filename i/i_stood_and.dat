Thereafter, the parishioners had to use {{the church in}} Gladsaxe though there was {{increasing}} interest in building a new church in Bagsværd. It therefore came as no surprise that the congregational council took special interest in the church Utzon had included in a competition exhibit for the town centre in Farum when it was displayed in Gladsaxe at an architectural exhibition in 1967. When he was asked whether he would like to submit a proposal for a church at Bagsværd, Utzon was elated: [...] "There <b>I</b> <b>stood,</b> <b>and</b> was offered the finest task an architect can have — a magnificent time when it was the light from above that showed us the way." [...] The proposal he submitted the following year included four sketches: the first one showed a group of people under the clouds on a beach, the last one depicted the same people as a congregation in a church where the clouds had become the sculptural roof. They were intended to illustrate Utzon's understanding of the overall concept.|$|E
