40|$|Graphene {{has been}} gaining {{attention}} mainly because of its exceptional electrical and mechanical properties. Mono layer graphene with its planar hexagonal lattice structure is transparent and flexible. Together with its high electrical conductivity, this form of graphene can be an excellent material for flexible electronics. However, structural defects and lattice disorders have been the primary reasons for its inability to fulfill its full potential. As a result, other graphene based structures have been developed faster - {{one of the most}} important of which is graphene paper. Graphene paper is a hierarchical structure the building block of which is graphene nano platelets. The objectives of the study were to synthesize high quality graphene powder, and to prepare stable ink to fabricate graphene paper samples for electrical and mechanical characterization. Two types of tests were conducted to determine: (i) electrical resistance; and (ii) mechanical properties, specifically fatigue bending and adhesion. Experimental data were analyzed using standard statistical modeling techniques. 	In this work, high quality graphene powder was first produced using liquid phase exfoliation. Then, stable graphene ink was developed to produce large scale graphene paper depositions on polyimide Kapton substrates. A large set of graphene paper samples was prepared with different ink concentration and annealed at a temperature range between 280 oC and 320 oC for periods for up to 24 hours. 	The sheet resistance of the prepared graphene paper were measured using a custom built <b>electrical</b> <b>fixture.</b> The electrical measurement experiments indicated that the electrical resistance of graphene paper samples is mainly a function of annealing temperature, annealing time and concentration of the as-prepared ink. 	A set of fatigue bending and adhesion tests was conducted to ensure that the material is mechanically durable such that the electrical resistance does not change after repeated bending loads. It was found that the material structure gets mechanically weaker as the annealing time increases. Prolonged annealing for periods longer than 8 hours at 300 oC degrades the mechanical properties of this specific graphene paper. 	Finally, capacitance properties of the produced graphene paper were investigated. To simulate double layer capacitance behaviour, electrodes were fabricated with graphene paper coating and used for cyclic voltammetry setup. It was found that the material does not exhibit ideal double layer behaviour due to its low porosity...|$|E

50|$|The Waltham Water Works Shop is a {{historic}} municipal public works building at 92 Felton Street in Waltham, Massachusetts. The two story brick building was built in 1894, {{as part of a}} major municipal construction campaign. It is distinctive as a well-preserved yet utilitarian municipal structure, whose construction embodies some significant advances for the period. Its basement level, which originally housed a workshop, had a cement floor and was illuminated by both gas and <b>electrical</b> <b>fixtures,</b> all then somewhat advanced features. The main floor, which housed offices, space for carriages, and stalls for six horses, was constructed of concrete and iron.

5000|$|The wall inlets are {{connected}} to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air return ducts (if permitted by building code).

Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and <b>electrical</b> <b>fixtures,</b> the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|R

50|$|According to {{a market}} report {{prepared}} in August, 2016 by Grand View Research, Inc., the global powder coatings market {{is expected to reach}} USD 16.55 billion by 2024. Increasing use of powder coatings for aluminum extrusion used in windows, doorframes, building facades, kitchen, bathroom and <b>electrical</b> <b>fixtures</b> will fuel industry expansion.

General industries were the prominent application segment and accounted for 20.7% of the global volume in 2015. Increasing demand for tractors in the U.S., Brazil, Japan, India, and China is expected to augment the use of powder coatings on account of its corrosion protection, excellent outdoor durability, and high-temperature performance. Moreover, growing usage in agricultural equipment, exercise equipment, file drawers, computer cabinets, laptop computers, cell phones, and electronic components will propel industry expansion.|$|R

50|$|Electrical appliances, such as lights, heaters, {{and heated}} towel rails, {{generally}} {{need to be}} installed as fixtures, with permanent connections rather than plugs and sockets. This minimizes the risk of electric shock. Ground-fault circuit interrupter electrical sockets can {{reduce the risk of}} electric shock, and are required for bathroom socket installation by electrical and building codes in the United States and Canada. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, only special sockets suitable for electric shavers and electric toothbrushes are permitted in bathrooms, and are labelled as such. UK building regulations also define what type of <b>electrical</b> <b>fixtures,</b> such as light fittings (i.e. how water-/splash-proof) may be installed in the areas (zones) around and above baths, and showers. Contrary to some information provided with bathroom light fittings, sinks and basins do not affect bathroom zones, as a bathroom is solely defined as a room containing a bath or shower, by wiring regulations. It is nevertheless good practice to avoid installing unsuitable fixtures close to sinks, as damage from water splashes may occur.|$|R
50|$|North Rochester's first {{church was}} built in 1748, about 1 mi west of the present building, and was served by {{traveling}} ministers from other communities. The church congregation was formally organized in 1790, and a new church was built at that time. The current church building {{was built in}} 1841 by Solomon K. Eaton, a noted regional builder whose credits include several other area churches. One of the congregation's notable early 19th-century members was Marcus Morton, a three-time Governor of Massachusetts. The congregation, given its small numbers and rural character, frequently struggled financially, and stopped supporting a full-time minister in 1916. Although periodically revived, the congregation struggled throughout the 20th century, with no services held for a roughly twenty-year period in 1970. The building began to decay, and was invaded by raccoons. In 1990 it was again revived, and the building underwent a sensitive restoration that included moving it onto a new foundation.
