Like <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> SG-II ADS is also a towed system, and utilizes all other subsystems of <b>its</b> <b>predecessor</b> {{with the exception of}} the gun.

5|$|The ICJ {{delivered}} its {{judgment on}} 23 May 2008. It held that although Pedra Branca {{had originally been}} under the sovereignty of Johor, the conduct of Singapore and <b>its</b> <b>predecessors</b> à titre de souverain (with {{the title of a}} sovereign) and the failure of Malaysia and <b>its</b> <b>predecessors</b> to respond to such conduct showed that by 1980, when the dispute between the parties arose, sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore. The relevant conduct on the part of Singapore and <b>its</b> <b>predecessors</b> included investigating marine accidents {{in the vicinity of the}} island, planning land reclamation works, installing naval communications equipment, and requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits. In contrast, Johor and its successors had taken no action with respect to the island from June 1850 for a century or more. In 1953 the Acting Secretary of the State of Johor had stated that Johor did not claim ownership of Pedra Branca. All visits made to the island had been with Singapore's express permission, and maps published by Malaysia in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that it recognised Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca.|$|E
