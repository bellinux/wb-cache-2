25|$|Vegetable growers {{sometimes}} grow mustard as a <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> Its {{main purpose}} is {{to act as a}} mulch, covering the soil to suppress weeds between crops. If grown as a <b>green</b> <b>manure,</b> the mustard plants are cut down at the base when sufficiently grown, and left to wither on the surface, continuing to act as a mulch until the next crop is due for sowing, when the mustard is dug in. In the UK, mustard sown in summer and autumn is cut down starting in October. April sowings can be cut down in June, keeping the ground clear for summer-sown crops. One of the disadvantages of using mustard as a <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> is its propensity to harbor club root.|$|E

The <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> legumes were field pea (Pisum sativum L.), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) N fertilization ranged from 0 to 360 kg ha- 1. On a three-year average, field pea (3 065 kg ha- 1) and common vetch (2 647 kg ha- 1) consistently had higher aboveground dry matter yields than faba bean (1307 kg ha- 1). Field pea and common vetch had N contents of 68. 7 and 54. 0 kg ha- 1, respectively, in aboveground dry matter in the spring.

25|$|Alfalfa , Medicago sativa {{also called}} lucerne, is a {{perennial}} flowering {{plant in the}} pea family Fabaceae cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, {{as well as a}} <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and cover crop. The name alfalfa is used in North America. The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 10–20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Poland {{was largely}} an agrarian society {{throughout}} the Middle Ages {{and into the}} 19th century. Polish farmers were mostly peasants, ruled by Polish nobility that owned their land and restricted their political and economic freedoms. Peasants were disallowed from trading, and typically would have to sell their livestock to the nobility, who in turn would function as middlemen in economic life. Commercial farming did not exist, and frequent uprisings by the peasants were suppressed harshly, both by the nobility and the foreign powers occupying Poland. A number of agricultural reforms were introduced in the mid-19th century to Poland, first in German Poland, and later eastern parts of the country. The agricultural technologies originated in Britain and were carried eastward by conversing traders and merchants; Poland gained these secrets in the most developed regions first, and through successful implementation, areas that adopted them boomed. The introduction of a four-crop rotation system tripled the output of Poland's farmlands and created a surplus of agricultural labor in Poland. Prior to this, polish peasants continued Medieval Era practice of three field rotation, losing one year of productive growing time to replenish soil nutrients. Instead of leaving a field fallow, or without any plants for a season, the introduction of turnips and especially red clover allowed Polish fields to maximize nutrients by <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> Red clover was especially popular because it fed cattle as grazing land, giving the extra benefit of more robust livestock raising in Poland.|$|E

40|$|Earthworms {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} soil macrofaunal groups, and they play a major role in agricultural ecosystems. Agricultural practices, such as reduced tillage, the use of <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> and organic fertilization, can be beneficial for earthworm populations in agricultural systems. However, under a Mediterranean climate, not much is known regarding their response to agricultural management. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of tillage type, organic fertilization, and <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> on the density and biomass of earthworms in organic arable dryland. The trial was conducted in a four-year crop rotation with a complete factorial design that combined tillage system (mouldboard ploughing vs. chisel), fertilization (composted farmyard manure vs. no fertilizer) and <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> (<b>green</b> <b>manures</b> vs. no <b>green</b> <b>manures).</b> Earthworms were assessed in each plot by the extraction of all individuals in three soil areas of 33 cm× 33 cm that were excavated to a depth of 25 cm. Only five earthworm species were found in this trial, and the earthworm community was dominated by such endogeic ecotypes as Aporrectodea rosea and Allolobophora georgii, and the anecic ecotype Aporrectodea trapezoides. Endogeic species can benefit from soil inversion because of the incorporation of organic matter, but the anecic ones can be negatively affected by it. The results show that plots with farmyard manure had higher density and biomass of earthworms. We observed that the type of tillage significantly affected earthworm populations: plots that had been ploughed with mouldboard ploughing (soil inversion) the year prior to sampling presented more juveniles. The biomass of earthworms was significantly lower in plots with <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> and chiselling. Our results indicated that the combination of chiselling and <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> were not optimal for earthworm populations, but organic fertilization played a considerably more important role and enhanced their abundances...|$|R
