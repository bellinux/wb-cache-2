5|$|In June 1841, {{with the}} help of {{influential}} supporters (among them was Domingo Róxas), Pule again {{sent a letter to the}} Real Audiencia requesting for the cofradía to be recognized. This letter was forwarded to the office of Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri. The Governor-General himself personally reviewed the petition and was disturbed by the cofradías rule which excluded Spaniards and mestizos from joining without Pule's permission. This made De Oraá believe that it was a seditious organization where religion was used as a blind for potential <b>insurgence</b> against Spanish authorities. De Oraá then recommended Pule's dismissal from San Juan de Dios Hospital and had the cofradía outlawed in July 1841, ordering its disbandment and the arrests of its members. Pule immediately went into hiding to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} event {{of his tenure}} in Salisbury occurred very late in his life when Major Robert Pike, a layman and very prominent member of his church, collided with him {{during the winter of}} 1675 to 1676. There may have been multiple reasons for the severe friction between the men, one of them being that Wheelwright was against the Quaker <b>insurgence</b> into New England, whereas Pike was much more tolerant of their evangelism. Another reason may have been that during the election of 1637, Pike traveled all the way from Newbury to Newtown to vote Governor Vane out of office. A more recent and local cause of dissension was likely over the division of Salisbury when the town of Amesbury was created from it several years earlier. Pike had made certain claims of Wheelwright, to which Wheelwright wrote a petition to the court, and on 10 March 1676 the court sided with Wheelwright. Not easily rebuked, Pike enlisted support from other members of the church and town, following which Wheelwright called for intervention by civil authorities.|$|E
5|$|The prequel Birth by Sleep {{introduces}} Terra as {{an apprentice}} Keyblade wielder who trains alongside Aqua and Ventus at the Land of Departure. Early in the game, Terra is denied the rank of Keyblade Master when his mentor, Master Eraqus, detects a strong presence of darkness in his heart. Disheartened, Terra is {{given a chance to}} redeem his failure when dispatched to eliminate an <b>insurgence</b> of dark creatures called the Unversed in neighboring worlds. Periodically, the vagabond Master Xehanort appeals to Terra to channel the power of darkness freely, creating a schism between him and his friends as they grow troubled by his actions. This eventually leads Terra to clash with Eraqus when he finds his master inexplicably attacking Ventus, which ends with Xehanort vanquishing the weakened Eraqus. Terra, realizing the entire conflict was engineered to stimulate his inner darkness, confronts Xehanort at the Keyblade Graveyard and succumbs to rage, allowing Xehanort to take over his body to prolong his own life. Terra's disembodied mind inhabits his discarded armor and becomes the Lingering Will, which remains in the Keyblade Graveyard after defeating Xehanort. The game's secret ending shows Terra's heart continuing to resist Xehanort, who still possesses his body after losing his memories in a final battle against Aqua.|$|E

This study therefore, examines the everyday problem of <b>insurgences</b> and displacement in Nigeria. It examines these in Adamawa, Bornu and Yobe states. Of 678, 713 IDPs officially registered in these states as at the year 2014, findings showed that female accounted for 68. 0 % while the proportions of children and aged were 48. 0 % and 32. 0 % respectively. The proportion of IDPs whose spouse {{died as a result}} of <b>insurgences</b> was 37. 0 %. While 8. 0 % of the children lost both parent, findings showed that 78 % lost their source of income to <b>insurgences.</b> Findings showed that Boko Haram’s brutality remained the significant cause of displacement in the study area. Nonetheless, inter-communal, religion conflicts, forced eviction and natural disasters have also caused some displacements. Internal displacement crises remain serious issue in Nigeria that, given the sheer scale of the present disasters, has fundamental implications for the future well-being of Sub-Saharan Africa.

500|$|The Diocese of Moray was a {{regional}} bishopric [...] unlike the pre-eminent see of the Scottish church, St Andrews, which had {{evolved from a}} more ancient monastic Celtic church and administered scattered localities. It is uncertain whether there were bishops of Moray before c. 1120 [...] but the first known prelate—possibly later translated to Dunkeld—was Gregory (or Gregoir) and was probably bishop in name only. Gregory was a signatory to the foundation charter of Scone Priory, issued by Alexander I (Alaxandair mac Maíl Choluim) between December 1123 and April 1124, and again in a charter defining the legal rights of the same monastery. He is recorded {{for the last time}} when he witnessed a charter granted by David I to Dunfermline Abbey in c. 1128. These actions are all that is known of Gregory with no basis for later assertions that he was a promoted monk in a 'Pictish Church'. After the suppression of Óengus of Moray's rebellion in 1130, King David must have regarded the continued existence of a bishopric in Moray as essential to the stability of the province. Yet the next bishop was the absentee titular bishop William (11521162), King David's chaplain who had probably been an aid since 1136 and had likely done little to improve the stability of the see by the time he died in 1162. [...] Felix was the next bishop and is thought to have been prelate from 1166 to 1171 although no accurate dates are knowndetails of his tenure are almost unknown with only one appearance as a witness in a charter of William the Lion at his court held in Elgin.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks {{take advantage of the}} current situation and primarily aim at destabilizing or severely limiting usability of infrastructure to the end-users in part or whole. A typical DDoS incursion exploiting heterogeneous base of personal computers consists of two phases: insertion of predefined set of instructions into the host systems via either self-propagating or non-reproducing malware and simultaneous execution of repeating queries to a destination unit. Generally targeted and deployed to impede functionality of a single or multiple servers with similar properties and utilizing substantial resources with little to no discernible selection criteria, DDoSes poses a significant threat. Moreover, effective and efficient countermeasures require experience, precision, speed, operational awareness, appropriate security protocols summarizing and alleviating potential consequences in case of failure to contain as well as proactive detection algorithms in place. Global response instruments (batch filtering, temporary IP address blacklisting) are only suitable for SYN floods, whereas during GET DDoS the same tools can't be used due to presence of legitimate incoming requests.

40|$|The cloth-dyers of West Africa {{are known}} to produce indigo {{textiles}} which reputation needs no making. These various productions, often times centuries old, have been continuously exposed to the turmoil {{of a variety of}} external events which have often made them very fragile or, on the other hand, have brought about prosperity. Among those events, let us cite the caravan trade across the Sahara and the Sahel, the establishment of trading posts by the Europeans on the Atlantic Coast, the Senegal River and the Niger, the slave trade, the development of small indigo factories, colonization by the English, the French and the Portuguese, the chemical and industrial revolutions, local and regional politics, world conflicts, the 1929 economic crash, independences, climate changes, development programs and technical assistance, fashion globalization, terrorism, tourism, international fairs, etc. While, in some areas, indigo dyeing has simply vanished and {{is no more than a}} cherished memory which the elderly women talk about while preserving carefully old indigo wrappers for special occasions, in other areas indigo cloth-dyeing seems to be prospering since the late 1980 s, due to a renewed interest in the Western world for natural products (locally grown organic cotton, natural dyes, handmade crafts) and, an appeal for “ethnic” products which has prompted a revival of the “traditional” indigo dyeing craft in West Africa. Textile and fashion designers, NGOs and private businesses have been instrumental in promoting the all-natural process. They have diversified the indigo textile production to meet Western tastes and high level standards: the motifs and decors of indigo wrappers are now offered in a range of linen, upholstery fabrics, curtains, western style clothes, etc. The demand for this type of production has allowed the resurgence of a “tradition” in indigo cloth-dyeing, saving it from disappearance, and has created some employment. However, the overall impact, so far, remains limited to a few areas. At the same time, early this XXI century, two major series of events have had a negative impact on the production of indigo textiles in West Africa, i. e. the economic penetration of the market of African textiles by China and, the wave of terror and <b>insurgences</b> led by Boko Haram in Northern Nigeria. The Chinese manufacture synthetic textiles reproducing a variety of traditional wrappers, including indigo wrappers. These counterfeit wrappers are put for sale in the region where they are usually produced, directly competing with the local cloth-dyers. Despite the low quality of these synthetic wrappers, many customers prefer to spend less than go for the more expensive locally produced cotton wrappers. As a result, indigo cloth-dyers have seen their sales decelerate and while some are struggling to stay in business, others have already given up. For the last few years, Northern Nigeria has been off limit to tourists and buyers who purchased the famous Hausa indigo cloth from Kano, a town re-known for centuries in all of West Africa for its indigo production. In addition, Nigeria’s government policies regarding import of textiles have put local production at a disadvantage. As a result, sales have gone way down and many Kano cloth-dyers have had to leave their ground pits and find another occupation. But, let us now focus on the productions of two specific types of women garments, the Fouta-Djallon wrapper and the melhafa from Mauritania and see how they have evolved since the XIX century.
