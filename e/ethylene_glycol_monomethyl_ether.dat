The mechanisms behind sulfur mustard’s effect on endothelial cells are still being studied, but recent studies have shown that high levels of exposure can induce high rates of both necrosis and apoptosis. In vitro tests have shown that at low concentrations of sulfur mustard, where apoptosis is the predominant result of exposure, pretreatment with 50 mM N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) was able to decrease the rate of apoptosis. NAC protects actin filaments from reorganization by sulfur mustard, demonstrating that actin filaments play a large role in the severe burns observed in victims.|$|E

In recent years, some studies tried successfully to introduce one ether group or more into biodiesel molecules to further reduce smoke emissions, and a novel biodiesel synthesized via the transesterification of fatty acids methyl esters with short chain glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether palm oil monoester (Jiang and Yun 2012), ethylene glycol n-propyl ether palm oil monoester (Gao et al. 2011), ethylene glycol monoethyl ether soybean oil monoester (Zhang et al. 2006), and <b>ethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> palm oil monoester (Jiang et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2015 a) et al. have been developed. Compared with the traditional biodiesel, novel biodiesel with higher oxygen content for introducing an ether group can effectively improve the combustion and emission performance (Guo et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2015 b; Chen et al. 2014 a). At present, novel biodiesel is mainly prepared by homogeneous base catalyst, such as sodium alcoholate (Zhang et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2015 c) and KOH (Li et al. 2012; Jiang 2012). The usage of homogeneous catalysts produced large amounts of caustic wastewater giving rise to serious environmental pollution and post-processing was complex (Deshmane and Adewuyi 2013).

40|$|Self-assembled thermoresponsive {{polymers}} in {{aqueous solution}} have great potential as smart, switchable materials for use in biomedical applications. In recent years, attention has turned to the reversibility of these polymers’ thermal transitions, {{which has led to}} debate over what factors influence discrepancies in the transition temperature when heating the system compared to the temperature obtained when cooling the system, known as the thermal hysteresis. Herein, we synthesize micelles with tunable aggregation numbers (Nagg) whose cores contain poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (p(nBA-co-DMA)) and four different thermoresponsive corona blocks, namely poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (pDEAm), poly(diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> methacrylate) (pDEGMA) and poly(oligo(ethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> methacrylate) (pOEGMA). By studying their thermoresponsive behavior, we elucidate the effects of changing numerous important characteristics both in the thermoresponsive chain chemistry and architecture, and in the structure of their self-assemblies. Our findings demonstrate large deviations in the reversibility between the self-assemblies and the corresponding thermoresponsive homopolymers; specifically we find that micelles whose corona consist of polymers with a brush-like architecture (pDEGMA and pOEGMA) exhibit irreversible phase transitions at a critical chain density. These results lead to a deeper understanding of stimuli-responsive self-assemblies and demonstrate the potential of tunable Nagg micelles for uncovering structure–property relationships in responsive polymer systems. ...|$|R

40|$|With a hyperbranched poly(amidoamine) {{core and}} many {{water-soluble}} poly(ethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> arms connected by pH-sensitive acylhydrazone bonds, multiarm hyperbranched polymer {{was used as}} nanoreactor and reductant to prepare metal nanoparticles endowed with intelligence and biocompatibility. The multiarm hyperbranched polymer encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) showed excellent catalytic activity for hydrogenation, thus an excellent catalyst system for hydrogenation was established. The rate constants could reach as high as 3. 48 L·s− 1 ·m− 2, which {{can be attributed to}} the lack of surface passivation afforded by the multiarm hyperbranched polymer...|$|R
