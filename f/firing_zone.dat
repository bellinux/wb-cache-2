50|$|The Type 99 is {{a smooth}} bore, muzzle-loading weapon of the Stokes-Brandt type. The Type 99 81 mm mortar {{differs from the}} Type 97 81 mm {{infantry}} mortar in the shortness of its tube, which is only 21.75 inches as compared with 45.34 inches of the Type 97. The mortar can be disassembled into three units: the tube, the bipod, and the base plate. The legs of the bipod, made of tubular steel, are mounted on the elevating screw housing by a clevis joint. They terminate in thin steel plates which have single-pointed spikes on the underside. The spread of the legs is limited by a chain which has a spring attached to one end to relieve the shock of firing. A buffer system incorporated in the bipod gives a recuperation of 2 inches. The recoil cylinders are filled with light grease or heavy oil. The base plate, made of pressed steel, has a series of ribs and braces welded on the underside {{to allow it to}} dig into the ground when the piece is fired. On the top side of the plate, in the center, is a circular depression into which the base-cap knob fits when the mortar is mounted in firing position. A carrying handle is attached to the rear edge of the plate. Also, two small hooks are welded to the rear edge to permit the attachment of a carrying strap. Around {{the outer edge of the}} plate is a one-inch ridge, and on the lower front edge a hook is attached through which a small rod can be thrust and used for slight changes in base plate alignment. A stability test of the Type 99 mortar, in which a total of 14 rounds were fired, produced no visible evidence of cracking or deformation of either base plate or bipod. The plate sank about 2 inches into the ground with the firing of seven rounds at alternate elevations of 45 to 75 degrees. Stability was very satisfactory when <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> charges I to IV, but zones V to VI produced noticeable hop of the mortar and a sinking of the base plate. The reported range of the weapon of about 2,200 yards has not been conclusively confirmed.|$|E

Therefore, on the one hand, the paper simulates the composite ceramic materials based on cellular automata (CA) to optimize the ratio of two formulations. On the other hand, in order to optimize sintering process, CA modeling is also carried out for the sintering process of composite ceramics. Finally, in order to detect the temperature of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln by using the characteristics of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone,</b> the K-means clustering method is used for the color segmentation of the flame image of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the ceramic kiln. The experimental results show that the size of the grains is in accordance with the actual situation of the simulation and the microstructure evolution of the composites can be simulated well by using the CA theory to simulate the composites; with the increase of simulation time, the grain size distribution is basically unchanged, which accords with the normal distribution, and the simulation process of grain growth is very stable. Based on the K-mean clustering segmentation method, the segmentation of the flame image of ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> is realized. This method also provides a good technical means for feature extraction of flame image in ceramic kiln <b>firing</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of a project which aim is to develop a process {{integration}} model for the Swedish iron ore company LKAB's production system in Malmberget. Within the facility, there are two pelletising plants which were started up 1973 and 2006, respectively. Both pelletising plants are using the straight grate induration furnace, and they are the most energy intense process units within the facility. Basically a straight grate induration furnace consists of three different zones, i. e. a drying zone, a <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> and a cooling zone, and their purpose is to upgrade crude iron ore to the final product of iron ore pellet. As an initial step of the project, the mass and energy flows within a straight grate induration furnace have been analysed.

40|$|Nonuniform {{temperature}} fields in steam cracking furnaces caused by geometry {{factors such as}} burner positions, shadow effects, and asymmetry of the reactor coil layout are detrimental for product yields and run lengths. The techniques of adjusting burner <b>firing</b> (<b>zone</b> firing) and feedstock mass flow rate (pass balancing) have been practiced industrially to mitigate these effects but could only reduce the nonuniformities between the so-called modules (a group of many coils). An extension of the pass balancing methodology is presented to further minimize the intra-module nonuniformities, that is, variation between the coils within a module, in floor fired furnaces. Coupled furnace-reactor computational fluid dynamics-based simulations of an industrial ultraselective conversion (USC) furnace were performed to evaluate four different feedstock flow distribution schemes, realizing equal values for coil outlet temperature, propene/ethene mass ratio, maximum coking rate and maximum tube metal temperature (TMT), respectively, over all the reactor coils. It is shown that feedstock flow distribution creates a larger operating window and extends the run length. Out of the four cases, the coking rate as criterion leads to the highest yearly production capacity for ethene and propene. Uniform maximum coking rates boost the annual production capacity of the USC furnace with a nameplate ethene capacity of 130 103 metric tons per year with 1000 metric tons for ethene and 730 metric tons for propene. For industrial application, achieving uniform maximum TMT is more practical due to its measurability by advanced laser-based techniques. Most steam cracking furnaces can be retrofitted by optimizing the dimensions of venturi nozzles that regulate the feedstock flow to the coils.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} heat {{transfer}} in a lift-off furnace which is employed in the batch annealing of a stack of coils of steel strip. The objective of the project is to investigate the various factors which govern the furnace design and the heat transfer resistances, so as to reduce {{the time of the}} annealing cycle, and hence minimize the operating costs. The work involved mathematical modelling of patterns of gas flow and modes of heat transfer. These models are: Heat conduction and its conjectures in the steel coils;Convective heat transfer in the plates separating the coils in the stack and {{in other parts of the}} furnace; and Radiative and convective heat transfer in the furnace by using the long furnace model. An important part of the project is the development of numerical methods and computations to solve the transient models. A limited number of temperature measurements was available from experiments on a test coil in an industrial furnace. The mathematical model agreed well with these data. The model has been used to show the following characteristics of annealing furnaces, and to suggest further developments which would lead to significant savings: - The location of the limiting temperature in a coil is nearer to the hollow core than to the outer periphery. - Thermal expansion of the steel tends to open the coils, reduces their thermal conductivity in the radial direction, and hence prolongs the annealing cycle. Increasing the tension in the coils and/or heating from the core would overcome this heat transfer resistance. - The shape and dimensions of the convective channels in the plates have significant effect on heat convection in the stack. An optimal design of a channel is shown to be of a width-to-height ratio equal to 9. - Increasing the cooling rate, by using a fluidized bed instead of the normal shell and tube exchanger, would shorten the cooling time by about 15 %, but increase the temperature differential in the stack. - For a specific charge weight, a stack of different-sized coils will have a shorter annealing cycle than one of equally-sized coils, provided that production constraints allow the stacking order to be optimal. - Recycle of hot flue gases to the <b>firing</b> <b>zone</b> of the furnace would produce a. decrease in the thermal efficiency up to 30 % but decreases the heating time by about 26 %...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{history of}} civilization is {{concurrent}} {{to the use}} of brick and its manufacturing. Brick kiln is the most important component in the manufacturing of clay-burnt bricks. Poorly operated brick kilns are considered as the major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission nowadays. Various types of brick kilns are in operation throughout the world. Tunnel kiln is the most widely used technology in developed countries as it is highly automated. Other technologies which are quite popular in developing countries are: Hoffman kiln, Vertical Shaft kiln, Fixed Chimney kiln, Zigzag kiln, etc. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, ANSYS CFX is being applied to evaluate performance of Tunnel kiln using natural gas as its fuel. The idea of a typical Tunnel kiln layout geometry has been envisaged from local brick industries. The length, width and height of the Tunnel kiln geometry are taken as 100 m × 3. 24 m × 1. 48 m. The length and width of the brick stack is taken as 920 mm × 440 mm. With a gap of 400 mm and 100 mm between two brick stacks longitudinally and laterally respectively, a total of 450 (6 × 75) stacks can be accommodated inside the kiln at a time. Brick stack height including the kiln car height is taken as 1. 38 m. There is a clearance of 100 mm between the stack and the kiln roof. To produce certain quality bricks/ceramics, a particular temperature distribution throughout the kiln needs to be maintained. This temperature distribution with respect to the kiln length is known as Tunnel kiln curve. To achieve the Tunnel kiln curve obtained from industry for ordinary brick type, some design parameters need to be optimized for a given geometry.  Selection of these optimized design parameters are obtained through a series of trial and error runs of the CFD model. The total length of the tunnel can be divided into pre-heating, firing and cooling zones. Green bricks pass through the pre-heating, then firing and finally the cooling zones, while fresh air flows in opposite direction of the brick stack move. It is to be noted that brick industries are very reluctant to disclose any of those technical secrets related to their brick kiln design. In this regard, this design is based on initial guesses of those parameters and slowly come up with best performing scenario with respect to considered Tunnel kiln curve. To achieve the Tunnel kiln curve, the design parameters that need to be played around are gas and air flow rates, flow directions, their inlet-outlet number, spacing and placements at different locations of the kiln are considered very crucial. Other important parameters that are varied include brick stack placement with respect to air and gas inlet-outlets, gaps between iv kiln roof and stacks and gaps between two consecutive stacks. To supply adequate air, a large rectangular air inlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed at the roof of the exit end of the kiln. To maintain the air temperature distribution as given in Tunnel kiln curve, one intermediate size air outlet with an area of 0. 4 m 2 and a series of 13 rows × 12 columns small air inlet-outlets (openings) are also placed at the roof of the kiln in the cooling zone. All these heated air has been transferred to dryer to dry the green bricks. A series of 12 rows × 12 columns of gas inlets are placed in the roof of the <b>firing</b> <b>zone.</b> At the entry end of the tunnel, a flue gas outlet with an area of 0. 8 m 2 is placed in the roof.  Due to three dimensional nature of the kiln geometry, the CFD simulation of the whole system would be very time consuming. A close look of the geometry dictates that, a one-sixth slit of the total geometry (100 m × 3. 24   61 × m) containing 1 row × 75 stacks of bricks is enough to simulate the whole geometry of the kiln. This modelled geometry is meshed and mesh independency is checked using ANSYS Mesh. Turbulence, combustion and radiation models are adopted to simulate a realistic Tunnel kiln environment using ANSYS CFX Pre.  Several model runs are performed until the simulated temperature distributions obtained closely replicate the Tunnel kiln curve of the industry. From these simulations, the optimum Tunnel kiln design is suggested. The resulting CO 2 and NO emissions are also obtained from these simulations. Gas inlet velocity is proposed to be 6 m/s with an inlet diameter of 25 mm.  Gas velocity direction is suggested to be normal to the kiln roof. Air flow direction should be at 14 o with kiln roof towards <b>firing</b> <b>zone.</b> Gaps between brick stacks and the kiln roof should be about 200 mm. To get a uniform distribution of heated gases, positions of the brick stacks are such that on each occasion of its changed position it would be just directly below the inlet jets. Gaps between two consecutive brick stacks should also be reduced to 200 mm instead of the initially assumed 400 mm spacing. Hence additional number of bricks could be accommodated inside the kiln at a time which will result higher production of bricks with the same amount of fuel...|$|E
