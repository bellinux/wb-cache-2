40|$|This paper aims at {{recognizing}} spatial differentiation in {{probability of}} <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> occurrence {{with reference to}} atmospheric circulation, using regional classification of circulation types for Poland. Daily maximum air temperatures measured at nine meteorological stations were used to recognize the <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> occurrence in the period from January 1951 to March 2014. The relations between the <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> occurrence and atmospheric circulation were analysed using catalogues of circulation types compiled for nine grid boxes within Poland. Linkage between the frequency of <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> and atmospheric circulation was recognized {{in the period of}} January 2001 - March 2014. A decreasing tendency in the frequency of the occurrence of winter <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> was found. The occurrence of <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> in Poland is clearly related to atmospheric circulation. In the entire area of Poland their occurrence is favoured by eastern and south-eastern advection of air during anticyclonic conditions (types Ea nad SEa).

50|$|Minimum {{temperatures}} {{during spring}} do not typically stay above freezing {{until well into}} June, although the average last spring <b>ice</b> <b>day</b> date is April 1 and the first fall <b>ice</b> <b>day</b> November 1. Low winter precipitation limits both snowfall and snow depth: the annual mean fall is 42.3 in, and the mean peak snow cover 11 in, with the most {{snow on the ground}} being 32 in on January 2, 1943. Snow cover is usually gone by the end of March, and despite occasional light snowfalls in May, snow on the ground in that month has not been recorded since 1953. Precipitation is heaviest during the spring, but the enclosed valley location means most moisture is always captured before reaching Wisdom: the wettest month since records began in 1923 has been May 1981 with 4.32 in, whilst the wettest calendar year has been 1967 with 15.74 in and the driest 1974 when only 5.60 in fell.|$|E

40|$|Much {{attention}} {{has recently been}} paid to the impact of climate change at the Tibetan Plateau. This remote and harsh region includes a large system of endorheic (closed basin) lakes. Ice phenology i. e. the timing of freeze-up and break-up and the duration of the ice cover may provide valuable information about climate variations in this region. The ice phenology of 59 large lakes on the Tibetan Plateau was derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8 -day composite data for the period from 2001 to 2010. Duration of the ice cover appears to have a high variability in the studied region due to both climate and local factors. Mean values for the duration of ice cover were calculated for four groups of lakes defined as distinct geographic regions. In each group several lakes showed anomalies in ice cover duration in the studied period. Possible reasons for such anomalous behavior are discussed. Furthermore, many lakes do not freeze up completely during some seasons. This was confirmed by inspection of high resolution optical data. Mild winter seasons, large water volume and/or high salinity are the most likely explanations. Trends in the ice cover duration derived by linear regression for all the studied lakes show a high variation in space. A correlation of ice phenology variables with parameters describing climatic and local conditions showed a high thermal dependency of the ice regime. It appears that the freeze onset and water clean of <b>ice</b> <b>day</b> appear to be more thermally determined than freeze-up and break-up dates in case of the studied lakes...|$|E

40|$|In-cloud icing can impose safety {{concerns}} and economic challenges for various industries. Icing climate representations proved beneficial for optimal designs and careful planning. The current study investigates in-cloud icing, its related cloud microphysics and introduces a 15 -year time period climatology of icing events. The model was initially driven by reanalysis data from North American Regional Reanalysis and downscaled through a two-level nesting of 10. km and 5. km, using a limited-area {{version of the}} Global Environment Multiscale Model of the Canadian Meteorological Center. In addition, a hybrid approach is used to reduce time consuming calculations. The simulation realized exclusively on significant <b>icing</b> <b>days,</b> was combined with non-significant <b>icing</b> <b>days</b> as represented by data from NARR. A proof of concept is presented here for a 1000. km area around Gaspé during January for those 15. years. An {{increase in the number}} and intensity of icing events has been identified during the last 15 years. From GEM-LAM simulations and within the atmospheric layer between 10 m and 200 m AGL, supercooled liquid water contents indicated a maximum of 0. 4 gm- 3, and 50 % of the values are less than 0. 05 gm- 3. All values of median volume diameters (MVD) are approximately capped by 70 μm and the typical values are around 15 μm. Supercooled Large Droplets represent approximately 5 %. The vertical profile of icing climatology demonstrates a steady duration of icing events until the level of 60 m. The altitudes of 60 m and 100 m indicate substantial icing intensification toward higher elevations. GEM-LAM demonstrated a substantial improvement in the calculation of in-cloud icing, reducing significantly the challenge posed by complex terrains...|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} {{climate model}} RegCM 3 {{is used to}} investigate potential future changes of temperature indices in Poland for the period 2011 – 2030. The model is forced by ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM GCM data from World Data Centre (WDCC) database for the 1971 – 1990 reference period and 2011 – 2030 projection period under SRES B 1, A 1 B and A 2 emission scenarios. Model output statistics methods are used to transform simulated minimum and maximum temperature data into realistic data. Selected indices of temperature extremes and their differences between the scenario simulations and the reference were calculated, for all scenarios, for the entire period and for each season. Results show a mean yearly {{increase in the number}} of summer and hot days and a decrease in the number of frost and <b>ice</b> <b>days.</b> Highest decline in the number of frost and <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> in autumn and an increase in spring is noticed. An highest {{increase in the number of}} summer and hot days is seen in summer.

40|$|Cold {{temperature}} and associated extremes often impact adversely {{human health and}} environment and bring disruptions in economic activities during winter over Canada. This study investigates projected changes in winter (December to March) period cold extreme days (i. e., cold nights, cold days, frost <b>days,</b> and <b>ice</b> <b>days)</b> and cold spells over Canada based on 11 regional climate model (RCM) simulations for the future 20402 ̆ 0132069 period {{with respect to the}} current 19702 ̆ 0131999 period. These simulations, available from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program, were obtained with six different RCMs, when driven by four different Atmosphere 2 ̆ 013 Ocean General Circulation Models, under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A 2 scenario. Based on the reanalysis boundary conditions, the RCM simulations reproduce spatial patterns of observed mean values of the daily minimum and maximum temperatures and inter-annual variability of the number of cold nights over different Canadian climatic regions considered in the study. A comparison of current and future period simulations suggests decreases in the frequency of cold extreme events (i. e., cold nights, cold days and cold spells) and in selected return levels of maximum duration of cold spells over the entire study domain. Important regional differences are noticed as the simulations generally indicate smaller decreases in the characteristics of extreme cold events over western Canada compared to the other regions. The analysis also suggests an increase in the frequency of midwinter freeze 2 ̆ 013 thaw events, due mainly to a {{decrease in the number of}} frost <b>days</b> and <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> for all Canadian regions. Especially, densely populated southern and coastal Canadian regions will require in depth studies to facilitate appropriate adaptation strategies as these regions are clearly expected to experience large increases in the frequency of freeze 2 ̆ 013 thaw events.
