He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but {{did not have to}} depend upon its products.|$|E

However, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that her campaign ignored earlier private warnings about Hsu and that Clinton was the largest recipient of bundled donations from Hsu.|$|E

5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> that David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the idea of the individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{visit to}} the Peloponnese in 1862 a new coup was {{launched}} and this time a Provisional Government was set up and summoned a National Convention. Ambassadors of the Great Powers urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to Bavaria aboard (the same way they had come to Greece) taking with them the Greek royal regalia which they had brought from Bavaria in 1832. It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, then the King would not have been overthrown, as succession was also a major unresolved question at the time. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true,</b> however, that the Constitution of 1843 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.|$|E
5|$|The A4 {{motorway}} is {{a significant}} northsouth motorway in the northern Croatia connecting the nation's capital, Zagreb, to the Hungarian M7 motorway at the Goričan border crossing The southern terminus of the A4 motorway at the interchange in Ivanja Reka represents its junction {{with the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network via the A3 motorway. As a part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is a part of European route E65 and European route E71. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of the development of its economy, notably tourism, as it represents the shortest and the most comfortable route between Budapest, Hungary and the Adriatic Sea. This particularly applies to tourist resorts on the Istria and Kvarner Gulf islands and to the Port of Rijeka, but it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> for resorts in the Dalmatia region, served via the A1 motorway. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node. This expansion is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka's cargo handling capacity, improved railroad links and a new Rijeka bypass motorway linking the A6, via a new interchange, to the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. The project is, among other goals, aimed to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan-European corridor Vb, of which the A4 motorway is a part.|$|E
