5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the <b>Inflator</b> room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E

25|$|Most divers {{prefer to}} be more {{negative}} for ice diving than in open water like in most overhead environments, and ability to disconnect the low pressure <b>inflator</b> on a BCD or drysuit is a critical skill.|$|E
50|$|On May 4, 2016, the NHTSA {{announced}} recall {{campaigns of}} an additional estimated 35-40 million <b>inflators,</b> adding to the already 28.8 million <b>inflators</b> previously recalled.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{used in some}} <b>inflators</b> {{contains}} butane {{which is}} flammable and which may explode if exposed to high temperatures (either when in the can or in a re-inflated tire). Other <b>inflators</b> use a non-flammable formulation instead.|$|R
50|$|One {{model of}} airbags {{made by the}} Takata Corporation used {{ammonium}} nitrate-based gas generating compositions in airbag <b>inflators</b> instead of the more stable, but more expensive compound Tetrazole. The ammonium nitrate-based <b>inflators</b> have a flaw where old <b>inflators</b> with long-term exposure to hot and humid climate conditions could rupture during deployment, projecting metal shards though the airbag and into the driver. The defect caused seven deaths and over 100 injuries in the U.S., and one death in Malaysia. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recalled over 33 million vehicles in May 2015, and fined Takata $70 million in November 2015. Toyota, Mazda and Honda {{have said that they}} will not use ammonium nitrate <b>inflators.</b>|$|R
25|$|Most <b>inflator</b> {{problems}} can be avoided by keeping gear maintained and dry before the dive, using a low flow rate for inflation and avoiding long bursts, and having warm water at the dive site to thaw gear since ambient air temperature is usually well below freezing and this usually causes BCD issues before the dive.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of other}} {{emergency}} air {{sources such as}} octopus second stage, integrated DV/BC <b>inflator</b> units, bailout cylinders etc. also requires the learning of appropriate skills. These procedures are as complex as buddy breathing {{up to the point}} of sharing, and the fundamental difference is that the donor and recipient are not required to alternate breathing with a period when no air is available, which can be a big advantage. These alternatives to buddy breathing also require substantial learning and reinforcement to be reliable in a stressful situation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for the dry suit or BCD inflation valve to freeze while inflating, for similar reasons to regulator freeze. If this happens it can cause a runaway ascent {{if it is not}} dealt with immediately. If possible the low pressure <b>inflator</b> hose should be disconnected before it freezes onto the valve, while dumping air to control buoyancy. Excessive dumping of air may leave the diver too negative so it is preferable to have at least two controllable buoyancy systems, such as a dry suit and BCD, preferably supplied from different first stages. If the dry suit inflation valve freezes open it may allow water to leak into the suit once disconnected, so this usually results in aborting the dive.|$|E

25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for inflating buoyancy compensators and/or dry suits. These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically sealing valve which blocks flow if the hose is disconnected from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC <b>inflator</b> connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on dry suits.|$|E
500|$|The {{compressor}} {{was placed}} in Classic setting, to emulate the LA-2A leveling amplifier, and the Warmth button used to add harmonics. Oxford Dynamics {{was used for the}} bass in a different setting. Goldstein passed the final mix through the Oxford EQ and <b>Inflator</b> plug-ins. Pro Tools software was used to print the aux track into a 44.1kHz/24-bit CD and then into a 24-bit CD master. After the sessions for [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] ended, Hermansen said that [...] "everyone felt they had captured something special and that Beyoncé had done the track justice", but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play the song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal. [...] "But then it became the biggest urban record ... ever," [...] said.|$|E
500|$|MY09.5: {{upgrades}} affected models {{ordered from}} 21 October 2008 and produced from November. Instrument cluster illumination was commonised to white. The turn-by-turn navigation and Berlina V8 options were removed. Engine wise, the [...] "premium" [...] {{version of the}} Alloytec V6 was now fitted to the Omega and Berlina, bringing improved fuel consumption and a slight reduction in engine output (see above). A range of safety upgrades were also introduced (see above). Further MY09.5 changes were introduced in March 2009. The space-saver spare wheel were discontinued and replaced by two no-cost options: either a lightweight tyre <b>inflator</b> kit or a full-size spare wheel (previously an extra cost). Sportwagon variants of the Calais V and SS V receive an alloy spare wheel if the full-size spare is chosen, while {{the remainder of the}} line-up receives a steel wheel spare. March also signalled an opportunity for Holden to replace the dark-grey horizontal dashboard strip and steering wheel spokes as used on the SV6, SS and SS V to a matte silver type. The safety improvements made to the Omega sedan from October production onwards were also introduced for the Omega Sportwagon (see above), and the [...] "V-Series" [...] insignia used on SS V and Calais V models was removed, replaced by a single [...] "SS V" [...] or [...] "Calais V" [...] badge.|$|E

2500|$|Helium conducts heat {{six times}} faster than air, so helium-breathing divers often carry a {{separate}} supply of a different gas to inflate drysuits. This is to avoid the risk of hypothermia caused by using helium as <b>inflator</b> gas. Argon, carried in a small, separate tank connected only to the <b>inflator</b> of the drysuit, is preferred to air, since air conducts heat 50% faster than argon. Dry suits (if used together with a buoyancy compensator) still require a minimum of inflation to avoid [...] "squeezing", i.e. damage to skin caused by pressurizing dry suit folds.|$|E
2500|$|Development of space-suits in the 1960s {{led to the}} pressure-tight zipper, first {{manufactured}} by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956. The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral <b>inflator</b> and latex seals. This {{was followed by the}} Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure <b>inflator</b> valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. Overpressure valves were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced [...] through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits. Also in Sweden, Stig Insulán and Jorn Stubdal developed a vulcanised rubber drysuit, and Insulán patented the semi-automatic variable volume drysuit exhaust valve in 1971 which combined with the low pressure <b>inflator</b> valve gave the diver precise and trouble-free buoyancy control, in the variable volume dry suit.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the <b>inflator</b> valve to accept the alternative hose. [...] Both types of BCD and dry suit <b>inflator</b> hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} {{of the performance}} of restraint systems and airbag systems is becoming more important in the field of the safety technology. Tank tests are used in the automotive industry since decades as a method to estimate the mass flow from airbag <b>inflators.</b> The aim of this study in cooperation with AUDI AG is to apply a new mass flow determination method developed at Fraunhofer ICT (Institute for Chemical Technology) that should improve the accuracy of the measurements for special simulation scenarios. This brand new measurement system consists of two different experimental set ups and the cross-validation of the obtained results. The validation of the new method is carried out by integrating the mass flow curves of several airbag <b>inflators</b> obtained by this method and the mass flow curves of the same <b>inflators</b> obtained by the test tank method. The results revealed the suitability of the method, as well as an outstanding increase on the accuracy of the measurements when compared to those obtained by the test tank method...|$|R

2500|$|The {{vent valves}} of a BCD are more secure and have backups, often via the <b>inflator</b> hose, the left {{shoulder}} valve, the right shoulder valve {{and sometimes the}} bottom. [...] The dry suit has none, other than manipulating the neck and wrist seals, the wrist seals may not be available if wearing certain types of gloves.|$|E
2500|$|Neoprene {{dry suits}} are {{generally}} not as easy to put on and remove as are membrane dry suits, largely due to a closer fit which is possible due to the inherent elasticity of the material, and partly due to greater weight. As with wet suits, their buoyancy and thermal protection decreases with depth as the air bubbles in the neoprene are compressed. The air or other gas in the dry fabric undergarments providing insulation under a dry suit is also compressed, but can be restored to an effective volume by inflating the drysuit at depth through an <b>inflator</b> valve, thus preventing [...] "suit squeeze" [...] and compacting of the air-filled undersuit. Foam-neoprene tends to shrink {{over the years as}} it loses gas from the foam and slowly becomes less flexible as it ages.|$|E
2500|$|The US and Canadian {{version of}} the Chevrolet Cruze entered limited {{production}} at Lordstown, Ohio, in July 2010 as a 2011 model, replacing the Chevrolet Cobalt. Full production began September 8, 2010. For these markets, the Cruze utilizes a more advanced Watts Z-link rear suspension from the Opel Astra (J). Offered in LS, LT, LTZ, and Eco trim lines, both the 1.8-liter and the turbocharged 1.4-liter engines are offered, coupled with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. With a starting price slightly higher than most compact competitors, the base model Cruze LS is equipped with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine and comes with air-conditioning and power locks, the higher-level LT and LTZ models is fitted with the 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. For the Eco model, aerodynamic improvements have been made such as an electronically controlled air shutter that adjusts air flow to the engine depending on the temperature, wind speed and tow weight. To save weight, Chevrolet replaces the space saving spare tire and jack on the Eco model with a tire <b>inflator</b> kit, reducing weight by [...]|$|E

2500|$|On 17 January 2013 Cirrus Aircraft {{announced}} the fourth {{generation of the}} SR22 and SR22T (skipping G4 as a designation for the {{new version of the}} aircraft). Features included a [...] increase in the maximum takeoff weight, and some previous options—60/40 split back seat, ADS-B transponder, and Garmin GFC700 autopilot—became standard equipment. The wheel pants were redesigned and included an access door for the <b>inflator</b> valve. Cirrus improved the aircraft's ballistic parachute using a larger canopy to account for the higher takeoff weight, and a more powerful rocket. The rocket firing changed to a fail-safe electronic ignition, with a maximum operating speed of 140 knots (up from 133 knots). Earlier versions used a pyrotechnic rocket ignition system. Maximum flap speeds were increased to 150 knots (first notch); 110 knots (second notch); and added another 3.5 degrees of extension. Fuel burn slightly increased at cruise speeds, rate of climb was reduced, liftoff speed increased to 80 knots (from 72 knots), and stall speed increased to 60 knots (from 58 knots).|$|E
60|$|Duncan Dullamy, {{the great}} company <b>inflator,</b> showed no outward sign of displeasure. As {{a matter of}} fact, he was {{secretly}} relieved {{at the prospect of}} finding even a two-hundred-a-year husband for his daughter Leonore. A crisis was rapidly rushing upon him, from which he knew he would emerge with neither money nor credit; all his recent ventures had fallen flat, and flattest of all had gone the wonderful new breakfast food, Pipenta, on the advertisement of which he had sunk such huge sums. It could scarcely be called a drug in the market; people bought drugs, but no one bought Pipenta.|$|E
50|$|The {{corrugated}} hose of the <b>inflator</b> assembly should be {{long enough to}} easily dump air from the bladder and no longer, as this {{makes it difficult to}} streamline. The <b>inflator</b> mechanism must not be a high flow type. These use a non-standard connector, and can fill the wing dangerously quickly if the valve sticks open. It is easier to deal with a runaway inflation on a low flow rate <b>inflator.</b> A pull dump valve on the inflation manifold is an unnecessary additional point of failure.|$|E
