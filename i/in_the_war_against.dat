5|$|World WarII cost {{thousands}} of Australian lives and consumed {{a large portion}} of the national income. During the war, 27,073members of the Australian military were either killed, died of wounds or died while prisoners of war. Of these, 9,572 were killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Germany and Italy and 17,501 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Japan. Prisoners of war held by the Japanese made up nearly half of Australia's deaths in the Pacific. At least 386Australian civilian seamen were killed during the war. Total Australian war expenditure was £2,949,380,000 and at its peak in 1942–43, military costs accounted for 40.1percent of national income.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{successfully}} prosecuted his operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Paraguay, Inhaúma's {{leadership was}} encumbered by his hesitating and procrastinating behavior. While in command {{in the war}} zone, he became mentally exhausted and contracted an unknown disease. Seriously ill, Inhaúma returned to the national capital in early 1869 and died shortly thereafter. Although historical works have not given much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among the greatest of the Brazilian navy officers.|$|E
5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so was obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E

5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied {{to the side of}} King Henry VI.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{was born}} in the Stockholm Palace Tre Kronor in November 1655. His father, Charles X of Sweden, left Sweden in July to fight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Poland.

5|$|Development of the {{military}} settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans {{out of the city}} during the Great Turkish War. The chief commander of the Imperial army, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> the Ottomans. He urged the repair of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban's principles of military engineering.|$|E
5|$|In 1600 and 1601 Zamoyski {{took part}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Sweden {{commanding}} the Commonwealth forces in Livonia (Inflanty). At {{the same time}} he was a vocal opponent of that war on the political scene. In 1600 he recaptured several strongholds from the Swedes and a year later captured Wolmar on 19 December 1601 Fellin on 16 May 1602, and Bialy Kamien on 30 September 1602. The rigours of the campaign, however, placed a strain on his health, and he resigned the command.|$|E
5|$|In 2506, {{during the}} End War, the Daelaam {{under the command}} of Hierarch Artanis came to Cybros to reactivate the purifiers. Clolarion acted as their {{spokesman}} and leader during the mission, and ordered the Purifiers to engage the zerg on the station, and then purified the surface of Endion, the forest moon Cybros orbited. With the battle over, Artanis asked the purifiers to join the Daelaam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Amon. Clolarion questioned his sincerity and only accepted an alliance on the condition of Talandar being their ambassador.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{returned}} to Thessaly {{the next summer}} (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice {{if they wanted to}} avoid being conquered by Onomarchus' army. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} {{were born to}} a plebeian branch {{of the old and}} noble Sempronia family. Their father was the elderly Tiberius Gracchus the Elder (or Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus) who was tribune of the plebs, praetor, consul, and censor. Their mother was a patrician; Cornelia Africana daughter of Scipio Africanus himself considered a hero by the Roman populace for his part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Carthage. Their parents had 12 children, but only one daughter - who later married Scipio Aemilianus (Scipio Africanus the Younger) - and two sons, Tiberius and Gaius, survived childhood.|$|E

However, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy units and personnel continued to take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Germany and Italy. From 1942 until early 1944, Australian forces {{played a key role}} in the Pacific War, making up the majority of Allied strength throughout much of the fighting in the South West Pacific theatre. While the military was largely relegated to subsidiary fronts from mid-1944, it continued offensive operations against the Japanese until the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{foreign policy}} was largely defensive. The {{exception}} was the English occupation of Le Havre from October 1562 to June 1563, {{which ended in}} failure when Elizabeth's Huguenot allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for Calais, lost to France in January 1558. Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy. This paid off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> Spain, 80% of which was fought at sea. She knighted Francis Drake after his circumnavigation of the globe from 1577 to 1580, and he won fame for his raids on Spanish ports and fleets. An element of piracy and self-enrichment drove Elizabethan seafarers, over whom the queen had little control.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant gains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 {{formation of a}} multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across {{the north of the}} country.|$|E
