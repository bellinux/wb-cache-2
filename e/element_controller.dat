40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the {{investigation}} of fiber-optic interferometric sensor based on the array of fiber Bragg gratings. Reflection spectra displacement mechanism of the fiber Bragg gratings under the external temperature effects and the static pressure is described. The experiment has shown that reflection spectra displacement of Bragg gratings reduces the visibility of the interference pattern. A method of center wavelength adjustment is proposed for the optical radiation source in accord ance with the current Bragg gratings reflection spectra based on the impulse relative modulation of control signal for the Peltier <b>element</b> <b>controller.</b> The semiconductor vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser controlled by a pump driver is used as a light source. The method is implemented by the Peltier <b>element</b> <b>controller</b> regulating and stabilizing the light source temperature, and a programmable logic-integrated circuit monitoring the Peltier <b>element</b> <b>controller.</b> The experiment has proved that the proposed method rendered possible to regulate the light source temperature at a pitch of 0. 05 K and adjust the optical radiation source center wavelength at a pitch of 0. 05 nm. Experimental results have revealed that the central wavelength of the radiation adjustment at a pitch of 0. 005 nm gives the possibility for the capacity of the array consisting of four opticalfiber sensors based on the fiber Bragg gratings. They are formed in one optical fiber under the Bragg grating temperature change from 0 ° C to 300 ° C and by the optical fiber mechanical stretching by the force up to 2 N...|$|E

These applications require a secure store for keeping sensitive data. Combining NFC with integrated smartcard chips in a mobile device allows the emulation of different cards. Representing each secure element with different UIDs poses several problems. Thus we propose an approach with a fixed UID dedicated to a Secure <b>Element</b> <b>Controller</b> (SEC). This approach allows an optimized backwards compatibility to already established reader infrastructures but also the communication in peer-to-peer mode with other NFC devices. Additionally the communication over peer-to-peer as well as the internal mode of secure elements at the same time is possible. This is approach poses a flexible alternative to the implementations proposed so far. In addition when there are to multiple, removable secure elements in a device it is ensured that the secure elements are only used by authorized user/devices.

In order to concretize our model, we have based our prototype application in the following three frameworks. First, the Struts framework in which the <b>controller</b> <b>element</b> resides. Second, the Cocoon framework which serves {{as the basis for the}} view. And, finally, the J 2 EE business components that constitute the model.

The control and mitigation of the this wave phenomenon, which spreads out to different locations at a comparably slow speed, is important for enhancing power system transient stability, as shown in part two of this two-paper series. In an idealized power system consisting of infinitesimal generators and line impedances, this traveling wave can exist to infinite frequencies, its speed {{can be derived from}} a wave equation and its reflection can be eliminated by a characteristic termination. Part one of this paper series examines realistic power systems with finite size generators and line impedances.

40|$|Thermal {{control of}} future large, high power {{spacecraft}} {{will require a}} two-phase fluid central bus. The two-phase fluid reservoir is a critical component in the two-phase fluid bus. It both controls the saturation temperature and provides a space for volumetric changes. A dynamic reservoir simulation model does not currently exist, but it is needed to expedite efforts and reduce risk. During 1989 an {{effort was made to}} develop a simulation model of the transient performance of a two-phase fluid reservoir. As a beginning, a preliminary model was developed. It is based upon component mathematical models in lumped parametric form and build upon five component mathematical models for calculating dynamic responses of two-phase fluid reservoirs, primary feedback <b>elements,</b> <b>controller</b> commands, heater actuators, and reservoir heaters. As much as possible, the model took advantage of the available SINDA' 85 /FLUINT thermal/fluid integrator. Additional calculation logic and computer subroutines were developed to complete implementation of the model. The model is capable of simulating dynamic response of an equilibrium two-phase fluid reservoir. Modification of the model to include the liquid/vapor nonequilibrium is required for applications of the model to simulate performance of reservoir in which the liquid and vapor phases of the reservoir fluid are not in equilibrium. In addition, the model in its present form, needs to be refined in several respects. More empirical data are needed to guide the model development. The model may then be used to conduct a full parametric study of two-phase fluid reservoirs. More complexities in two-phaes flow regions in laboratory and flight conditions may have to be considered eventually if empirical data cannot be simulated satisfactorily. System with other components arrangement also need to be simulated if optimization is ever to be attained. The present model does, however, preliminarily demonstrates that such analyses are quite possible and offers a far less expensive method to understand the transient of a two-phase fluid reservoir system than a totally headware approach...|$|R
