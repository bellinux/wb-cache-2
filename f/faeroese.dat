25|$|The Icelandic Coast Guard's (ICG) {{primary mission}} is the {{defending}} the Icelandic sovereignty, {{integrity of the}} territorial waters, maintaining Icelandic law and order inside the 200 nm wide Economic zone {{as well as other}} vital missions such as Search and Rescue. The Coast Guard operates JRCC-Iceland which is responsible for search and rescue of vessels and aircraft in Iceland's search and rescue region (SRR) according to International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual. Additionally the ICG is in the charge of defusing naval mines, most of which were laid during the Second World War, and monitoring fisheries in International waters outside of the Icelandic Economic zone in order to blacklist any vessel partaking in unregulated fishing and thus bar them from receiving services from any member of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in order to make unregulated fishing unprofitable. The Icelandic Coast Guard also occasionally operates within Greenlandic and <b>Faeroese</b> waters, following a bilateral agreement with Denmark regarding mutual aid in security, rescue and defence matters.|$|E

5000|$|Charles Godfrey Leland {{mentions}} {{the idea that}} the word could be derived from the Norse word hum, meaning 'night' or 'shadow', and the word bugges (used in the Bible), a variant of bogey, meaning 'apparitions'. The Norse word hum mentioned, or hume, actually means 'dark air' in Old Norwegian. From the other Scandinavian languages based on Old Norse, there is húm in Icelandic which means 'twilight', hómi in <b>Faeroese</b> which means 'unclear', and humi in Old Swedish which means 'dark suspicion', documented back to 1541. From this word is also derived the Swedish verb hymla, still in use, which means 'to conceal, hide, not commit to the truth'.|$|E
50|$|Joensen-Mikines {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Mykines. He never doubted that he would be an artist, and his first {{inclination}} was to be musician and play the violin. But in the summer of 1924 the Swedish bird painter William Gislander visited the Faroe Islands for painting the enormous colonies of birds. Gislander was not a great artist, but for the young Joensen-Mikines he was the idol, whose steps he followed from the very beginning, and who let him make his first brush strokes with the remainders of paint that could squeeze out of Gislander's tubes. His paintings were inspired both by Edvard Munch and Eugène Delacroix, and his trend-setting art was decisive for the development of <b>Faeroese</b> art.|$|E
50|$|In 1889, {{at the age}} of 20, Sigert Patursson {{traveled}} to western Siberia and the Kara Sea. The journey lasted six years, and {{when he returned to the}} Faroe Islands he wrote the book Sibirien i vore Dage (Siberia Today). The book was published in 12 fascicles from 1900 to 1901, and then combined into a single book with the same title in 1901. In addition to the journey itself, the book focuses on the culture that he discovered there. Among other things, he described a local peasant wedding. A Faroese translation of the book by Sigrið av Skarði Joensen was published in 1994. Patursson also {{traveled to}} many other lands, including Mongolia and Egypt, which was very unusual for a <b>Faeroese</b> at that time.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{remains of}} the old Norse tongue, Norn, in script form, and what is extant, such as the ballad [...] "Hildina", The [...] "Unst Boat song" [...] and various Norn {{fragments}} collected by Jakob Jakobsen seems often corrupted, though the parts are fascinating. Those have been studied in depth, and scholars have notionally fixed the old Shetlandic Norn as kin to <b>Faeroese</b> and Vestnorsk. The oral tradition for which Shetland was famed in the Norse era, when it {{was known as a}} land of bards, died with the language - though {{it may well be that}} some of the old folktales and ballads were translated into the oral tradition we now know in Shetlandic, and that the continuing proliferation of writers in Shetland is an ongoing form of that tradition of 'bards' - even across the difficult cultural shift from Scandinavia to Britain.|$|E

50|$|The Germanic {{branch of}} the Indo-European {{languages}} has {{a large number of}} speakers, approximately 450 million native speakers, partly due to the colonisation of many parts of the world. However, the number of different languages within the Germanic group is rather limited. Depending on the definition of what counts as a language there are about 12 different languages. Traditionally, they are divided into three subgroups: East Germanic (Gothic, which is no longer a living language), North Germanic (Icelandic, <b>Faeroese,</b> Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish), and West Germanic (English, German, Dutch, Afrikaans, Yiddish and Frisian). Some of these languages are so similar that they are only considered independent languages because of their position as standardised languages spoken within the limits of a state. This goes for the languages of the Scandinavian countries, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian, which are mutually intelligible. Other languages consist of dialects which are in fact so different that they are no longer mutually intelligible but are still considered one language because of standardisation. Northern and southern German dialects are an example of this situation.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} {{results of}} broad {{research into the}} Brethren Movement in the Faeroes from 1865 to 2010, emphasising the disciplines Church History, Economic, Social and Cultural History, Cultural Studies and Missiology. The role of Brethren in the Nation Building Process is analysed {{as well as their}} pioneering work in the language struggle. Drawing on recent theories the <b>Faeroese</b> Brethren Movement is set in national and international perspective. Interviwes with many Brethren confirm the validity of the theories and give insight into (1) the developments until the 1960 s, and (2) the period after. New aspects are brought to light, analysed and seen as part of the general development in the islands, and how Brethren have influenced the national, economic and cultural progresses. Nowhere has the Brethren Movement had such support as in the Faeroes where around 15 per cent of the polulation are members; elsewhere it is between a half and one per cent at most. Reasons for this are analysed as are Brethren theology and practices, attitudes and activism which have influences the broader community. The conclusion points out that the <b>Faeroese</b> Brethren movement has had much greater impact on the progress and developments that so far acknowledged. Self-government, self-financing and self-propagation of each assembly have influenced attitudes outside the movement, and Brethren attitudes, pioneering spirit and new ways of thinking have inspired others. The Brethren Movement was the first to break away from colonial power (the Danish State Church) and establish a <b>Faeroese</b> church. Tensions and changes within the movement in the early 21 st century are discussed and the future of Brethren in the Faeroes is evaluated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the costs and {{benefits}} for Iceland from joining the EMU from a labour-market perspective. We conclude that none of Mundell's three criteria for an optimal currency area are at present fulfilled for Iceland and the initial Euro zone. Shocks to the Icelandic economy are found to be asymmetric with those experienced in other countries, nominal wages rigid, and migration limited. The painful adjustment of the <b>Faeroese</b> economy to macroeconomic shocks in the early 1990 s suggests that the disadvantages of not having a separate currency can be substantial if nominal wages are rigid. Substantial variation in labour market participation and frequent adjustments of the exchange rate seem to have held unemployment in check in Iceland, at least until around 1988. ...|$|E
