50|$|Pearceite is a brittle mineral {{that breaks}} with a conchoidal to {{irregular}} fracture. It is soft, with hardness only 3, {{the same as}} calcite.

During the period of insemination, because of the rain, it can fail in giving fruits, and it is then called [...] "praznobačva" [...] (empty barrel). Blatina can produce dry red wine with 12 to 13.5% of alcohol, 5 to 7 g/l of total acidity, 25-32 g/l of extract. It has a <b>dark</b> <b>ruby</b> red color.|$|R

50|$|While {{it is by}} far {{the most}} renowned type of port, from a volume and revenue standpoint, Vintage port {{actually}} makes up only a small percentage of the production of most shippers. Vintage ports may be aged in barrels or stainless steel for a maximum of two and a half years before bottling, and generally require another ten to forty years of ageing in the bottle before reaching what is considered a proper drinking age. Since they are potentially aged in cask for only a short time, they retain their <b>dark</b> <b>ruby</b> colour and fresh fruit flavours. Particularly fine Vintage ports can continue to gain complexity and drink wonderfully for many decades after they were bottled. It is not uncommon for 19th century bottles to still be in perfect condition for consumption. The oldest known Vintage Port still available from a Shipper is the 1815 Ferreira which is still in excellent drinking condition.|$|R
5000|$|In 1865, an Indian {{showed a}} piece of [...] "mineral-bearing" [...] rock to Owen Farell, M. G. Cough, and Alonzo Monroe.

Upon payment, the Indian directed them to a spot {{about two and a half}} miles west of the township of Eureka, Nevada. On this site, the northwestern side of Prospect Mountain, the Buckeye and Champion mines were established. In the early 1870s, a mining town followed. The town took its name from the <b>ruby</b> <b>silver</b> that had been discovered there and became known as Ruby Hill. A post office was built and services commenced on September 23, 1873, until its closure on November 30, 1901. The town was serviced by the railroad and the route of the train was named after Ruby Hill. The train would take the ores produced at the mine to the smelters in Eureka.|$|R

60|$|But yet I am not {{describing}} her after the accepted fashion. I should produce {{a catalogue of}} features, and tell how {{every one of them}} was formed. Her hair was dark, and worn very plain, but with that graceful care which shows that the owner has not slurred over her toilet with hurried negligence. Of complexion it can hardly be said that she had any; so little was the appearance of her countenance diversified by a change of hue. If I am bound to declare her colour, I must, in truth, say that she was brown. There was none even of that flying hue which is supposed to be intended when a woman is called a brunette. When she first came to Croker's Hall, health produced no variation. Nor did any such come quickly; though before she had lived there a year and a half, now and again a slight tinge of <b>dark</b> <b>ruby</b> would show itself on her cheek, and then vanish almost quicker than it had come. Mr Whittlestaff, when he would see this, would be almost beside himself in admiration.|$|R
