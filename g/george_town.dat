5|$|In {{response}} to British {{activity in the}} region and the reluctance of the inhabitants of Île de France to follow orders from the National Convention abolishing slavery, the French dispatched a squadron of frigates to the East Indies early in 1796. This force, led by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, originally comprised three frigates, subsequently joined by three more vessels, forming a powerful raiding squadron. After resupplying on Île de France in July, Sercey's frigates cruised off the Ceylon coast, dissuaded from attacking the undefended ports of British India by false information fed to his scouts that a British battle squadron was at anchor in Calcutta. Turning eastwards, Sercey hoped to raid <b>George</b> <b>Town</b> at Penang, but was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with a British squadron off Sumatra on 9 September. He spent the winter sheltering in Batavia on Java.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, the {{hurricane}} again weakened as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. At 1415UTC on September 12 Ivan passed 25miles (40km) south-southwest of <b>George</b> <b>Town,</b> Cayman Islands, where sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h) were reported. The storm surge from {{the hurricane}} flooded all of Grand Cayman Island. After its eyewall became re-established Ivan attained Category5 status {{for a third}} time early on September 13. Shortly thereafter, a trough created a weakness in the ridge to its north, causing the hurricane to turn to the northwest. The combination of enhanced outflow from the trough and very warm waters allowed Ivan to maintain Category5 status for 30hours. Early on September 14 the hurricane passed through the Yucatán Channel about 17miles (28km) southwest of Cabo San Antonio, Cuba, with the eastern portion of the eyewall crossing the western portion of the island. Only the extreme western portion of the island experienced hurricane-force winds, although rainfall from the hurricane was reported across the island.|$|E
