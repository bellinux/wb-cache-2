It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation.

Also, and again as evident in Figure 13 the degrees of freedom were obtained under a small sample-assumption adjustment, which was determined by the type of reference distribution used for inference. The model F test assumes that the fractions of missing information of all coefficients are equal (equal FMI) and thus rejects the hypothesis that all coefficients are equal to zero.|$|R

Recent brain imaging work helps to recognize that establishing connectivity between brain regions is of importance for successful navigation. Here, we ask whether the ability to navigate is impaired in adolescents who were born premature and suffer congenital bilateral periventricular brain damage that might affect the path-ways interconnecting subcortical structures with cortex.

Since carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, an increase in CO2 results in a decrease in blood pH, resulting in hemoglobin proteins releasing their load of oxygen.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the degree of firm heterogeneity on the number of firms and of the difference in this degree between countries on international trade. The change in the mass of firms, trade pattern and welfare effect of trade are examined in a general equilibrium model where firms with different productivity levels in two countries having different degrees of firm heterogeneity in productivity compete in a monopolistically competitive market of a differentiated good. The paper reveals that the number of firms in a country always <b>inversely</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> the degree of firm heterogeneity of its own, both in autarky and under free trade. In contrast, when firms in a country become less (more) heterogeneous, the number of firms in this country’s trading partner will decrease (increase). Two countries with different extents of firm heterogeneity will benefit from trade at an equilibrium where the country with less heterogeneous firms has more firms and is the net-exporter in the intra-industry trade of the differentiated good. This paper contributes to the analysis of the effect of asymmetry between countries at firm level on the industrial reallocation and international trade with firm heterogeneity...|$|R

When this fault was active, it behaved similarly to the San Andreas Fault in California and the Denali Fault here in Alaska.

40|$|A central {{paradox of}} vitamin D biology is that 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 {{exposure}} <b>inversely</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> colorectal cancer (CRC) risk despite {{a capacity for}} activation of both pro- and anti-oncogenic mediators including osteopontin (OPN) /CD 44 and E-cadherin, respectively. Most sporadic CRCs arise from adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation but understanding of its effects on vitamin D growth control is limited. Here we investigate effects of the ApcMin/+ genotype on 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 regulation of OPN/CD 44 /E-cadherin signalling and intestinal tumourigenesis, in vivo. In untreated ApcMin/+ versus Apc+/+ intestines, expression levels of OPN and its CD 44 receptor were increased, whereas E-cadherin tumour suppressor signalling was attenuated. Treatment by 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 or rationally designed analogues (QW or BTW) enhanced OPN but inhibited expression of CD 44, the OPN receptor implicated in cell growth. These treatments also enhanced E-cadherin tumour suppressor activity, characterized by inhibition of β-catenin nuclear localization, T-cell factor 1 and c-myelocytomatosis protein expression in ApcMin/+ intestine. All secosteroids suppressed ApcMin/+-driven tumourigenesis although QW and BTW had lower calcium-related toxicity. Taken together, these data indicate that the ApcMin/+ genotype modulates vitamin D secosteroid actions to promote functional predominance of E-cadherin tumour suppressor activity within antagonistic molecular networks. APC heterozygosity may promote favourable tissue- or tumour-specific conditions for growth control by vitamin D secosteroid treatment...|$|R

25|$|Neural {{oscillation}} {{can also}} arise from interactions between different brain areas coupled through the structural connectome. Time delays {{play an important}} role here. Because all brain areas are bidirectionally coupled, these connections between brain areas form feedback loops. Positive feedback loops tends to cause oscillatory activity where frequency is <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the delay time. An example of such a feedback loop is the connections between the thalamus and cortex. This thalamocortical network is able to generate oscillatory activity known as recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance. The thalamocortical network {{plays an important role in}} the generation of alpha activity. In a whole-brain network model with realistic anatomical connectivity and propagation delays between brain areas, oscillations in the beta frequency range emerge from the partial synchronisation of subsets of brain areas oscillating in the gamma-band (generated at the mesoscopic level).|$|E
40|$|The {{breakdown}} {{delay time}} of a closed plasma plume excited by a high-voltage pulse is investigated. The visible monochromatic light of 404, 532, and 662 [*]nm wavelength and narrow-waveband light at a central wavelength of 400, 430, 450, 470, 500, 530, 570, 610, and 630 [*]nm are used to pre-ionize the gas. It is found that the breakdown delay time decreases when the visible light illuminates the discharge tube. The light is most effective when it is applied at the position near the high-voltage electrode. Besides, the tube material and size are important for enhancing the effect. The jet using quartz tube and larger inner diameter make the effect stronger. The effect of visible light is found <b>to</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> the wavelength, manifested by the longer breakdown delay times for longer wavelengths. With increasing the frequency and the pulse width of the voltage, the visible light shortens the delay time more effectively. These observations {{can be explained by}} the visible light-enhanced generation of free electrons before the ignition. The proposed mechanisms of free-electron generation are the optically stimulated exoelectron emission from the inner surface of the discharge tube wall and the vibrational excitation of nitrogen molecules. The effects of visible light weaken with the addition of oxygen as a result of electron affinity to oxygen...|$|R
