40|$|Introduction When {{one looks}} at a {{two-dimensional}} scene of moving objects, one can usually assign a velocity to each point in that scene with little effort. This suggests that some early visual processes are able to generate a twodimensional velocity map using fast parallel computations. But it is not obvious how this should be done, and we are currently trying {{to understand how the}} human visual system does it. If moving patterns were merely one-dimensional, the visual system's task would be easier. One dimensional motion can be signaled by cells such as those described by Barlow and Hill in rabbit (1963); these units compare responses of two adjacent regions on the retina at two successive moments of time. Combinations of such cells can signal the one-dimensional velocity of a moving <b>edge,</b> <b>bar,</b> or other contour. But the retinal image is two-dimensional, and the problem becomes more complex than it first seems. Figure l illustrates a well-known visual phenomenon called the "barberpole...|$|E

40|$|Elastic-plastic {{crack tip}} {{constraint}} {{has been estimated}} for the common planar crack geometries. These include single <b>edge</b> cracked <b>bars</b> in tension and bending, centre cracked panels, and double <b>edge</b> cracked <b>bars.</b> The description of the stress field has been modified from a one parameter characterisation, based on K or J, to include a second term. The second parameter is a non-singular term, described either {{in terms of an}} elastic T-stress or a Q field. The limits of one and two parameter characterisation are discussed for single <b>edge</b> <b>bars</b> in tension and bending and for centre cracked panels. For the single edge geometries the two parameter characterisation was found to extend the characterisation well beyond the one parameter approach. For the centre cracked panels the two parameter characterisation in terms of a J-Q approach was found to be more accurate than a J-T approach at high levels of deformation. For the single edge cracked bending and tension geometries the second parameter Q is divided into two components named QT and QP. QT is an elastic term which depends on the elastic T stress and is independent of the distance from the crack tip. The second component, QP, arises from global bending on the uncracked ligament. This is a distance dependent term which depends on the level of deformation and can either be expressed {{as a function of the}} load normalised by the limit load or as a function of the plastic component of the J-integral. For single <b>edge</b> bend <b>bars</b> the constraint estimation provides a basis for a method of predicting fracture toughness using local failure approach, where the failure criterion is expressed in terms of the stress level ahead of the crack tip. Finally the constraint of mixed mode problem has been analysed and compared with that of pure Mode I problems...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, quadratic modelling {{of natural}} images {{has resulted in}} cell models that react strongly to <b>edges</b> and <b>bars.</b> Here we apply quadratic Indepen-dent Component Analysis to natural image patches, and show that up to a small approximation error, the estimated components are computing conjunctions of two linear features. These conjunctive features appear to represent not only <b>edges</b> and <b>bars,</b> but also inherently two-dimensional stimuli, such as corners. In addi-tion, we show that {{for many of the}} components, the underlying linear features have essentially V 1 simple cell receptive field characteristics. Our results indicate that the development of the V 2 cells preferring angles and corners may be partly explainable by the principle of unsupervised sparse coding of natural images. ...|$|R

In addition, a modified Valley beater was tested to study the effect of fiber cutting as a pretreatment. Both pretreatment methods: cellulase hydrolysis and anionic polymer adsorption showed potential on manipulating the swelling properties of cellulose fiber and facilitating disintegration of pulp during refining. The swelling results showed {{it is possible to}} increase internal fibrillation of fibers without increasing the fiber swelling by using both methods, especially by cellulase hydrolysis.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{improved}} bioinspired optical position sensing device, in which insect-based retinal microscanning movements {{are used to}} detect and locate contrasting objects such as <b>edges</b> or <b>bars.</b> The active microvibrations imposed upon the retina endow the sensor with hyperacuity. For the sake of clarity, this is demonstrated here for a two-pixel sensor, but the same principle {{could be applied to}} all pairs of neighboring photosensors in a focal plane array. The sensor is able to detect an <b>edge</b> or a <b>bar</b> present within its small field of view (4 degrees) and locate it with a resolution (0. 025 degrees) 160 -fold finer than the static resolution imposed by the pixel spacing. The sensor features the novel ability to establish whether it is actually facing an <b>edge</b> or a <b>bar,</b> based on the phase difference between the sinusoidally modulated signals of its two photoreceptors. The visual processing algorithm involves simple linear filtering and purely arithmetic operations requiring few computational resources. The complete theoretical framework is presented here, including an analytical model for the microscanning sensor.

40|$|A linear {{neural network}} is {{proposed}} for mamalian vision {{system in which}} backward connections from the primary visual cortex (V 1) to the lateral geniculate nucleus play a key role. The backward connections control {{the flow of information}} from the LGN to V 1 {{in such a way as}} to maximize the rate of transfer of information from the LGN to V 1. The application of hebbian learning to the forward and backward connections causes the formation of receptive fields which are sensitive to <b>edges,</b> <b>bars,</b> and spatial frequencies of preferred orientations. Receptive field types in V 1 are shown to depend on the density of the afferent connections in the LGN. Orientational preferences are organized in the primary visual cortex by the application of lateral interactions during the learning phase. Change in the size of the eye between the immature and mature animal is shown be an important factor in the development of V 1 organization. The orgainization of the mature network is compared to that found in the macaque monkey by several analytical tests. ...|$|R

Motionsof sand grain groups were observed to form ephemeral patterns of small scales, but they didnot change into oblique edges longer than channel width. Migrating disturbance also failedto cause the oblique edges. On the semi-fixed beds, bed forms varied with the thicknessesof the layers e. g. longitudinal streaks on the very thin layer, a row of long-crested antiduneson the thick enough one. When it was medium, several rows of short-crested antidunesoccorred and their trough lines propagated in the oblique directions, producing a staggeredpattern of small scour holes and oblique edges. Thus, their directions should be a functionof the Froude number, whereas that of <b>bar</b> <b>edges,</b> proportional to ratios of the width to thewave length, are known to be less related with the Froude number.
