50|$|Ireland has a well {{developed}} market for financial derivatives, with its annual value being measured in $ billions. Most common are {{interest rate swaps}} and foreign exchange transactions used by businesses to manage their risk and support their currency requirements. Ireland's strong funds and insurance sectors are also significant users of derivatives, as are other special purpose vehicles located in the country such as securitisation structures. The majority of transactions involve the major banks and they in turn tend to enter into contracts with institutions outside Ireland, particularly in the EU. The Irish Stock Exchange also has the facility for <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Ireland's proximity to London, shared language and time zone is a benefit to its financial services industry.

40|$|Weather {{derivatives}} are {{a relatively}} recent innovation, {{but according to the}} Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), are the fastest growing derivative market today. They are used to manage weather related risks which previously were exclusively handled by insurance products, and represent the latest product in the continuing convergence of financial and insurance research and markets. A weather derivative pays-off based upon the realization of an underlying weather index, much like stock index based derivatives pays-off based upon a realization of the underlying stock index. The pay-off from a weather derivative can offset losses generated by adverse weather conditions. The use of these derivatives creates new risks, however, depending upon whether an <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>derivative</b> or an over-the-counter (OTC) derivative is used.

40|$|Derivatives {{products}} provide certain {{important economic}} {{benefits such as}} risk management or redistribution of risk away from risk-averse investors towards those more {{willing and able to}} bear risk. Derivatives also help price discovery, i. e. the process of determining the price level for any asset based on supply and demand. These functions of derivatives help in efficient capital allocation in the economy; at the same time their misuse also poses a threat to the stability of the financial sector and the overall economy. In the mid- 1990 s India started reviving the exchange traded commodity derivatives market and introduced a variety of instruments in the foreign exchange derivatives market, while exchange traded financial derivatives were intro-duced in 2001.

40|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} turmoil of 2007 and 2008, no major derivative clearing house in the world encountered distress while many banks were pushed to the brink and beyond. An important {{reason for this is}} that derivative exchanges have avoided using value at risk, normal distributions and linear correlations. This is an important lesson. The global financial crisis has also taught us that in risk management, robustness is more important than sophistication and that it is dangerous to use models that are over calibrated to short time series of market prices. The paper applies these lessons to the important <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> in India and recommends major changes to the current margining systems to improve their robustness. It also discusses directions in which global best practices in exchange risk management could be improved to take advantage of recent advances in computing power and finance theory. The paper argues that risk management should evolve towards explicit models based on coherent risk measures (like expected shortfall), fat tailed distributions and non linear dependence structures (copulas). ...|$|E

40|$|Basis risk {{has been}} cited as a primary concern for {{implementing}} weather hedges. This study investigates several dimensions of weather basis risk for the U. S. corn market at various levels of aggregation. The results suggest that while the degree of geographic basis risk may be significant in some instances, it should not preclude the use of geographic cross-hedging. In addition, {{the degree to which}} geographic basis risk impedes effective hedging diminishes as the level of spatial aggregation increases. In fact, geographic basis risk is actually negative in the case most representative of a reinsurance hedge, and the reduction in risk from employing straightforward temperature derivatives is significant. Finally, precipitation hedges are found to introduce additional product basis risk.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} unwinding of leveraged positions {{can trigger}} financial market turbulence. Although balance-sheet measures of leverage are available, {{it is useful}} to construct a measure of leverage that incorporates both on- and off-balance-sheet activities. This paper provides measures of leverage implicit in derivative contracts by decomposing the contracts into cash market equivalent components. A leverage ratio can then be calculated for this replicating portfolio, which consists of own funds (equity) and borrowed funds equivalents (debt). Methods for aggregating leverage by institution and by markets are presented. The interaction between leverage and risk is discussed, and a modified capital adequacy ratio is calculated, which captures off-balance-sheet exposure.

40|$|The {{profits of}} many {{businesses}} are strongly affected by weather related events, and insurance against weather related risks (acts of God) {{has been a}} traditional domain for transfer of (certain) of these risks. Recent innovations in the capital market have now provided financial instruments to transfer and hedge some of these risks. Unlike insurance solutions, however, using these financial derivative instruments creates {{a situation in which}} the return to the purchaser of the instrument is no longer perfectly correlated with the loss experienced. Such a mismatch creates new risks which must be examined and evaluated as part of ascertaining cost effective risk management plans. Two newly engendered risks, basis risk (the risk created by the fact that the return from the financial derivative is a function of weather at a prespecified geographical location which may not be identical to the location of the firm) and credit risk (the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract may not perform), are analyzed in this article. Using custom tailored derivatives from the over the counter market can decrease basis risk, but increases credit risk. Using standardized <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> decreases credit risk but increases basis risk. Here also the effectiveness of using hedging methods involving forwards and futures having linear payoffs (linear hedging) and methods using derivatives having nonlinear payoffs such as those involving options (nonlinear hedging) for the purpose of hedging basis risk are examined jointly with credit risk.

40|$|Jet {{fuel costs}} have {{substantially}} risen {{over the past}} several years putting consistent pressure on airlines to maintain positive cash flows. While the costs are hedgable, there is not a perfect hedge available in either the over-the-counter or <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>derivatives</b> markets. Over-the-counter derivatives on jet fuel are very illiquid which makes them rather expensive and not available in quantities sufficient to hedge all of an airlines jet fuel consumption. Exchange-traded derivatives are not available in the United States for jet fuel, so airlines must use futures contracts on commodities that are highly correlated with jet fuel, such as crude and heating oil. As such, airlines employ a variety of strategies ranging from not hedging to fully hedging using a combination of products. This paper is divided into several sections. First, we document the various strategies, including hedging using over-the-counter derivatives, futures contracts, and not hedging, and evaluate the effectiveness and merits of each. We then discuss the accounting rules and the implications these rules have for driving hedging strategies. Finally, we perform an industry survey as of December 31, 2003 and document the practices currently in place in the domestic airline industry to determine whether the use of a hedging strategy appears to create market value. Our research indicates that, contrary to the opinions of many airline executives, the optimal strategy is to employ a dynamic hedging program that is actively managed through the price cycle using a variety of derivative products. Because the airline industry is relatively unhedged at the present, using derivatives to hedge jet fuel costs creates a competitive advantage and has been shown to increase firm value. I.

These include using both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives and remaining unhedged...|$|E
