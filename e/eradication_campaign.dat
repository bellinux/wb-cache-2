5|$|In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation funded a {{hookworm}} <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> {{through the}} International Health Division. This campaign used {{a combination of}} politics and science, along with collaboration between healthcare workers and government officials to accomplish its goals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> led to {{the death}} of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the {{subsequent}} suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign.</b> As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} many who have debated whether {{invasive}} mammal <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> are effective enough considering the non-target and environmental impacts of the methods used, the cost, and even those who believe the problem of introduced mammals on islands is overstated. However, since introduced mammals pose such a threat to biodiversity worldwide, the pervading thought is that action {{must be taken to}} remove these invasive mammals from islands. Many studies have shown overwhelming effectiveness of individual <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns,</b> including partial or complete recovery of seabird populations. Reviews have shown that over 70% of rat and 90% of goat <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> that have been attempted have successfully ridded the islands of these invasive mammals. Additionally, while concerns persist that island ecosystems take centuries to recover after the removal of invasive mammals, recent research suggests that, if managed properly, islands might take only a couple years to a couple decades to recover.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{prevention}} and <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> funded for example by the World Health Organization, US Agency for International Development, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UK Department for International Development.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, only 148 {{people were}} {{reported}} to have dracunculiasis because of a successful <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> for that particular helminth, which is easier to eradicate than other helminths as it is transmitted only by drinking contaminated water.|$|E
25|$|As part of island {{restoration}} some islands' rat {{populations have}} been eradicated to protect or restore the ecology. Hawadax Island, Alaska was declared rat free after 229 years and Campbell Island, New Zealand after almost 200 years. Breaksea Island in New Zealand was declared rat free in 1988 after an <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> {{based on a}} successful trial on the smaller Hawea Island nearby.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, WHO {{had dropped}} its {{commitment}} to a global malaria <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> as too ambitious, it retained {{a strong commitment to}} malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012 WHO was to report, as to whether RTS,S/AS01, were a viable malaria vaccine. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used {{to prevent the spread of}} malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.|$|E

40|$|Background. After 2 {{decades of}} focused efforts to {{eradicate}} polio, {{the impact of}} eradication activities on health systems continues to be controversial. This study evaluated the impact of polio eradication activities on routine im-munization (RI) and primary healthcare (PHC). Methods. Quantitative analysis assessed the effects of polio <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> on RI and maternal healthcare coverage. A systematic qualitative analysis in 7 countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa assessed impacts of polio eradication activities on key health system functions, using data from interviews, participant observation, and document review.

50|$|It {{seems that}} the {{tremendous}} success of the Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread program is related to extremely well planned campaigns, which involves communication, transparency and clarity of objectives: in advance to an application STS holds meetings that include the area population in general, concerned citizens, public officials, scientists and technical personnel to discuss strategies of management of Gypsy moth {{in the areas of}} concern. There is a movement requesting that new government invasive species <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> model their pest suppression actions on the existing successful suppression programs like GM STS, and embrace a more effective policy of communication, transparency and clarity of objectives. With the involvement and education of the public, areawide <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> will be better planned and more able to deliver decisive end effective pest eradication actions.|$|R
25|$|In the Niayes {{region of}} Senegal, a coastal area close to Dakar, {{livestock}} keeping was difficult {{due to the}} presence of a population of Glossina palpalis gambiensis. Feasibility studies indicated that the fly population was confined to very fragmented habitats and a population genetics study indicated that the population was genetically isolated from the main tsetse belt in the south eastern part of Senegal. After completion of the feasibility studies (2006–2010), an area-wide integrated <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> that included an SIT component was started in 2011, and by 2015, the Niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free.|$|E
25|$|Rinderpest (also cattle plague or steppe murrain) was an {{infectious}} viral disease of cattle, domestic buffalo, {{and some other}} species of even-toed ungulates, including buffaloes, large antelope and deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations. Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although {{it could also be}} transmitted by air. After a global <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign,</b> the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Vaccines {{have contributed}} to the {{eradication}} of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as {{the vast majority of people}} are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, the difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between disease control, {{population growth and}} economic development is examined through a comparison of changes subsequent to malaria <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> in Sri Lanka and Sardinia. Both islands were similar in terms of malaria morbidity and mortality rates {{as well as a}} history of massive malaria <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> using DDT immediately after the Second World War. The critical comparative distinction is that Sardinia had a much lower population density than Sri Lanka. In both cases, the anticipated effects of malaria control were increased agriculture production in endemic zones coupled with a relief of population pressure in non-malaria areas. This has not happened. Patterns of demographic change, marked by sharp declines in general mortality and accelerated population rates, are similar in both cases. Malaria control has resulted in economic development in neither case, however, and this is explained using ecological and political-economic analyses. ...|$|R

25|$|Ali Maow Maalin (also Mao Moallim and Mao' Mo'allim) (1954 – 22 July 2013) was a Somali {{hospital}} {{cook and}} health worker from Merca {{who is the}} last person known to be infected with naturally occurring Variola minor smallpox in the world. He was diagnosed with the disease in October 1977 and made a full recovery. Although he had many contacts, none of them developed the disease and an aggressive containment campaign was successful in preventing an outbreak. Smallpox was declared to have been eradicated globally by the World Health Organization (WHO) two years later. Maalin was subsequently involved in the successful poliomyelitis <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign</b> in Somalia, and he died of malaria while carrying out polio vaccinations after the re-emergence of the virus in 2013.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 2001, Tasmania {{formed a}} fox task force, now the Fox Eradication Branch, to {{eliminate}} the European red fox. Officials planned to spend up to A$50million on an <b>eradication</b> <b>campaign,</b> which has since been reduced. No foxes have been captured, poisoned or photographed with certainty in the Island state, although four carcasses have been recovered. Of these, one was claimed to be shot, {{and the other three}} presumed road-kills.The lack of an abundance of foxes, through low population densities, and fox-poisoning campaigns, has resulted in an abundance of denial of fox presence by the Tasmanian community. Established foxes in Tasmania could devastate native mammals, livestock, ground-nesting birds and native rodents. Experts estimate there are fewer than 30million foxes on mainland Australia, having been introduced by European settlers.|$|E
25|$|At the 25th ISCTRC (International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis Research and Control) in Mombasa, Kenya, in October 1999, {{the idea}} of an African-wide {{initiative}} to control tsetse and trypanosomiasis populations was discussed. During the 36th summit of the Organization for African Unity in Lome, Togo, in July 2000, a resolution was passed to form the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis <b>Eradication</b> <b>Campaign</b> (PATTEC). The campaign works to eradicate the tsetse vector population levels and subsequently the protozoan disease, by use of insecticide-impregnated targets, fly traps, insecticide-treated cattle, ultra-low dose aerial/ground spraying (SAT) of tsetse resting sites and the sterile insect technique (SIT). The use of SIT in Zanzibar proved effective in eliminating the entire population of tsetse flies but was expensive and is relatively impractical to use in many of the endemic countries afflicted with African trypanosomiasis.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{antimalarial}} {{drugs is}} indissolubly {{linked with the}} use of insecticides in malaria <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> and is, indeed, of quite particular importance in areas in which insecticides have for various reasons—such as acquired resistance by anophelines—proved to be of limited value or in which residual spraying has ceased and potential foci of infection must be suppressed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this first}} {{comprehensive}} review of negative effects of introduced rodents on insular small mammals, the focal species Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, R. exulans and Mus musculus are implicated in at least 11 extinctions. Furthermore, removal experiments, <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns</b> and control programmes provide evidence for negative effects on extant populations. While data are currently insufficient for meaningful generalisation {{with regard to the}} most threatening rodents, the most threatened small mammals, and the true extent of the problem, it is interesting that R. rattus is implicated in the majority of impacts. This may be explained by its extensive distribution and ecological plasticity. I conclude with methodological recommendations to guide data collection for impact quantification and the study of impact mechanism. This information should facilitate the prioritisation and justification of <b>eradication</b> <b>campaigns,</b> control programmes and biosecurity measures while ensuring that much-needed attention is paid to the conservation of insular small mammals.

2500|$|A major {{contribution}} to smallpox vaccination {{was made in}} the 1960s by Benjamin Rubin, an American microbiologist working for Wyeth Laboratories. Based on initial tests with textile needles with the eyes cut off transversely half-way he developed the bifurcated needle. This was a sharpened two-prong fork designed to hold one dose of reconstituted freeze-dried vaccine by capillarity. Easy to use with minimum training, cheap to produce ($5 per 1000), using 4 times less vaccine than other methods, and repeatedly re-usable after flame sterilization, it was used globally in the WHO Smallpox <b>Eradication</b> <b>Campaign</b> from 1968. Rubin estimated that it was used to do 200 million vaccinations per year during the last years of the campaign. Those closely involved in the campaign were awarded the [...] "Order of the Bifurcated Needle". This, a personal initiative by Donald Henderson, was a lapel badge, designed and made by his daughter, formed from the needle shaped to form an [...] "O". This represented [...] "Target Zero", the objective of the campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s [...] and early 1950s, Leslie Collier, an English {{microbiologist}} {{working at the}} Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, developed a method for producing a heat-stable freeze-dried vaccine in powdered form. Collier added 0.5% phenol to the vaccine {{to reduce the number}} of bacterial contaminants but the key stage was to add 5% peptone to the liquid vaccine before it was dispensed into ampoules. This protected the virus during the freeze drying process. After drying the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen. Like other vaccines, once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1–2 [...] days at ambient temperatures. However, the dried vaccine was 100% effective when reconstituted after 6 months storage at [...] allowing it to be transported to, and stored in, remote tropical areas. Collier's method was increasingly used and, with minor modifications, became the standard for vaccine production adopted by the WHO Smallpox Eradication Unit when it initiated its global Smallpox <b>Eradication</b> <b>Campaign</b> in 1967, at which time 23 of 59 manufacturers were using the Lister strain.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the nationalists, the Communists had much simpler and more effective strategy aided by their lack of the same order of problems as the Nationalists: the Communist forces simply needed to eradicate bandits.
