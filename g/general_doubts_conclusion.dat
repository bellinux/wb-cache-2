Recently, standards-based teacher evaluation has been introduced in many countries to improve teaching practice.

Data were collected in 32 secondary schools from 298 teachers and 32 school leaders, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We put forward a research model which is investigated through path analysis. Results nurture optimism about teacher evaluation indicating that teacher evaluation can stimulate teachers to undertake professional learning activities when they perceive feedback as useful. The important role of the school leader (through both instructional and transformational leadership) is stressed. Teacher participation and teacher collaboration also have a positive influence on teacher evaluation and its outcomes...|$|R

However, circular reasoning is not persuasive because a listener who <b>doubts</b> the <b>conclusion</b> also <b>doubts</b> the premise that leads to it.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to report the {{educational}} activity called ‘Talking with the Bedridden Patient’ based on five themes: Rehabilitation; Empowerment; Amputation; Uncertainties and Guidance. This research was conducted as part of the outreach project Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation of Amputees of the State University of Santa Catarina. The actions of the project at hospital level included: collection of notifications; conversation with bedridden patients; delivery of a kit with informative brochures and an elastic band for the bandaging of the stump; schedule for physical therapy assessment after hospital discharge in the outreach project. Method: This qualitative case study was performed with a person who had recently undergone a lower limb amputation in a public hospital in the city of São José/Santa Catarina. Results: This project proved to be efficient mainly to empower the patient for early onset of rehabilitation. Conclusion: We call attention to the importance of training hospital multidisciplinary teams involved in providing guidelines on fitting, return to work and clarification of <b>general</b> <b>doubts</b> taking into account the patient’s wishes and family support...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, the [...] "accidental" [...] {{possibility}} of manipulating the analog image {{is something which}} had already been increasingly undertaken by the mass media in recent years. The ability to do so derives {{from the fact that}} even the analog photo is a technical synthesis, and as such exposed to an irreducible potential for falsification. For this falsification to be effective, there must be an alteration of what was, but there must also be a belief {{on the part of the}} viewer in the [...] "this was" [...] of the photo. Today, however, with the analogico-digital photo, the conditions of this belief are diminished, leading to a <b>general</b> <b>doubt,</b> and one which affects, for example, democracy. This doubt must be doubled by another doubt, a positive, resolute doubt leading to new forms of [...] "objective analysis" [...] and [...] "subjective synthesis," [...] and therefore to a new kind of belief and of disbelief. The doubt and fear caused by the analogico-digital image is therefore also what would make possible this more knowing belief.|$|R

Here, for the sake of argu-ment, I grant that the inference can neither rationally overcome <b>doubt</b> about its <b>conclusion</b> nor strengthen one’s epistemic position with respect to the conclusion, and examine whether, and in what way, this undermines use of this inference in a reply to the sceptic. 1...|$|R
30|$|Perhaps {{this is one}} of {{the factors}} that may {{contribute}} to explain the decline of urban planning in this phase. However, even in the field of urban design it is not easy to maintain that critical thinking is currently thriving and widely supported. The paradox remarked upon by Rem Koolhaas (Koolhaas, 1995) almost twenty years ago is as relevant as it ever was. Real processes express a growing demand for good urbanism. From Koolhaas’s viewpoint, this notion cannot be divorced from the quality and efficacy of urban design. However, on the whole the results appear to be less than satisfactory. The capacity to direct and control spatial transformation appears weak not only from the regulatory point of view, but also from that of the effective capacity in terms of visioning and urban designing. In <b>general,</b> <b>doubt</b> is cast upon the social role and influential capacity of the disciplines of spatial organisation and transformation. Is there nothing left to do but adopt some form of “lite urbanism”, an ad hoc, adaptive version, which is lacking in true ambition for innovation (Koolhaas 1995)? It is difficult to find an answer by way of theoretical reflection, which remains abstract and often elusive.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to examine factors {{determining}} women’s preference for places to give birth in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A quantitative and cross-sectional community based study design was employed. Data was collected using structured questionnaire administered to 901 women aged 15 – 49 years through a stratified two-stage cluster sampling technique. Multinomial logistic regression model was employed to identify predictors of delivery care. More than three-fourth of slum women gave birth at public healthcare facilities compared to slightly more than half of the nonslum residents. Education, wealth quintile, the age of respondent, number of children, pregnancy intention, and cohabitation showed net effect on women’s preference for places to give birth. Despite the high number of ANC attendances, still many pregnant women especially among slum residents chose to deliver at home. Most respondents delivered in public healthcare institutions despite the <b>general</b> <b>doubts</b> about the quality of services in these institutions. Future studies should examine motivating factors for continued deliveries at home and whether there is real significant difference between the quality of maternal care service offered at public and private health facilities...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{alignment}} of Corporate Real Estate (CRE) strategies of Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) with the developments in higher education. Methodology/approach – The paper first illustrates the key developments in higher education learning and teaching, and relevant CRE management literature. Subsequently, it presents two studies that examine the CRE strategies of large Dutch UAS, to align their CRE with current and potential future developments. These are explored based on interviews and scenario analysis with {{experts in the field}} of higher education and CRE management. Findings – The findings of the two studies show that CRE in the short term is well aligned with recent and current developments in higher education. Yet, in the long term, CREmanagers in <b>general</b> <b>doubt</b> the probability of some developed scenarios and are not sufficiently prepared for disruptive developments due to inflexibility of the CRE portfolio. Originality/value –There is still limited understanding of how to optimally align school buildings to education. Furthermore, the future is unclear. The two studies in this paper contribute to insights about strategies of CRE-managers in the education sector to translate current and assumed developments into future proof accommodations. The presented frameworks and the scenario approach are applicable in other sectors as well...|$|R

Methods The study was conducted in three phases: in the first phase, eight speech-language pathologists and seven physicians, with no experience in BAEP, were instructed to read and perform each SOP, eventually all individuals evaluated the SOPs by responding to a questionnaire; in the second phase, the questionnaires were analyzed and the three SOP texts were reviewed; in the third phase, nine speech-language pathologists and six physicians, also with no experience in BAEP, read and re-evaluated the reviewed SOPs through a questionnaire. Results In the first phase, difficulties in understanding the texts were found, raising doubts about the procedures; however, every participant was able to perform the procedure as a whole. In the third phase, after the review, all individuals were able to perform the procedures appropriately and continuously without any <b>doubts.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> The assessment of the SOPs by questionnaires showed the need for adaptation in the texts. After the texts were reviewed according to the suggestions of the health professionals, it was possible to observe that the SOPs assisted in the execution of the task, which was conducted without any difficulties or doubts, being regarded effective and ensuring quality to the service offered...|$|R
