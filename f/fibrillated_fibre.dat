40|$|Thermal drying of a pulp {{sheet on}} a paper machine {{is one of the}} most {{energy-intensive}} operations in the paper-making process (Ghosh, 2011). The drying section of a paper machine removes less than 20 % of the total water eliminated from the wet sheet, but is responsible for 78 % of the energy consumption of the paper machine (Karlsson, 2009 & Biermann, 1996). Any enhancement of the dewatering of the paper sheet in the forming and pressing sections, thereby sending a sheet of lower moisture content to the drying section, would result in significant energy savings in the drying of the paper. Typically, the Canadian Standard Freeness (or freeness) and the Water Retention Value (WRV) of pulp are used as a measurement for the dewatering ability of pulp on the wire of the paper machine (Hubbe, 2007). However, neither of these measurements was designed to predict the water removed from the wet sheet (TAPPI T 227, 1999, Scallan & Carles, 1972). The factors that influence the dewatering of pulp on the forming fabric and in the pressing section of a paper machine have been the subject of many studies (Hubbe, 2007). The first objective of the current study was to compile a literature review to build an dewatering of the pulp sheet. Pliable fibres may conform to each other, resulting in a sealing effect that inhibits drainage. Mechanical and enzymatic refining may induce external and internal fibrillation of fibres, and the generation of fines in the pulp. Treating the pulp with an enzyme, specifically endoglucanase, may enhance the susceptibility of the fibres to development by mechanical refining. In the current study, the dewatering of pulp was analysed at pilot scale in order to test which pulp measurements best predicted its forming and pressing performance. A hardwood pulp, composed of Eucalyptus grandis, was refined in a pilot refiner and yielded samples over a range of refining energies. The conventional dewatering measurements, freeness and WRV, were performed on the pulp samples and related to the dewatering performance of the handsheets produced therefrom. The formability (water removed during forming) and pressibility (water removed during pressing) of the handsheets were also determined, and compared to the freeness and WRV of the pulps. It was found that the formability of a handsheet was a much stronger predictor of its dewatering performance than either the freeness or WRV of the pulp. Formability was likely the best predictor of handsheet dewatering because it was a direct measurement of the dewatering performance of a sheet on the forming fabric, whereas freeness and WRV both measured the dewatering of a thicker pad of pulp. The effect of the refining of pulp with an enzyme additive on its dewatering properties was also studied at pilot scale. An endoglucanase was incubated with a hardwood pulp, composed primarily of Eucalyptus grandis, and refined in a pilot refiner. The enzyme was added at four levels, including a control pulp with no enzyme. The dewatering properties of the handsheets formed from the pulp were tested and compared for each enzyme dosage. The morphology of fibres of each of the pulps was determined. It was found that increasing the enzyme dosage of the pulps resulted in the decrease of the dewatering ability of the handsheets. The number of fines in the pulp increased with increasing enzyme dosage. It was likely that fines were responsible for the restriction of pulp dewatering, as suggested by the choke-point hypothesis (Hubbe, 2007). Based on the extent of fibrillation and width of fibres, as well as the number of fines in the pulp, a model of the effect of the enzyme added on the dewatering of the pulp was proposed. Increasing the enzyme concentration in the pulp increased the susceptibility of the fibre to refining. An enzyme dosage of 100 g/t resulted in a more <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibre</b> than found in the control pulp. However, the fibres of the pulp treated with the enzyme at a concentration of 200 g/t were less fibrillated, suggesting that the fibre surface was weakened to the extent that the fibrils were broke off during refining. The fibres of the pulp treated at 500 g/t were again more fibrillated, suggesting the occurrence of secondary fibrillation of the fibre at this high enzyme dosage. The fibres of the pulps treated at 500 and 200 g/t were also narrower, suggesting the loss of fibre material.

30|$|In general terms, the {{production}} of homogeneous fibril qualities may require major costs, including costs related to pre-treatments and to energy consumption during production. The less energy that is utilised, the less is the fibrillation of cellulose fibres and the less the amount of produced nanofibrils [35]. Considering that conventional fibrillation (e.g. homogenisation without pre-treatment) produces a material that is inhomogeneous and may contain a major fraction of poorly <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibres</b> and fines, can we state that MFC is a nano-structure? MFC per se {{is not necessarily a}} nano-material, but contains nano-structures, i.e. the nanofibrils (Figures 4 and 5). To define MFC as a nano-structure, it is necessary to give substantial evidence with respect to (1) the fraction of <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibres,</b> (2) the fraction of nanofibrils and (3) the morphology of the nanofibrils in an MFC material. Provided that a given MFC is composed of an appropriate fraction of individualised nanofibrils, the MFC will have a major influence on the rheological, optical, mechanical and barrier properties of the corresponding materials.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, conventional MFC production yields {{materials with}} inhomogeneous sizes (Figures 3 B,C, 4 A and 5 A). However, the fibrillation can be facilitated by, e.g. pre-treating the cellulose fibres enzymatically [31] or chemically [32, 33]. Pre-treatments have thus facilitated {{the production of}} homogeneous fibril qualities, with fibril diameters less than 100 nm (Figure 3 E,F). In addition, some authors have reported a filtration procedure to remove poorly <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibres,</b> thus maintaining mostly the fraction of homogeneous nanofibrils [34].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{proposes a}} method to {{calculate}} Mode I plane-strain fracture toughness of concrete, by {{taking into account the}} possible crack deflection (kinked crack), even {{in the case of a}} far-field Mode I loading. As a matter of fact, during fracture extension, cracks may deflect as a result of microstructural inhomogeneities inside the material. Concrete is an inhomogeneous mixture due to aggregates embedded in the cementitious matrix, but additional inhomogeneities may be represented by fibres. Firstly, a two-parameter fracture model based on Mode I analytical expressions of the linear elastic fracture mechanics is employed. Then, in order to take into account the possible crack deflection as a result of the above inhomogeneities, a modified version of such a model is here discussed.

At introductory chapters there is given a more general summarisation of knowledge and experience gained from literature and own experiments. As analysed at chapter No. 2, theoretical derivation of properties of short fibre composites with omnidirectional orientation of fibres is very complicated. That is why experimental processes are still used to examine their final mechanic-physical properties. At the paper, the experimental program dealing with an influence of a few factors, such a dosage and type of fibres, treatment of test speciments and speed of loading on final properties of the composite, is presented in more details. An influence ot two types of short PP fibres (length 12 mm) on properties of fine-grained cement mortar is followed. Thin monofilament fibres (T) are compared with thicker foil <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibres</b> (F). Especially their influence on energy of rupture is analysed in more details. In the frame of suggested experimental program, possibilities of measuring and evaluation of energy of rupture not only from deflection of specimens according to RILEM draft but also from crack opening (CMOD method) were verified successfully. Simultaneously it was managed to gain and evaluate stress-strain diagrams of bending tests with high speed of loading, where the time up to reaching of maximum strength is 0, 5 - 1 sec.

The changes of the fibre surface due to fibrillation can be followed optically or by handle changes. In the paper a new method for observing the changes of optical properties of lyocell fibres influenced by fibre fibrillation is given. The analyses were performed on Tencel fabrics.

Within {{the last}} decade, {{a new class}} of civil engineering materials referred to as High Performance Fibre Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC) has been developed. As a subset in this new field, additions of polypropylene (PP) fibres, in the form of woven textile fabrics, have proved most successful as reinforcement to cementitious matrices, leading {{to the development of a}} novel composite material: so called "Textile Concrete" (TC). Although the strength and modulus of PP are not very high, careful design through the appropriate placement and high fibre volume fraction of a textile format, has led to sufficient strength and stiffness, while at the same time high toughness has been achieved. In particular the development of a <b>fibrillated</b> core <b>fibre</b> to which is attached an outer layer of ultrasonically welded, or bonded "fluffy" PP fibres, has been most successful, and is a unique feature. These outer fluffy layers provide excellent physical bonding characteristics to the cement matrix, thus overcoming the intrinsic hydrophobic nature and otherwise weak matrix bonding of PP fibres.

40|$|The {{large amount}} of used {{polypropylene}} baler twine generated from the agricultural community may provide a low-cost, environmentally friendly source of fibre reinforcement {{that can be used}} to improve the properties of concrete. However, the performance of such fibres for the application has not yet been explored. The effectiveness of using small amounts of chopped baler twine to control the restrained plastic shrinkage cracking of portland cement mortar was investigated in this study. To determine the influence of baler twine fibre type, length and volume fraction on their performance, two types of baler twine (one composed of strands with circular cross section, the other composed of flat band shape strands) in two lengths (19 mm and 38 mm) and three volume fractions (0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 3 %) were evaluated. To compare the performance of baler twine fibre with that of other commercially available synthetic <b>fibres,</b> <b>fibrillated</b> polypropylene <b>fibres</b> at equal lengths and volume fractions was investigated. The restrained plastic shrinkage tests were carried out by subjecting the fibre-reinforced mortar specimens, cast on rough substrate bases, to a wind speed of 2. 6 m/s, and relative humidity less than 3 % at 35 °C for 22 hours. To evaluate the effectiveness of the fibres, the crack numbers were recorded, and the maximum crack width and total crack area on the surface of each specimen were measured using an image analysis technique. Unrestrained plastic shrinkage tests were also conducted in which fibre-reinforced mortar specimens without the substrate bases were tested under the same environmental conditions. Test results indicate that both types of baler twine are capable of controlling restrained plastic shrinkage cracking to some extent, but are not as effective as fibrillated polypropylene. The baler twine composed of band shape strands performed better than the one composed of strands with circular cross section. Compared with plain specimens, the total crack area was reduced by 95. 3, 77. 5 and 38. 7 % when 0. 3 % volume fraction of 38 mm fibrillated polypropylene, band shape baler twine and circular baler twine fibres, respectively, were added. Similar reductions in maximum crack width were observed. Fibre length did not significantly influence cracking behaviour.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to explore the possible ways of using the intrinsic properties of cellulosic pulp fibres and inorganic pigments, by combining these elements using non-standard procedures, {{as a means to}} engineer a new composite material – a novel uncoated woodfree paper with improved physical properties. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) was used as the inorganic pigment in this study. To accomplish this objective, we conducted a preliminary study on web addition followed by detailed studies on in-situ precipitation in fibrillated pulp suspensions and blending of novel furnish materials. We evaluated the different technological approaches by analysing the production process and product quality. In the first approach, chemical precipitation and spraying of filler dispersion onto a fibrous web, and mechanically pressing to assist penetration into the network, were compared against conventional filler dosage before web forming. The results showed that web addition approach results in higher tensile strength and lower light scattering of paper. Filler agglomeration and optical crowding, in chemical precipitation and web application respectively, resulted in significantly deteriorating the light scattering of the handsheets. The experimental conditions were not sufficient to obtain an even distribution of filler along the thickness direction of paper and the filler characteristics were not optimised in this study. In the second technique, precipitation onto fibrillated pulp suspensions was investigated by varying the pulp substrate, PCC crystal structure, and pre-refining a mixture of pulp and milk of lime. According to the research findings, PCCs formed by precipitation of calcium carbonate onto cellulosic fibrils and fibres do not necessarily have the same characteristics as reference PCCs formed by carbonizing milk of lime. Precipitation of calcium carbonate onto <b>fibrillated</b> <b>fibres</b> and microfines increases the retention of filler but impairs the dewatering of handsheets during pressing. Higher amount of fibrillated cellulosic substrates in combination with appropriate filler morphology, scalenohedral or rhombohedral, contribute to increased bond strength and light scattering of traditional fine paper. Pre-refining a mixture of pulp and calcium hydroxide results in grinding of lime, and hence, the composites have a greater surface area than the reference filler. Composite filled handsheets, from this study, exhibited high light scattering. In the third method, the microfines-filler composite was envisioned as the backbone structure for a new composite material – uncoated fine paper. In the new composite paper, strength properties arise from the microfibrillated cellulose, bulk and pores originate from the filler surrounded by fibrils, whereas tear strength is imparted by a minimal proportion of pulp fibres in the composite. Compared to conventional fibre based fine paper, even at high filler loading the new composite material showed higher bending stiffness, tensile and tear indices, internal bond strength, light scattering and brightness properties. The new concept of fines-pigment-based furnish enables us to load pigments in uncoated wood free paper up to 50 %- 60 %. However, dewatering time is considerably longer. This method needs to be optimised, with further research on dewatering, and printability, before scaling it to an industrial process. This study shows the potential of different approaches, novel furnish components and addition of pigment onto a formed web, in the creation of new composite fine paper. Novel composite structure for fine paper can be achieved by employing the smallest component of pulp fibres, cellulosic microfines, in combination with pigments. The characteristics of microfines and crystal structure of pigments are important control variables in the formation and properties of the new composite paper. On the other hand, cellulosic microfines are highly swollen and retard dewatering. Therefore, further optimisation of process methodology and product quality can be expected to lead to some useful advances in commercialisation of this technology...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{assessment}} of the allergenic potential towards wool products from indoor living areas (e. g. carpets, bedding and insulating material) with skin contact and with contact by the respiratory tract for inhale particles. New and used wool products were characterised with protein chemical methods (amino acid analysis and SDS gel electrophoresis). The processing agents (e. g. flame retarding and mothproofing agents) and substances like pesticides were characterised with analytic methods. The long-term use of wool products from indoor living areas can lead to changes of the products. Mechanical influence is important by carpets and is leading to damages {{on the surface of the}} carpet and the wool <b>fibres.</b> <b>Fibrillates</b> wool <b>fibres</b> were found. Thermal influence is important by insulating material and beddings and is leading only to small changes on the wool fibre surface. By insulating material humidity could not provoke the building of mildew. Mite contamination was founded by several beddings. This mite contamination must be involved by the investigation of the allergenic potential. The changes of the wool products generated by thermal influences are be simulated by an artificial thermal ageing process. The wool before and after ageing is not significantly different in the composition of the amino acids. But it was found a significantly decrease in the band pattern in the area of the KIF. This decrease was caused by new protein cross linkage (lanthionine and isodipeptide linkage (epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine). The changes of the processing agents are characterised by analytical methods. During the long-term use of the products dust particles can be produced. The building of dust was simulated by laboratory tests for mechanical weakly influenced products (e. g. insulating material, bedding) and mechanical strongly influenced products (e. g. carpets). Wool dust is a complex mixture of the wool, inorganic and organic compounds from the processing agents and substances of the environment. The dust particles of wool fibres are wool fibre fragments of different dimension, cortical cells, cortical fragments, polygonal cuticular cells and cuticular cell fragments. The total airborne dust and the fine airborne dust of a carpet were collected with a dust sampler. The collected dust was characterised. The investigation of the solubility of wool and wool dust was made with physiological model solution under in-vitro-conditions. The model solution of sweat and bronchial fluid are modified with enzymes for simulate the enzymatic activity of human fluids. The incubation of beddings with synthetic enzyme free and modified sweat solution solved only a small amount of proteins (max. 1 %). The soluble proteins show a great similarity to the PCL of the wool and the endocuticula. The incubation of dust of insulating materials and carpets with enzyme free and modified solution for the extracellular and intracellular lung solution solved only a small amount of proteins (max. 2 %). The soluble proteins show a substantial similarity to the PCL and the endocuticula and by the use of the enzyme trypsine to the proteins of the medulla and of the intermediarfilaments.

40|$|One of {{the major}} cost factors in {{mechanical}} pulp production is the electrical energy input. Much of the {{research in this field}} has therefore been devoted {{to an understanding of the}} mechanisms in the refining process and, consequently, to find ways of reducing the electrical energy consumption. Shear and compression are probably the main types of fibre deformation occurring in refiners for collapsing and <b>fibrillating</b> the <b>fibres</b> into a suitable pulp. In current refiners, the repeated mechanical action of the bars on the fibres consumes large amounts of energy in a treatment of mechanical fibres that is almost random. Fundamental studies of the deformation of wood have indicated that a combination of shearing and compression forces is highly beneficial in terms of fibre deformation with a low energy demand. Pure compression is able to permanently deform the fibre but requires a substantial amount of work, while pure shearing, although being much less energy demanding, does not lead to any permanent deformations. A more suitable application of the shear and compression forces on the wood fibres during the refining process could be a way to develop fibres at a lower energy demand. These ideas have been studied in this work trying to find new ways of saving energy in the mechanical pulping process. The first paper in this thesis discusses the way of producing wood shavings and the introduction of shear/compression deformations in these, as well as the potential benefits of using them instead of wood chips as raw material for TMP production. With the shaving process, high deformations in the wood cells were achieved by the shear and compression forces. This led to energy savings of about 25 % at a given tensile index, when compared to traditional chips. The quality of the pulp produced from wood shavings was found to be better than that of the pulp produced from wood chips, when it came to strength properties (except for tear index) and optical properties at comparable energy levels. Another way of reducing energy consumption in refining involving a limited shear combined with compression forces for the mechanical treatment of both wood chips and coarse fibres was also studied. This work shows that such a kind of treatment resulted in a high degree of fibre collapse at low energy demands. The thick-walled transition fibres could even be permanently deformed. Furthermore, refining trials, utilising shear and compression pre-treated chips, showed that the strength properties, except for tear index, along with the optical properties of a TMP could be improved and the electrical energy consumed could be reduced by approx. 100 kWh/tonne, when compared to untreated chips. The results from the pilot trials described in this work could be used as a starting point for further implementation in the industry, in order to identify the most efficient way of producing mechanical pulp with a lower consumption of electrical energy.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis was to obtain new information about mechanisms of thermomechanical pulp refining in the inner area of a refiner disc gap by studying inter-fibre refining and by calculating the distribution of energy consumption in the refiner disc gap. The energy consumption of thermomechanical pulping process is very high although theoretically {{a small amount of}} energy is needed to create new fibre surfaces. Mechanisms of refining have been widely studied {{in order to understand the}} high energy consumption of the process, however, phenomena in the inner area of disc gap has had less attention. It is likely that this important position is causing high energy consumption due to the high residence time of pulp located there. The power distribution as a function of the refiner disc gap was calculated in this work. The calculation was based on mass and energy balances, as well as temperature and consistency profiles determined by mill trials. The power distribution was found to be dependent on segment geometry and the refining stage. However, in the first stage refiner with standard refiner segments, a notable amount of power was consumed in the inner area of the disc gap. Fibre-to-fibre refining is likely to be the most important mechanism in the inner area of disc gap from the point of view of energy consumption. In this work the inter-fibre refining was studied using equipment for shear and compression. Fibre-to-fibre refining was found to be an effective way to refine fibres from coarse pulp to separated, <b>fibrillated</b> and peeled <b>fibres</b> if frictional forces inside the compressed pulp were high enough. It was proposed that high energy of today’s thermomechanical pulping process could derive from too low frictional forces that heated pulp and evaporated water without any changes in fibre structure. The method to calculate power distribution and results of fibre-to-fibre refining experiments may give ideas for developing today’s thermomechanical pulp refiners’ or for developing totally new energy saving mechanical pulping processes...|$|R
