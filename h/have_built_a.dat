5|$|Siward {{is said to}} <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> church {{dedicated}} to St Olaf at Galmanho, York. The record of his burial in this church is the only notice of a non-royal lay burial inside a church in pre-Norman England. Siward's Howe, i.e., Heslington Hill near York, was most likely named after Earl Siward, although probably because Siward held popular courts there rather than because it was his burial place.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan Tamils in India {{are mostly}} {{refugees}} of about over 100,000 in special camps and another 50,000 {{outside of the}} camps. In western European countries, the refugees and immigrants have integrated themselves into society where permitted. Tamil British singer M.I.A (born Mathangi Arulpragasam) and BBC journalist George Alagiah are, among others, notable people of Sri Lankan Tamil descent. Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> number of prominent Hindu temples across North America and Europe, notably in Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, and the UK.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Castle {{was built}} during this period. There are two {{possible}} dates for the construction: William the Conqueror may <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> castle at Cardiff {{as early as}} 1081 on his return from his pilgrimage to St Davids. Alternatively, the first Norman fortification may have been constructed around 1091 by Robert Fitzhamon, the lord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon invaded the region in 1090, and used the castle {{as a base for}} the occupation of the rest of southern Glamorgan over the next few years. The site was close to the sea and could be easily supplied by ship, was well protected by the Rivers Taff and Rhymney and also controlled the old Roman road running along the coast.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{surviving}} evidence, {{it is likely that}} Halton Hill was a settlement in prehistoric times. Following the Norman conquest, the Barony of Halton was established by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester. The first baron to be appointed was Nigel of Cotentin and it is almost certain that he would <b>have</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> motte and bailey castle on the site, constructing it from wood, although the excavations in 1986–87 showed no evidence of a motte and bailey structure or of a timber tower or palisade. It is most probable that during the 12thcentury the wooden structure was replaced by a castle built from the local sandstone although no documentary evidence of this remains. Details of the building works are obscure but {{it has been suggested that}} John of Gaunt, the 14thbaron, made alterations to the castle but this again has not been confirmed by documentary evidence. When the 15thbaron, Henry Bolingbroke, ascended the throne as KingHenryIV, the castle became the property of the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|E
