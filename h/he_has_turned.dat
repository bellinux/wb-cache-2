25|$|When {{analyzing}} these 12 lines, Sethna {{suggests that}} the lovely boy is becoming substantially older in years with out losing any beauty; in fact he is increasing with beauty: he has grown by waning, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> more boyishly lovely as the span of his life lessens further and further. Sethna believes that the boy's lack of aging underscores Shakespeare's aging, and Shakespeare's aging highlight's nature's ability to ignore Time in the boy's case. This is emphasized by Nature's capacity to foil Time's destructiveness. Nonetheless, the capacity can only last so long.|$|E

500|$|Chen plays a {{wide variety}} of video games, but he names his {{greatest}} influences as Katamari Damacy, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. He also names Final Fantasy VII as an influence, and the game that he took his adopted name from. He personally plays games [...] "competitively", including titles such as Street Fighter IV and StarCraft. He feels he has a competitive nature, which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> towards [...] "winning" [...] at being a game designer by creating games that are unlike what is in the market rather than towards creating competitive games. As he was raised in China and works in America, Chen feels that he cannot fully relate to either culture as a game designer. As such, instead of trying to make games that fit perfectly with one culture he tries to make games that tap into feelings that are universal and independent of culture.|$|E
500|$|... 4chan {{is one of}} the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, {{according}} to the Los Angeles Times. 4chan's Alexa rank is generally around 700, though it has been as high as number 56 at times. It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of bandwidth; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site online, so <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> to advertising to help make ends meet. However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who {{do not want to be}} associated with the site's content. In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt and the site was continuing to lose money. The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.|$|E

500|$|Schwimmer {{made his}} directorial feature {{debut in the}} 2007 British comedy film Run Fatboy Run. The film stars Simon Pegg {{as a man who}} signs up for a {{marathon}} (he is out of shape) to convince his former fiancée and five-year-old son that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> his life around. When asked why he decided to direct the film, Schwimmer said: [...] "As a director, I was struck by the challenge that I thought the script presented, which was that it was kind of three films in one. You had some great, big physical comedy, and I thought funny dialogue and characters. And then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect". Run Fatboy Run garnered mixed reception, with the New York Daily News rating it one-and-a-half out of five stars and writing, [...] "Most disappointing is how Schwimmer—who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with hyperverbal characters—manages to bumble 'Fatboy's' tender moments". USA Today, however, was favorable towards Schwimmer, reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse [...] "having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera". For his directorial work, he was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Debut Director.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit [...]285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an American League rookie and was the most by a Major League rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen base count, which led the AL, also broke a {{franchise}} record (previously set by Miguel Diloné in 1980). Indians first base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped {{learn how to be}} successful with bunting. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen bases' record, recording 70 (which led the MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, [...] "I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast." [...] Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, [...] "He went from a guy who could hardly get the ball past the infield to a guy who could hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> into a dominant player." [...] The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his [...]349 batting average would be a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, [...] "What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise." [...] Lofton would join fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form [...] "the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any." ...|$|E
