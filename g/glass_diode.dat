50|$|During {{automated}} SMT pick-and-place, {{this happens}} mostly if the mechanical {{pressure of the}} SMD placer nozzle is too low. If the MELF components are placed into the solder paste with enough pressure, then this problem can be minimized. Care must be taken with <b>glass</b> <b>diodes</b> which are less mechanically robust than resistors and other MELF components.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} optical mice detected {{movement on}} pre-printed mousepad surfaces. Whereas modern optical mice work on most opaque diffusely reflective surfaces like paper, they usually aren't {{able to detect}} movement on specularly reflective surfaces like polished stone; coherently-lit (laser) mice can function even on such glossy surfaces, but perform poorly on transparent surfaces; dark field illumination allows mice to function reliably even on <b>glass.</b> Laser <b>diodes</b> are also used for better resolution and precision. Battery-powered wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.|$|R
40|$|A CMOS-compatible {{method for}} {{application}} of integrated optical circuits to silicon through PECVD and RIE was developed. High- reproducibility and high-efficiency circuit prototypes such as integrated interferometers were manufactured. The circuit dimensions {{were reduced to}} chip size. A process-compatible method for integration of optical circuits by means of micromechnanical elements (bridges, resonators) was developed, and a method for effective <b>glass</b> fiber/laser <b>diode</b> coupling was tested. A mature technology for integrated optical sensors on silicon was made available. (orig.)

The revised topics include <b>glasses,</b> sol–gel, light-emitting <b>diodes,</b> nanoparticles, metal–organic frameworks, coordination polymers, thin films, energy transfer processes, upconversion and development of new theoretical tools. The important role played by Prof. Oscar L.

50|$|Diode lasers {{wavelengths}} in the 810-1,100 nm range {{are poorly}} {{absorbed by the}} soft tissues such as the gingivae, and cannot be used for soft tissue cutting or ablation. Instead, the distal end of <b>diode’s</b> <b>glass</b> fiber is charred (by burned ink or by burned corkwood, etc.) and the char is heated by the 810-1,100 nm laser beam, which in turn heats up the glass fiber’ tip. The soft tissue is cut, on contact, by the hot charred glass tip and not by the laser beam.|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{operation}} of 1024 channel diode arrays (Model AXUV- 1024, from IRD, Inc.) in subdued room light to establish that they worked and to determine the direction and speed of the scan of the 1024 channels. Further tests were performed in vacuum in the HAP, High-Average-Power Facility. There {{we found that the}} bare or <b>glass</b> covered <b>diodes</b> detected primarily visible light as expected, but diodes filtered by aluminized parylene, produced a signal consistent with soft x-rays. It is probable that the spectral response and sensitivity, as discussed below, reproduce that previously demonstrated by 1 to 16 channel VUV-photodiodes; however, significantly more effort would be required to establish that experimentally. These detectors appear to be worth further evaluation where 25 w spatial resolution bolometers or spectrograph detectors of known sensitivity are required, and single-shot or 0. 02 - 0. 2 s time response is adequate. (Presumably, faster readout would be available with custom drive circuitry. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} p-WSe 2 /n-MoS 2 {{heterojunction}} diodes fabricated both on glass and SiO 2 /p+-Si substrates. The electrostatic performance {{and stability of}} our diode were successfully improved toward ideal current-voltage (I-V) behavior by adopting the fluoropolymer CYTOP encapsulation layer on top of our diode; reduction of reverse-bias leakage current and enhancement of forward-bias on current were achieved along with good aging stability in air ambient. Such performance improvement is attributed to the intrinsic properties of CYTOP materials with C-F bonds whose strong dipole moment causes hole accumulation, while the strong hydrophobicity of CYTOP would prevent ambient molecule adsorption on 2 D semiconductor surface. Moreover, fabricated on <b>glass,</b> our p-n <b>diode</b> displayed good dynamic rectification at over 100 Hz, without displacement current-induced signal overshoot/undershoot which was shown in the other diode on SiO 2 /p+-Si. Little I-V hysteresis in our diode is another benefit of glass substrate. We conclude that our CYTOP-encapsulated WSe 2 /MoS 2 p-n <b>diode</b> on <b>glass</b> is a high performance and ambient stable 2 D nanodevice toward future advanced electronics...|$|R
40|$|We {{have worked}} on a project 'optical {{microwave}} generation for mobile communications' {{in the context of}} the BMBF Project line 'PHOTONIK II' together with the Heinrich Hertz Institut (HHI). The task of Bosch were in the area of microwave engineering. For the estimation of the results and for promotion issues we have built working demonstrator systems at 18 GHz and 60 GHz. We have estimated the characteristics of the mobile radiofrequency channel at 60 GHz and have analyzed suitable modulation methods. An optical path which is built with laser <b>diodes,</b> <b>glass</b> fiber and photodetector has been integrated in a radio relay system from Bosch. With this system we have realized a bidirectional data transmission at 155 MBit/s with an OQPSK modulation at 18 GHz. For the Demonstrator at 60 GHz we have created a radio basestation and radio mobile station with waveguide components. Based on a power budget for a cellular radio communication network we have developed a hemisspherical antenna. The measurements of the antenna match the simulations very well and show the suitability for a cellular network at 60 GHz. (orig.)

40|$|The {{crystallization}} of Si thin-film on <b>glass</b> using continuous-wave <b>diode</b> laser is performed. The {{effect of}} various processing parameters including laser power density and scanning speed is investigated {{in respect to}} microstructure and crystallographic orientation. Optimal laser power as per scanning speed is {{required in order to}} completely melt the entire Si film. When scan speed of 15 – 100 cm/min is used, large linear grains are formed along the laser scan direction. Laser scan speed over 100 cm/min forms relatively smaller grains that are titled away from the scan direction. Two diode model fitting of Suns-Voc results have shown that solar cells crystallized with scan speed over 100 cm/min are limited by grain boundary recombination (n = 2). EBSD micrograph shows that the most dominant misorientation angle is 60 °. Also, there were regions containing high density of twin boundaries up to ~ 1. 2 × 10 - 8 /cm 2. SiOx capping layer is found to be effective for reducing the required laser power density, as well as changing preferred orientation of the film from ⟨ 110 ⟩ to ⟨ 100 ⟩ in surface normal direction. Cracks are always formed during the crystallization process and found to be reducing solar cell performance significantly...|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{sulphide}} (ZnS) {{quantum dots}} (QDs) were synthesized successfully via simple sonochemical method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis revealed the average size of QDs {{of the order of}} 3. 7 nm. The band gap of the QDs was tuned to 5. 2 eV by optimizing the synthesis parameters. UV-Vis absorption spectra of ZnS QD confirm the quantum confinement effect. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed the formation of single phase ZnS QDs. To fabricate the diode, blend of ZnS QDs and P 3 HT was prepared and the heterojunction of PEDOT:PSS and the blend was formed by spin coating on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated <b>glass</b> substrate. The <b>diode</b> behaviour of the heterojunction was analysed, wherein the ideality factor was found to be 2. 53 with turn on voltage 0. 75 V and the barrier height was found to be 1. 429 eV. ZnS-Graphene QDs nanocomposite was characterised for the surface morphological study. It was found that the synthesized ZnS QDs appear as quasi spherical particles on the graphene sheets. The average particle size of ZnS-graphene nanocomposite QDs was found to be 8. 4 nm. From voltage-current characteristics of ZnS-graphene nanocomposites, it is observed that the conductivity of the composite increases by 104 times the conductivity of ZnS QDs. Thus the addition of graphene QDs in ZnS QDs enhances the mobility of the charge carriers in the composite material. Thus, the graphene QDs, with high specific area for a large interface, high mobility and tunable band gap, show a great potential as an electron-acceptors in photovoltaic devices...|$|R
