25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad that I did not think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow I would make it. He kept me.|$|E
500|$|At {{the close}} of Grant's two terms as {{president}} in 1877, the Republican-controlled Congress suggested that Grant {{not return to the}} White House for a third term. Grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife Julia, [...] "I {{do not want to be}} here [...] another four years. I do not think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> it." [...] After Grant left the White House, he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to travel around the world. A biographer from the New York Herald, John Russell Young, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant. Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking, China.|$|E

The travelling didn't tire me much and I never had {{to be left out}} of the team. I think I should like to live in England, though I don't know whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> the cold in the winter." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What's that to you?" [...] said I savagely, for {{my heart}} was sore and heavy, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stand</b> the {{interference}} of a stranger.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stand</b> it, and I {{got up to}} go away, feeling {{extremely}} particeps criminis. Mrs. Makely {{seemed to}} have a conscience as light as air.|$|R
2500|$|Margarita's {{father wanted}} her to become a {{professional}} dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, [...] "From the time I was {{three and a half}} … as soon as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> on my own feet, I was given dance lessons." [...] She noted [...] "I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood".|$|E
2500|$|During the {{impeachment}} trial, the BBC {{reported that she}} was [...] "widely regarded as the shining star of the defense team, and gave an effective presentation on President Clinton's behalf {{on the second day}} of defense arguments." [...] Other media outlets also viewed her work quite favorably. Her presentation to the Senate focused on refuting the obstruction of justice charge and the House Managers' claim that failure to convict the President would damage the rule of law. [...] Her summation became known for its endorsement of Clinton's record with respect towards women and minorities; she said, [...] "I stand here before you today because President Bill Clinton believed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> here for him ... I'm not worried about civil rights, because this President's record on civil rights, on women's rights, on all of our rights is unimpeachable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mohammad Shirvani, {{a fellow}} filmmaker and close friend, quoted Kiarostami on his Facebook wall June 8, 2016: [...] "I {{do not believe}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> and direct any more films. They [...] {{destroyed}} it [...]" [...] After this comment, a campaign {{was set up by}} Iranians on both Twitter and Facebook to investigate the possibility of medical error during Kiarostami's procedure. However, Ahmad Kiarostami, his eldest son, denied any medical error in his father's treatment after Shirvani's comment and said that his father's health was no cause for alarm. After Kiarostami's death, Head of the Iranian Medical Council Dr. Alireza Zali sent a letter to his French counterpart, Patrick Bouet, urging him to send Kiarostami's medical file to Iran for further investigation. Nine days after Kiarostami's death, on July 13, 2016, his family issued a formal complaint of medical maltreatment through Kiarostami's personal doctor. Dariush Mehrjui, famous Iranian cinema director also criticized the medical team that treated Kiarostami and demanded legal action.|$|E

6000|$|At {{this point}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> no more. I interrupted--"Provided it were fired from Philadelphia," [...] I said, and {{passed into the}} smoking-car.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did notice it, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stand</b> that drive. And, even if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be {{got to the}} train, to go North, I {{should have}} to walk a good deal at the stations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, come, Woody, don't get on {{your high}} horse," [...] was Stumpy's response, as he swung back in the rocker he occupied. [...] "You know <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> your high-toned ways." ...|$|R

60|$|ACIS. Just so, mam. Art is not honest: {{that is why}} <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> much of it. It is all make-believe. Ecrasia {{never really}} says things: she only rattles her teeth in her mouth.|$|R
