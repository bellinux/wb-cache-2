5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} innovations brought by the 1996 protocol is the codification of the [...] "precautionary approach" [...] and the [...] "polluter pays principle." [...] Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called [...] "reverse list" [...] approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 ("the reverse list") of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this reverse list requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures {{to ensure that the}} issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of reverse list substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the reverse list include dredged material; sewage sludge; industrial fish processing waste; vessels and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of <b>incineration</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or <b>incineration</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E

40|$|Increasing waste {{production}} by human activities increased {{the problem of}} how to get rid of it without causing undesirable impact on the environment and human. In principal land disposal is more popular than other means, including landfills, <b>incineration,</b> and, dumping <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> because it is relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, land disposal of these wastes is a potential risk for human safety due to the inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals borne in these wastes. Concern about metal contamination of soils relates directly to the extent to which natural background levels are exceeded and to the mobility of these metals in terms of bioavailability to plants and to movement to ground water...|$|R

2500|$|PCBs are {{technically}} attractive {{because of}} their inertness, which includes their resistance to combustion. [...] Nonetheless, they can be effectively destroyed by <b>Incineration</b> <b>at</b> 1000°C. [...] When combusted at lower temperatures, they convert in part to more hazardous materials, including dibenzofurans and dibenzodioxins. When conducted properly, the combustion products are water, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen chloride. In some cases, the PCBs are combusted as a solution in kerosene. PCBs have also been destroyed by pyrolysis {{in the presence of}} alkali metal carbonates.|$|R

The nerve agents at Site 59, were removed under Operation Steel Box in 1990. These agents were transported by truck, rail and ship ultimately ending up at Johnston Atoll for <b>incineration</b> <b>at</b> the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System facility.|$|R
30|$|The {{lyophilized}} truffle {{samples were}} analyzed for proteins, fat, carbohydrates and ash, using the AOAC (1995) procedures. The {{crude protein content}} (N ×  4.38) of the samples was estimated by the macro-Kjeldahl method; the crude fat was determined by extracting a known weight of powdered sample with petroleum ether, using a Soxhlet apparatus; the ash content was determined by <b>incineration</b> <b>at</b> 600  ±  15  °C. Total carbohydrates were calculated by difference. Energy was calculated according to the following equation: energy (kcal) =  4  × (g proteins + g carbohydrates) +  9  × (g fat).|$|R
