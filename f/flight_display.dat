5|$|The Patrouille Suisse flight {{demonstration}} {{team were}} prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades. Squadron aircraft were fitted with smoke generators {{on the engine}} exhausts and, later on, were painted in a distinctive red-and-white livery. The group officially formed on 22 August 1964, and used the Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994, the team continued to perform <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> using newer aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The flight {{instruments}} in the B.1 were traditional and included G4B compasses; Mk.4 artificial horizons; and zero reader <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> instruments. The B.1 had a Smiths Mk10 autopilot. In the B.2, these features were incorporated into the Smiths Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots' components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and a Mk.10A or Mk.10B autopilot. From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the ARI 5959 Terrain-following radar (TFR), built by General Dynamics, its commands being fed into the director-horizons.|$|E
5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging <b>flight</b> <b>display.</b> The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E

In November 2008, the company announced that it would be offering an Aspen Avionics glass cockpit primary <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> as an option on the DA20. Diamond indicated the Aspen PFD would be easy to incorporate into the existing instrument panel design because it mounts in a standard round instrument hole. In October 2009, the company introduced the Garmin G500 glass cockpit as an option.|$|E

50|$|Injury-feigning, {{including}} broken-wing and impeded <b>flight</b> <b>displays,</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} common forms of distraction. In broken-wing displays, birds that are at the nest walk away from it with wings quivering so as to appear as an easy target for a predator. Such injury-feigning displays are particularly well known in nesting waders and plovers, but also have been documented in other species, including snowy owls, the alpine accentor, and the mourning dove. Impeded <b>flight</b> <b>displays</b> additionally may suggest an injured wing, but through an airborne display.|$|R

25|$|There is {{a rental}} car {{facility}} located in an annex {{on the ground floor}} of the parking deck. Eight rental car companies are housed within this facility. The airport offers a parking deck with over 5000 spaces available for hourly and daily parking. A remote lot is available for long term parking, with over 700 spaces. A shuttle runs between the terminal and the remote lot continuously throughout the day. There is also a free cell phone waiting lot with a digital <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> for people waiting on arriving passengers.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1973 oil crisis, oil and gas companies began exploration and extraction activities farther offshore, thus creating a long-term need for more capable rotary aircraft. The development of the EC225, an enlarged variant of the AS332 Super Puma, was announced by Eurocopter in June 1998. The principal differences of the EC225 from the preceding AS332 are the adoption of Spheriflex rotor technology and new Turbomeca Makila 2A turboshaft engines, along with a redesigned main gearbox to accommodate the rotor and engine changes, and the addition of an integrated <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> system; these changes resulted in higher speeds and passenger comfort, as well as greater flight safety and reduced operating costs.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1952, the prototype, G-ALUN, {{conducted}} its maiden flight, piloted by Geoffrey Tyson. The initial flight {{lasted for}} 35 minutes, {{in which the}} flying boat performed a complete circumnavigation of the Isle of Wight. According to aviation author Phillip Kaplan, the Princess has not been intended to fly that day at all and only taxiing tests {{had been scheduled to}} take place, and that Tyson had decided to proceed due to the excellent conditions present on the day. The prototype was quickly put through several test flights with the hope of being able to sufficiently ready the flying boat to appear at the 1952 Farnborough Airshow, however indications of engine reliability issues were encountered and this led to the intended <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> at Farnborough that year being abandoned.|$|E
500|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} is {{sexually mature}} when aged one year, and starts its courtship behaviour in the following December. It has a fluttering <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> in which the male flies with shallow wingbeats and a spread tail. He calls in flight and may land at a prospective nest-site. The [...] pair excavate a new hole at least [...] above the ground and usually lower than , although sometimes much higher. The chosen site is normally a tree, alive or dead, occasionally a utility pole or nest box. Old holes are rarely re-used, although the same tree {{may be used for}} nesting for several years. The nest cavity is [...] deep with an entrance hole [...] wide. It is excavated by both sexes, the male doing most of the chiselling. As with other woodpeckers, the hole is unlined, although wood chips from the excavation may cover the base of the cavity.|$|E

500|$|The F-16 has a {{head-up display}} (HUD), which {{projects}} visual flight and combat information {{in front of}} the pilot without obstructing the view; being able to keep his head [...] "out of the cockpit" [...] improves a pilot's situation awareness. [...] Further flight and systems information are displayed on multi-function displays (MFD). The left-hand MFD is the primary <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> (PFD), typically showing radar and moving-maps; the right-hand MFD is the system display (SD), presenting information about the engine, landing gear, slat and flap settings, and fuel and weapons status. Initially, the F-16A/B had monochrome cathode ray tube (CRT) displays; replaced by color liquid-crystal displays on the Block 50/52. [...] The MLU introduced compatibility with night-vision goggles (NVG). The Boeing Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) is available from Block 40 onwards, for targeting based on where the pilot's head faces, unrestricted by the HUD, using high-off-boresight missiles like the AIM-9X.|$|E

2500|$|SR22s and SR20s {{built before}} 2003 were {{equipped}} with traditional analog instruments and a 10" [...] Multi-function display (MFD). In February 2003, Cirrus began offering SR22s with the Avidyne Entegra primary <b>flight</b> <b>display</b> (PFD), making the plane {{the first of}} its kind to come with a glass cockpit. Later that year, this instrumentation became standard equipment on all SR-series aircraft and helped pioneer the use of glass cockpits in the light general aviation industry. Retrofits are available for the older aircraft that replace the instrument panels with one that includes the PFD, a new MFD and the installation of back-up mechanical instruments.|$|E

2500|$|Based on a {{preliminary}} review of FDR data, the NTSB stated {{there was no}} anomalous behavior of the engines, the autopilot, the flight director, or the autothrottle. The autothrottle control {{was found to be}} in the [...] "armed" [...] position during documentation of cockpit levers and switches, differing from both the [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] positions. Furthermore, the pilot flying's flight director (Primary <b>Flight</b> <b>Display)</b> was deactivated whereas the instructor pilot's was activated (this may prove to be significant, as deactivating neither or both Flight Directors enables and forces an autothrottle [...] "wake-up" [...] whereas deactivating only one Flight Director inhibits an autothrottle [...] "wake-up"). All three fire handles were extended; these operate safety equipment intended to put out fires on the aircraft (a handle for each engine and the auxiliary power unit). The speedbrake lever was down, showing it was not being used.|$|E
