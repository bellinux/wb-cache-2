5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take on an even more complex <b>helicopter</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Early {{concepts}} {{included both}} utility and scout/attack versions, but by 1988 the utility concept was dropped. [...] A Request for proposals {{for the new}} <b>helicopter</b> <b>type</b> was released in June 1988. In October 1988, the Boeing-Sikorsky and Bell-McDonnell Douglas teams received contracts for their designs. [...] The Bell-McDonnell Douglas design featured ordnance carriage within a combined wing/sponson and instead of a tail rotor used a NOTAR ducted exhaust system. The Boeing-Sikorsky design carried ordnance within upward swinging gull-wing doors in {{the sides of the}} fuselage and featured a fenestron tail rotor. The program's name was changed to Light Helicopter (LH) in 1990. [...] In April 1991, the Boeing-Sikorsky team was selected as the contest winner and received a contract to build four prototypes. [...] Also that month, the helicopter was designated [...] "RAH-66 Comanche" [...] by the Army.|$|E
