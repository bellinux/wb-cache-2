40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of Swedish and Scandinavian investor sentiment on the net asset value discounts of closed-end <b>investment</b> <b>companies.</b> While previous studies have linked sentiment to discounts, both Scandinavian and Swedish evidence is lacking. The study contributes to existing literature by further developing the methodology by Baker & Wurgler (2006) to examine the investor sentiment effect brought forward by Lee et al. (1991) in a Scandinavian setting. In particular, this study offers additional evidence to Hjelström (2007) regarding the aggregate discounts of closed-end <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> in Swedish capital markets. Unlike previous studies, I provide evidence on individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> and consider both regional and local sentiment as an explanatory factor. DATA The investor sentiment data set covers quarterly data for stock mutual fund inflows, trading volume for aggregate equity markets, and the number and first-day returns of all main-list IPOs within the time period of 1. 1. 1999 to 31. 3. 2011 separately for Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. The net asset value data set covers 854 quarter-end net asset value discounts (or premiums) of 20 closed-end <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> during the same time period. Both of the novel datasets were manually collected from multiple sources. RESULTS My main findings indicate that the aggregate net asset value discount of closed-end <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> is not a sentiment indicator. I show that investor sentiment does not affect aggregate discounts but rather affects the discounts of individual closed-end <b>investment</b> <b>companies.</b> Furthermore, sentiment affects the discounts of individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> in conflicting ways (i. e. positive sentiment can either increase or decrease discounts). Finally, I find evidence indicating that discounts of individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> do not exhibit correlation, and that the strength of the sentiment effect varies substantially between different types of individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies.</b> My results are mostly in contrast to Lee et al. (1991) but in line with Hjelström (2007) ...|$|R
