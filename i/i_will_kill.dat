500|$|According to Abu Bakr, {{speaking}} to Al Hayatt in 2002, Abu Nidal {{said he was}} behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on 21 December 1988; a former head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines was later convicted. Abu Nidal reportedly said of Lockerbie, according to Seale: [...] "We do have some involvement in this matter, but if anyone so much as mentions it, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>kill</b> him with my own hands!" [...] Seale writes that the ANO appeared to have no connection to it; one of Abu Nidal's associates told him, [...] "If an American soldier tripped in some corner of the globe, Abu Nidal would instantly claim it as his own work." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{felt that}} Ellen brought a [...] "maternal energy" [...] to the series, and {{described}} the character as [...] "a lioness, which is tough and badass and 'You touch my children, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>kill</b> you.'" [...] Likewise, actress Samantha Ferris described her as a [...] "gun-toting, beer-slinging, bar-owning broad" [...] with a [...] "very maternal core". Ferris also feels that, despite Ellen having gone through a lot in her life, she is cautious rather than jaded, and is [...] "very protective {{of the things she}} has in her life", especially her daughter Jo and the Winchesters. Thus, her main concern is Jo's safety, which prompts her to forbid her daughter from going on hunts. When she realizes that she can no longer stop Jo from doing what she wants, Ellen becomes her hunting partner, deciding it {{is the best way to}} look after her. By the time of Ellen's final appearance, actress Alona Tal came to view their characters more as equals rather than mother and daughter.|$|E
500|$|As usual, the Earps {{carried their}} revolvers in their coat pockets {{or in their}} waistbands. Wyatt Earp was {{carrying}} a [...]44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down {{the south side of}} Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, [...] "For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!" [...] Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, [...] "I have disarmed them." [...] Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys [...] "for the purpose of disarming them," [...] not that he'd actually disarmed them. One eye witness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, wrote in his testimony afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, [...] "those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>kill</b> them on sight." ...|$|E

500|$|Zumurrudi {{reported}} back to an-Nasir Muhammad that Ahmad was behaving poorly, dressing as a Bedouin and {{was spending}} {{much of his}} time drinking with a Bedouin boy, Shuhayb, with whom Ahmad had fallen in love with. As a consequence for his behavior, Ahmad was ordered by an-Nasir Muhammad to return to Cairo with Shuhayb in March 1339. Ahmad was received without fanfare and Shuhayb was jailed. In protest at the latter action, Ahmad forsook food and isolated himself to his quarters in the Cairo Citadel. An-Nasir Muhammad sent his two most senior emirs, Bashtak and Qawsun, to persuade or threaten Ahmad to abandon his relationship with Shuhayb, but to no avail; Ahmad told the emirs if [...] "this young man [...] is punished, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>kill</b> myself!" [...] Ahmad also refused an offer from his father that would have transferred one hundred of an-Nasir Muhammad's mamluks to Ahmad's service in return for Ahmad's abandonment of Shuhayb. An-Nasir Muhammad ultimately relented and abandoned hopes that Ahmad could succeed him as sultan. Instead, he released Shuhayb and made Ahmad an emir of forty mounted mamluks (the second highest Mamluk military rank). Ahmad was also made to stay in Egypt, while Abu Bakr was sent to al-Karak, likely replacing Ahmad as governor of the province.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Zandvoort, Rindt gained {{confidence}} in the new Lotus 72, describing it as [...] "the best racing car that exists at the moment". But he continued to have problems. During practice for the French Grand Prix, Rindt opted to drop his new all-enveloping Bell-Star crash helmet, finding it too hot. He went back to using his open-front helmet, only to be hit in the face by a stone from another car, causing a deep cut on his right cheek. He also suffered a steering failure on his car. Furious over yet another mechanical problem, he stormed into the Lotus garage and yelled at Colin Chapman: [...] "If this happens again and I survive, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>kill</b> all of you!" [...] Rindt {{was still able to}} win the race, taking the lead in the championship. The next race was the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. Jacky Ickx established an early lead ahead of Brabham and Rindt, but when Ickx's transmission failed, Rindt seized the opportunity to pass Brabham for the lead. Brabham was then able to regain the top spot on lap 69 as Rindt missed a gear and looked the certain winner, only to repeat his misfortune of Monaco: on the last lap, he ran out of fuel, allowing Rindt to take his third win in a row. His victory was cast into doubt shortly after the race when Chief Scrutineer Cecil Mitchell found the rear aerofoil not at the regulated height. Rindt was provisionally disqualified, only to be reinstated as winner after three hours of deliberation.|$|E

[...] Handy {{publicly}} proclaimed that any attorney foolish enough to represent her in the divorce case “would be sorry.” He described his wife as [...] "a morphine fiend and a common slut." [...] His attempts to intimidate Heney had the opposite effect, pricking Heney's conscience. Heney told his brother Ben, who {{lived across the street}} from Handy, that [...] "If a lawyer can't take any case he feels it is right for him to handle, then he should take down his shingle." [...] Heney and Handy had several confrontations. On more than one occasion, as the lawyer walked along the street, Handy intentionally attempted to run Heney over with his buggy. Handy called Heney a coward and a son of a bitch and tried to provoke a fight. Clerk of the Court Brewster Cameron, a friend of both Handy and Heney, warned Handy that his threats might negatively influence the court, and Handy desisted for a while.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was said}} that {{throughout}} these battles, however, Wang was being undermined inside the Later Liang army itself. He had long resented {{what he saw as}} the corrupting influence that Zhu Zhen's brother-in-law Zhao Yan and four brothers/cousins of Zhu Zhen's deceased wife Consort Zhang (including Zhang Hanjie, who was her brother), and had told people, [...] "After I victoriously return, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>kill</b> all the wicked men on the behalf {{of the people of the}} empire." [...] His hatred of them eventually was discovered by Zhao and the Zhangs. Further, Duan was jealous of Wang and wanted to be the commander himself, and therefore formed an alliance with Zhao and the Zhangs, and it {{was said that}} Wang's military campaign was much hampered by this group of internal enemies. After his forced withdrawal from Majiakou, Zhu Zhen believed the false accusations against Wang and relieved him of his command of the main Later Liang army, instead ordering him to rendezvous with Dong Zhang to attack Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi). Zhu Zhen replaced him with Duan, despite the oppositions of senior officials Jing, Li Zhen, and Zhang Zongshi.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Wen also treated Yang Longyan with respect. [...] However, {{things changed}} in 915, when Xu Wen, {{who was then}} {{carrying}} the titles of military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered at Run Prefecture (潤州) in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and Duke of Qi, left Guangling and established his headquarters at Run Prefecture. [...] He left his oldest biological son Xu Zhixun in command at Guangling as junior regent, with Xu Wen himself only ruling {{on the most important}} matters. [...] As junior regent, Xu Zhixun grew arrogant, alienating the Wu officials and officers. [...] He was even disrespectful to Yang Longyan, who was formally his sovereign. [...] For example, once he put on a play with himself playing the character of an army officer and with Yang Longyan playing the character of a servant, following him around abjectly. [...] He also once fired slingshots at Yang Longyan when they both went on a river cruise. [...] On yet another occasion, when they were both watching flowers at Chanzhi Temple (禪智寺), Xu Zhixun was drunk and became very insulting toward Yang Longyan, such that the prince became fearful and began to cry. [...] The prince's attendants quickly put him on a boat and left the scene. [...] Xu Zhixun tried to give chase, and when he could not catch up to Yang Longyan, he killed some of Yang Longyan's attendants. [...] Once, when Xu Zhixun heard that the general Li Decheng had many singing girls in his household, he sent a demand to Li that the singing girls be given to him. [...] When Li responded that these singing girls were too old for Xu and that he would try to find younger and more beautiful ones for Xu, Xu responded to Li's messenger, [...] "One day <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>kill</b> Li Decheng and take even his wife!" [...] These unlawful deeds, however, were said to be unreported to Xu Wen as the staff members were fearful of the consequences of reporting.|$|E
