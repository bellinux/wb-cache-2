40|$|In this study, {{bullying}} {{was examined}} as {{a continuum of}} mild-to-extreme behaviors, and the potential correlates of bullying others were delineated. To improve identification and targeting of those youth at risk for bullying, demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial correlates were tested on a continuous measure of bullying behavior rated according to the number and frequency of behaviors. Among 558 middle school students surveyed in 1995, only 20 % reported no bullying behavior. In multiple regression analysis, miscon-duct, anger, beliefs supportive of violence, confidence in using nonviolent strategies, and intentions to use nonviolent strategies were associated with levels of bullying behavior. Although boys reported more bullying behavior than did girls, gender was not a signifi-cant predictor in the multiple regression analysis. These study results were inconsistent with the perspective that early adolescents were either bullies or nonbullies and indi-cated {{the need for a}} comprehensive approach to preventing bullying behavior.

40|$|The true {{extent of}} alcohol-related {{violence}} and intimidation has been revealed in startling new research.

However, {{in the case of}} assaults, half of people said that they had not reported the crime to the Gardai. Just over 1, 000 people aged 16 and older were surveyed, with almost half of these admitting that they had gone {{out of their way to}} avoid drunk people or places where drinkers were known to hang out. The survey also revealed that: -Almost one in five people had felt unsafe while waiting for, or using, public transport because of other people's drinking-related behaviour -At least one in 10 had been verbally abused by someone under the influence of drink -At least one in 10 had been in what they classed a ‘serious argument' because of someone else's drinking...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘mode of coordination’ captures the way economy is {{embedded}} in social relationships and influences the integration of society through an ‘instituted process. ’ Three main typical or ideal modes of coordination {{have been identified in}} the literature, namely the market, the bureaucratic and the ethical (reciprocity) modes of coordination (Polanyi 1944, [1957] 1968, Lindblom 1977, and Kornai, 1984, 1992). Our purpose is to introduce another type of coordination that we name ‘destructive mode of coordination’. It is social organisation through <b>intimidation,</b> <b>threat</b> and the use of coercive means. This type of coordination has almost been entirely neglected in the literature, although it has existed since ancient times in different forms and varieties. A typical recent illustration is the social order under the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran is not the sole example in the Middle East; many others can be cited in that region as well as in Africa and Latin America. Destructive coordination also describes sectoral logic of the Military Industrial Complex in developed market economies like the United States, and in Post Socialist economies such as Russia and China. Historically, colonialism, the ‘primitive accumulation of capital’, and the Stalinist regime from 1933 to 1938 may be invoked as examples from the recent past. Looting tribes and pirate colonies in the past and present provide other illustrations. Although I will refer to all these evidences, my main focus will be Iran since the 1979 revolution. ...|$|E

But throughout 1975 and 1976, students, journalists, socialists, employees, and farmers were subject to growing harassment, <b>intimidation,</b> <b>threats,</b> and finally assassination.

40|$|The {{definition}} of workplace {{violence is a}} “any act of harassment (including sexual harassment), <b>intimidation,</b> <b>threat,</b> rape or homicide that takes place at a victim’s place of employment. ” When the statistics for workplace violence are looked at, it is easily understood why workplace security is rapidly becoming a problem for many organizations. The situation that provokes workplace violence does not necessarily have to start in the workplace or and the act of violence does not necessarily have {{to happen in the}} workplace for organizations to be concerned. Many organizations are just learning that violence can occur anywhere at anytime and they must be prepared to cope with the situation. This means they must take a look at their preparedness and decide {{what they need to do}} to not only increase preparedness but also to understand what procedures they do day to day that might affect a potentially violent situation. Organizations need to ask tough questions as to their hiring procedures, termination procedures, and security procedures. In today’s society, this increases from the aspect of global terrorism and how well are they prepared for the potential of a terrorist attack. Security in the workplace will continue to be a concern but by following specific procedures and processes the risk of a situation happening can be significantly reduced. workplace violence, workplace security, organizational security, domestic violence, spillover violence, workplace threats, violence prevention, employee violence...|$|E
40|$|Auditor {{independence}} is {{a cornerstone of}} the auditing profession and the basic principle that underpins {{the reputation of the}} auditing profession in the public eye. Indeed, it is the attribute most demanded from auditors by the public. Therefore, the sustainability of the auditing profession depends on how auditors can protect this principle. This dissertation consists of four interrelated essays concerned with auditor independence. Specifically, it examines situations that can threaten and impair auditor independence. In addition, this dissertation also examines several variables that may enhance and protect auditor independence. The first essay aims to examine the impact of social pressures occurring within audit firms on auditors’ judgment in the setting of a society with “high power distance” and “low individualism” cultural dimensions. The social pressures consisted of obedience pressure exerted by an auditor’s superior and conformity pressure exerted by an auditor’s colleague. Moreover, two moderating variables—a multi-dimensional professional commitment and locus of control—were included as moderator variables in the relationship between the social pressures faced by auditors and their judgment. The findings show that obedience and conformity pressures influence auditor judgment. Auditors who face the social pressures will make a judgment that may be even diametrically opposite to the independence principle. The findings also indicate that a multi-dimensional professional commitment and locus of control may potentially influence auditor judgment in a situation with social pressures. The second essay aims to investigate the association of advocacy and familiarity threats caused by auditor fee dependence and auditor tenure on auditor independence based on Finnish data, law, and auditing environment. This essay was motivated by the Green Paper on Audit Policy, published by the European Commission in 2010 that questions whether the maximum fee collected from a client should be regulated and whether consecutive assignments should be limited, among others. Contrary to popular belief, this essay does not find evidence that audit fees and long auditor tenure will jeopardise auditor independence. Therefore, the findings do not support policies to regulate auditor fees or limit auditor tenure in Finland. The third essay aims to examine the effect of client intimidation on auditor independence in an audit-client conflict situation. <b>Intimidation</b> <b>threat</b> is one of five independence threats that are explicitly referenced in the IFAC’s independence framework. Client intimidation was manifested in the client threatening to replace the auditor if the auditor did not adopt the client’s position. In addition, this essay examines the role of auditor’s perceived pressure and multi-dimensions of professional commitment as moderator variables. The findings suggest that auditors who experience client intimidation in an audit conflict situation {{are more likely to have}} their independence impaired than those who are in a similar situation but without client intimidation. Moreover, auditors who experience client intimidation perceive higher pressure than those who do not experience intimidation. Finally, auditors’ affective and continuance professional commitment dimensions moderate the relationship between auditors’ perceived pressures and auditor independence. The aim of the fourth essay is twofold. First, it aims to develop a scale for measuring auditors’ reputation awareness. Second, it aims to examine the correlation between the levels of auditor reputation awareness and auditor independence. A seven-item scale was developed as the reputation awareness scale. The findings indicate that the scale consists of one dimension. It also has a level of satisfactory reliability and a high level of validity. The findings show that there is a positive correlation between the level of auditors’ reputation awareness and auditor independence...|$|E
