40|$|With {{respect to}} the Food Labelling Ordinance of the FRG, a report is given from {{practice}} on the minimum durability. The span between purchase and "best before" date of pre-packs was investigated sensorically {{in order to get}} a not yet representative insight into the quality level, during their remaining life, of a number of new foods brought from the trade and found increasingly on the market. Nutritive value, enjoyment value and usefulness determine their properties. The enjoyment value, i. e. shape, colour, smell, taste and consistency, is of particular interest to the customer. Even with a relatively low designated traffic limit, which allows noticeable impairments of the sensory properties and slight faults, only a few of the product batches investigated reached the "best before" (minimum <b>durability)</b> <b>date</b> without clear losses of their enjoyment value. The majority of the foods investigated had an overstreched "best before" dating. With meat products, e. g., it is proposed to lower the declared storage temperature from + 7 °C to + 2 °C to + 4 °C...|$|E
50|$|Household {{items of}} {{particular}} cultural and practical significance are woven mats called Burush (sing. Birsh, برش).Mats that are called Segagah (سجاجة) are two ells wide and {{are laid out}} on the traditional beds called Anqarib (عنقريب).A plain uncoloured Segagah is kept aside in every household to be used for washing and carrying the body of a deceased.A second type of Segagah is dyed in different colours and laid out by the bride groom during bridal night and further marriage festivities. It is reused for the period of forty days (ربع) after a woman has given birth and during which she is not supposed to leave the house. A different kind of Birsh can be found in many households and in community places such as the guest house (Madeifah, مضيفة) of the village. It is four ells long and will be rolled out on the floor during banquets or for prayers. It is called Birsh Rubai (برش رباعي).The best Burush are woven from the leaves of Mishriq palm trees prominent for their soft and flexible leaflets, although leaflets of other varieties are added for higher <b>durability</b> (cf. <b>Date</b> cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). Old Burush are reused for mending holes in the ceiling or for supporting small window openings in the rooms.|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{structures are}} susceptible {{to a variety of}} deterioration mechanisms due to creep and shrinkage, alkali-silica reaction (ASR), carbonation, and corrosion of the reinforcement. The deterioration problems can affect the integrity and load carrying capacity of the structure. Substantial research has been dedicated to these various mechanisms aiming to identify the causes, reactions, accelerants, retardants and consequences. This has improved our understanding of the long-term behaviour of reinforced concrete structures. However, the strengthening of reinforced concrete structures for <b>durability</b> has to <b>date</b> been mainly undertaken after expert assessment of field data followed by the development of a scheme to both terminate continuing degradation, by separating the structure from the environment, and strengthening the structure. The process does not include any significant consideration of the residual load-bearing capacity of the structure and the highly variable nature of estimates of such remaining capacity. Development of performance curves for deteriorating bridge structures has not been attempted due to the difficulty in developing a model when the input parameters have an extremely large variability. This paper presents a framework developed for an asset management system which assesses residual capacity and identifies the most appropriate rehabilitation method for a given reinforced concrete structure exposed to aggressive environments. In developing the framework, several industry consultation sessions have been conducted to identify input data required, research methodology and output knowledge base. Capturing expert opinion in a useable knowledge base requires development of a rule based formulation, which can subsequently be used to model the reliability of the performance curve of a reinforced concrete structure exposed to a given environment...|$|R
