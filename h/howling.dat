5|$|The Loudest Engine {{features}} a sound {{adapted to the}} genres of folk and rock, {{more so than the}} previous two <b>Howling</b> Bells records. Juanita explained that the band relied less on the sound technology that was prominent in Radio Wars, instead returning to the more organic state of <b>Howling</b> Bells. For the new album, Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon Düül and Aphrodite's Child. <b>Howling</b> Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You're Strange, which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine.|$|E
5|$|By July 2005, {{the band}} was not yet signed to a record label. <b>Howling</b> Bells toured for ten {{months prior to the}} release of the album. They played {{sporadically}} in clubs in Australia and North America, and they toured Europe and the UK with Editors. The group played extensive UK club shows with many artists, including The Young Knives and Hank & Lily. <b>Howling</b> Bells also played Camden Crawl and the 2006 NME New Music Tour.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, <b>Howling</b> Bells started {{recording}} The Loudest Engine at the Killers-owned Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas. It {{was produced}} by bassist Mark Stoermer, whom the group had met while it toured with The Killers. The relationship between Stoermer and <b>Howling</b> Bells strengthened after the band disembarked from its flight to Las Vegas. The flight had been delayed by more than 12 hours, but he had nonetheless waited for them at the airport. <b>Howling</b> Bells were impressed by his style of work. Rather than overproducing, he kept the amount of takes to a minimum and allowed the band just to play, which kept the sessions very natural. The band members became less conscious of trying to please other people, made the record that they wanted, and hoped that it would change people's attitudes toward the band.|$|E
5|$|Following the charmed ring, Sophie passes into a {{scene from}} the past. She watched a young <b>Howl</b> take pity on a falling star—Calcifer—and give it his heart. The act bound Calcifer to <b>Howl</b> indefinitely; however, by losing his heart, <b>Howl</b> was emotionally trapped in adolescence. Sophie finds <b>Howl</b> in bird form, and takes him back to Calcifer. The witch returns <b>Howl's</b> heart, and Sophie places it back inside <b>Howl,</b> {{returning}} him to life and freeing Calcifer. <b>Howl</b> wakes up and Sophie embraces him. Although Calcifer is now free, he returns to his former company. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. <b>Howl,</b> Sophie, and the others are seen high in the air in a new flying castle, while the bombers return from the war.|$|R

5|$|Heartstrings materialized {{following}} a brief hiatus by <b>Howling</b> Bells, whereupon {{the band members}} worked on other projects. Additionally, Juanita became a first-time mother after giving birth. This, along with frustration from the long period of inactivity and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again, at which point she got {{the other members of}} the band involved. They made demos and sent them out to prospective producers, one being Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins). Moulder was busy at the time so he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his, Catherine J. Marks (Foals, The Killers), who after meeting, <b>Howling</b> Bells chose to produce the album.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, <b>Howling</b> Bells {{recorded}} Heartstrings at Assault & Battery Studios, in London. The {{album was}} primarily produced by Marks, but Moulder supported {{the effort and}} was given credit as co-producer. Marks set {{the tone of the}} environment in the recording studio and the band felt extremely open and comfortable in her presence. Her female nature was credited with her ability to elicit exceptional performances from the band, more so than any of her record producer counterparts who worked with <b>Howling</b> Bells previously. The band moved on from former label Cooking Vinyl and established a partnership with Birthday Records, a small, independent record label founded by former Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Nick Hodgson.|$|E
5|$|Members of <b>Howling</b> Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to <b>Howling</b> Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this band shrouded in red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|E

5|$|<b>Howling</b> Bells are an indie {{rock band}} that formed in Sydney in 2004. The band {{obtained}} moderate {{popularity in the}} United Kingdom following the release of its 2006 self-titled debut album.

5|$|<b>Howling</b> Bells are {{notable for}} a doom-and-gloom, country-and-rock music style, {{and they have}} been {{labelled}} as melodic blues and country-goth.

5|$|As autumn approaches, Teran takes {{advantage}} of Sea Mither's exhaustion to break free, and conflict between the two starts again. The power struggles cause the weather to change with darkening skies and <b>howling</b> winds. This time, Teran triumphs in the conflict termed the Gore vellye. Control {{of the ocean and}} weather is returned to Teran and Sea Mither is forced to leave. No details are given as to where she spends the winter, but during the storms caused by Teran the fishermen were consoled that Sea Mither would return refreshed and powerful in the spring, to again oust Teran from his malevolent grip over the seas.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog <b>howling</b> along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which he put on the wall just outside the front door, and had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. <b>Howling</b> Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
500|$|The coyote {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the most vocal of all [...] North American mammals". Its loudness and range of vocalizations was the cause for its binomial name Canis latrans, meaning [...] "barking dog". At least 11 different vocalizations are known in adult coyotes. These sounds are divided into three categories: agonistic and alarm, greeting, and contact. Vocalizations of the first category include woofs, growls, huffs, barks, bark <b>howls,</b> yelps, and high-frequency whines. Woofs are used as low-intensity threats or alarms, and are usually heard near den sites, prompting the pups to immediately retreat into their burrows. Growls are used as threats at short distances, but have also been heard among pups playing and copulating males. Huffs are high-intensity threat vocalizations produced by rapid expiration of air. Barks can be classed as both long-distance threat vocalizations and as alarm calls. Bark <b>howls</b> may serve similar functions. Yelps are emitted as a sign of submission, while high-frequency whines are produced by dominant animals acknowledging the submission of subordinates. Greeting vocalizations include low-frequency whines, 'wow-oo-wows', and group yip <b>howls.</b> Low-frequency whines are emitted by submissive animals, and are usually accompanied by tail wagging and muzzle nibbling. The sound known as 'wow-oo-wow' {{has been described}} as a [...] "greeting song". The group yip <b>howl</b> is emitted when two or more pack members reunite, and may be the final act of a complex greeting ceremony. Contact calls include lone <b>howls</b> and group <b>howls,</b> as well as the previously mentioned group yip <b>howls.</b> The lone <b>howl</b> is the most iconic sound of the coyote, and may serve the purpose of announcing the presence of a lone individual separated from its pack. Group <b>howls</b> are used as both substitute group yip <b>howls</b> and as responses to either lone <b>howls,</b> group <b>howls,</b> or group yip <b>howls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Howl</b> {{continues}} {{to avoid the}} Witch of the Waste until she lures Sophie into a trap; believing that the Witch has taken <b>Howl's</b> current love interest, Lily Angorian, captive, Sophie goes to save her and is in turn captured by the Witch of the Waste. <b>Howl</b> comes to save Sophie, unshaven and with his hair in a mess, proving his love for Sophie, and defeats the Witch of the Waste. He knew all along that Miss Angorian was actually the Witch's fire demon in disguise. The Witch's fire demon had, over the years, taken control of the Witch and, once the Witch is defeated, tries to take <b>Howl's</b> heart to stay alive. <b>Howl</b> is able to stop the demon but fails because Miss Angorian took hold of Calcifer, who had been guarding <b>Howl's</b> heart, and tries to control <b>Howl</b> by squeezing <b>Howl's</b> heart. Sophie uses her ability of bringing things to life by talking to them to break the contract between <b>Howl</b> and Calcifer without killing either of them. Sophie has been unconsciously retaining the spell on herself, but her concern for <b>Howl</b> weakens the spell, and {{with the death of}} the Witch of the Waste (who was a significant force behind the spell as well), Calcifer, as he promised, breaks the spell surrounding her the second she concludes the contract between him and <b>Howl.</b> She immediately returns to her proper age. When <b>Howl</b> awakens, he destroys the witch's fire demon. This breaks the curse on Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin, whom the Witch had fused together in an effort to create a [...] "perfect human" [...] (<b>Howl's</b> head was meant to complete the being) to use as a puppet to rule Ingary.|$|R

5|$|<b>Howling</b> Bells parted {{ways with}} Bella Union and, in 2008, {{signed a deal}} with record label Independiente.

However, they have stated that in retrospect, they learned a great deal from him and felt fortunate for having the experience of collaborating with him.|$|E
5|$|<b>Howling</b> Bells {{spent much}} of the next two years touring the UK, Europe, Australia, and the US. They played at the 2007 NME Awards Show. They {{performed}} at numerous festivals during the northern hemisphere's summer months in 2006 and 2007, including Reading and Leeds and Latitude.

5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the <b>howling</b> of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E

5000|$|Calcifer is <b>Howl's</b> {{resident}} fire demon. As {{the result}} of a mysterious bargain with <b>Howl</b> some years ago he agrees to heat and power the castle.

5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce <b>howling</b> sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as <b>howling</b> wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E

In 2002, with a rhythm guitarist, they issued the Top50 album I'm Already Home. With four members, the band then toured Australia and New Zealand. Shortly thereafter, Brendan Picchio joined Waikiki as a bassist, and Juanita switched to rhythm guitar. The group soon became dissatisfied with its material, so the members chose a new direction for their music. They wrote {{a number of new}} songs and made a wish list of producers with whom they would like to work. In 2004, the band changed its name to <b>Howling</b> Bells, as its members felt that phrase better embodied its newly adapted indie rock style.|$|E
