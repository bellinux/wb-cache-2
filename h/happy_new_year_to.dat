2500|$|The {{origins of}} [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] {{date back to}} at least the late 19th century, when two sisters, Patty and Mildred J. Hill, {{introduced}} the song [...] "Good Morning to All" [...] to Patty's kindergarten class in Kentucky. Years later, in 1893, they published the tune in their songbook Song Stories for the Kindergarten. Kembrew McLeod stated that the Hill sisters likely copied the tune and lyrical idea from other popular and similar nineteenth-century songs that predated theirs, including Horace Waters' [...] "Happy Greetings to All", [...] "Good Night to You All" [...] also from 1858, [...] "A <b>Happy</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> <b>to</b> All" [...] from 1875, and [...] "A Happy Greeting to All", published 1885. However, American law professor Robert Brauneis disputes this, noting that these earlier songs had quite different melodies.|$|E
2500|$|American {{photographer}} Attila von Szalay {{was among}} the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn't until 1956, after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder, that he believed he was successful. Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as [...] "This is G!", [...] "Hot dog, Art!", and [...] "Merry Christmas and <b>Happy</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> <b>to</b> you all". [...] Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless' work was published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1959. Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, Phone Calls From the Dead.|$|E

It happened that I read at Cheltenham a couple of months ago, and that I have rarely seen a place that so attracted my fancy. I had never seen it before. Also I believe the character of its people to have greatly changed for the better. All sorts of long-visaged prophets had told me that they were dull, stolid, slow, and I don't know what more that is disagreeable.

Your letter came in the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of feeling' that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea, and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged it and pranced. It was so homey and refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought. Beth's new 'ink bib' was capital, and Hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books Father has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps! ...|$|E

We are situated at a brand new Air Base and thus far we don’t have much in the line of a Post Exchange. All the boys were hoping for plenty of candy for the Christmas holiday. I rather imagine that the two pounds won’t last long, but you may rest assured that [it]is being appreciated not only by me but by the other men in the barrack. I am always interested in the doings of the graduates of Bryant and the November issue of the Bulletin provided plenty of such information. We were well provided for at dinner today; I am sure that no one could have expected more at any Army camp. The mess sergeant has certainly a swift pace for himself from now on.

Its origin lies in the desire to have a medium in which the Society, as a collection of units and as a unity, may give expression to its thoughts and life. Following a suggestion from Mr F. F. L. Alexander, at the last annual general meeting, I obtained quotations for printing this periodical which enabled me to formulate a practical scheme for its continuance within the limits of our income. The scheme was unanimously adopted at a special meeting on Nov. 27th last, with Mr B. G. Laws in the chair and I accepted the meeting's invitation to edit these pages.

6000|$|At supper, Mr. Tupple {{shows to}} still greater {{advantage}} {{than he has}} done throughout the evening, and when Pa requests every one to fill their glasses {{for the purpose of}} drinking happiness throughout the year, Mr. Tupple is so droll: insisting on all the young ladies having their glasses filled, notwithstanding their repeated assurances that they never can, by any possibility, think of emptying them and subsequently begging permission {{to say a few words}} on the sentiment which has just been uttered by Pa—when he makes one of the most brilliant and poetical speeches that can possibly be imagined, about the old year and the new one. After the toast has been drunk, and when the ladies have retired, Mr. Tupple requests that every gentleman will do him the favour of filling his glass, for he has a toast to propose: on which all the gentlemen cry ‘Hear! hear!’ and pass the decanters accordingly: and Mr. Tupple being informed by the master of the house that they are all charged, and waiting for his toast, rises, and begs to remind the gentlemen present, how much they have been delighted by the dazzling array of elegance and beauty which the drawing-room has exhibited that night, and how their senses have been charmed, and their hearts captivated, by the bewitching concentration of female loveliness which that very room has so recently displayed. (Loud cries of ‘Hear!’) Much as he (Tupple) would be disposed to deplore the absence of the ladies, on other grounds, he cannot but derive some consolation from the reflection that the very circumstance of their not being present, enables him to propose a toast, which he would have otherwise been prevented from giving—that toast he begs to say is—‘The Ladies!’ (Great applause.) The Ladies! among whom the fascinating daughters of their excellent host, are alike conspicuous for their beauty, their accomplishments, and their elegance. He begs them to drain a bumper to ‘The Ladies, and a <b>happy</b> <b>new</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> them!’ (Prolonged approbation; above which the noise of the ladies dancing the Spanish dance among themselves, overhead, is distinctly audible.) ...|$|E

Altho [sic] most of us won’t be where we would like to be at Christmas time, we celebrate the best we can. We have just recently completed building a dayroom for after work leisure. It is a swell place to read, write and relax and listen to the brand new radio. The most important feature is the bar which serves the best beer and cognac. The whole set up is the envy of every other squadron on the field. Our group also runs an Enlisted Man’s club in the nearby city which is really ritzy. All the modern conveniences of a large hotel and the Saturday nite [sic] dance with the local belles is the highlight of the week. So you can see that things could be a lot worse, at least here. The weather lately hasn’t been any too wonderful so I won’t take any time to praise this country about that. This country is just about as good as any of these old countries in this old world. All of them are do far behind the good ol [sic] USA that they never will catch up. One exception might be the gay city of Paris. A visit to that city will never be forgotten, at least I won’t forget my two trips. I read all about Lt Desormeaux and his recent adventure in a clipping sent to me.
