Residential mobility is of particular interest to developmental scientists because of the possible detrimental consequences for children (NRC, 2010). We examined a survey sample of 33 low-income rural households and an <b>intensive</b> <b>sample</b> of eight low-income rural families with school-aged children. Using qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews, we discovered that push and pull factors were almost equally apparent in the survey sample, in which respondents were asked to state the factors that influenced their most recent move. For the <b>intensive</b> <b>sample,</b> the families gave an account of every move that had taken place in each child’s lifetime. We found that push factors appeared more frequently that pull factors. The push factors numbered 44 and the pull only 24, out of 68 total moves. We discovered that Housing Imperative (the need for immediate housing, lack of housing or discontent) was the most commonly stated push factor in both samples. The most common pull factor in the survey sample was the Affordability of the new location, but in the <b>intensive</b> <b>sample,</b> it was a Kin Network (proximity, dependence or providing/receiving support from relatives or friends).

Beyond that, determination can become more difficult. <b>Intensive</b> <b>sampling</b> in the Smithers/Hazelton/Houston area of British Columbia showed Douglas (1975), according to Coates et al. (1994), that cone scale morphology was the feature most useful in differentiating species of spruce; the length, width, length: width ratio, the length of free scale (the distance from the imprint of the seed wing to the tip of the scale), and the percentage free scale (length of free scale {{as a percentage of the}} total length of the scale) were most useful in this regard. Daubenmire (1974), after range-wide sampling, had already recognized the importance of the 2 latter characters. Taylor (1959) had noted that the most obvious morphological difference between typical Picea glauca and typical P. engelmannii was the cone scale, and Horton (1956,1959) found that the most useful diagnostic features of the 2 spruces are in the cone; differences occur in the flower, shoot and needle, [...] "but those in the cone are most easily assessed" [...] (Horton 1959). Coupé et al. (1982) recommended that cone scale characters be based on samples taken from the midsection of each of 10 cones from each of 5 trees in the population of interest.|$|E

This {{study was}} aimed {{to detect the}} {{relationship}} between Aphis sp. and ants and to show whether ants could alter insecticide efficacy on Aphis sp. A survey was conducted in the yard-long bean agroecosystems that have been frequently attacked by aphids and for years treated with imidacloprid insecticide (in Mulyosari Village, <b>intensive</b> <b>sample)</b> versus those barely treated in Ganjar Agung Village (non-intensive sample), both in the West Metro municipal area, Lampung. Two sampling occasions were made (in March and November 2005) where 35 plant parts (i. e. 35 flowers and 35 pods) per sample were randomly observed to record the number of Aphis sp. and ants. The efficacy of the insecticide treatment was determined by comparing {{the mean number of}} aphids or ants from intensive versus non <b>intensive</b> <b>samples</b> using a t-test at the 0. 05 level. The relationships between ant and aphid numbers were determined by calculating their coefficients of correlation and testing them using a t-test at the 0. 01 or 0. 05 level. The study showed that the long-term application of the insecticide imidacloprid in the yard-long bean agroecosystem 1) might strengthen the relationship between Aphis sp. and ants (especially Solenopsis sp., Camponotus sp. and Paratopula sp.) and 2) was not effective to suppress Aphis sp. number.

40|$|Background: Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) {{is being}} intro-duced {{into a large}} number of clinical laboratories.

However, MS is not without problems related to interference, especially through ion suppres-sion effects. Ion suppression results from the presence of less volatile compounds that can change the effi-ciency of droplet formation or droplet evaporation, which in turn affects the amount of charged ion in the gas phase that ultimately reaches the detector.

5000|$|The low {{mobility}} and habitat specialization {{associated with the}} subgenus make Nothonotus species particularly sensitive to habitat degradation. [...] Darter populations are frequently assessed {{as a proxy for}} stream habitat quality. In a comparative species richness survey, museum specimen from 1948-1955 contained approximately 33% more diversity than samples collected from 2005-2006 in the same localities despite more <b>intensive</b> <b>sampling</b> efforts in contemporary populations. The following Nothonotus species have been designated conservation statuses by IUCN redlist: Vulnerable : N. maculatum, N. acuticeps, N. denoncourti, N. etowahae, N. wapiti Near threatened: N. aquali N. tippecanoe Endangered: N. moorei , N. rubrum. [...] Impoundment by dams and siltation restrict gene flow between previously continuous populations, threatening the genetic diversity of various Nothonotus species. Siltation has been cited as the most concerning mode of habitat destruction in aquatic habitats. Sediment issues occur when anthropogenic activities like mining, deforestation, urbanization, and road construction alter flow regimes and erosion rates. Genetic diversity assessments of Nothonotus populations are often conducted to determine the consequences of siltation on aquatic communities. [...] Coloration, particularly conspicuous in males, is hypothesized to have evolved in response to sexual selection and habitat preference. Species residing higher in the water column, in clear water, and in habitats with low predation typically express stronger nuptial coloration patterns. Sedimentation may also interfere with mate identification due to reduced water clarity.|$|E

50|$|ESI {{offers a}} {{similarly}} high throughput {{answer to the}} problem of label-free droplet detection to MALDI, with less <b>intensive</b> <b>sample</b> preparation and fabrication elements that are scalable to microfluidic device scale. This ionization technique involves the application of a high voltage to a carrier stream of analyte-containing droplets, which aerosolizes the stream, followed by detection at a potential-differentiated analyser region. Droplet size, Taylor cone shape, and flow rate can be controlled by varying the potential differential and the temperature of a drying (to evaporate analyte-surrounding solvent) stream of gas (usually nitrogen). Because ESI allows for online droplet detection, other problems posed by segmented or off-chip detection based systems can be solved, such as the minimizing of sample (droplet) dilution, which is especially critical to microfluidic droplet detection where analyte samples are already diluted to the lowest experimentally relevant concentration.|$|R

A more <b>intensive</b> <b>sample</b> clean-up, which is mandatory for liquid Chromatographie analysis, is reported for serum Cortisol. With {{the exception of}} calcidiol, the extraction of steroids is almost complete. Recovery of peptides is about 80 % and depends {{on the nature of}} the peptide and on protein-analyte dissociating diluents. Precision of recovery is lower than 7 % (CV) for all analytes studied.
