50|$|Although modern Bolaq {{has only}} two {{connections}} to other reservoirs, both subterranean, it once had a complex hydrology. Bolaq had a tributary, a brook that had flowed from a former lake in the modern Paris Commune public garden. In the course of year, Bolaq flowed from Qaban to Kazanka. During Kazanka's spring tide, that followed Qaban's spring tide, Bolaq flowed from Kazanka to Qaban. Then <b>flow</b> <b>course</b> normalized. Ten days later, during Volga's spring tide, Bolaq flowed from Kazanka, Volga's tributary to Qaban again. At the south Qaban also became connected with Volga.At the winter's end, Bolaq waters had 45 m above sea level, at Volga spring tide 50 to 53 m and even 56 m. In summer the normal level was 49.5 m.As {{the result of this}} changing of the course, Bolaq's bottom had little silt. Since the 1950s Bolaq silts rapidly.|$|E
40|$|The latex {{dilution}} reaction {{during the}} tapping <b>flow</b> <b>course</b> {{has been well}} documented and associated with the facilitation of tapping latex flow. However, its underlying mechanism has not experimentally examined. The latex total solid content, osmotic potential and phloem turgor pressure change during the tapping <b>flow</b> <b>course</b> were simultaneously measured to investigate the cause of water movement during the tapping <b>flow</b> <b>course.</b> It was found that there are three different stages for the laticifer water equilibrium during the tapping <b>flow</b> <b>course.</b> The tapping-induced rapid turgor pressure drop is the cause of the first stage water influx into laticifers, while osmoregulation prevails during water exchange {{in the second and third}} stages of tapping flow. Meanwhile, aquaporin expressions were, for the first time, investigated during the tapping <b>flow</b> <b>course.</b> The rapid transcript up-regulation of HbPIP 1, HbPIP 2; 1 and HbPIP 2; 3 contributes to the latex dilution reaction. However, their activity gating cannot be ruled out. Ethrel stimulation can significantly dilute the corresponding latex fractions during the tapping <b>flow</b> <b>course</b> due to its up-regulations of HbPIP 1, HbPIP 2; 1 and HbPIP 2; 3. Nevertheless, the latex dilution reaction pattern for the Ethrel treated trees did not change, except for a lower degree of dilution compared with the un-treated trees. All these results suggest that both phloem turgor pressure and aquaporins are involved in the latex dilution reaction during the tapping <b>flow</b> <b>course...</b>|$|E

Dynamic development of numerical simulation techniques and accessibility to highly advanced and specialized software causes the fact that these techniques are commonly used for solving problems related to liquid flows by using analytical methods. Whereas, physical modelling is an important cognitive tool in the field of empirical identification of these phenomena. This allows for peer review and specification of the researched problems. By exploiting these relationships, a comparison of the obtained results was performed in the form of residence time distribution (RTD) curves and visualization of particular types of liquid steel flow distribution zones in the investigated tundish...|$|E

40|$|Intestinal {{motility}} {{analysis is}} an important examination in detection of various intestinal malfunctions. One of the big challenges of automatic motility analysis is how to compare sequence of images and extract dynamic paterns {{taking into account the}} high deformability of the intestine wall as well as the capsule motion. From clinical point of view the ability to align endoluminal scene sequences will help to find regions of similar intestinal activity and in this way will provide a valuable information on intestinal motility problems. This work, for first time, addresses the problem of aligning endoluminal sequences taking into account motion and structure of the intestine. To describe motility in the sequence, we propose different descriptors based on the Sift Flow algorithm, namely: (1) Histograms of Sift Flow Directions to describe the <b>flow</b> <b>course,</b> (2) Sift Descriptors to represent image intestine structure and (3) Sift Flow Magnitude to quantify intestine deformation. We show that the merge of all three descriptors provides robust information on sequence description in terms of motility. Moreover, we develop a novel methodology to rank the intestinal sequences based on the expert feedback about relevance of the results. The experimental results show that the selected descriptors are useful in the alignment and similarity description and the proposed method allows the analysis of the WCE. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish Industrial Association for Multiphase Flows (SIAMUF) is a {{consortium}} of various Swedish companies and has been initiated in 1998 together with an academic research program entitled "Multiphase Flow". The main goals of SIAMUF are to broaden the competence within the area of multiphase flows, by arranging courses, seminars and workshops, to identify the relevant research areas, to transfer results from academia to industry and to obtain an overview of relevant academic research worldwide. Successfully bringing together industry and academia to improve the knowledge and technology for Swedish industry is unique and, among other aspects, motivates to develop better suitable courses and workshops for both students and industry. Every year, a workshop is organized where academia, Swedish industry, and external scientific experts discuss their research and challenges they face. SIAMUF provides financial support and industrial time for academic visits to industry, contributes to a "best practice guideline" for multiphase flows, organizes an annual workshop and a large multiphase <b>flow</b> <b>course</b> once every five years in collaboration with ERCOFTAC. Swedish academia {{in the field of}} multiphase flow provides courses to SIAMUF members, gives lectures and courses tailored to the needs of industry, and participates in joint research projects.

40|$|SUMMARY Regional {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} (rCBF) was measured over both hemispheres in 20 patients with unilateral transient ischemic attacks (TIA) of {{the territory of the}} internal carotid artery {{on the day of the}} TIA. rCBF was estimated with the nontraumatic Xenon '"-inhalation technique using the initial slope index. 13 patients experienced their first TIA, 7 had several attacks. In 14 patients the first rCBF-measurement was performed during the presentation of clinical symptoms. The 2 nd rCBF-measurement was done on day 2, the last one on day 7. Scans of the 15 patients studied with CT were normal. On day 1 mean rCBF of the TIA-side was significantly lower than that of the contralateral hemispheres. 22 % of all areas showed a significant reduction of flow compared to mean rCBF. Mean rCBF of both the TIA- and the contralateral side was significantly reduced compared to the bi-hemispheric mean rCBF of a control group with no history of TIA or completed strokes but at least 2 risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Whereas mean rCBF did not change in the contralateral side it increased significantly (+ 6. 9 %) in the TIA-side from day 1 to day 2 but not from there to day 7. This is reflected by the increase of the total number of ROI with normal flow from day 1 to day 2. Considering the actual flow and the <b>flow</b> <b>course</b> of that tissue which was beloved to be responsible for the clinical symptoms the following regional patterns were observed: normal rCBF in 6 patients; early return to normal concomitant to the clinical course (n = 4); delayed return to normal with ischemia on day 2 but not on day 7 (n = 3); early hyperperfusion with perifocal ischemia on day 1 (n = 2); delayed hyperperfusion on day 2 with ischemia on day 1 (n = 2); persistent ischemia (n = 3). The data indicate that transient ischemic attacks are accompanied by varying patterns of focal CBF with negligible participation of the contralateral hemisphere. 60 % of all cases present with flow abnormalities on the day of the TIA and 40 % on the day following the clinical symptoms. The method seems to be highly sensitive in indicating pathophysiological abnormalities in patients with transient ischemia of the brain...|$|E

30|$|Phloem turgor {{pressure}} regulation {{has not been}} extensively studied. The negative relationship of phloem {{turgor pressure}} with leaf water deficit of H. brasiliensis (Buttery and Boatman 1964; 1966), and F. americana (Susan et al. 1981) suggests the water transport to the phloem laticifer vessels is directly responsible for phloem turgor pressure. Similarly, in the tapping induced latex <b>flow</b> <b>course,</b> the recovery of phloem turgor pressure could be also partially ascribed to the influx of water from surrounding tissues. The phloem turgor pressure recorded reflects the balance between fluid loss and fluid gain. In the intact laticifer fluid cytoplasm, the latex, is well equilibrated and under a turgor pressure as high as 10  bar. Upon tapping, the phloem laticifer vessels connected by anastomosis are breached and the turgor pressure of the laticiferous system near the cut will reduce to atmospheric pressure. Immediately, a turgor pressure difference of about 6.9 to 14  bar between the nearby laticiferous vessels and the cut itself will be established (Figures  6 and 7; Additional files 3, 4 and 5) (Buttery and Boatman 1966, 1967) resulting in the latex expulsion. Subsequently, latex coagulation and water influx from surrounding tissues, operating for a long while, will occur leading to a latex flow recession and turgor pressure recovery. When the tree is just tapped, the loss of fluid from the latex outflow is too great to be compensated by water inflow. Hence the turgor pressure drops very immediately after tapping. After a while (normally 8 - 45  min), the latex exudation from the tapping cut receded rapidly due to the gradually plugging of the severed laticifer vessels. When the rate of water inflow into the latex vessels exceeds the rate of latex exudation from the tapping cut, phloem turgor pressure rises. The gradually increase of phloem turgor pressure 8 - 45  min after tapping (Figure  6 and Additional files 3 and 4) is therefore a consequence of laticifer vessel water inflow accompanied by plugging that were well documented (D’Auzac et al. 1989; Frey-Wyssling 1932; Pakianathan et al. 1966; Priyadarshan 2011). The relative higher turgor pressure at 5  cm beneath the tapping cut than that at 25  cm below the tapping cut before the latex flow cease (Figure  7 and Additional file 5) is because that maximum latex dilution occurs {{very close to the}} tapping cut or even at the tapping cut itself (D’Auzac et al. 1989). Therefore, the real time measurement of rubber tree phloem turgor pressure with PTPP could better understand its latex flow and phloem water relationship. The PTPP could probably also extend to investigate the phloem water relationship and turgor pressure regulation of other woody plant trunk.|$|E
