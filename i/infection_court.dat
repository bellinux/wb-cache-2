30|$|Nectria flute canker, {{caused by}} N. fuckeliana (Dick and Crane 2009), is an {{important}} disease of Pinus radiata in New Zealand (Gadgil 2003) and Chile (Morales 2009). The flute canker disease is associated with pruning wounds (Gadgil 2003; Hopkins et al. 2012; Morales 2009) and the fungus {{has been found in}} wounded tissue of Picea abies in Europe (Huse 1981; Metzler 1997; Roll-Hansen and Roll-Hansen 19791980; Vasiliauskas and Stenlid 1998; Vasiliauskas et al. 1996); therefore, it was hypothesised that pruning wounds serve as the primary <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> for N. fuckeliana in Pinus radiata. In this study, we assessed the presence of N. fuckeliana in pruned and unpruned Pinus radiata and the results indicated that pruning wounds are not the primary <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> for the pathogen. There was no significant difference of the presence of the fungus in pruned and unpruned trees. These results do not rule out pruning wounds as <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> for N. fuckeliana, and this study provides some limited evidence of an increasing level of infection in pruned versus unpruned trees {{over the course of the}} study (Figure 4). However, the similar level of infection between pruned and unpruned trees (Figure 3 a) suggests that the fungus is able to enter Pinus radiata via other routes, and demonstrates that pruning wounds are not the only <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> or even the primary <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> for the fungus.

The fungus can then lie dormant for up to 50 years, until activated by host stressors, such as large branch stubs, logging injury, a broken top, or stress cracks, that leads to the initiation of decay (Etheridge and Craig 1976). A similar situation may be occurring in N. fuckeliana infected Pinus radiata. It is also possible that the fungus is able to enter the tree through an alternate <b>infection</b> <b>court,</b> such as cracks in the bark at the branch collar or crotch (Hopkins et al. 2012), become established within the sound stem and then actively incite disease following pruning.|$|E

In view of this, an in vitro experiment was conducted to investigate attachment, colonisation and survival of Bacillus subtilis on avocado flowers. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed that the bacterium could attach and colonise avocado flower surfaces. It can also survive on the flowers {{for longer periods of}} time. In vivo mode of action of the antagonist against stem-end rot (SER) pathogens was also studied where results showed lysis and degradation of hyphae and conidia. However, no viable colonies were retrieved from bee antagonist dispersal under field conditions. Bee antagonist dissemination was compared with antagonist and fungicide spray applications in terms of SER control and the added effect on other diseases such as Cercospora spot and anthracnose. Spray applications of the antagonist were more effective in reducing the incidence of SER than bee dissemination. Integrated sprays of the antagonist and fungicides significantly reduced the incidence of both pre- and postharvest diseases.

Stems were inoculated with a suspension of motile zoospores on the green stem/young periderm region. Light microscopy was used to examine penetration at sites of taxis, and fluorescent microscopy was used to examine penetration sites of seedlings with intact periderm. Two main <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> were identified on stems: the emerging axillary shoot and the region of stem immediately surrounding an axillary shoot, where the periderm was thin or discontinuous. Invasion also occurred at sites where the developing shoot had not yet emerged but was at the stem surface.

Zoospores of P. cinnamomi were not attracted to stomata on mature leaves or green stems. Penetration of the epidermal cell layer of the axillary bud leaf primordia was inter- and intra-cellular; growth of hyphae in the periderm surrounding the shoot was intercellular; while in collenchyma it was inter- and intra-cellular, being intercellular between polyphenolic-rich cells. Exposed stem collenchyma was also directly invaded immediately adjacent to the young axillary shoot.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Verticicladiella wageneri Kendrick is a {{vascular}} wilt pathogen of conifers, causing a black staining of colonized sapwood of roots and lower stem. In Douglas-fir, V. wageneri is intimately associated with insects. Hylastes nigrinus, Pissodes fasciatus, and Steremnuis carinatus are {{commonly associated with}} diseased hosts, carry inoculum of V. wageneri in the field, successfully transmit the pathogen to seedlings under laboratory conditions, and create suitable <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> in susceptible hosts. Furthermore, insect-mediated transmission of V. wageneri has been documented tor the first time. Stand density management, such as precommercial thinning, results in elevated activity of H. nigrinu, P. fasciatus, and S. carinatus in disturbed stands. Insects colonize roots and the root collar region of cut trees; these hosts are susceptible to infection by V. waqeneri. Also, crop trees are wounded on the roots and root collar region by H. nigrinus for {{one to two years}} following precommercial thinning. Some of these wounds penetrate to the xylem and are, therefore, suitable <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> for V. wageneri. Time of precommercial thinning can be manipulated to significantly reduce immigration of vectors, i. e., by thinning plantations during early summer after the peak flight of H. nigrinus. H. nigrinius and S. carinatus are attracted to alpha-pinene, a major constituent of Douglas-fir oleoresin. Forest management activities that injure hosts, and hence cause release of alpha-pinene, may attract vectors of V. wageneri. H. niqrinus and S. carinatus also are attracted to ethanol. In addition, root sections infected with V. wageneri are more attractive to H. nigrinus and S. carinatus than uninfected roots. Aspects of injury and stress to hosts leading to the release of host attractants are discussed.

One gene so identified encodes a putative plant peroxidase protein, which we have named Rip 1 for Rhizobium-induced peroxidase. The accumulation of rip 1 transcript was rapidly and transiently induced by R. meliloti and by the corresponding lipooligosaccharide signal molecule Nod factor RmIV, which was both necessary and sufficient for rip 1 induction. The duration of maximal rip 1 expression coincided with the preinfection period: transcript levels for rip 1 were near maximal by 3 hr postinoculation and declined by 48 hr, coincident with early infection events and the onset of nodule morphogenesis.

In New Zealand, flute canker disease is associated with pruning wounds on Pinus radiata (Gadgil et al. 2003; Hopkins et al. 2012). Pruning wounds have been demonstrated to be important infection courts for Sphaeropsis sapinea (Fr.) Dyko & B.

It was therefore concluded that P. vaccinii is a causal agent of upright dieback disease. ^ Various <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> were tested by conducting inoculations of different tissue using different wounding techniques. It was determined that, while non-wounded plants occasionally developed symptoms, stem-pierce wounds resulted in infection of more plants and typically greater tissue death than other wound techniques. A higher percent of plants on which current-year growth was inoculated developed symptoms compared to plants on which 1 -yr-old growth was inoculated. It was concluded that current-year growth in spring was the most susceptible growth stage, although plants can be infected throughout the season if wounded. It was observed that only current-year growth was affected when infection occurred in the current-year growth, and infection did not progress to adjacent runners or uprights if the infection occurred in the 1 -yr-old growth. ^ It was determined that isolates of P. vaccinii and non- P. vaccinii isolates of Phomopsis could result in symptom development on tissue-cultured cranberry plants and rooted cuttings of cranberry. More P. vaccinii isolates resulted in disease development than other Phomopsis sp. isolates. A few isolates did not result in symptom development on any inoculated plant, or resulted in symptom development on only a low percent of plants. Since these isolates were regularly isolated from symptomless tissue, it is probable that these isolates are non-parasitic endophytes of cranberry plants. ^ P. vaccinii-inoculated tissue-cultured plants were examined microscopically, and P. vaccinii was observed throughout necrotic leaf tissue and in vascular stem tissue. These observations indicate that P. vaccinii is a vascular pathogen. It is expected that the fungus infects succulent growth and progresses from leaf tissue into the stem tissue, or infects through stem wounds, eventually colonizing vascular tissue. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Associations between root {{diseases}} and bark beetles (Scolytidae) constitute {{some of the}} most serious pest complexes affecting forests in North America and elsewhere. The interactive functioning of these pests derives from the following relationships: 1) root diseases predispose trees to bark beetle infestation by lowering resistance, and perhaps increasing attractiveness, of trees to the attacking beetles; 2) bark beetles may be vectors of root disease fungi or may create <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> for them. Symbioses between bark beetles and fungi are common in nature, and previous reviewers (e. g., Graham 1967) have identified several types of these symbiotic relationships, some of which appear to be beneficial to both (mutualism), and others which apparently benefit only one (competition, predation, parasitism). These relationships will be discussed in relation to interactions between root {{diseases and}} bark beetles. Others, which benefit neither (i. e., commensalism or cohabitation), are not considered to be true interactions as defined here, and will not be further mentioned. VECTORING Virtually all bark beetles vector fungi to host trees, inoculating the phloem and xylem as they mine in the cambial region. Much studied are the pathogenic blue- and brown-staining fungi, vectored by stem- and twig-infesting beetles. These fungi largely infect above-ground host tissues and thus are not true root pathogens. Bark beetles can also carry propagules of saprot fung...|$|R
40|$|Erwinia carotovora subsp. betavasculorum strains {{produced}} a bactericidal antibiotic in vitro that inhibited {{a wide spectrum}} of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The optimum temperature for production was 24 °C, and the addition of glycerol to culture media enhanced antibiotic production. Antibiotic production by these strains in the <b>infection</b> <b>court</b> of potato was the principal determinant enabling it to gain ascendancy over competing antibiotic-sensitive Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora strains. There was a complete correlation between antibiotic production by E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum in vitro and inhibition of competing E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains in planta. Inhibition of the latter by the former was apparent after 10 h of incubation in potato tuber wounds. Population densities of sensitive E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains in mixed potato tuber infections with E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum were approximately 106 -fold lower after 48 h of incubation than in corresponding single sensitive strain infections. E. carotovora subsp. carotovora were not inhibited in tuber infections that were incubated anaerobically. This correlated with the absence of antibiotic production during anaerobic incubation in vitro. Antibiotic-resistant strains of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora were not inhibited in planta or in vitro by E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum. Moreover, isogenic antibiotic-negative (Ant−) mutant E. carotovora subsp. betavasculorum strains were not inhibitory to sensitive E. carotovora subsp. carotovora strains in tuber infections...|$|E
40|$|The Karnal bunt pathogen, Tilletia indica, is heterothallic and {{depends on}} {{encounters}} on wheat spikes between airborne secondary sporidia of different mating types for successful infection and reproduction. This life history characteristic results in reduced reproductive success for lower population densities. Such destabilizing density dependence at low population levels {{has been described}} {{for a range of}} animals and plants and is often termed an Allee effect. Our objective was to characterize how the Allee effect might reduce the invasive potential of this economically important pathogen. We developed a simple population model of T. indica that incorporates an Allee effect by calculating the probability of infection for different numbers of secondary sporidia in the <b>infection</b> <b>court.</b> An Allee effect is predicted to be important at the frontier of an invasion, for establishment of new foci by a small population of teliospores, and when the environment is nonconducive for the production of secondary sporidia. Using estimated model parameter values, we demonstrated a theoretical threshold population size below which populations of T. indica were predicted to decline rather than increase. This threshold will vary from season to season as a function of weather variables and their effect on the reproductive potential of T. indica. Deployment of partial resistance or use of fungicides may be more useful if they push population levels below this threshold...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} sclerotinia stem rot in {{commercial}} rapeseed fields in East and West Central Saskatchewan in 1983 and 1984, several factors relating to inoculum density were monitored when the crops were in bloom. Carpogenically-germinated sclerotia were counted in I II specific areas. The frequencies of Sclerotinia-infested live and dead petals, leafaxils and leaf bases were determined by plating on potato dextrose agar with added rose bengal and streptomycin. The final percentage of diseased plants was determined shortly before the crops were swathed. The results demonstrated {{a significant relationship between}} petal infestation at early bloom and final disease. Significant relationships between germinated sclerotia and disease were obtained only with intensive sampling. Infested petals and disease were regularly found when apothecia were absent, thereby demonstrating the infective potential of extrinsically produced ascospores. The possibility of using petal infestation to forecast stem rot and improve the economics of chemical control is discussed; however, several, refinements in the technique are required. Laboratory studies demonstrated the potential for petals to be colonized by. sclerotiorum before falling from the inflorescences onto plant surfaces. Laboratory and field studies of the persistence of water droplets in leaf axils, a major <b>infection</b> <b>court</b> of rapeseed, demonstrated that water sometimes persisted for relatively long periods even when ambient environmental conditions were generally unfavorable for infection. In view of the moisture requirements for infection, this may partially explain the occurrence of low to moderate levels of disease in some rapeseed fields during relatively dry years...|$|E

They are hypothesized to enhance infection and tissue colonization. Growth of F. graminearum was examined on media amended with extracts from floral parts of nine wheat genotypes with various Fusarium head blight resistance levels. Results indicated no significant effect of anther, palea, or lemma extracts on radial growth when compared with unamended controls. Effects on spore germination and hyphal growth of F. graminearum by choline, betaine, and an equimolar mixture at concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 1, 000 μM also were examined. Spore germination was not significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) affected by choline, betaine, {{or a combination of}} the compounds compared with unamended controls. Radial hyphal growth also was not consistently affected (P ≤ 0. 05) by choline or betaine when compared with controls. Equimolar mixtures of the two compounds showed significant slight reduction in growth rate at higher concentrations when compared with controls. The reduction in growth rate was due to higher concentrations of betaine. Results {{of this study indicate that}} endogenous compounds in floral parts may not be associated with wheat resistance to F. graminearum...|$|R

40|$|Choanephora cucurbitarum is a plant {{pathogenic}} fungus {{with a wide}} host range. The fungus {{was isolated}} from rotting fruits of Capsicum anuum, after {{it was observed that}} some vegetables were infected in the farm. The role of <b>infection</b> <b>courts</b> on severity was determined by inoculating the pathogen into soil, leaves and stems of the test plants. The test plants used were Abelmoschus esculentus, Amaranthus sp. Cucumis sativus and Vigna unguiculata. Determinants of pathogenicity were plant height, leaf reduction, fresh and dry weight. Results showed that the fungus was pathogenic to the test plants. A significant reduction in height, leaves, fresh and dry weight of the test plants was observed when compared with the control. The greatest effect of the pathogen was on the inoculated stem of the test plants with a mean of 42. 94. The least effect was observed on infected soil with a mean of 92. 99. Cucumis sativus showed the least effect by the pathogen with a mean of 84. 18, while Abelmoschus esculentus showed the greatest effect with a mean of 44. 59. The pathogen showed the greatest effect on leaves of Cucumis sativus with a mean of 20. 45, while the least effect was on Vigna unguiculata with a mean of 36. 77. Fresh weight ranged from 3. 35 g to 37. 40 g, Dry weight 2. 15 to 7. 90 g as compared with the control which had a fresh weight of 7. 0 g to 57. 25 g and 3. 8 g to 11. 90 g for dry weight. Symptoms such as leaf blight, blight of the shoot apex, soft rot of stems, die back and decay of Vigna unguiculata pods were observed...|$|R
