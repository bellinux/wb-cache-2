Before and after conditioning phase subjects were measured Body weight, 8 parts of girth, 13 parts of skinfold thickness. The parts which had highly skinfold thickness before conditioning tend to more <b>degrease</b> than those which had less. % Fat was estimated by 2 methods which measured skinfold thickness and Total body water. Body weights were unchanged (52. 8 ± 5. 03, 52. 9 ± 4. 52 kg). 5 parts of girthes except arm and forearm were <b>degreased,</b> wherereas only calf girth was increased because of muscle hypertrophy. 12 parts of skinfold thickness except a part of cheek were also <b>degreased.</b> % Fat was 10 % grater for the using T.

25|$|Many {{chemicals}} undergo reactive decay {{or chemical}} change, especially {{over long periods}} of time in groundwater reservoirs. A noteworthy class of such chemicals is the chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene (used in industrial metal <b>degreasing</b> and electronics manufacturing) and tetrachloroethylene used in the dry cleaning industry. Both of these chemicals, which are carcinogens themselves, undergo partial decomposition reactions, leading to new hazardous chemicals (including dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride).|$|E
25|$|Organic {{chemicals}} {{are widely used}} as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, <b>degreasing,</b> and hobby products. Fuels {{are made up of}} organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds during usage, and, to some degree, when they are stored. Testing emissions from building materials used indoors has become increasingly common for floor coverings, paints, and many other important indoor building materials and finishes.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{concerns}} about its toxicity, {{the use of}} trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned {{in much of the}} world since the 1970s. Legislation has forced the substitution of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 risk phrase, May cause cancer. Many <b>degreasing</b> chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on n-propyl bromide which carries an R60 risk phrase of May impair fertility, and they would not be a legally acceptable substitute.|$|E
25|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} {{are used}} in nearly any industrial practice where <b>degreasing</b> removers are required. PCE is a highly utilized solvent in the dry cleaning industry because of its cleaning effectiveness and relatively low cost. It has also been used for metal-degreasing operations. Because it is highly volatile, it is more frequently found in groundwater than in surface water. TCE has historically {{been used as a}} metal cleaning. The military facility Anniston Army Dept (ANAD) in the United States was placed on the US EPA Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) because of groundwater contamination with as much as 27 million pounds of TCE. Both PCE and TCE may degrade to vinyl chloride (VC), the most toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon.|$|E
25|$|A {{common use}} of sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is in the}} production of parts washer detergents. Parts washer detergents based on sodium hydroxide {{are some of the most}} aggressive parts washer cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, rust inhibitors and defoamers. A parts washer heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for <b>degreasing</b> applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many solvent-based systems in the early 1990s when trichloroethane was outlawed by the Montreal Protocol. Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the solvent-based cleaning methods.|$|E

These spills collected in the chalk underlying Sawston until groundwater swept them into the Cambridge Water Company's borehole.|$|E
500|$|Welders {{are also}} often exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. [...] While the process doesn't produce smoke, {{the brightness of}} the arc in GTAW can break down surrounding air to form ozone and nitric oxides. The ozone and nitric oxides react with lung tissue and moisture to create nitric acid and ozone burn. Ozone and nitric oxide levels are moderate, but exposure duration, repeated exposure, and {{the quality and quantity of}} fume extraction, and air change in the room must be monitored. Welders who do not work safely can contract emphysema and oedema of the lungs, which can lead to early death. Similarly, the heat from the arc can cause poisonous fumes to form from cleaning and <b>degreasing</b> materials. Cleaning operations using these agents should not be performed near the site of welding, and proper ventilation is necessary to protect the welder.|$|E
