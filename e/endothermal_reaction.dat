The first method is thermally-driven local synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures where localized temperature field enhances mass transport of precursor materials and <b>endothermal</b> <b>reaction</b> at selected regions.

30|$|Figure  9 {{indicates}} that the whole trends of heat flux for all the pyrite contents are similar. At the early stage of the oxidation process, the values of heat flux are negative indicating endothermal reactions, primarily due to the highly humid environments (The moisture content in the coal samples are 10.12  %). The existence of moisture can absorb the heat and prohibit the chemical reactions as well. Consequently, the oxidation reaction proceeds slowly {{and so does the}} endothermal process. As the temperature rises, the moisture evaporates and the oxidation reaction speeds up, leading to an increase of heat flux. After the proceeding of the reaction reaches to certain values, the <b>endothermal</b> <b>reaction</b> converts to exothermal reaction.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the modular High Temperature Reactor with blockfuel {{elements}} is developed and a comparison with the modular Pebble Bed High Temperature Reactor is performed in this report. The fitting of a graphite column into the mean corezone serves to limit the maximum fuel element temperature to less than 1600 °C {{in the case of}} a loss-of-coolant-accident. The "Pushthrough"-loading can decrease the fuel element temperature under normal operation. Under normal operation the Pebble Bed High Temperature Reactoris characterized by a low fuel element temperature. The lost of pressure in the core has a low value of 0, 2 bar at a system pressure of 40 bar. In the primary cycle therefore the system pressure can be decreased with respect to the <b>endothermal</b> <b>reaction</b> by the nuclear process heat application...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in a rotary reactor is described for a reactor {{consisting of a}} graphite tube with graphite heating elements, and operating at temperatures between 1773 and 2273 K. Under those conditions heat transfer is very good due to radiation and the high thermal conductivity of graphite. An overall coefficient of heat transfer of at least 400 W/m²K is estimated. As {{an example of the}} application of a rotary reactor the carbothermal production of SiC is described.

40|$|The {{structure}} and emission spectrum of J shocks in molecular gas are studied over {{a broad range}} of conditions. It is found that at high densities chemistry has a profound effect on the emission spectrum: the density behind the shock is sufficiently high that some of the internal energy of the newly formed H 2 molecules is transformed to the gas as heat by collisional deexcitations, producing the H 2 formation plateau. In this temperature plateau, <b>endothermal</b> <b>reactions</b> and neutral-neutral chemical reactions with activation energies can proceed efficiently, producing significant quantities of warm H 2, CO, OH, and H 2 O and enhanced columns of warm atoms and ions. The heat generated by the H 2 formation is radiated in collisionally excited atomic fine-structure lines...|$|R
40|$|First-principles {{calculations}} {{reveal that}} the adsorption of representative first-row atoms with different electronegativity, such as lithium (Li), carbon (C) and fluorine (F), on zigzag single-walled boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibits surprising selectivity. The adsorption energy and adsorption site are dependent upon the chemical activity of adsorbate {{with respect to the}} B and N atoms in the host tube. In detail, the F atom prefers to be adsorbed {{on the top of the}} B atom, the C atom is energetically favorable to stay on the bridge site which is perpendicular to the tube-axis, and the Li atom hardly adheres to the tube (an <b>endothermal</b> <b>reaction).</b> The adsorption behavior of these three types of elements on BNNTs is elucidated based on the frontier molecular orbital theory. In addition, the mechanism of modification of electronic structures of BNNTs by adsorption is probed, and a feasible approach is proposed to tailor the electronic properties of BNNTs.

40|$|International audienceTo {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of the electrochemical effects observed on an original potentiometric gas sensor, interactions of oxygen with the device were investigated. This gas sensor is made of a solid electrolyte (treated Na-β-alumina) associated with two metallic electrodes (gold and platinum) located in the same gas mixture. Adsorption of charged oxygen species, considered responsible for the electrical response developed by the sensor, was investigated by work function measurements. Results showed that charged oxygen species only form on partially gold or platinum covered solid electrolyte. Comparison of these results with those obtained in a previous calorimetric study of interactions between oxygen and the same materials suggests the existence of at least two different oxygen species adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} sensitive element. The first one, located on the solid electrolyte surface, is neutral and characterized by an <b>endothermal</b> <b>reaction</b> of formation. The second one is charged and probably produced at the gas/solid electrolyte/metallic electrode interface. A mechanism based on the concept of "three phase boundary" and similar to the "reverse spillover" phenomenon is proposed to account for the adsorption of these oxygen species...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the second of a series devoted to the {{extension}} of ChapmanEnskog's method to inelastic collisions 1). This note is mainly concerned with {{the study of the}} influence of the heat of reaction on the Maxwell distribution. As shown in the first paper this effect is in general small for the activation energy. The heat of reaction, however, can perturb the Maxwell distribution to an appreciable extent. As a result, the reaction rate is increased for exothermal, decreased for <b>endothermal</b> <b>reactions.</b> The effect is especially important for exothermal reactions. At the same time, the order of the reaction is increased. The calculations have been performed for the initial rate of a reaction of the type A 0 + B → A 1 + B. In this case the result can be expressed by the following equation v = v(0) (1 + 1, 2 xA 0 xBrVT ε{lunate}*) where ε* is the activation energy, γVT the heat of reaction and xA 0 xB the mole fractions of A 0 and B; v(0) is the reaction rate estimated by assuming Maxwell distributions for each constituent. © 1950.

40|$|Extensive R&D is in {{progress}} to exploit the huge amount of solar energy falling on Earth (105 TW). A fast growing technology developed to pursue this goal is Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) : a field of optical sun tracking mirrors is used to concentrate the solar energy onto a receiver to eventually produce electricity or to drive an endothermic chemical reaction. The key to success of CSP is the integration with thermal energy storage systems, which provide a mean to overcome the inherent limitations associated with the variable/seasonal availability and spatial non uniformity of the primary energy source. Incident fluxes in CSP can reach and exceed 3000 kW m– 2. For this reason, the receiver has {{a crucial role in}} CSP systems, as it must collect and transfer the incident solar energy while ensuring low heat losses and minimizing local overheating. Gas−solid Fluidized Beds (FB) can be conveniently applied to CSP thanks to their large heat transfer coefficients and effective thermal diffusivities. The interaction between the incident radiative flux and the FB can occur in an indirect way, focusing the radiation onto an exposed surface which transfers the heat to the FB, or in a direct way, providing the FB with transparent walls or windows. Direct absorption of solar energy permits operating temperatures high enough to perform thermochemical storage processes with high energy density. A critical issue in FB receivers is the bed surface overheating −induced by high concentrated solar radiations− that can cause sintering and/or degradation of the fluidized particles, hence a strong reduction of the thermochemical cycles efficiency. In {{the first part of the}} present work, the dynamics of a directly irradiated FB exposed to a highly concentrated simulated solar radiation has been investigated. Analysis of local temperature fluctuations in time and frequency domains has been performed. Conditioning of bed hydrodynamics close to the surface has been investigated as a mean to improve the interaction between the incident radiative flux and the bed. In the second part of the work, the application of a solar irradiated reactor to <b>endothermal</b> <b>reactions</b> has been demonstrated with reference to solar driven limestone calcination, followed by autothermal recarbonation of lime. Solar driven calcination has been investigated with the twofold perspective of: a) accomplishing thermochemical energy storage by a reversible high enthalpy and high temperature chemical reaction; b) performing solar aided CO 2 capture from flue gas to be embodied in carbon capture and sequestration schemes such as calcium looping...|$|R
40|$|The {{binary system}} of {{vanadium}} and nitrogen offers promising phases {{in order to}} enhance the tribological properties of common hard coatings, owing to their ability to form lubricious oxides, often also referred to as Magnéli phases, at elevated tem-peratures. The aim of this work is to characterize VN coatings prepared by reactive unbalanced magnetron sputtering, and to verify the new concept of solid/liquid oxide lubrication. Oxidation of the coatings and possible melting of the oxides were investi-gated by dynamic Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) up to 900 C in air. On heating the coating samples, exothermal reactions appeared during the DSC measurements indicating oxidation in the tempera-ture range of 500 – 650 C. Subsequently, <b>endothermal</b> melting <b>reactions</b> were observed between 650 and 850 C. To investigate the effect of oxide formation and melting, dry sliding experiments against alumina and austenitic stainless steel balls were per-formed using a ball-on-disc tribometer in the temperature range between 25 C and 700 C.

40|$|To use {{heat from}} carbon-free sources like {{concentrated}} solar radiation to drive chemical reactions {{for the production}} of transportation fuels or of chemical commodities represents a promising way to replace established industrial processes and to avoid substantial amounts of climate relevant emissions. Recent developments offer attractive medium- to long-term prospects for the provision of chemicals like ammonia, sulfur, phosphates or cement and fuels like hydrogen and synthesis gas. The direct use of solar heat to drive <b>endothermal</b> chemical <b>reactions</b> in a temperature range between 500 and 1800 °C is possible. In the field of solar fuels production so-called thermo-chemical cycles are a viable option to produce hydrogen from water or syngas from water and CO 2 at an acceptable temperature level. The most prominent examples are cycles from the so-called sulphur family, the hybrid sulphur and the sulphur-iodine process, and redox cycles applying metal/metal oxide pairs or multi-valent metal oxides which are capable to reversible incorporate oxygen in this lattice. The present analysis gives an overview on recent developments and the state-of-the art of high temperature fuels or chemical commodities producing solar processes. It will have a look on the most important performance parameters involved and will give an outlook on further potential and necessary developments. In addition we look at variants of such processes offering the chance to use them for thermo-chemically storage of solar heat or for air separation...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide {{capture and}} storage has {{recently}} received increasing attention {{as a mean to}} moderate environmental {{problems related to}} CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere. In this scenario, the Calcium Looping (CaL) process carried out in dual interconnected fluidized bed systems is among the most promising techniques to treat CO 2 -containing combustion flue gases. CaL is based on alternated temperature-swing CO 2 uptake, with absorption taking place in a carbonator operated at around 650 – 700 °C, followed by release of concentrated CO 2 in a calciner operated at around 900 – 950 °C, according to the reversible reaction CaO(s) +CO 2 (g) =CaCO 3 (s). A somehow less investigated aspect of CaL is represented by the possible effect of steam. Steam can be present in a CaL process in both the carbonator, where the flue gas coming from a combustion unit and contacting the sorbent may contain significant amounts of it, and the calciner, which is typically operated as an oxyfuel combustor to drive the <b>endothermal</b> calcination <b>reaction,</b> hence with appreciable partial pressure of steam. Recent studies highlighted that, during high-temperature calcination, steam may induce relevant changes in the micro-texture of sorbent calcines. Moreover, tests carried out exposing a sorbent to steam during the carbonation stage indicated that steam can “catalyze” the heterogeneous CaO/CO 2 reaction by enhancing the CO 2 diffusion across the CaCO 3 -rich shell of the sorbent particles. This study aims at improving the current level of understanding of the influence of steam on the development of textural and microstructural properties of a limestone-based sorbent upon iterated carbonation/calcination cycles. To this end, an experimental campaign has been performed in a lab-scale fluidized bed reactor. The campaign consisted in a reference test without steam, whose results are compared with tests in which sorbents were exposed to steam in either the calcination or the carbonation stages, or in both...|$|R
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ING+MLU:FRM:NOG:YSCInternational audienceBiogas is {{a complex}} gas mixture {{primarily}} composed of methane and carbon dioxide, which is produced by anaerobic digestion of biomass. Biogas can be reformed into hydrogen-rich syngas for fuel-cell applications. In this study, autothermal reforming (ATR) of model biogas was performed. Previous screening of catalysts for this reaction led to {{the selection of a}} Ni-Rh/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst, which showed a stable performance over more than 300 hours [1]. SiC foams are promising catalyst supports for small size ATR units. They have excellent thermal characteristics and low pressure drops, permitting a very compact reformer. For a better reformer design a kinetic model of the biogas ATR reaction is highly desirable. Several kinetic models for methane reforming are available in the literature but only a few models exist for methane ATR [2], [3]. In this study, a kinetic model was developed for the ATR of model biogas over SiC foams coated with a 15 - 0. 05 wt. % Ni-Rh/MgAl 2 O 4 catalyst. The tested foam samples had a diameter of 2. 5 cm and two different lengths were used: 2. 5 and 1. 4 cm (Figure 1). The carrier gas was a mixture composed of steam, CH 4, CO 2, O 2 in a balance of inert argon. The operating variables were temperature, gas hourly space velocity as well as steam/CH 4, CO 2 /CH 4 and O 2 /CH 4 ratios. Overall 65 experiments were performed. Figure 1 : SiC foam coated with 15 wt. % Ni- 0. 05 wt. % Rh/MgAl 2 O 4 catalystFig. 2 shows the effect of the inlet O 2 /CH 4 and H 2 O/CH 4 ratios on the catalyst performances at 650 and 700 °C. The relatively low temperatures and high GHSV were chosen to ensure incomplete conversions of methane, necessary for kinetic studies. High H 2 /CO ratios and high methane conversions were observed even at severe GHSV conditions. At 650 °C, the conversion of methane increased with the O 2 /CH 4 ratio, since more oxygen translates into more methane burnt in CO 2, and also more heat supplied to the <b>endothermal</b> reforming <b>reactions.</b> At 700 °C the methane conversion was not modified with the O 2 /CH 4 ratio but the H 2 /CO ratio increased with the O 2 /CH 4 ratio. When the H 2 O/CH 4 ratio increased, higher conversions and higher H 2 /CO ratios were reached. Indeed, the water gas shift reaction is greatly influenced by the inlet partial pressure of H 2 O Figure 2 : Observed methane conversion at 700 °C () and 650 °C () as well as H 2 /CO ratio at 700 °C () and 650 °C () as a function of (a) the O 2 /CH 4 ratio (H 2 O/CH 4 fixed at 3) and (b) the H 2 O/CH 4 ratio (O 2 /CH 4 fixed at 0. 5) during the ATR reforming of biogas (GHSV = 15000 h- 1). The performance of the model was tested by using three objectives functions: the methane conversion, the temperature {{at the center of the}} catalyst foam and the H 2 /CO ratio at the reactor exit. Two different models were tested consisting of the same model for methane combustion combined with two different methane reforming models, one by Hou and Hughes [4] and one by Xu and Froment [5]. The latter one was also used by Halabi et al. to simulate an ATR reactor [2]. Initial simulations showed that the rate of methane combustion was too slow, giving incomplete oxygen conversion. The corresponding rate coefficient was therefore increased until a reasonable comparison with the experimental data was reached. Axial temperature gradient could not be avoided and had to be taken into account in the model. Therefore a one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous plug-flow reactor with axial temperature gradient was applied. Initial simulations showed that the model by Xu and Froment [5] outperformed the model by Hou and Hughes [4] and further optimization was done using the Xu and Froment model with the model adequately described the measured data (Figure 3). Figure 3 : Parity plot A kinetic ATR model reported in the literature has thus been successfully adapted to describe adequately the experimental ATR data over the foam catalyst. The main change concerned the higher rate of methane combustion, probably due to the presence of rhodium in our sample, which is a better combustion catalyst. Studies are ongoing on powder for comparison purposes.
