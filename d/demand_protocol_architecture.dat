In The classical TCPilP layered <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> {{is beginning}} to show signs of age. In order to cope with. problems such as the poor performance of wireless links and mobile terminals, including the high error rate of wireless network interfaces, power saving requirements, quality of service, and an increasingly dynamic network environment, a <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> that considers cross-layer interactions seems to he required.

40|$|The Source Specific Multicast (SSM) service {{model and}} <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> have {{recently}} been proposed {{as an alternative to}} the currently deployed Any Source Multicast (ASM) service. SSM attempts to solve many of the deployment problems of ASM including protocol complexity, inter-domain scalability, and security weaknesses. However, the SSM <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> is not radically different from that of ASM. This has created opportunities for integrating it into the currently deployed ASM infrastructure. In this paper, we first describe the ASM and SSM service models and associated <b>protocol</b> <b>architectures,</b> highlighting the relative merits and demerits of each. We then examine the network infrastructure needed to support both of them. Our conclusion is that integration is relatively straightforward in most cases; however there is one case [...] -supporting ASM service over an SSM-only <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> [...] -for which it is difficult to design elegant solutions for an integrated SSM/ASM infrastructure. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{comparison}} to other communication networks, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have unique requirements {{with respect to}} applications, types of communication, self-organization and other issues. In order to meet these requirements, the structuring of functionalities into protocols and their interaction must be re-thought for VANETs. The traditional approach of decomposition of functionality into protocol layers (layered approach) and a protocol design specifically tailored {{to the needs of}} VANETs (unlayered approach) lead to two extreme and opposed manifestations of a potential VANET <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture.</b> From these two extreme approaches we derive a stack-based VANET <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> that combines the strengths of both sides. Among the key features of this <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> are VANET-specific <b>protocol</b> layers, a staircase approach for interaction among layers and the use of an information connector for cross-layer information exchange using the publisher/subscriber pattern. We believe that this <b>protocol</b> <b>architecture</b> provides a clear modular structure with flexibility for protocol interaction and information exchange at a reasonable complexity. I...|$|R
