5000|$|Blackouts can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} 2 categories, [...] "en bloc" [...] blackouts and [...] "fragmentary" [...] blackouts. En bloc blackouts are classified by the inability to later recall any memories from the intoxication period, even when prompted. These blackouts are characterized also by the ability to easily recall things that have occurred within the last 2 minutes, yet being unable to recall anything prior to this period. As such, a person experiencing an en bloc blackout may {{not appear to be}} doing so, as they can carry on conversations or even manage to accomplish difficult feats. It is difficult to determine the end of this type of blackout as sleep typically occurs before they end, although it is possible for an en bloc blackout to end if the sufferer has stopped drinking in the meantime. Fragmentary blackouts are characterized by a person having the ability to recall certain events from an intoxicated period, and yet being unaware that other memories are missing until reminded of the existence of those 'gaps' in memory. Research indicates that such fragmentary blackouts, also known as brownouts, are far more common than en bloc blackouts. Memory impairment during acute intoxication involves dysfunction of episodic memory, a type of memory encoded with spatial and social context. Recent studies have shown that there are multiple memory systems supported by <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>regions,</b> and the acute effects of alcohol and learning and memory may result from alteration of the hippocampus and related structures on a cellular level. A rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is most consistently associated with the likelihood of a blackout. However, not all subjects experience blackouts which implies that genetic factors play a role in determining central nervous system (CNS) vulnerability to the effects of alcohol. The former may predispose an individual to alcoholism, as altered memory function during intoxication may affect an individual’s alcohol expectancy, one may perceive positive aspects of intoxication while unintentionally ignoring the negative aspects.|$|E

An SPM-compatible Matlab toolbox has been developed which allows the creation of subject-specific ROI masks based on anatomical markers and the testing of functional hypotheses on the regional response using multivariate time-series analysis techniques. The combined application of subject-specific ROI definition and region-level functional analysis is shown to appropriately compensate for inter-subject anatomical variability, offering finer localization and increased sensitivity to task-related effects than standard techniques based on whole brain normalization and voxel or cluster-level functional analysis, while providing a more direct link between <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> hypotheses and the statistical analyses used to test them.

40|$|What hippocampal neural firing {{patterns}} signal memory and, more importantly, how is {{this memory}} code used by associated structures to translate a memory into a decision or action? Candidate hippocampal activity patterns will be discussed including (1) trajectory-specific firing of place cells with place fields on an overlapping segment of two (or more) distinct trajectories (2) prospective firing of hippocampal neurons that signal an upcom-ing event or action, and (3) place cell remapping to changes in environment and task.

New findings suggest that learning and memory processes are emergent properties of interregional interactions and not localized within any one <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>region.</b> Therefore, the next step in understanding how remapping and trajectory coding participate in memory coding may be to investigate how these activ-ity patterns relate to activity in anatomically connected structures such as the prefrontal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is a {{heterogeneous}} disorder with many {{factors contributing to}} a spectrum of severity, leading to cognitive dysfunction that may last for many years after injury. Injury to axons in the white matter, which are preferentially vulnerable to biomechanical forces, is prevalent in many TBIs. Unlike focal injury to a <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>region,</b> axonal injury is fundamentally an injury to the substrate by which networks of the brain communicate with one another. The brain is envisioned {{as a series of}} dynamic, interconnected networks that communicate via long axonal conduits termed the connectome. Ensembles of neurons communicate via these pathways and encode information within and between <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> in ways that are timing dependent. Our central hypothesis is that traumatic injury to axons may disrupt the exquisite timing of neuronal communication within and between brain networks, and that this may underlie aspects of post-TBI cognitive dysfunction. With {{a better understanding of how}} highly interconnected networks of neurons communicate with one another in important cognitive regions such as the limbic system, and how disruption of this communication occurs during injury, we can identify new therapeutic targets to restore lost function. This requires the tools of systems neuroscience, including electrophysiological analysis of ensemble neuronal activity and circuitry changes in awake animals after TBI, as well as computational modeling of the effects of TBI on these networks. As more is revealed about how inter-regional neuronal interactions are disrupted, treatments directly targeting these dysfunctional pathways using neuromodulation can be developed...|$|R

Swiss mice, Mus musculus, were given 270 ppm fluoride (600 ppm NaF) in their drinking water for 30 days, while continuing the fluoride exposure, toxicated animals were given differential doses (50 - 250 mg/kg body wt) of phytoextracts through oral gavage for 2 weeks. <b>Discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> separated from dissected animals to perform biochemical assessments. Disturbances in mitochondrial enzyme complexes (I-IV) and decrements in TCA enzymes (ICDH, SDH, and aconitase) were noted in <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> upon F exposure, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, {{a significant reduction in}} oxidative stress indices with increased MDA content as well as decrease in reduced glutathione content and increases in catalase and SOD enzyme activity suggests the involvement of severe oxidative stress affecting the mitochondrial function(s). Treatment with either GE or BLE reversed F-induced alterations in augmenting the suppressed complex enzymes followed by TCA enzymes and oxidative stress indices in a dose independent manner. However, the co-exposure of GE and BLE at a dose of 150 mg/kgbw appeared to restore mitochondrial functioning. These results provide in vivo evidence supporting the hypothesis that fluoride induces impairments in mitochondrial function, which can be reversed by treatment with GE and BLE as well their co-exposure at 150 mg/kgbw.

40|$|Abstract Background Production of contextually {{appropriate}} {{social behaviors}} involves integrated activity across many <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> Many songbird species produce complex vocalizations called ‘songs’ that serve to attract potential mates, defend territories, and/or maintain flock cohesion. There are {{a series of}} <b>discrete</b> interconnect <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> that are essential for the successful production of song. The probability and intensity of singing behavior is influenced by the reproductive state. The objectives of this study were to examine the broad changes in gene expression in <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> that control song production with a <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> that governs the reproductive state. Results We show using microarray cDNA analysis that two <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> systems that are both involved in governing singing behavior show markedly different gene expression profiles. We found that cortical and basal ganglia-like <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> that control the socio-motor production of song in birds exhibit a categorical switch in gene expression that was dependent on their reproductive state. This pattern is {{in stark contrast to the}} pattern of expression observed in a hypothalamic <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> that governs the neuroendocrine control of reproduction. Subsequent gene ontology analysis revealed marked variation in the functional categories of active genes dependent on reproductive state and anatomical localization. HVC, one cortical-like structure, displayed significant gene expression changes associated with microtubule and neurofilament cytoskeleton organization, MAP kinase activity, and steroid hormone receptor complex activity. The transitions observed in the preoptic area, a nucleus that governs the motivation to engage in singing, exhibited variation in functional categories that included thyroid hormone receptor activity, epigenetic and angiogenetic processes. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of considering the temporal patterns of gene expression across several <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> when engaging in social behaviors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Binge eating episodes are {{characterized}} by uncontrollable, distressing eating of {{a large amount of}} highly palatable food and represent a central feature of bingeing related eating disorders. Research suggests that inflammation plays a role in the onset and maintenance of eating-related maladaptive behavior. Markers of inflammation can be selectively altered in <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> where they can directly or indirectly regulate food intake. In the present study we measured expression levels of different components of cytokine systems (IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 18, TNF- and IFN-ɣ) and related molecules (iNOS and COX 2) in the preoptic and anterior-tuberal parts of the hypothalamus of a validated animal model of binge eating. In this animal model, based on the exposure to both food restriction and frustration stress, binge-like eating behavior for highly palatable food is not shown when animals are exposed to the frustration stress during the estrus phase. We found a characteristic down-regulation of the IL- 18 / IL- 18 receptor system (with increased expression of the inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL 18, IL- 18 BP, together with a decreased expression of the binding chain of the IL- 18 receptor) and a three-fold increase in the expression of iNOS specifically in the anterior- tuberal region of the hypothalamus of animals that develop a binge-like eating behavior. Differently, when food restricted animals were stressed during the estrus phase IL- 18 expression increased while iNOS expression was not significantly affected. Considering the role of this region of the hypothalamus in controlling feeding related behavior, this can be relevant in eating disorders and obesity. Our data suggest that by targeting centrally selected inflammatory markers, we may prevent that disordered eating turns into a full blown eating disorder...|$|R

Aspartame was administered orally to the MTX treated animals and was studied along with controls and MTX treated controls. Oral intubations of FDA approved 40  mg/kg b. wt aspartame were given daily for 90 days. The loco–motor activity and emotionality {{behavior in the}} aspartame treated animals showed a marked increase in the immobilization, fecal bolus with a marked decrease in ambulation, rearing, grooming. The anxiety behavior in the aspartame treated animals showed a marked decrease in percentage of open arm entry, percentage {{of time spent in}} open arm and number of head dips. It is appropriate to point out, formaldehyde and formate could have led to an increased formation of free radical in the aspartame treated animals resulting in altered neurobehavioral changes owing to neuronal oxidative damage. Aspartame induced ROS may be also linked to increased neuronal apoptosis. In this study the aspartame treated animals showed an up regulation in the apoptotic gene expression along with protein expression in the respective <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> indicating the enhancement of neuronal cell death.

40|$|The rate of {{conversion}} of [1, 3 - 14 C]glycerol into 14 CO 2 was measured in the presence and absence of unlabelled alternative substrates in whole homogenates from the brains of young (4 - 6 and 18 - 20 days old) and adult rats. Unlabelled glucose decreased 14 CO 2 production from [1, 3 - 14 C]glycerol by about 40 % at all ages studied. Unlabelled 3 -hydroxybutyrate significantly decreased the 14 CO 2 production from both low (0. 2 mM) and high (2. 0 mM) concentrations of glycerol in 4 - 6 - and 18 - 20 -day-old rat pups. However, the addition of 3 -hydroxybutyrate {{had no effect on}} the rate of 14 CO 2 production from 2. 0 mM-glycerol in adult rats, suggesting that the interaction of 3 -hydroxybutyrate with glycerol in adult rat brain is complex and {{may be related to the}} biphasic kinetics previously reported for glycerol oxidation. Unlabelled glutamine decreased the production of 14 CO 2 by brain homogenates from 18 - 20 -day-old and adult rats, but not in 4 - 6 -day-old rat pups. In the converse situation, the addition of unlabelled glycerol to whole brain homogenates had little effect on the rate of 14 CO 2 production from [6 - 14 C]glucose, 3 -hydroxy[3 - 14 C]butyrate and [U- 14 C]glutamine, although some significant differences were noted. Collectively these results suggest that glycerol and these other substrates may be metabolized in separate subcellular compartments in brain such that the products of glucose, 3 -hydroxybutyrate and glutamine metabolism can dilute the oxidation of glycerol, but the converse cannot occur. The data also demonstrate that there are complex age-related changes in the interaction of glycerol with 3 -hydroxybutyrate and glutamine. The fact that glycerol oxidation was only partially suppressed by the addition of 1 - 5 mM-glucose, - 3 -hydroxybutyrate or -glutamine could also suggest that glycerol may be selectively utilized as an energy substrate in some <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>region...</b>|$|R
40|$|The tridecapeptide neurotensin {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to increase glutamate levels in <b>discrete</b> rat <b>brain</b> <b>regions,</b> leading to the hypothesis of a possible involvement of the peptide in neurodegenerative pathologies. The present article reviews morphological and biochemical findings {{about the role of}} neurotensin in modulating glutamate excitotoxicity in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons and rat mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Since the enhancement of glutamate signal is responsible, at least in part, for the neurodegeneration of the dopaminergic neurons and cortical neurons occurring during chronic neurodegenerative disorders, the observed neurotensin-induced-increase of glutamate levels in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex in pathological conditions should result in an amplification of the excitotoxic effects of glutamate. The possible existence of a reciprocal interaction between neurotensin and NMDA receptor mediated signals, through the activation of protein kinase C favouring the depolarization and the entry of calcium, strengthens the idea that neurotensin is involved in the amplification of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, since the NMDA receptors are especially important for the toxic actions of glutamate. The antagonistic effect exerted by SR 48692 on the neurotensin-amplificated glutamate excitotoxicity could suggest the use of selective neurotensin receptor antagonists in combination with conventional drug treatments as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative pathologie...|$|R
40|$|The tridecapeptide neurotensin {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to increase glutamate release in <b>discrete</b> rat <b>brain</b> <b>regions,</b> leading to the hypothesis of a possible involvement of the peptide in neurodegenerative pathologies. The role of neurotensin in modulating glutamate excitotoxicity and the possible neuroprotective action of the neurotensin receptor antagonist SR 48692 were investigated in primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons by measuring [(3) H]dopamine uptake and tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry 24 hr after glutamate treatment. The exposure to glutamate (30 and 100 microM, 10 min) decreased [(3) H]dopamine uptake into mesencephalic neurons. Neurotensin (10 and 100 nM), added before glutamate (30 microM) exposure, significantly enhanced the glutamate-induced reduction of [(3) H]dopamine uptake. In addition, the peptide (10 nM) also significantly enhanced the effect of 100 microM glutamate. The effects of neurotensin were counteracted by the neurotensin receptor antagonist SR 48692 (100 nM) and by the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C. The exposure to 100 microM, but not 30 microM, glutamate significantly {{reduced the number of}} tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells, and neurotensin (10 nM) significantly enhanced this effect.

Methods: We examine the functional connectivity signatures of <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> that show overt alterations in metabolism, as measured by semiquantitative 2 -deoxyglucose autoradiography, in an animal model (subchronic phencyclidine [PCP] treatment), which shows cognitive inflexibility with relevance to the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia. Results: We identify the specific components of functional connectivity that contribute to the rescue of this cognitive inflexibility and to the restoration of overt cerebral metabolism by modafinil. We demonstrate that modafinil reversed both the PCP-induced deficit in the ability to switch attentional set and the PCP-induced hypometabolism in the prefrontal (anterior prelimbic) and retrosplenial cortices. Furthermore, modafinil selectively enhanced metabolism in the medial prelimbic cortex. The functional connectivity signatures of these regions identified a unifying functional subsystem underlying the influence of modafinil on cerebral metabolism and cognitive flexibility that included the nucleus accumbens core and locus coeruleus. In addition, these functional connectivity signatures identified coupling events specific to each brain region, which relate to known anatomical connectivity. Conclusions: These data support clinical evidence that modafinil may alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and also demonstrate the benefit of applying PLSR modeling to characterize functional brain networks in translational models relevant to central nervous system dysfunctio...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Although {{considerable}} {{experimental evidence}} suggests that endogenous adenosine may function as a modulator of neuronal activity in the etiology or control of seizures, the neuroanatomical and neurochemical basis for the anticonvulsant actions of adenosine have not been well established. A <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> of possible fundamental importance to epileptogenisis within the rat prepiriform cortex (PC) has been described (Piredda and Gale, 1985). The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine whether adenosine analogs exert anticonvulsant effects by an action at the seizure focus - a site within the PC, - elicited by a chemoconvulsant, bicuculline; and to pharmacologically characterize the adenosine receptor mediating the seizure suppressant effects in the rat prepiriform cortex. Unilateral focal microinjection of 118 pmol bicuculline methiodide (BMI) into the PC elicited bilateral motor seizures and these seizures were potently inhibited by prior injection of the adenosine receptor agonist, 2 -chloroadenosine (2 -C 1 A). In addition, this anticonvulsant action of 2 -C 1 A at a dose of 41. 4 pmol was completely prevented when co-administered with the specific adenosine receptor antagonist 8 -(p-sulfophenyl) theophylline (8 -pSPT). These results not only indicate that the PC is one potential site of adenosine modulation of seizure susceptibility, but also demonstrate that an activation of adenosine receptor is operative in the observed suppression of the behavioral seizures. Furthermore various adenosine analogs, N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), (-) N⁶-(Rphenylisopropyl) adenosine (R-PIA), (+) N⁶-(S-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (S-PIA), N⁶-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) and N⁶-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) were applied to the PC and produced a dose-dependent reduction in the severity of seizures evoked by BMI. The most potent analog tested was NECA with an ED₅₀ value as low as 4. 0 ± 3. 0 picomoles. Other adenosine analogs were also potent antiepileptic agents and had ED₅₀ values which ranged from 7. 76 to 207. 8 picomoles. The rank order potency was NECA ≥ CHA > CPA > R-PIA > 2 -C 1 A » S-PIA. R-PIA was found to be 10. 2 times more potent than its S-diastereoisomer as an antiepileptic in the PC. Finally, the selective A₂ adenosine receptor agonist, 2 -phenylaminoadenosine (CV- 1808), was devoid of seizure suppressant activity when focally injected in the PC in a dose as high as 334. 8 picomole. This rank order potency, degree of stereoselectivity for R-PIA vs S-PIA and lack of anticonvulsant effect of CV- 1808 suggest that activation of A₁ adenosine receptors is the basis for protection afforded by focal injections of these analogs against seizures induced by bicuculline from a site within the rat prepiriform cortex...|$|R

40|$|The {{brain is}} {{organized}} into functionally specific networks as characterized by intrinsic functional relationships within <b>discrete</b> sets of <b>brain</b> <b>regions.</b> However, it is poorly understood whether such functional networks are dynamically organized according to specific task-states. The anterior insular cortex (aIC) -dorsal {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (dACC) /medial frontal cortex (mFC) network has been proposed to {{play a central role}} in human cognitive abilities. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed at testing whether functional interactions of the aIC-dACC/mFC network in terms of temporally correlated patterns of neural activity across <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> are dynamically modulated by transitory, ongoing task demands. For this purpose, functional interactions of the aIC-dACC/mFC network are compared during two distinguishable fluid reasoning tasks, Visualization and Induction. The results show an increased functional coupling of bilateral aIC with visual cortices in the occipital lobe during the Visualization task, whereas coupling of mFC with right anterior frontal cortex was enhanced during the Induction task. These task-specific modulations of functional interactions likely reflect ability related neural processing. Furthermore, functional connectivity strength between right aIC and right dACC/mFC reliably predicts general task performance. The findings suggest that the analysis of long-range functional interactions may provide complementary information about brain-behavior relationships. On the basis of our results, it is proposed that the aIC-dACC/mFC network contributes to the integration of task-common and task-specific information based on its within-network as well as its between-network dynamic functional interactions...|$|R
40|$|Some upper {{brainstem}} cholinergic neurons (pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei) {{are involved}} in the generation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and project rostrally to the thalamus and caudally to the medulla oblongata. A previous report showed that 96 h of REM sleep deprivation in rats induced an increase in the activity of brainstem acetylcholinesterase (Achase), the enzyme which inactivates acetylcholine (Ach) in the synaptic cleft. There was no change in the enzyme's activity in the whole brain and cerebrum. The components of the cholinergic synaptic endings (for example, Achase) are not uniformly distributed throughout the <b>discrete</b> <b>regions</b> of the <b>brain.</b> In order to detect possible regional changes we measured Achase activity in several <b>discrete</b> rat <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> (medulla oblongata, pons, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex) after 96 h of REM sleep deprivation. Naive adult male Wistar rats were deprived of REM sleep using the flower-pot technique, while control rats were left in their home cages. Total, membrane-bound and soluble Achase activities (nmol of thiocholine formed min- 1 mg protein- 1) were assayed photometrically. The results (mean ± SD) obtained showed a statistically significant (Student t-test) increase in total Achase activity in the pons (control: 147. 8 ± 12. 8, REM sleep-deprived: 169. 3 ± 17. 4, N = 6 for both groups, P< 0. 025) and thalamus (control: 167. 4 ± 29. 0, REM sleep-deprived: 191. 9 ± 15. 4, N = 6 for both groups, P< 0. 05). Increases in membrane-bound Achase activity in the pons (control: 171. 0 ± 14. 7, REM sleep-deprived: 189. 5 ± 19. 5, N = 6 for both groups, P< 0. 05) and soluble enzyme activity in the medulla oblongata (control: 147. 6 ± 16. 3, REM sleep-deprived: 163. 8 ± 8. 3, N = 6 for both groups, P< 0. 05) were also observed. There were no statistically significant differences in the enzyme's activity in the other <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> assayed. The present findings show that the increase in Achase activity induced by REM sleep deprivation was specific to the pons, a <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> where cholinergic neurons involved in REM generation are located, and also to <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> which receive cholinergic input from the pons (the thalamus and medulla oblongata). During REM sleep extracellular levels of Ach are higher in the pons, medulla oblongata and thalamus. The increase in Achase activity in these brain areas after REM sleep deprivation suggests a higher rate of Ach turnover.

40|$|Kindling {{refers to}} a {{procedure}} in which repeated electrical stimulation of a <b>discrete</b> <b>brain</b> <b>region</b> is used to evoke seizures that progress in their severity with successive stimulations. This process results in enduring changes in brain function that are manifest in an enhanced susceptibility to seizure-evoking stimuli and alterations {{in at least some}} types of behavior. In my dissertation, I investigated the relation between brain changes associated with epileptogenesis induced by kindling and spatial cognition in rats. This topic is of interest for both its clinical relevance to memory dysfunction observed in patients with epilepsy and the insights it may provide into the mechanisms underlying learning and memory function. My approach was twofold. First, I examined the effects of kindling {{on a wide variety of}} behavioral tasks in order to characterize the nature of the effects of kindling on spatial cognition. Second, because kindling produces a collage of brain changes, some of which, at least, vary in relation to the site of the electrode used for kindling, the severity of the seizures elicited, and the interval since the last kindling stimulation, I investigated the relation between these kindling-related variables and behavioral task performance. In a series of studies, I investigated the effects of (i) kindling in the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), perirhinal cortex (PRH), or amygdala (AM), (ii) kindling until partially or fully generalized seizures were elicited, and (iii) testing at intervals from one to 28 days following kindling on tasks that assessed sensorimotor functions, motivation, anxiety, object-related cognition, and spatial cognition in rats. I found that kindling was capable of producing highly selective and enduring behavioral effects, which varied depending upon the site being kindled and the severity of the seizures elicited. These included: (i) a selective disruption of spatial learning, which was produced by kindling in the dHPC but not in the PRH or AM and by kindling of fully generalized but not partially generalized seizures, (ii) a partially selective impairment of object-related mnemonic functions, which was produced by kindling in the PRH but not the AM or dHPC, and (iii) an anxiogenic effect, which was produced by kindling in the PRH or AM but not the dHPC. Based on these findings, I generated a specific hypothesis regarding the underlying mechanisms of the effects of kindling on spatial mnemonic function as follows. Epileptogenesis disrupts spatial learning through metaplastic effects that alter hippocampal mechanisms regulating induction of experience-dependent plasticity. Consistent with this hypothesis, kindling has been shown to produce enduring changes in factors that might be expected to alter plasticity including NMDA receptor function, PKC activity, and CA++ channel density. Importantly, available evidence suggests that these effects show a relation to the site and extent of kindling that is consistent with the conditions under which the deficit is observed. This hypothesis makes a variety of novel, testable predictions and, if verified, would provide evidence in support of the proposed role of synaptic plasticity in experience-dependent behavioral change. It would also offer a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at treating epilepsy-associated mnemonic dysfunction...|$|R

To delineate further the organization of the central CRH network, we generated mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) {{under the control of the}} CRH promoter, using bacterial artificial chromosome technology. Here we validate CRH-GFP transgene expression within specific brain regions and confirm the distribution of central GFP-producing cells to faithfully recapitulate that of CRH-expressing cells.

Median raphe lesions reduced activities in the hippocampus, septal area, frontal cortex, and, to a lesser extent, in the hypothalamus. These data {{are consistent with the}} suggestion that the dorsal and median raphe nuclei are the origins of two separate ascending serotonergic systems - one innervating striatal structures and the other mesolimbic structures, predominantly.

40|$|The brain {{constituents}} β-phenylethylamine (PEA) and tryptamine {{enhance the}} impulse propagation mediated transmitter release (exocytosis) from the catecholaminergic and serotoninergic neurons {{in the brain}} (‘catecholaminergic/serotoninergic activity enhancer, CAE/SAE, effect'). (−) Deprenyl (Selegiline) and (−) 1 -phenyl- 2 -propylaminopentane [(−) PPAP] are amphetamine derived CAE substances devoid of the catecholamine releasing property. By changing the aromatic ring in PPAP we developed highly potent and selective CAE/SAE substances, structurally unrelated to the amphetamines. Out of 65 newly synthetized compounds, a tryptamine derived structure, (−) 1 -(benzofuran- 2 -yl) - 2 -propylaminopentane [(−) BPAP] was selected as a potential follower of (−) deprenyl in the clinic and as a reference compound for further analysis of the CAE/SAE mechanism in the mammalian brain. (−) BPAP significantly enhanced in 0. 18 [*]μmol[*] 1 − 1 concentration the impulse propagation mediated release of [3 H]-noradrenaline and [3 H]-dopamine and in 36 [*]nmol[*] 1 − 1 concentration the release of [3 H]-serotonin from the isolated brain stem of rats.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the organisation of the human ventral occipital temporal pathway, part of the brain involved in the recognition of objects and processing of scenes. The architecture of this system has been extensively investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which reveals the engagement of parts of the brain in different tasks. Conventional analyses have been used to identify <b>discrete,</b> circumscribed <b>brain</b> <b>regions</b> which appear to be specialised for processing particular categories of stimuli, such as faces or landscapes. In characterising the function of these regions, an important factor in previous research has been to establish {{whether or not they are}} invariant to more basic sensory properties such as size or 3 D orientation, which change as places and objects are encountered from different points of view. A more recent suggestion is that the ventral occipital temporal pathway, rather than being comprised of discrete regions, is better conceived of as a continuous topographical map, or multiple overlapping maps. Within this framework, fundamental computational requirements, such as the need to establish different forms of invariance, may provide overarching organising principles governing the spatial arrangement of processing within ventral visual cortex. This more nuanced view of the functional architecture of the visual system demands a more nuanced view of invariance. Through a series of experiments using fMRI in conjunction with a parametric adaptation paradigm, this thesis investigates the invariance of neural representations as a continuous variable that can be explicitly quantified rather than an all-or-none phenomenon. This novel approach reveals structure and symmetry normally hidden in conventional analyses. Invariance is found to vary by degree throughout the ventral surface of the brain depending on the nature of the stimulus and the types of processing required. Different forms of invariance can be dissociated from one another in terms of distinct spatial patterns of parametric adaptation that different forms of visual change generate...|$|R
