60|$|It {{was well}} they were forewarned, {{and that they}} were constitutionally obedient. A few minutes later, and they were all swept up high on the beach in a {{wilderness}} of foam. The return of that wilderness was like the rushing of a millrace. Sand, stones, sticks, and seaweed went back with it in dire confusion. Prone on their knees, with fingers and toes fixed, and <b>heads</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> brothers and sister met the rush. It was almost too much for them. A moment more, and strength as well as breath would have failed; but the danger passed, and Dominick sprang to his feet.|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Pike {{ordered the}} wheel hard up, he slacked {{off all the}} mizzen- yards, and {{followed}} it with a partial slacking of the main-yards, so that the after-pressures were eased. The foresail and fore-lower- and-upper- topsails remained flat {{in order to pay}} the head off before the wind. All this took time. The men were slow, not strong, and without snap. They reminded me of dull oxen by the way they moved and pulled. And the gale, ever snorting harder, now snorted diabolically. Only at intervals could I glimpse the group on top the for'ard-house. Again and again, leaning to it and holding their <b>heads</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> men on the 'midship-house were obliterated by the drive of crested seas that burst against the rail, spouted to the lower-yards, and swept in horizontal volumes across to leeward. And Mr. Pike, like an enormous spider in a wind-tossed web, went back and forth along the slender bridge that was itself a shaken thread in the blast of the storm.|$|E
