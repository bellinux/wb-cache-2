25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any individual I know to help me by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E

25|$|Furman {{may have}} been the most {{successful}} coach in the history of chess, although some would give that title to Mark Dvoretsky. Chess culture has traditionally and typically credited the player for chess success, with the coach recognized in a much lesser fashion, or not at all. Chess coaches were not commonly seen for top players until the post-World War II period, when competition became much stiffer. They were first developed in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries; {{it is no coincidence that}} top players from these nations have dominated chess for the past sixty years. Furman, with a very significant role in Karpov's development from his late teens, building upon earlier roles with World Champion Botvinnik and world-class players such as Bronstein, Korchnoi, and Geller, may have <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other coach, from the early 1950s until the late 1970s, to help ensure Soviet dominance.|$|E
25|$|The {{supporters}} of Caesar argued that Caesar deserved {{an extension of}} his command so that the fruit of his success would not be lost. There was a debate on this. Pompey showed goodwill towards Caesar. He claimed that he had letters from Caesar {{in which he said}} he wanted to be relieved of his command, but he said that he thought that he should be allowed to stand for the consulship in absentia. Cato opposed this and said that if Caesar wanted this he had to lay down his arms and become a private citizen. Pompey did not contest Cato's view. This gave rise to suspicions about his real feelings towards Caesar. Plutarch wrote that Pompey also asked Caesar for the troops he had lent him back, using the Parthian war as a pretext. Although Caesar knew why Pompey asked this he sent the troops back home with generous gifts. Appian wrote that Caesar gave these soldiers a donation and also sent one of his legions to Rome. Pompey was drifting toward the optimates and away from Caesar. According to Plutarch the rift between Pompey and Cato became accentuated when Pompey fell seriously ill in Naples in 50 BC. When he recovered the people of Naples offered thanksgiving sacrifices. This celebration spread throughout Italy. He was feted in towns he travelled to on his way back to Rome. Plutarch wrote that this was said ‘to have <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything else to bring about the subsequent civil war’. It made Pompey arrogant, incautious and contemptuous of Caesar’s power. The following year the two men were fighting each other in the Great Roman Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Few, {{even in the}} Labour Party, gave Robinson {{much chance}} of winning the presidency, not least because of an {{internal}} party row over her nomination. With the Labour Party the first name for a possible candidate was an elderly former minister for Health, and hero to the left, Noel Browne. Browne was a household name for having <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anybody else in Ireland for tackling Tuberculosis in the 1950s. However Browne's relationship with the Labour Party had been stormy. He was critical of its ties with Fine Gael and had co-founded the short lived Socialist Labour Party in 1977 after leaving the Labour Party. Although he was supported by left wing members within Labour such as Michael D. Higgins, he {{had little or no}} contact with Dick Spring and therefore had to live in hope of being nominated without the endorsement of the party leadership. The possibility that Browne might be nominated raised the possibility of an internal argument within the party. The fact that Browne was enthusiastic for candidacy, in a contest where Labour never before contested, now acted as pressure for Labour to find a candidate. Spring did not feel that he could control Browne {{for the duration of the}} election, given Browne's history of defying party policy to such a degree that Browne had to leave several political parties. In these circumstances the decision to propose Robinson proved to be politically inspired. Robinson had an advantage in being the first candidate nominated for the election (and the first female), in that she could cover more meetings, public addresses and interviews. However she refused to be drawn on specifics in case she would alienate possible support. Robinson also received the backing of the Irish Times newspaper, and this proved hugely advantageous.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers such as Justin Chang and Mark Kermode {{emphasized}} Scorsese's {{collaboration with}} his production crew {{and with his}} actors as contributing to the film's quality. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang called the film an [...] "anguished masterwork" [...] for Scorsese stating: [...] "Working with such sterling past collaborators as editor Thelma Schoonmaker, production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Scorsese has <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> resurrect a vision of feudal Japan... Silencefeels less like a feat of adaptation than an act of artistic submission". Mark Kermode writing for The Guardian indicated exemplary performances by the range of Japanese supporting actors in the cast stating: [...] "The real stars however, are the Japanese cast, from Yōsuke Kubozuka’s enigmatic wretch, Kichijiro... to Yoshi Oida’s devout elder Ichizo, to whose village these priests bring both salvation and suffering. As a smiling, silver-tongued interpreter, Tadanobu Asano is a superb foil to the inquisitor, Inoue, played with fly-swatting menace by a wheedling Issey Ogata".|$|E

Frequent floods had reduced its income, and in 1429 the church and other abbey buildings were described as being [...] "ruinous".

In 1522 there were reports of disputes between the abbot and the prior. The abbot was accused of [...] "wasting the house's resources, nepotism, relations with women" [...] and other matters, while the prior admitted to [...] "fornication and lapses in the observation of the Rule". The prior threatened the abbot with a knife, but then left the abbey. The physical state of the buildings continued to deteriorate.|$|E
500|$|Historians who penned {{biographies of}} Stevens {{in the late}} 1930s sought {{to move away from}} this perspective, seeking to {{rehabilitate}} him and his political career. [...] Thomas F. Woodley wrote of Stevens in 1937, and while his work shows admiration of Stevens, he attributed Stevens's driving force to bitterness over his clubfoot. [...] Alphonse Miller, in his 1939 biography, found that the former congressman was motivated by a desire for justice. [...] Both men were convinced that recent books had not treated him fairly. [...] Richard Current's 1942 work reflected current Beardian historiography, which saw all American history, including Reconstruction, as a three-way economic struggle between the industrialists of the Northeast (represented by Stevens), the planters of the South, and the farmers of the Midwest. Current argued that Stevens was motivated in his Reconstruction policies by frustrated ambitions and a desire to use his political position to promote industrial capitalism and advance the Republican Party. He concluded that despite Stevens's egalitarian beliefs, he actually promoted inequality, for [...] "none had <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he to bring on the age of Big Business, with its concentration of wealth." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she would {{no longer be able to}} negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this [...] "unbelievable, wondrous news has <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything to make me feel so much better".

[...] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was [...] "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{himself had}} to ditch {{into the sea}} on 10April, {{when he was shot}} down after being {{surprised}} by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger. Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as [...] "a mere scratch". On 27April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: [...] "Tomorrow I'm going to show you how". According to journalist Osmar White, who saw him {{on the night of the}} 27th, Jackson's [...] "hands and eyes were still and rock steady" [...] but he appeared [...] "weary in soul" [...] and [...] "too long in the shadows". White concluded: [...] "He had <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> conquer fear—he had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore. His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.|$|E
