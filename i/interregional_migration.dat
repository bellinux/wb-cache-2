40|$|The paper {{surveys the}} recent {{theoretical}} and empirical literature on the economic determinants of <b>interregional</b> labor <b>migration.</b> In the first part, theoretical approaches are outlined, in the second part, results of several empirical investigations are surveyed. The authors conclude that regional wage differences do, indeed, induce <b>interregional</b> labor <b>migration,</b> as theoretical approaches suggest. However, the impact of wages on migration seems to be limited. More important are regional differences in employment opportunities. Regions with comparatively low unemployment rates, resp. high employment probabilities, tend to exhibit net in-migration, whereas regions with higher unemployment rates tend to exhibit net out-migration. Other important factors influencing migration decisions are - {{at least at the}} microeconomic level - the migrant's age and qualification. At the macro level, however, these determinants often are insignificant. The same holds for several region-specific determinants such as urbanization, climate, or social benefits...|$|R

40|$|The article {{explores the}} problem of <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> flows modelling. As a rule, the {{existing}} models of <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> flows use the aggregated data and do not {{take into consideration the}} fact that a decision to relocate is formed and taken at the micro-level, at the level of households. The purpose of the present research is to develop the forecasting method for <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> flows of the region taking into consideration the behaviour of households at the micro-level. The research tests the hypothesis that the modelling of household behaviours at the local level as regards taking a decision to relocate to other regions, which takes into account the existing interactions with relatives and other communities, allows to obtain adequate forecasts of <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> flows. To forecast the <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> flows of the region, we develop a methodological approach and software solution, based on cellular automaton model modification proposed in the current work and on econometric models of birth and death processes, which have been tested on the Primorsky Krai data. The authors’ model of the cellular automaton is a kind of the combined probabilistic cellular automaton in which the condition of each cell changes depending on a condition of four closest neighbours (von Neumann vicinity) and four cells chosen in a random way.

40|$|Local {{labor markets}} are most {{flexible}} and aggregate natural unemployment is reduced {{when there is}} sufficient <b>interregional</b> economic <b>migration</b> to ensure that workers are reallocated from declining to expanding regions. Local European labor markets have generally been viewed as not as flexible as those in North America, leading to greater fluctuations in local wages, labor force participation and unemployment rates, and smaller changes in local employment as economic shocks are primarily experienced by the local area's original residents. France is an interesting case. French gross migration rates—though perhaps relatively low—are higher today than a generation ago. Using a host of novel identification approaches and French employment zone data {{dating back to the}} early 1980 s, we investigate whether these changes correspond to economic migration that would increase labor market flexibility. Our results detect surprising amounts of economic migration in that most new jobs are eventually taken by new migrants or outside commuters. We then reconcile these somewhat surprising findings with the still relatively low contemporary French <b>interregional</b> gross <b>migration</b> rates, concluding that other structural impediments besides relative local labor market inflexibility are behind relatively poor labor market performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> in Sweden during the last three decades and to discuss the effects that changes on the labour market and in household structures have had on migration patterns. The empirical data consists of all interregional migrants in Sweden from 1970 to 2001. The results indicate that the pattern of labour market-related migration has changed as more migrants today migrate at an age prior to having become established on the labour market. The increase in <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> is to a large extent an effect of increased student migration. The study further shows that changed household structures have also had an impact on migration patterns during the studied period. <b>Interregional</b> <b>migration</b> among families has become rarer as dual income households have become the norm.

30|$|Although {{the first}} two {{hypotheses}} assume a general high willingness among unemployed persons to accept job offers, one can expect a lower willingness with regard to interregional jobs. Anticipated moving costs {{are more likely to}} prevent unemployed individuals from accepting job offers. Although migration might be associated with higher relative income gains, it poses a higher risk for unemployed persons because periods of unemployment increase the risk of becoming unemployed again in the future (Arulampalam et al. 2001; Ludwig-Mayerhofer 2008 a: 214). This could be the case because employers have less information to evaluate the productivity of unemployed applicants, with detrimental effects {{on the quality of the}} match (Grassinger 1993). Awareness of this fact increases the risk of failure in the new job for unemployed persons and influences their assessment of the stability of the job on offer. This lower perceived job stability can be assumed to result in a comparatively lower propensity to accept interregional job offers. That is, it is likely that the actual costs of <b>interregional</b> <b>migrations</b> are assessed differentially by employed and unemployed individuals. The latter are more concerned with risk factors, such as the general employment options at the new location and the difficulty of finding new accommodations.|$|R

Such a representation allows an analyst to compare the spatial structures of different migration regimes and contrast their changes over time. It also facilitates the indirect estimation of migration flows, in the absence of such data, by allowing the analyst to impose a particular age or spatial structure when observed flow data are inadequate, partial, or completely nonexistent. In this paper, we focus on the level and allocation aspects (or the generation and distribution components) of age-specific <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> flows. We find that over time these flows exhibit strong regularities that can be captured by generalized linear models, which can then be used in situations where data are inadequate or missing to indirectly estimate <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> patterns.

It finds that the regional system eventually eliminates disequilibrium unemployment differentials and adjusts to an equilibrium where a region's relative wage compensates for its unemployment differential at the rate 3 : 1 (i. e., 3 percent higher wage for a percentage point higher unemployment). Adjustment is very slow, so regional policy might save several person-years of unemployment by offering incentives for the faster movement of people and jobs.

In this paper we exploit the panel structure of a dataset on <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> among nineteen MSAs in the US from 1993 to 2001 to estimate a modified dynamic gravity model of migration. In particular, using both semi-parametric and GMM estimators (taking into account possible endogeneity of the explanatory variables), we find robust evidence of a non-linear relation between migration and wage differentials. With a wage differential smaller than a certain threshold, people rarely move controlling for the other socioeconomic variables. Only beyond the threshold, the <b>interregional</b> <b>migration</b> grows rapidly proving an important role of the option value of waiting in migration decision process. ...|$|E

Specifically, we argue that in the presence of an environmental externality, <b>interregional</b> labour <b>migration</b> depends not only on wages but also on amenities. People may leave a region offering higher wages, if the resulting utility loss from worsened amenities exceeds the gain in wages.

A 10 % {{up of the}} nominal wage is attributed to the productivity increase in production activities while a 4 % down of the real wage is a compensation for the net agglomeration economies, which are the benefits from product variety minus the costs of congestion. That is, city bigness not only enhances productivity of firms, but also brings net agglomeration economies to households. In this way, we separated the net agglomeration economies in production side from those in consumption side. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the paper are to examine the determinants of <b>interregional</b> labour <b>migration</b> for German regions using the data on gross flows of labour movements across regions. This {{is one of the}} few studies where data on labour migration is used. There also was a wage convergence after reunification between regions of East and West Germany and this to a certain extent provides an explanation for non-linear relationship between wage differences among regions and migration. As the study distinguishes the blue-collar and white-collar wage difference between regions, different relationships between migration and blue and white-collar workers' wage differences can be assessed. We also test the hypothesis whether highly skilled workers migrate to the regions where inequality is greater while less skilled workers tend to migrate to the regions where inequality is low. ...|$|R
