5|$|<b>Gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> {{is a kind}} of hip hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality, and a dangerous criminal image. Though the origins of <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. <b>Gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century.|$|E

Though the origins of <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> {{can be traced back to}} the mid-1980s raps of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style is usually said to have begun in the Los Angeles and Oakland area, where Too Short, NWA and others found their fame. This West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were the breakthrough rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, {{the group}} had the problem of having spent more money on {{production}} than was covered by returns. The group decided that its <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> style was the cause: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, {{making it difficult for}} Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Referring to local rapper Esham's horrorcore style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap.</b> The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E

5|$|The Chronic {{peaked at}} number {{three on the}} Billboard 200 and had been {{certified}} triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with sales of 5.7 million copies in the United States, which led to Dr. Dre {{becoming one of the}} top ten best-selling American performing artists of 1993. Dr. Dre's production has been noted for popularizing the G-funk subgenre within <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap.</b> The Chronic has been widely {{regarded as one of the}} most important and influential albums of the 1990s and regarded by many fans and peers to be one of the most well-produced hip hop albums of all time. The Chronic was ranked at #138 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, {{largely due to}} the mainstream success of hip-hop artists such as Kanye West. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation in the first week alone. Industry observers remark that West's victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip-hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists.|$|E
5|$|The PTC {{also has}} an Advisory Board {{consisting}} of politicians and entertainers working to assist the council in their goal of protecting children against profanity and violence in the media.

Bahçeşehir University associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC advisory board members as not consistent with their stance on morality.|$|E
5000|$|Research of {{rap music}} also {{suggests}} that it may contain positive images. Zillman et al. proposed that rap music {{is used as a}} way to fight oppression from the dominant culture. It was also found by Kubrin that 68 percent of all <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap's</b> focal point is about respect. It is a [...] "cultural response to historic oppression and racism, and a system for communication among black communities throughout the United States." [...] With both gleeful and aggressive views on the situation of black Americans, Hip Hop artists were spread reality and lessons learned {{in a way that is}} understandable by a younger generation. Some call it a [...] "street-leveling language".|$|R
5000|$|However, Paul Massari of The Boston Globe {{criticized the}} album, writing [...] "311 tries to {{demonstrate}} {{that it is still}} relevant in the era of the loud, angry rap-metal band. The death-rock power chords on tracks like [...] "Full Ride" [...] are plodding, and the tone of the <b>gangsta</b> <b>raps</b> is absurdly inflated." [...] Kathryn McGuire of Rolling Stone adds, [...] "311 slings melodramatic metal riffs and whiny verses every which way, and their once-novel fusion seems unfocused and flat." [...] Kristen Koba, founder of Popmatters.com wrote, [...] "The whiny white boy rap, almost funky bass lines, and grinding guitar riffs just couldn’t hold up in a city that offers so much innovative hip-hop and truly vital rock." ...|$|R
5000|$|From the start, Snoop {{was known}} for his <b>gangsta</b> <b>raps,</b> G-funk beats, and {{reckless}} lifestyle. His popularity started back when {{he was a member of}} Death Row Records, where he released his debut album Doggystyle. The album sold more copies than any debut album ever had, making “Snoop Doggy Dogg” a well-known name. [...] Though he was famous for being “gangsta,” Snoop had shown that he wanted peace as well; especially after he just missed a conviction for murder in 1996 which helped him further himself even more from all the conflict happening in the industry around that time. More recently, his peaceful and nonviolent state of mind became more evident, as he decided to begin participating the Rastafari faith, give himself a new name, and take on a new style of music.|$|R
5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} cornerstone of contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.|$|E

500|$|The album {{launched}} {{the careers of}} West Coast hip hop artists, including Snoop Doggy Dogg, Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and Warren G, Dr. Dre's stepbrother – all of whom pursued successful commercial careers. The Chronic {{is widely regarded as}} the album that re-defined West Coast hip hop, demonstrated <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap's</b> commercial potential as a multi-platinum commodity, and established G-funk as the most popular sound in hip hop music for several years after its release, with Dr. Dre producing major albums that drew heavily on his production style. The album's success established Death Row Records as a dominant force in 1990s hip hop. It has been re-released 3 times, first as a remastered CD, then as a remastered DualDisc with enhanced stereo and four videos, and in 2009 as [...] "The Chronic Re-Lit" [...] with a bonus DVD containing a 30-minute interview and 7 unreleased tracks.

5000|$|Lyrically, [...] "Hands to Myself" [...] express {{sexual desire}} and wish to find love through {{good and bad}} situations. Sam Wolfson of Vice {{magazine}} opines that at first the lyrics suggest a typical song about sexual desire, but a [...] "darker undercurrent" [...] then becomes apparent; [...] "there's two narratives at play - a surface and a more hostile truth", he explained. According to Wolfson, the [...] "all of the downs and the uppers" [...] lyric implies a relationship affected by drugs and mental health, further manifested in the line, [...] "The doctors say you're no good". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic writes that the lyric [...] "you're metaphorical gin-and-juice" [...] "rebukes the idea that Millennials like the 23-year-old Gomez don't get the meaning of 'literal'; is a redundant description given that it's unlikely she'd be singing to an actual cocktail; and is further proof of Long Beach <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap's</b> grand influence". [...] "Hands to Myself" [...] is written in the key of E major with a tempo of 111 beats per minute. The song follows a chord progression of EGmCmB, and Gomez' vocals span from B3 to C#5.|$|R
5000|$|Rap-A-Lot Records is a Houston hip hop {{record label}} {{that was created}} in 1986. Sublabels include Smoke-a-Lot Records.

25|$|Also in 2005, the new subgenre of geeksta rap (named for <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap)</b> emerged, largely {{independently}} of more traditional nerdcore.

This braggadocio led to the first nerdcore feud, between MC Plus+ and Monzy.|$|E
5000|$|Filipino rap is heterogeneous, {{encompassing}} rap {{in numerous}} languages such as Tagalog, Chavacano, and Ilocano, {{as well as}} English.

25|$|Like other media, such as {{rock music}} (notably heavy metal music and <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap),</b> video games {{have been the}} subject of objections, controversies and censorship, for {{instance}} because of depictions of violence, criminal activities, sexual themes, alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, propaganda, profanity or advertisements. Critics of video games include parents' groups, politicians, religious groups, scientists and other advocacy groups.

5000|$|Compared to the lyrical themes on the duo's {{previous}} albums, {{this album}} features {{an even greater}} focus on hardcore <b>gangsta</b> and mafioso <b>rap</b> lyrics.

Most of the songs feature vivid stories of some sort, many of them related to organized crime (especially the singles [...] "On the Run" [...] and [...] "Ill Street Blues") and violent street crime ("Train Robbery", [...] "Two to the Head"). There are also sex raps ("Operation CB", [...] "Fuck U Man"), horrorcore stories ("Straight Jacket", [...] "Edge of Sanity"), and even some socio-political commentary similar to Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions ("Crime Pays").

25|$|G-funk is {{a fusion}} genre of music which {{combines}} <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> and funk. It {{is generally considered}} to have been invented by west coast rappers and made famous by Dr. Dre. It incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and the Bomb Squad), G-funk often used fewer, unaltered samples per song.|$|E
25|$|After finding solo success, Dr. Dre began {{crafting}} Snoop Dogg's {{debut album}} Doggystyle; the process took two years. Snoop's debut {{was released in}} 1993 due to public demand and high pressure from retailers. Though unfinished, it outperformed The Chronic at Quadruple Platinum, and garnered similarly glowing reviews. Soon {{after the release of}} the album, Snoop Dogg was charged with murder, fueling the debate that politicians C.

25|$|Compton {{has been}} {{referred}} to on numerous occasions in gang affiliation, <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> and g-funk songs, especially in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, and so has attained an association not only with gang violence and crime, but with hip hop music as well. The city is known as the home of many famous rappers.

25|$|As the hip hop {{community}} worldwide {{received the}} album {{with a high}} note, the members of N.W.A became the top stars for the emerging new era of <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> while popularizing the lyrics of Ice Cube and MC Ren. The album also helped to spawn many young MCs and gangsta hip hop groups from areas such as Compton, California, and South Central Los Angeles, as many thought {{they had the same}} story to tell and the ability to pursue the career track that N.W.A had taken, hence groups such as Compton's Most Wanted coming into being.|$|E
25|$|Straight Outta Compton is {{the debut}} studio album by American hip hop group N.W.A, {{released}} August 8, 1988 on group member Eazy-E's record label Ruthless Records.

The album has been viewed as the pioneering record of <b>gangsta</b> <b>rap</b> with its ever-present profanity and violent lyrics. This was the group's only release with rapper Ice Cube prior to his 1989 departure.
