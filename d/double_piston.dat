5|$|Flamethrower, <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> and gunpowder-activated: Although {{the single}} piston {{flamethrower}} was first {{developed in the}} Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> syringes (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) spouting Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E

50|$|The M4+2 engine {{took its}} name from a {{combination}} of the two working modes of the known engines, that is from the Two-stroke engine and Four-stroke engine. The two-stroke combustion engine is characterized by a simple construction and system of air load change as well as bigger index of power output. Unfortunately, its filling ratio is worse than in four-stroke engine. The ecological index of two-stroke engine is also unfavorable. The system of valves of the four-stroke engine is its disadvantage. The cylinders of both modules of <b>double</b> <b>pistons</b> engine have been joined along one axis with common cylinder head - in the form of the ring. The pistons are moved with different speed and with appropriate stage displacement. There are two crankshafts, which are connected with special transmission in shown solution. The four-stroke crankshaft is rotated with twice a speed of two-stroke crankshaft. The engine is named <b>double</b> <b>pistons</b> because of its construction - <b>double</b> <b>pistons</b> and crankshafts. In the M4+2 the advantages of both engines being connected are obvious; the pistons of the engine working in one combustion cylinder are set oppositely to each other, but in different modes. Although the projects of connecting two stroke modes in one cylinder were tried already a long time ago in the Opposed piston engine, the combination of the two different cycles had never been tried before. It turned out that the engine is not only able to work, but that the effects are very promising. The engine has a far greater efficiency over the break-even value known to combustion engines (ca 35%) and closer to the one associated with steam turbines or electric engines (ca 70%).|$|R
50|$|The {{strain of}} side loading can be {{directly}} reduced {{with the use of}} internal stop tubes which reduce the maximum extension length, leaving some distance between the piston and bore seal, and increasing leverage to resist warping of the seals. <b>Double</b> <b>pistons</b> also spread out the forces of side loading while also reducing stroke length. Alternately, external sliding guides and hinges can support the load and reduce side loading forces applied directly on the cylinder.|$|R

5000|$|The trunk {{engine was}} largely {{replaced}} by the double piston-rod engine. [...] This was a return connecting rod engine, with the crankshaft between the crosshead and cylinder. Four piston rods were used to pass around the crankshaft, both above and below, and also to {{each side of the}} crank, as the crank throw was wider than the vertical spacing of the piston rods. As most of these engines were parallel compounds, two piston rods would be taken from each of the HP and LP pistons. In some engines, double rods were used from the large LP cylinder and a single rod from the HP cylinder, with a yoke to pass around the crankshaft. <b>Double</b> <b>piston</b> rods could also be used from a simple engine, but these required an overhung gudgeon pin on the crosshead, so tended to be limited to smaller engines. An advantage of the <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> rod engine over the trunk was that both ends of the connecting rod were accessible for maintenance. One factor learned from naval use of horizontal cylinders was that, despite previous fears, there was little additional wear owing to the piston's weight resting on the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Because {{variety of}} tone colour was {{considered}} paramount, the double horn, though easier {{to play and}} more secure, was not adopted by the Viennese orchestras. The Vienna horn is, in essence, the natural horn of the Viennese classical era with <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> valves added by the instrument maker Leopold Uhlmann (1806-1878). The trumpet, instead of having the almost universal Perinet piston valves , is the old German model with rotary valves, while the F tuba is its own instrument type. The trombone in Viennese orchestras is the usual type, although here, too, the preference is for the tonal quality of a narrower bore.|$|E
50|$|František Janeček {{started the}} company after working {{several years in}} the {{armament}} industry. Although he didn't have any experience with motorcycles, he was familiar with production techniques. Janeček chose between the Austrian <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> two-stroke motor of Puch, the Berlin two-stroke of Schliha, and the new Wanderer 500 cc. Janeček chose the Wanderer. Because {{of the collapse of}} the German motor industry, Wanderer had already decided to stop the production. This is because they didn't think it would be profitable to directly compete with BMW. The first model was introduced on October 23, 1929. This was a 500 cc 4-cycle engine with 12 kW of power (18 hp) and fuel consumption of 6 liters per 100 km. Although priced highly, through the first years (and several constructional fixes) this motorcycle was successful and was considered reliable.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986, {{he moved}} to Berlin to more fully realise his ongoing project, The Relative Violin, which is the {{development}} of a total artform based around the one instrument. This prompted innovation in the fields of new instrument design (over 20 deconstructed violin instruments including the legendary <b>Double</b> <b>Piston</b> Triple-neck Wheeling Violin), in environmental performance (such as bowing fences in the Australian outback), in new instrumental techniques (tested sometimes in uninterrupted marathon concerts of up to twelve hours), and in both analogue (built into the violins themselves) and interactive electronics. His alternative, personal, and revised history for the violin used the mediums of radio (over 30 major international productions for radio stations like ABC, BBC, WDR, SR, BR, Radio France, RAI, ORF, and SFB), live-performance film (In the 1980s, he integrated Super 8 into his worldwide performances.), video, and television (ZDF).|$|E
5000|$|Honda {{has focused}} on ride quality, responsiveness, and ride comfort with a {{completely}} redesigned front suspension. A simpler MacPherson strut design, replaces the class leading and highly refined double wishbone front suspension, in use since the second generation Accord. The rear suspension retains the independent multi-link suspension. The costlier design is now available only on the top-tier Acura RLX. The new front suspension helps shave weight and free up room in the engine compartment. In addition to the safety concerns of Honda's Advanced Compatibility Engineering, there is focus on body stiffness and dynamic handling response by improving structural rigidity around the front strut tower and lower control arm. All but the LX trim feature a strut bar. All trims receive upgraded shocks front and rear. The Touring trim now comes with more sophisticated <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> shocks called [...] "Amplitude Reactive Dampers" [...] that have been recently introduced on several Acura models. These are typically found in European luxury cars.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the trend of the engine performance according to the Gul & Co - Motor development using cycloid crank-connecting rod instead of the conventional crankshaft. Since the Gul & Co motor aims at the <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> engine with stroke reduction, a preliminary investigation of the Gul & Co concept, including the piston stroke effect on the engine performance is needed. Furthermore, the investigation of the general performance of a <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> engine with diameter reduction would give a helpful additional infoffi 1 ation. In order to further evaluate the Gul & Co concept, a preparatory approximation of the engine design by using the cycloid crank-connecting rod instead of conventional crankshaft is needed, and the engine performance comparison should be performed. The method used was the simulation of the engine performance by using non dimensional Filling-Emptying model. In its basic form, this model requires the rate of combustion as an input to the calculation. However, such model allows general engine design changes to be investigated with moderate computational requirements. The cycle simulation is designed to predict details of the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid and general engine performance over a broad range of operating and design conditions, including valve timing, spark ignition timing, engine cooling conditions et...|$|E
50|$|The {{idea was}} {{developed}} at the Silesian University of Technology, Poland, {{under the leadership of}} dr Adam Ciesiołkiewicz. It was granted a patent nr 195052 by the Polish Patent Office. The work with the new combustion engine has been done by IZOLING P.W. Company in cooperation with Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice. There are consultations with researchers from Technical University of Kraków, too. So far two working engine models have been made. The preliminary model is based on two existing engines (two-stroke motorbike engine and four-stroke small machine engine). This model confirms the rightness of two- and four-stroke engines connection. The second model is the functional model. It realizes the elaborated engine work conception.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new design of {{experimental}} <b>double</b> <b>piston</b> filament stretching apparatus that can stretch fluids to very high extensional strain rates. Using high speed photography, filament deformation and breakup profiles of a strategically selected range of fluids including low and higher viscosity Newtonian liquids {{together with a}} viscoelastic polymer solution, biological and yield stress fluids were tested {{for the first time}} at extensional strain rates in excess of 1000 s− 1. The stretching rate was sufficiently high that observation of low viscosity Newtonian fluid stretching, end pinching and break was observed during the stretching period of the deformation, whereas for a higher Newtonian viscosity, filament thinning and breakup occurred after the cessation of piston movement. Different fluid rheologies resulted in very different thinning and breakup profiles and the kinetics, in particular of yield stress fluids showed a striking contrast to Newtonians or viscoelastic fluids. Surprisingly all the tested fluids had an initial sub millisecond “wine glass” profile of deformation which could be approximately captured using a simple parabolic mass balance equation. Subsequent deformation profiles were however very sensitive to the rheology of the test fluid and where the final breakup occurred before or after piston cessation. In certain cases the thinning and break up was successfully matched with a 1 D numerical simulation demonstrating the way numerical modelling can be used with the fluids correct rheological characterization to gain physical insight into how rheologically complex fluids deform and breakup at very high extensional deformation rates...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{analytic}} {{linear model}} of hydraulic cylinder usually comes from assumptions of identical action piston areas {{on both sides}} of hydraulic cylinder (<b>double</b> <b>piston</b> rod) and suitable operation point, which is usually chosen in the middle of piston. By reason of that volumes inside of cylinder are than same. Moreover for control of that arrangement of hydraulic cylinder, usually controlled by 4 / 3 servovalve, the same mount of flows comes in and comes out to each of chambers of hydraulic cylinder. Presented paper deal with development of extended form of analytic linear model of single piston rod hydraulic cylinder which respects different action piston areas and volumes inside of chambers of hydraulic cylinder and also two different input flows of hydraulic cylinder. In extended model are also considered possibilities of different dead volumes in hoses and intake parts of hydraulic cylinder. Dead volume has impact on damping of hydraulic cylinder. Because the system of hydraulic cylinder is generally presented as a integrative system with inertia of second order: eq, we can than obtain time constants and damping of hydraulic cylinder for each of analytic form model. The model has arisen for needs of model fractionation on two parts. Part of behaviour of chamber A and part of behaviour of chamber B of cylinder. It was created for the reason of analysis and synthesis of control parameters of regulation circuit of multivalve control concept of hydraulic drive with separately controlled chamber A and B which could be then used for...|$|E

40|$|Cumulative {{effect of}} {{transmitted}} vibrations to the tractor driver not only leads to driver health problems, but also reduces the driver working efficiency. Tractor suspension system {{is one of}} the methods which is employed to lower the level of transmitted vibrations to the driver. In this study the design and performance assessment of a semi-active suspension model of tractor cabin was considered. Tractor full vibration model was developed first, and subsequently a semi-active ON-OFF damper model was designed. The examination of the model indicated that <b>doubling</b> the <b>piston</b> area and the volume of hydraulic accumulator air chamber, led to 39 % increase and 31 % reduction of the resonance frequency of transmitted vibrations to the driver, respectively. On the other hand <b>doubling</b> the <b>piston</b> area and the primary air pressure of the accumulator, affected the RMS of transmitted vibration to the driver by 77 cm s- 2 reduction and 66 cm s- 2 increase, respectively. Moreover, the numerical comparison of the model outputs with and without activation of semi-active cabin suspension, while the model was stimulated with the same input function, led to 43 % improvement in RMS acceleration of the transmitted vibrations to the tractor seat. Therefore, the designed semi-active suspension model of cabin was able to attenuate the level of transmitted vibrations to the tractor driver...|$|R
