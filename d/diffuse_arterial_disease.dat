Methods: Demographic features, category and clinical grade, Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II classification lesion type, pre- and postprocedure ankle–brachial indices, and primary patency were compared between group 1 (EIAS without distal revascularization) and group 2 (EIAS with concomitant distal revascularization). Results: No mortality and a 100 % immediate technical success rate was recorded in group 1 (n = 12) and group 2 (n = 24). Eleven patients (30. 6 %) also had stenting of the adjacent common iliac artery. Two thirds of group 2 patients required concomitant femoral or distal revascularization.

40|$|Copyright © 2009 Royal Australasian College of PhysiciansBACKGROUND: Magnetic {{resonance}} angiography (MRA) of renal vessels correlates {{well with}} conventional angiography (CA) and enables non-invasive assessment of renal vessels without nephrotoxic contrast. AIMS: We aimed {{to identify the}} referral source {{and nature of the}} patient group undergoing renal MRA, and the impact of this test on their management. METHODS: All renal MRA scans performed at the Royal Adelaide Hospital from 1 November 1997 to 31 December 2000 were reviewed (n = 121). Clinical data were obtained by case-note review or from treating physicians. MRA scans were with gadolinium enhancement, using a Siemens Vision 1. 5 Tesla machine (Siemens, New York), with Visual Basic 33 software and 3 D reconstruction. RESULTS: Nephrologists ordered the majority of renal MRA studies (64. 5 %). Indications for MRA included: (i). hypertension (91. 3 %), (ii). abnormal renal function (78. 3 %), (iii). other imaging suggesting renovascular disease (64. 3 %) and (iv) renal impairment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (18. 3 %). Eighty-seven MRA studies revealed renovascular abnormalities ('positive'). Over 50 % of patients had three or more risk factors associated with vascular disease, with MRA positive in 76 %. Localized renal artery stenosis was identified in 65 cases. In 40 of these, CA and further intervention was not undertaken, mainly due to presence of features of irreversible renal damage, low-grade stenosis or stable clinical parameters. CA was performed in 25 patients, all of whom had moderate- to high-grade (> 60 %) -stenosis on MRA. Revascularization was attempted in 21 of the 25 patients, with technical success in 17. In 22 patients, MRA identified non-localized abnormalities, most commonly <b>diffuse</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> None went on to angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Selective use of renal MRA in high-risk patients (identified by vascular risk factors or with standard renal imaging) can assist in avoidance of invasive, potentially nephrotoxic conventional angiography in up to 80 % of cases. Those with lesions warranting treatment can then be selected for further intervention. S. Prasad, K. Bannister and J. Taylo...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To test how the {{presence}} of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> predicted mortality of middle-aged and elderly residents of Metlika county, a rural area in southeastern Slovenia. Methods: In 1987, we interviewed and examined a representative cohort of 646 subjects aged 45 - 80 years at inclusion without overt coronary or cerebrovascular disease, for cardiovascular risk factors and measured the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI). Peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> was defined as ABPI< 0. 90. The subjects were followed up 15 years or until death. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were assessed and compared between subjects with and without peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in a multivariate model. Results: There were 580 subjects with normal ABPI and 66 subjects with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> among which 49 were asymptomatic and 17 had intermittent claudication. Because subjects with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> were on average 10 years older than those without peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> {{the mere presence of}} peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> was not an independent predictor of mortality. However, there was a significant interaction of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> with age, with a more pronounced adverse prognostic effect of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in younger than in older age groups. For a 55 -year-old subject with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> the hazard ratio of dying from any cause in the follow-up period was 2. 44 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 15 - 4. 96) in comparison to an age-matched subject without peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> but at 75 years of age, the hazard ratio decreased to only 0. 71 (95 % CI, 0. 46 - 1. 09). For cardiovascular mortality, the hazard ratio in {{the presence}} of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> was 6. 05 (95 % CI, 1. 87 - 16. 27) at 55 years and 0. 92 (95 % CI, 0. 54 - 1. 52) at 75 years. Among patients with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> each decrement of ABPI at inclusion by 0. 10 significantly increased the cardiovascular mortality after 15 years by 30 % (P[*]=[*] 0. 038).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{whether there is an}} association between serum ischemia-modified albumin and the risk factor profile in type 2 diabetic patients with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> and to identify the risk markers for peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> METHODS: Participants included 290 patients (35. 2 % women) with type 2 diabetes. The ankle-brachial pressure index was measured using a standard protocol, and peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> was defined as an ankle-brachial index 1. 3. The basal ischemia-modified albumin levels and clinical parameters were measured and analyzed. The risk factors for peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> were examined by multiple logistic analyses. RESULTS: Age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, urine albumin, homocysteine, and ischemia-modified albumin were significantly higher in patients with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> than in disease-free patients (p< 0. 05), while ankle-brachial index was lower in the former group (p< 0. 05). Ischemia-modified albumin was positively associated with HbA 1 c and homocysteine levels (r = 0. 220, p = 0. 030; r = 0. 446, p = 0. 044, respectively), while no correlation was found with ankle-brachial index. Multiple logistic analyses indicated that HbA 1 c, systolic blood pressure, homocysteine and ischemia-modified albumin were independent risk factors for peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in the diabetic subjects.

40|$|Background: Peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a chronic}} illness, and {{patients}} with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> should receive advice about lifestyle changes and medical therapies to reduce further atherosclerotic complications. Previous {{research has indicated}} that patients with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> lack information about their disease and secondary prevention measures. The aim was to elucidate how patients with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> communicate their knowledge about their illness and treatments. Methods: During 2009, seven focus group interviews were conducted with twenty-one patients (50 – 81 years old) with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> and were analysed using content analysis. Results: When respondents with PAD communicate their knowledge about the illness and its treatments they “Navigate through uncertainty, believes and facts about PAD, displaying an active or passive information-seeking behaviour”. After discharge, they felt a feeling of relief at first, which was later exchanged into uncertainty from their restricted knowledge about the illness and how to behave following revascularisation. For example, during the discussions about risk factors, smoking was noted as a major risk factor, that triggered feelings of guilt. Thus, the respondents needed to consult other sources of information to manage their everyday lives.

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{frequent}} in type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}} patients due to accelerated atherosclerosis. Plasma osteoprotegerin (OPG) has evolved as a biomarker for CVD. We {{examined the relationship between}} plasma OPG levels and different CVD manifestations in {{type 2 diabetes}}. Methods Type 2 diabetes patients without known CVD referred consecutively to a diabetes clinic for the first time (n = 305, aged: 58. 6 ± 11. 3 years, diabetes duration: 4. 5 ± 5. 3 years) were screened for carotid <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> and myocardial ischemia by means of carotid artery ultrasonography, peripheral ankle and toe systolic blood pressure measurements, and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS). In addition, plasma OPG concentrations and other CVD-related markers were measured. Results The prevalence of carotid <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> and myocardial ischemia was 42 %, 15 %, and 30 %, respectively. Plasma OPG was significantly increased in patients with carotid and peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> compared to patients without (p Conclusions Increased plasma OPG concentration is associated with carotid and peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas no relation is observed with respect to myocardial ischemia on MPS. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Trial registration number at [URL] : NCT 00298844 </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> and elevated levels of C-reactive protein in the Japanese-Brazilian population of high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study derived from a population-based study on the prevalence of diabetes and associated diseases in the Japanese-Brazilian population. One thousand, three hundred and thirty individuals aged e" 30 underwent clinical and laboratory examination, including measurement of ultrasensitive C-reactive protein. The diagnosis of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> was performed by calculating the ankle-brachial index. We considered with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> patients who had ankle-brachial index d" 0. 9. After applying the exclusion criteria, 1, 038 subjects completed the study. RESULTS: The {{mean age of the}} population was 56. 8 years; 46 % were male. The prevalence of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> was 21 %, with no difference between genders. Data analysis showed no association between peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein. Patients with ankle-brachial index d" 0. 70 showed higher values of ultrasensitive C-reactive protein and worse cardiometabolic profile. We found a positive independent association of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> with hypertension and smoking. CONCLUSION: The association between low levels of ankle-brachial index and elevated levels of ultrasensitive C-reactive protein may suggest a relationship of gravity, aiding in the mapping of high-risk patients...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivePatients with aneurysmal and {{occlusive}} <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> have overlapping cardiovascular risk profiles. The {{question remains}} how atherosclerosis {{is related to}} the formation of aortic aneurysms. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is an easily accessible and objective marker of early atherosclerosis. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether there is a difference in atherosclerotic burden as measured by CIMT between patients with aneurysmal and those with occlusive <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> MethodsFrom 2004 to 2011, the CIMT was measured using B-mode ultrasound scanning in patients undergoing vascular surgery for aortic aneurysmal or occlusive <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> at the Erasmus University Medical Center. Cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and medication were recorded. Patients treated for combined aneurysmal and occlusive <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> and patients diagnosed with a genetic aneurysm syndrome were excluded. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to calculate differences in CIMT between aneurysmal and occlusive <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> ResultsIn total, 904 patients were included in the study: 502 patients with aneurysmal disease (85 % male; mean age, 72 years) and 402 patients with occlusive <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> (65 % male; mean age, 64 years). The mean (standard deviation) CIMT in patients with aneurysmal disease was 0. 97 (0. 29) mm and was 1. 07 (0. 38) mm in patients with occlusive <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> (P <. 001). Adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and medication showed a mean difference in CIMT of 0. 15 mm (95 % confidence interval, 0. 10 - 0. 20; P <. 001). ConclusionsThe current study shows a lower CIMT in patients with aneurysmal disease than in those with occlusive <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> indicating a lower atherosclerotic burden in patients with aneurysmal disease. These findings endorse the idea that additional pathogenic mechanisms are involved in aortic aneurysm formation. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of atherosclerosis in aortic aneurysm formation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: If a {{validated}} questionnaire, {{when applied}} to patients reporting with symptoms of intermittent claudication, could adequately discriminate between those with and without peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> GPs could avoid the diagnostic measurement of the ankle brachial index. AIM: To investigate the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire (ECQ) in general practice {{and to develop a}} clinical decision rule based on risk factors to enable GPs to easily assess the likelihood of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> DESIGN OF STUDY: An observational study. SETTING: General practice in The Netherlands. METHOD: This observational study included patients of > or = 55 years visiting their GP for symptoms suggestive of intermittent claudication or with one risk factor. The ECQ and the ankle brachial index were performed. The prevalence of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease,</b> defined as an ankle brachial index < 0. 9, was related to risk factors using logistic regression analyses, on which a clinical decision rule was developed and related to the presence of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> RESULTS: Of the 4790 included patients visiting their GP with symptoms suggestive of intermittent claudication, 4527 were eligible for analyses. The prevalence of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in this group was 48. 3 %. The sensitivity of the ECQ was only 56. 2 %. The prevalence of peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in a clinical decision rule that included age, male sex, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a positive ECQ, increased from 14 % in the lowest to 76 % in the highest category. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the ECQ alone has an inadequate diagnostic value in detecting patients with peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> The ankle brachial index should be performed to diagnose peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in patients with complaints suggestive of intermittent claudication, although our clinical decision rule could help to differentiate between extremely high and lower prevalence of peripheral arterial diseas...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of carotid and lower extremity <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> was assessed {{in a healthy}} population of 56 elderly adults with isolated systolic hypertension. Duplex scans were performed {{to determine the extent}} of carotid disease, and postexercise ratios of ankle to arm systolic blood pressure were mea-sured to assess lower extremity <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> Internal carotid stenosis was found in 38 % (21 of 56) of subjects and lower extremity <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in 42 % (23 of 55). The strongest predictor of internal carotid stenosis was lower extremity <b>arterial</b> <b>disease.</b> Independent risk factors for lower extremity <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> were smoking, internal carotid stenosis, and age. A measure of extent of carotid plaque was found to correlate with age, carotid stenosis, male sex, history of smoking, and total cholesterol. The high {{prevalence of}} peripheral vascular disease in this population may be related to their age and blood pressure. The high correlation between carotid stenosis and lower extremity <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> suggests that persons with peripheral vascular disease should be assessed and treated for atherosclerotic disease in general. (Stroke 1987; 18 : 817 - 822) Much of the epidemiology of carotid and lowerextremity <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> (LEAD) is un-known, largely due to a lack of available data regarding asymptomatic disease. Although nonin-vasive diagnostic techniques have been used in study-ing clinical populations, most studies of the general population have been confined to establishing the inci-dence and prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms. Although asymptomatic disease is not always of clini-cal interest, it is vital in describing the natural history of a disease and in relating the disease to its risk fac-tors. With the development and improvement of non-invasive vascular diagnostic techniques, the assess-ment of minimal to moderate disease is now possible. This study is among the few to use noninvasive testing to evaluate the prevalence of <b>arterial</b> <b>disease</b> in a healthy population...|$|R
