5|$|The watercolourist Moses Harris (1731–1785), {{known for}} his The Aurelian or natural history of English insects (1766), {{published}} in 1780, the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the banded <b>demoiselle,</b> Calopteryx splendens. He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species (Aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated), though his rough drawing of a larva (at lower left) with the mask extended appears to be plagiarised.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), <b>demoiselle</b> crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Clerget {{designed}} {{a range of}} Clément-Bayard aircraft engines including a 7-cylinder supercharged radial, the 4-cyl 40hp used on the <b>Demoiselle,</b> a 4-cyl 100hp used on 'Hanriot Etrich' monoplanes, and a V8 200hp airship engine.|$|E

25|$|Alberto Santos-Dumont was {{the first}} to offer for free {{construction}} plans, publishing drawings of its <b>Demoiselle</b> in the June 1910 edition of Popular Mechanics. The first aircraft to be offered for sale as plans, rather than a completed airframe, was the Baby Ace in the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|A {{period of}} service in the English Channel with Admiral George Rodney's {{squadron}} followed in 1759. On 28 March Boreas captured the <b>Demoiselle,</b> which was coming from San Domingo. Later, Boreas {{took part in the}} bombardment of Le Havre on 3 July that year. At some point Boreas also recaptured the Hazards Bounty.|$|E
25|$|The flying replicas were {{specifically}} {{chosen to}} be different enough that an ordinary audience member could distinguish them. They were all types reputed to have flown well, in or about 1910. In most cases this worked well, {{but there were a}} few surprises, adding to an accurate historical reassessment of the aircraft concerned. For example, in its early form, the replica of the Santos-Dumont <b>Demoiselle,</b> a forerunner of today's ultralight aircraft, was unable to leave the ground except in short hops. Extending the wingspan and fitting a more powerful Ardem 50hp engine produced only marginal improvement. When Doug Bianchi and the Personal Planes production staff who constructed the replica consulted with Allen Wheeler, he recalled that the Demoiselle's designer and first pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont was a very short, slightly built man. A suitably small pilot, Joan Hughes, a wartime member of the Air Transport Auxiliary who was the Airways Flying Club chief instructor, was hired. With the reduced payload, the diminutive <b>Demoiselle</b> flew very well, and Hughes proved a consummate stunt flyer, able to undertake exacting manoeuvres.|$|E

25|$|Farmland {{with very}} little {{disturbance}} acts as an important bird habitat in the Najafgarh lake basin, even fields lying fallow are used by hundreds of congregating <b>demoiselle</b> cranes and common cranes, pairs of Sarus cranes {{can be seen in}} the adjoining farmland along the Najafgarh drain. Other resident wild bird and animals also inhabit these farmlands including hares, nilgai, wildcat, common fox, jackal, monitor lizards, various varieties of snakes etc. which also come for shelter into the forested embankments of the drain and disperse into the neighbouring farmland for foraging.|$|E
25|$|The present Headmaster, Dr Christopher Barnett, is the twenty-sixth in the School's history. There are {{approximately}} 650 {{boys in the}} Lower School and 650 boys in the Upper School. Haling Park retains the appearance of an attractive country estate with a large copse, many fine specimen trees, Prevost's Squirrels, maras, peafowl (peacocks), crowned and <b>demoiselle</b> cranes, flamingos and other exotic birds. The Founder's Garden, Water Gardens and Andrew Quadrangle provide reflective spaces as well as venues for plays, concerts and celebrations. The Whitgift Rose, created to mark the 400th Anniversary of the School, is widely planted throughout the grounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{company also}} {{started working with}} Alberto Santos-Dumont in 1908 to build his <b>Demoiselle</b> No 19 {{monoplane}} that he had designed {{to compete for the}} Coupe d'Aviation Ernest Archdeacon prize from the Aéro-Club de France. The plane was small and stable, but they planned a production run of 100 units, built 50 and sold only 15 for 7,500 francs for each airframe. It was the world's first series production aircraft. By 1909 it was offered with a choice of 3 engines, Clément-Bayard 20hp; Wright 4-cyl 30hp (Clément-Bayard had the license to manufacture Wright engines); and Clément-Bayard 40hp designed by Pierre Clerget. It achieved 120km/h.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species of the}} river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The {{disappeared}} species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, Podiceps, great reed warbler and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of <b>demoiselle</b> cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese.|$|E

500|$|Part of the moor {{has been}} {{designated}} as a nature reserve, covering , which is managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. In addition to open water and reedbeds, it contains a fragment of acid mire, the largest to have survived in the south west of England. The reserve [...] provides habitat for many varieties of birds, which includes millions of starlings between November and January, along with osprey and bittern. Otters and Banded <b>demoiselle</b> are among other species which have made their home on the moor. A large bird hide, reached via a raised boardwalk, has been erected. Westhay Moor is also notified {{as part of the}} Somerset Levels and Moors Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive and as a Ramsar Site, and a National Nature Reserve.|$|E
