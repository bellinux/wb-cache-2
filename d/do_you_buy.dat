60|$|The known person least unlike Mr. Courthope's late 'maker' was 'Mussel-mou'd Charlie Leslie,' 'an old Aberdeenshire minstrel, {{the very}} last, probably, of the race,' says Scott. Charlie died in 1782. He sang, and sold PRINTED ballads. 'Why cannot you sing other songs than those rebellious ones?' asked a Hanoverian Provost of Aberdeen. 'Oh ay, but--THEY WINNA BUY THEM!' said Charlie. 'Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> them?' 'Why, faur I get them cheapest.' He carried his ballads in 'a large harden bag, hung over his shoulder.' Charlie had tholed prison for Prince Charles, {{and had seen}} Provost Morison drink the Prince's health in wine and {{proclaim}} him Regent at the Cross of Aberdeen. If Charlie (who lived to be a hundred and two) composed the song, 'Mussel-mou'd Charlie ' ('this sang Charlie made hissel''), then this maker could never have produced 'The Queen's Marie,' nor could any maker like him. His ballads were printed, as any successful ballad of 1719 would probably have been, in broadsides.* Against Mr. Child and Mr. Courthope, then, we argue that, after 1600, a marked decadence of the old ballad style set in- -that the old style (as far as is known) died soon after Bothwell Brig (1679), in the execrable ballads of both sides, such as 'Philiphaugh,' and that it soon was not only dead as a form in practical use, but was entirely superseded by new kinds of popular poetry, of which many examples survive, and are familiar to every student. How, or why, then, should a poet, aiming at popularity, about 1719-1730, compose 'The Queen's Marie' in an obsolete manner? The old ballads were still sung, indeed; but we ask for proof that new ballads were still composed in the ancient fashion.|$|E

40|$|Wh {{questions}} with multiple wh elements pose a special problem within the overall analysis of wh-type constructions. In a language like English, which only allows one wh element {{to be in}} the fronted discourse-prominent position, any additional wh element occupies an “in situ ” position; i. e. the position of the clause-internal grammatical function. 1 As noted at least since Kuno and Robinson (1972), the choice of which wh element is fronted is not free. They cite examples such as the following: (1) a. Who did what? b. Who went where? c. What happened to whom? d. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> give to whom? (2) a. *What did who do? b. *Where did who go? c. *To whom did what happen? d. *To whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> give what? / *Who <b>did</b> <b>you</b> give what to? A similar effect obtains in (a subset of) languages which front multiple wh elements, as seen in the following examples from Bulgarian (Bošković 2002 : 354). (3) a. Koj kogo običa? who whom loves ‘Who loves whom?’ b. *Kogo koj običa? whom who loves Expressing the constraint in movement terms, Kuno and Robinson state that a wh element cannot cross over another wh element. Stated this way, the constraint seems rather arbitrary. It becomes even more arbitrary when compared with cases such as the following: (4) a. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> where? b. When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> when...|$|R

In between screenings of video portraits, Israel created three additional interviews with surprise guests Laird Hamilton, Molly Ringwald and Melanie Griffith, {{in front of the}} live audience. Israel’s introduction to each interview is comically well rehearsed and he refuses to acknowledge the interviewee’s responses or ask follow-up questions, no matter how deep or thought-provoking the answers are. Instead, he works through a set of pre-made questions that he has written on flashcards. The questions range from “Are you more sympathetic to vampires or werewolves?” to “What kind of milk <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> at the grocery store?” Avoiding topics directly related to work, Israel's questions are meant to reveal his subjects' personal affects and characteristics. His repetitive performance allows him, as monotone interlocutor, to disappear, and enables the viewer to focus fully on the subject. In this way, Israel considers each episode to be a portrait, its goal, in the traditional sense of portraiture, to capture each subject's likeness.|$|E

40|$|What {{gives you}} the urge to splurge? Facing your {{spending}} habits can be uncomfortable, {{but it may be}} the only way to get control of your spending and debt. Are you always trying to pay off yesterday’s purchases? How will you acquire the things you truly need and want for tomorrow? Need or want? Do you know the difference between purchases made for wants vs. needs? A good way to separate wants from needs is to imagine that your income has been cut by one-third. Decide what you would give up and what you absolutely need to survive. This may be difficult. Many wants have become necessities in our culture. Spending too much on wants can leave you short on money for things you really need. Habits Good spending habits can be useful. But bad spending habits can work against you. Most grocery store shoppers make twothirds of their shopping decisions after they enter the store. Impulse buying or unplanned purchases can wreck your spending plan. Values and goals Values are beliefs that are important to you. Examples are health, comfort, honesty, safety, security, status and independence. Values and goals influence your spending. For instance, imagine two different consumers with the same clothing budget. One may buy less expensive clothes that allow her to have more items in her closet and shop more frequently. The “designer label ” is most important to the other consumer. She pays more for each item but makes fewer purchases. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what you buy? Beware of advertisements that appeal to emotions. Aim to make smart buying decisions that meet your personal needs. Available resources All consumers have a limited amount of money to spend. The amount you have depends on your income. This varies from person to person. Learn to live within your income. This is the key to financial freedom and worry-free living. Other factors Advertisements, credit offers, sales and store displays may tempt you. An emotional crisis can trigger a spending spree. Beware of factors that can stir the urge to splurge. How do I take control? Become aware of things that influence your spending. It may take time to master selfcontrol. A good way to start is to pick one spending habit that you want to change and work on that. Become a better money manager by changing one habit at a time.

In Zimbabwe, Busani Bafana investigates how {{restaurants}} use {{herbs and spices}} in their cooking to enhance the flavour in the food. Busani spoke to John Daines, owner of the Art Groove restaurant in Bulawayo, to find out more. As he discovers, if no spices and herbs {{are available in the}} market ? there are no alternatives. Nothing can replace the flavour or the colour that particular herbs and spices have. So, for smallscale farmers who produce them, there is a niche market. The secret is finding out more about it. If you are a smallscale farmer producing herbs and spices for the local market, listen in for a tour around the Art Grove restaurant to spice up your market ? and hear some good tips about what restaurants near you might be after. IN:	?We use both herbs and? OUT:	?fine or a coarse granule. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Busani Bafana speaking to John Daines at the Art Groove restaurant in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. If you are a smallscale farmer producing herbs and spices for local sale, find out what restaurants near you might want. You could see your market improve. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Daines	We use both herbs and spices as ingredients for a lot of our meals to enhance the flavour of our dishes and when we purchase these spices and herbs we look at what is available at the market at the time. Bafana	Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> your dried spices and your herbs? Daines	We buy them wherever we can. Sometimes it is in a supermarket, sometimes it is at a wholesale centre in Bulawayo or often than not we get them in from Harare. Bafana	Is this close to your restaurant?Is this, say, down the road or several kilometres away from your restaurant? Daines	Yes, it can be as close as just around the corner. We buy what we can and what is available at the time. Bafana	What standards, then, do you expect from your suppliers of dried spices and herbs? Daines	From a herb point of view when we are looking at the different herbs that are available we look at the colour and obviously a herb is very much of a green colour because everything is a leaf, whether it can be chives, whether it can be rosemary or oregano, we have mint, herbs like that obviously the brighter and the green, the fresher they are. If they are brown and dull and yellow we know that they have been sitting for an age. And from a spice point of view if we look at something like paprika we are looking at the redness, a strong red colour is absolutely important as opposed to a yellow and orange colour. And the same for if we purchase something like chilli, we look at the hot, the hotness, I do not know if that is good English but we want to burn the mouth when we buy that! If it is dull in flavour we know that it is not of good quality. Bafana	How then have you actually maintained these standards that you talked about? Daines	I think we just use sight and smell really when we look at these products. We know what we are looking for when we are buying and we just make sure that that is what we look for otherwise we just leave it. You know it is really important that we get good quality. Bafana	What opportunities are there for smallscale farmers to supply businesses like yours? Daines	One of the most common herbs that we purchase at this moment is something very simple called mixed herbs and it is just a basic mixture of dried herbs like oregano, marjoram, basil and those types of herbs and that is a very common ingredient to enhance the flavour of whether it is a soup or whether it is a gravy or a sauce or your meat and you actually simply cannot find it at the moment and we find ourselves actually purchasing the individual herb and rubbing and mixing them together. Bafana	What kind of spices and herbs <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy?</b> Daines	From the herbs I have already mentioned that there is basil, there is oregano, there is mint, there is chives, there is a whole array of herbs that are being used and on the spices side we have what a natural spice is like your paprika, like turmeric which is a root, like cumin, chilli, Bird?s-eye chilli which is the very small chilli which is really, really hot and then we can also get a blend of spices. Bafana	When these certain types of spices and herbs that you mentioned are not available, are there any alternatives? Daines	No, there are no alternatives, you know they enhance the flavour of your food and if it is not there you just have to go without. Bafana	<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> in bulk or say even for a month supply or a week?s supply? Daines	It can be like that even longer because you do not know when {{you are going to see}} it next. Bafana	How long have you been buying these products yourself? Daines	Well herbs and spices have been around for generations and I do not think there is not one restaurant or even a household that does not use them. Bafana	What of the packaging of the spices and the herbs and could the packaging influence the reason to buy or not to buy? Daines	Obviously the packaging can play an important part but I think we are not interested in the packaging because all it does is enhances the price. Bafana	What is your advice to smallscale farmers who want to start selling dried spices and herbs but have no clue of where to begin? Daines	I think that a little bit of investigating, they will see that there is a market and they just need to do a little bit of homework. Bafana	I have been interviewing John away from the crowd actually of the restaurant but right now we will actually move into behind the scenes where the food is prepared so I can maybe sample some of these spices. SFX	Kitchen Bafana	We are actually behind the scenes in John?s restaurant, where he prepares the meals, and he is about to explain to us about all the spices that he uses. John, go ahead. Daines	This is a product called turmeric and it is a very much yellow spice as you can see and this is actually made from a root and it is purely used for colour and it has no flavour. Bafana	For what meals do you use it with? Daines	Well very much it is used for curries and spiced Indian food. This one is black peppercorns, this is one that is used everywhere, it is the most simplest spice that we get and it is just basically used as a flavouring. It is left on our tables in the restaurant and it is very much used as an ingredient in our kitchen. Bafana	It has a very strong aroma? There is black pepper and white pepper? Daines	Black and white pepper and I know in South Africa you can get red and green as well just to enhance the colour as well. Bafana	You also feel the texture of the spices? Daines	Not really. Bafana	Not really? Daines	No, everything is ground very finely here and that is what we are looking at so that we don?t see any residue in the product that we are making, so it blends into the meal. Bafana	So tell me, do these spices come already prepared, you don?t grind them yourself here? Daines	Very much they come prepared except, obviously, for the peppercorns, which we can grind ourselves to how we want it, whether it?s a fine or a coarse granule.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{previous}} investigations using context matching (e. g., Gussenhoven 1983) and appropriateness rating tasks (Birch and Clifton 1995, Welby 2003) suggest that English-speaking listeners lack expectations regarding how {{the size of}} a focused constituent (broad versus narrow) can be expressed prosodically in certain constructions. In the present study English-speaking listeners were presented with the same SVO sentence (e. g., I bought a motorcycle) presented in either broad or narrow question contexts, and were asked to rate the prominence of the words in those sentences. In general, listeners reported sentence-final objects to be relatively more prominent than preceding verbs in the test sentences when those sentences were presented in narrow-object (What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy?)</b> rather than broad-VP (What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?)</b> or sentence (What happened?) focus contexts. This effect was found to be stronger in Experiment 2, where the answer was a correction. The findings suggest listeners do have expectations about the relationship between {{the size of a}} sentence’s focus constituent and its prosodic realization. It is argued that these expectations are well founded given the listeners’ likely experience with productions of this particular information structural contrast...|$|R
