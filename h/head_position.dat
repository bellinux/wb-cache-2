5|$|Most social foragers must {{search for}} food while also {{avoiding}} predators. It {{has been suggested}} that individuals that play scrounger could also, by virtue of their <b>head</b> <b>position,</b> be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up tactic {{has been shown to be}} associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while hopping does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly-breasted munia.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} ideal patient’s <b>head</b> <b>positioning</b> for the {{anterior}} circulation aneurysms microsurgery. Method: We divided {{the study in}} two parts. Firstly, 10 fresh cadaveric <b>heads</b> were <b>positioned</b> and dissected in order to ideally expose the anterior circulation aneurysm sites. Afterwards, 110 patients were submitted to anterior circulation aneurysms microsurgery. During the surgery, the patient’s <b>head</b> was <b>positioned</b> accordingly to the aneurysm location and {{the results from the}} cadaveric study. The effectiveness of the position was noted. Results: We could determine mainly two patterns for <b>head</b> <b>positioning</b> for the anterior circulation aneurysms. Conclusion: The best surgical exposure is related to specific <b>head</b> <b>positions.</b> The proper angle of microscopic view may minimize neurovascular injury and brain retraction...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>head</b> <b>positions</b> on high frequency tympanometry (HFT) results obtained from neonates. Design: A cross-sectional study to compare HFT results obtained from neonates in two <b>head</b> <b>positions</b> (face sideways and face up). Study sample: One hundred and fifty-seven neonates (80 female, 77 male; mean age 48. 3 ± 26. 7 hours) participated. Results: The mean uncompensated admittance at 200 daPa obtained in the face sideways position was significantly greater than that obtained in the face up position (1. 02 versus 0. 96 mmho). A significant ear effect for baseline compensated admittance was found (right/left 0. 64 / 0. 53 mmho). However, there were no significant main effects for <b>head</b> <b>positions</b> for the tympanometric peak pressure, baseline compensated static admittance, and component compensated static admittance measures, indicating that these measures are resilient to <b>head</b> <b>positions.</b> Conclusion: These findings support the use of HFT normative values regardless of the two <b>head</b> <b>positions</b> investigated in the present study...|$|R

25|$|A head-worn, {{computer}} device with a transparent display {{can be used}} to mitigate the effects of motion sickness (and spatial disorientation) if visual indicators of the wearer’s <b>head</b> <b>position</b> are shown. Such a device functions by providing the wearer with digital reference lines in their field of vision that indicate the horizon’s position relative to the user’s head. This is accomplished by combining readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes mounted in the device (US Patent 5,966,680). This technology has been implemented in both standalone devices and Google Glass. In two NIH-backed studies, greater than 90% of patients experienced a reduction in the symptoms of motion sickness while using this technology.|$|E

25|$|Before a disk can be accessed, {{the drive}} needs to {{synchronize}} its <b>head</b> <b>position</b> with the disk tracks. In some drives, {{this is accomplished}} with a Track Zero Sensor, while for others it involves the drive head striking an immobile reference surface. In either case, the head is moved {{so that it is}} approaching track zero position of the disk. When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero, the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned. For a drive without the sensor, the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero, knowing that once this motion is complete, the head will be positioned over track zero.|$|E

2500|$|Duane {{syndrome}} {{cannot be}} cured, as the [...] "missing" [...] cranial nerve cannot be replaced, and traditionally {{there has been}} no expectation that surgery will result in any increase in the range of eye movement. Surgical intervention, therefore, has only been recommended where the patient is unable to maintain binocularity, where they are experiencing symptoms, or where they are forced to adopt a cosmetically unsightly or uncomfortable head posture in order to maintain binocularity. The aims of surgery are to place the eye in a more central position and, thus, place the field of binocularity more centrally also, and to overcome or reduce the need for the adoption of an abnormal head posture. Occasionally, surgery is not needed during childhood, but becomes appropriate later in life, as <b>head</b> <b>position</b> changes (presumably due to progressive muscle contracture).|$|E
40|$|Background: We lack {{fundamental}} {{knowledge of}} the mechanisms of difficult laryngoscopy despite its clinical significance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how <b>head</b> <b>positioning</b> and direct laryngoscopy alter arrangements of craniofacial structures. Methods: Digital photographs of the lateral view of the head and neck were taken at each step of <b>head</b> <b>positioning</b> and direct laryngoscopy in age- and body mass index-matched patients with (n = 3 D 13) and without (n = 3 D 13) difficult laryngoscopy during general anesthesia with muscle paralysis. The images were used for measurements of various craniofacial dimensions. Results: Both simple neck extension and the sniffing position produced a caudal shift of the mandible and a downward shift of the larynx, resulting in an increase of the submandibular space. Direct laryngoscopy during the sniffing position displaced the mandible and tongue base upward and caudally, and the larynx downward and caudally, increasing the submandibular space and facilitating vertical arrangement of the mandible, tongue base, and larynx to the facial line. These structural arrangements in response to direct laryngoscopy were not observed in patients with difficult laryngoscopy, whereas <b>head</b> <b>positioning</b> produced similar structural arrangements in patients with and without difficult laryngoscopy. Conclusion: Increase in the submandibular space and a vertical arrangement of the mandible, tongue base, and larynx to the facial line seem to be important mechanisms for improving the laryngeal view during <b>head</b> <b>positioning</b> and direct laryngoscopy. Failure of these structural arrangements in response to direct laryngoscopy may result in difficult laryngoscopy...|$|R
