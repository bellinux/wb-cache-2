Any change in the system composition or end-users needs involves re-performing the whole design process.

But the scheduling method of a PNC is out of the scope of IEEE 802. 15. 3 draft standard. This paper proposes a scheduling method which is called Maximum Traffic (MT) scheduling for IEEE 802. 15. 3. MT scheduling guarantees that total transmission data is maximum at any point of time and the needed time slots for transmission is minimum.

A useful routing system should {{have the capability to}} support the driver effectively in deciding on an optimum route to his preference. The objective of this work is to model the driver behavior in the area of route selection. In particular, the research focuses on an optimum route search function in a typical in-car navigation system or dynamic route guidance (DRG) system. In this work, we want to emphasize the need to orientate the route selection method on the driver's preference. Each feasible route has a set of attributes. A fuzzy-neural (FN) approach is used to represent the correlation of the attributes with the driver's route selection. A recommendation or route ranking can be provided to the driver. Based on a training of the FN net on the driver's choice, the route selection function can be made adaptive to the decision making of the driver. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Applications for {{processing}} great volumes of data {{is a very}} widely used kind of software. In enterprise integration there are tasks of data integration. When solving these tasks, special tools supporting development and execution of applications implementing extract, transformation and load pattern are often used. From {{the point of view}} of functional testing, such applications have a specific peculiarity related to a huge number of combinations of input data. Existing approaches and tools solving the problem of test data generation for database application build large arrays of input data based on database scheme or on SQL queries of application under tests. To ensure covering functionality of an application under test using these approaches and tools, a brute force of all available combinations is needed. In the paper, we prpose a method allowing less excessive data generation for covering functionality of database applications. It allows achieving functionality coverage with acceptable amount of test data close to optimal one (one test per <b>one</b> <b>functionality</b> branch) in acceptable generation time.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, {{artificial}} intelligence evolved rapidly by {{the introduction of}} some innovative approaches and theories such as fuzzy logic. Fuzzy systems have filled some important niches in several applications of control, decision, etc. Despite these successes, fuzzy logic has confronted rapidly its limitations by the lack of processing the effect of context. Human is capable to decide adequately fuzzy representations in particular contexts. Nevertheless a fuzzy system, once conceived by an expert, is non-adaptable to conditions that change under the effect of context. This problem has been addressed by several researchers; however, very few have touched it. In this research, it has been first identified the reasons of such an indifference in fuzzy reasoning. By complex implications at the cognitive level, several areas such as linguistics, cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, the theory of knowledge and of memory and memorisation have been studied. These interdisciplinary studies helped to deduce essentials of such a model of contextual effect. Consequently, a cognitive structure named SFC is proposed. This structure contains internal mechanisms simulating human reasoning under contextual dependence. Proposed approach is structuralist by the fact of including internal modules, each <b>one</b> <b>having</b> different <b>functionality</b> and responsibilities. These modules interact hierarchically to process fuzzy information under the effect of context. As of representing knowledge, the approach assumes integrity at the level of information: knowledge to process has to contain, implicitly or explicitly, the information of context. Consequently, the effect of context is itself an information to process and to memorise. Under this viewpoint, knowledge is integrated to its context. The SFC structure is validated by an automatic conduct example of a car. Finally, a simplified structure named SFC-R {{that can be used in}} large-scale fuzzy systems is proposed. This structure is not only useful to reduce dimension in large scale rule bases, but also to integrate, in a very efficient manner, the discreet information in fuzzy rule bases...|$|R

In this context, during the shop floor process execution each MMT {{is viewed as a}} traditional machine with only <b>one</b> <b>functionality.</b> Therefore, this work proposes a novel approach to design the control system of PS considering the allocation of functionalities in real time to improve the efficiency of the PSs processes.
