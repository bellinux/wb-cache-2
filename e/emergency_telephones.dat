The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft, but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power generation.

25|$|Until {{a decade}} or so ago, PV was used {{frequently}} to power calculators and novelty devices. Improvements in integrated circuits and low power liquid crystal displays make it possible to power such devices for several years between battery changes, making PV use less common. In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive. Such applications include solar lamps, water pumps, parking meters, <b>emergency</b> <b>telephones,</b> trash compactors, temporary traffic signs, charging stations, and remote guard posts and signals.|$|E

At the time of opening, the strip lighting in the tunnel was commended as [...] "a big improvement" [...] on the standard provided in the original tunnel. In contrast with the Victorian northbound tunnel, the eastern tunnel had no sharp bends, and <b>emergency</b> <b>telephones</b> were provided. Its distinctive ventilation towers were designed in 1964 by GLC architect Terry Farrell. Immediately after opening, the old tunnel was closed for refurbishment. It re-opened on 4 April 1969 with a new electronic system to detect overheight vehicles.|$|E
