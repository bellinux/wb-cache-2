500|$|The common torpedo, ocellate torpedo, or <b>eyed</b> <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>ray</b> (Torpedo torpedo) is {{a species}} of electric ray in the family Torpedinidae, found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the Bay of Biscay to Angola. It is a benthic fish typically encountered over soft substrates in fairly shallow, coastal waters. Growing to [...] long, this species has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc and a short, thick tail with two dorsal fins of nearly equal size and a large caudal fin. It can be identified by the prominent blue spots on its back, which usually number five but may vary from zero to nine, {{as well as by}} the small knobs on the rims of its spiracles.|$|E
50|$|The Gulf torpedo, marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> or {{variable}} <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Torpedo sinuspersici) is {{a species of}} <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Torpedinidae. It {{is found in the}} Indian Ocean, but may represent a species flock of several local endemic species. It is distinguishable from other Torpedo species in its range by its ornate dorsal coloration.|$|R
50|$|The blackspotted {{numbfish}} (Narcine timlei), {{also known}} as the black-spotted <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Indian <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> largespotted numbfish, and spotted numbfish, is a species of numbfish in the family Narcinidae.|$|R
50|$|The Brazilian <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Narcine brasiliensis) is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Narcinidae. It inhabits reefs along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico from North Carolina to {{northern}} Argentina.|$|R
5000|$|The giant <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> or Cortez <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Narcine entemedor, is {{a species}} of numbfish, family Narcinidae, native to the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California to Panama. It is found in shallow water on sandy bottoms and {{sometimes}} adjacent to reefs. This species {{is closely related to}} the lesser <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Narcine bancroftii) from the western Atlantic, and may represent the same species. The specific epithet entemedor seems to be the Spanish equivalent of [...] "intimidator".|$|R
5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can be severe {{but is not}} directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|R
50|$|The shortlip <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Narcine brevilabiata is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the {{numbfish}} family, Narcinidae. It may be synonymous with the blackspotted numbfish, Narcine maculata. The shortlip <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is found in shallow continental shelf waters offshore of China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, {{at a depth of}} 41 to 70 meters. It is assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as it is caught as by-catch in large numbers by shrimp trawling fisheries operating throughout its range.|$|R
500|$|Relative to {{its small}} size, the onefin <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can deliver an {{extremely}} powerful electric shock {{to defend itself}} against predators, which include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). It propels itself using its muscular tail rather than its pectoral fins. The diet of this species consists mainly of polychaete worms. The reproductive biology of the onefin <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> has not been documented; presumably it is viviparous like other <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b> Males mature sexually at somewhere between [...] long, while females mature at around [...] long.|$|R

50|$|The blind torpedo, Benthobatis marcida, is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> most {{commonly}} found in the west-central area of the Atlantic Ocean. Like all <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> it can produce an electric shock that can be harmful to humans and other fish. It can grow up to 50 cm long.|$|R

500|$|The ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> or {{bullseye}} <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Diplobatis ommata) is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Narcinidae, native to the shallow inshore waters of the eastern central Pacific from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. Reaching [...] in length, this species has a rounded pectoral fin disc and pelvic fins with convex margins. Its short and thick tail bears two dorsal fins and terminates in a triangular caudal fin. The ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is named for the distinctive large eyespot on the middle of its disc, consisting of a black or yellow center surrounded by concentric rings. Its dorsal coloration is otherwise highly variable, ranging from plain to ornately patterned on a light to dark brown background. The front part of its disc is darker brown.|$|R

5000|$|The lesser <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Narcine bancroftii), {{also known}} as the Brazilian <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> small <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> spotted torpedo ray, torpedofish or trembler, is a species of {{numbfish}} in the family Narcinidae found on the western coastal fringes of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It is a small slow-moving fish, living in the surf zone of sandy or muddy beaches. Here it is easily caught as bycatch by shrimp fisheries and seine netters. As a result, its numbers have declined rapidly and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being [...] "critically endangered".|$|R
