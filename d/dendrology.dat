2500|$|The Roving Outdoor Conservation School (ROCS), {{started in}} 2000, is a twenty-one day trek {{program that is}} open to males and females {{between the ages of}} sixteen and twenty-one. ROCS is an {{educational}} backpacking experience rooted in conservation and environmental science education. [...] Throughout the trek participants have lessons rooted in environmental science, visits from guest speakers, and the opportunity to work on conservation projects with the Philmont Conservation Department and the U.S. Forest Service in the Valle Vidal Unit of the Carson National Forest. While on the trail participants learn about ecology, botany, <b>dendrology,</b> geology, hydrology, forestry, soil science, fire ecology, environmental policy, leave no trace principles, environmental ethics, conservation techniques, and wildlife, range, and land management practices. Participants tackle conservation projects ranging from trailbuilding to meadow encroachment to timber stand improvement to erosion control to streambed restoration. [...] Participants are exposed to the land management challenges facing the West, as well as the rest of America. The program focuses on empowering participants so that they may transfer what they learn on the trail to their lives back home.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dendrology</b> (δένδρον, dendron, [...] "tree"; and -λογία, -logia, {{science of}} or study of) or xylology (ξύλον, ksulon, [...] "wood") is {{the science and}} study of wooded plants (trees, shrubs, and lianas), specifically, their taxonomic classifications. There is no sharp {{boundary}} between plant taxonomy and dendrology; however, woody plants not only belong to many different plant families, but these families may {{be made up of}} both woody and non-woody members. Some families include only a few woody species. <b>Dendrology,</b> as a discipline of industrial forestry, tends to focus on identification of economically useful woody plants and their taxonomic interrelationships. As an academic course of study, <b>Dendrology</b> will include all woody plants, native and non-native, that occur in a region. A related discipline is the study of Sylvics, which focuses on the autecology of genera and species.|$|E
