40|$|Pig welfare {{from farm}} to {{slaughter}} {{can be defined}} by the stress the animals undergo when faced with new environments. Recent reports concerning animal welfare during transport {{and at the time}} of slaughter in Greece indicate that corrective actions should be taken by the Greek authorities in particular to supervision and monitoring the situation of transportation, resting and stunning of animals. Slaughter pigs are currently subjected to number of handing practices from the moment they leave their <b>fattening</b> <b>pen</b> until they stunned at slaughter. New management practices taking into account animal welfare during pre-slaughter and stunning (fasting, loading, transport, lairage, stunning system) must be adopted in order to limit animal stress from farm to slaughter. Some of these practices (equipment, logistics, training of the personnel) to be implemented are discussed. Apart of the issue of the animal welfare, the lack of adequate preparation of pigs on farm (fasting) and the use of poor handling systems throughout the pre-slaughter period also lead to carcass depreciation and meat quality defects (PSE, DFD) which reflect in great economic losses for the industry...|$|E

Farm recruitment {{was based on the}} farmer's willingness to cooperate. Pig status was assessed using an indirect ELISA test. Evolution of the serological status was studied by means of survival analysis. A Cox proportional-hazards model, taking into account the clustering of animals at the farm level, was used {{to examine the effects of}} explanatory variables on the time to Salmonella seroconversion of pigs. Applying group level antibiotic treatment to the pigs during the fattening period (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 7, 3. 4) was identified as a risk factor for Salmonella seroconversion, as the presence of residual Salmonella contamination in the <b>fattening</b> <b>pen</b> before placing the pigs into the pens (HR = 1. 9; 95 % CI: 1. 2, 2. 9). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) seropositivity during the fattening period also indicated an increased hazard for seroconversion (HR = 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 1, 2. 5). The batch size was identified as a risk factor for Salmonella seroconversion: the higher the number of pigs was in the fattening room followed, the higher was the risk (HR(+ 10 pigs) = 1. 05 for a 10 -pig increment; 95 % CI: 1. 03, 1. 06). The biosecurity measures of wearing specific clothes before entering the facilities (HR = 0. 5; 95 % CI: 0. 3, 0. 9) and enclosing the pig farm facilities were protective (HR = 0. 4; 95 % CI: 0. 2, 0. 8) ...|$|E

Body temperature, heart rate and salivary cortisol were measured during baseline conditions and in response to relocation, isolation and restraint. Pigs housed in the poor environment performed more manipulative social behavior directed to penmates than pigs housed in the enriched environment. Physiological responses to the stressors were the same for enriched- and poor-housed pigs. Surprisingly, enriched-housed pigs had significantly higher baseline salivary cortisol concentrations, especially at 14 and 17 weeks of age. Moreover, enriched housed pigs had a lower baseline body temperature at 17 weeks of age.

[...] The little sow {{should not}} be allowed to stop growing after weaning but to the contrary, should be made to grow as rapidly as {{possible}} all the time. She {{should not be}} kept fat but in good flesh, nor should she be fed concentrates but to the opposite she should have a bulky food which will keep her digestive tract distended making her capable of handling a great amount of food when she gets to be a year old. Clover or alfalfa pasture in the summer and wheat or rye pasture in winter should be provided for the brood sow all their lives. Clover and alfalfa hay are relished in the winter. About an acre per sow would be the right amount of pasture. A very desirable grain is oats or a mixture of oats and corn ground up together make an excellent feed for young sows. Some bran and shorts mixed in the slop is very good. This keeps the young sow growing well and the slop gives bulk as does the pasture. It is poor policy to put the young sow you intend for breeding purposes in the <b>fattening</b> <b>pen</b> with the hogs intended for market. This makes her lazy and reduces her power to convert food consumed into feed for the fetus and little pigs as she has not the capacity. She will have need of a good digestive apparatus when through it she has to furnish food for eight or twelve pigs for from five to twelve weeks. The place where the grain is fed to the sows should be dry and exceedingly clean as it is conducive to good health and pigs are clean animals if you will give them a chance to be such. The dust on the feeding floor is injurious to their lings and by or with dust a great many disease germs are transmitted. The sow should have plenty of clean water to drink and slop at meal time.

40|$|Public {{interest}} in livestock farming is increasing, as is general criticism regarding {{the welfare of}} farm animals. In this context, husbandry systems for pigs especially are perceived very negatively. Despite rising concern for animal farming, most people lack detailed knowledge of modern agricultural production processes, as well as direct contact with agriculture. With regards to public demand for transparency of production quality and animal welfare standards, farmers and farmer associations in several countries have begun installing webcams in dairy, pig and poultry farming operations. Along with informational texts, pictures from webcams are publicly {{available on the internet}} and are used as a new type of communication tool aimed at increasing the acceptance of livestock farming by providing farming-specific information. However, there are currently no existing studies quantitatively investigating the effect of webcam pictures from stables and accompanying informational texts on the broader public. In a randomized between-subject experimental design, we presented two webcam pictures from conventional pig barns (pig fattening barn and sow farrowing pen) to the broader public, along with two different informational texts (one written directly by farmers and one neutrally written by the authors). Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} examine 1) if the attitude towards pig farming changes after having seen the webcam pictures, 2) if different informational texts alter the evaluation of webcam pictures, 3) if there are differences in the perception of webcam pictures of a pig fattening barn and a sow farrowing pen, and 4) how people evaluate the use of webcams as a public relations tool that can be used to provide transparency. It was determined that the majority of respondents display a more negative attitude after viewing the webcam pictures and informational texts, and this is especially true for participants reading the neutrally written texts. Further, the farrowing pen is evaluated substantially more negatively than the pig <b>fattening</b> <b>pen.</b> Regarding the overall evaluation of webcams, people seem to appreciate that farmers show real pictures from their stables, although a rather low {{interest in}} the usage of webcams in agriculture can be observed. Thus, although transparency may be enhanced through the use of webcams, our findings suggest that webcams generally do not show the desired effects on the public and are likely to be unable to improve the image of pig farming by simply providing information via pictures and texts. Finally, the application of webcams as a communication tool cannot be recommended, at least not for the husbandry systems investigated within this study...|$|E

40|$|Alternatives to {{surgical}} castration in organic pig production are needed, due to stress and pain caused by castration of male pigs. One alternative, {{which is in}} accordance with the values in organic farming, is production of entire male pigs. However, changed behaviour of entires compared to castrates might affect the welfare of the animals. Therefore, in order to produce entire male pigs, without compromised animal welfare, changes in the production system, possible offered by the organic farming system, with e. g. more available space and access to rooting material and roughage, might be a necessity. The aim {{of this article is to}} investigate the effect of grouping strategy and group size on levels of mounting behaviour and skin lesions, hypothesising that procedures that influence the social stability (e. g. regrouping) will have a larger negative effect in small groups compared to large groups.

40|$|Background: Helminths {{are common}} in European organic pig {{production}} systems {{and the use of}} deep-litter has long been considered a serious risk factor contributing to this problem. However, until now hardly any data has existed to either support or reject this hypothesis, thus complicating formulation of farmer guidelines. Methods: On an organic Danish pig farm, 3 different areas (latrine, resting area and the area in-between) of 2 indoor <b>fattening</b> <b>pens</b> with deep-litter (min. 2 months old) were examined for Ascaris suum and Trichuris suis eggs. The deep-litter was sampled vertically 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm from the surface, by pooling 4 sub-samples per level. In addition, eggs were isolated from the top, middle, and bottom of deep-litter (3 - 4 months old) of the same areas but in 3 other pens. Percentage embryonation was determined before and after incubation in H 2 SO 4 at 25 OC for 7 weeks. For comparison, control eggs isolated from fresh faeces were also incubated. Results: Though less common in the resting areas, eggs of A. suum (0 - 481 eggs/g dry litter) and T. suis (0 - 58 eggs/g dry litter) were detected in all pen areas and vertically throughout the deep-litter, but the large majority of eggs was unembryonated and some were damaged. Hardly any eggs were partially or fully embryonated. Once isolated and given optimal conditions, eggs of both species from all 3 areas were able to develop to a larvated stage, but the ability to do so declined with the depth within the deep-litter. Compared to control eggs from faeces, A. suum eggs from deep-litter were less successful in embryonation while T. suis eggs from deep-litter had the same percentage embryonation as fresh eggs. Conclusion: For the first time data has shown that deep-litter may not be a risk factor for A. suum and T. suis transmission within the pens as previously suspected. However, it does appear that a high number of eggs may survive and potentially embryonate if they are transferred to a more beneficial environment. The consequence being that manure should not be spread indiscriminately onto pastures, which may later be used for pigs. A solution may be to inactivate the eggs first. ...|$|R

40|$|Ascaris suum is {{the most}} common {{intestinal}} worm in pigs irrespective of production system. However, organic farms which promote animal welfare (e. g. by providing pastures and bedding material) may further promote survival of the eggs through which the parasite is dispersed to new hosts. The parasite has a negative effect on production results and possibly impairs vaccines. A one year survey of 5 Danish organic farms therefore aimed at mapping the occurrence of parasite eggs in the farm environment, supplemented with laboratory and field studies, including serial necropsies of different age groups of pigs from 2 farms to monitor infection levels. The combined results showed that eggs were present on farrowing and weaning pastures, ensuring continuous exposure to the parasite outdoors. The farms did not have enough land for effective long-term rotation schemes to allow eggs to die and thus disappear naturally, as they can live for at least 9 years in the soil. Consequently, young infected pigs brought the parasite with them into the stables. Here, large numbers of eggs accumulated in the bedding material, but the majority of eggs died as the result of high temperatures and ammonia levels due to bacterial degradation of fecal matter. Nevertheless, infective eggs were present in the bedding material and pigs continued to be exposed and become infected in weaner/starter and <b>fattening</b> pig <b>pens</b> up to slaughter (22 weeks old). As the eggs may need several weeks or months to develop in the environment depending on season, some of the infective eggs in the pens may have been deposited by previous groups of pigs, as not all pens were cleaned between batches of pigs. In conclusion, exposure to A. suum is currently difficult to prevent outdoors in Denmark. The best approach to reduce overall exposure is thus to improve cleaning and disinfection procedures indoors and to compost and store manure/slurry sufficiently to inactivate eggs...|$|R

Thirty steers aged 18 months weighing 300 Â± 5 kg were randomly allocated to 5 treatments, 24 steers were fed dried poultry litter based rations and 6 steers were fed the control ration for 90 days in a completely randomised design experiment which was replicated six times. Formulated rations were Isoenergetic (12. 50 MJ ME/ kg) and Isonitrogenous (16 % Crude Protein).

50|$|Routine {{applications}} of anthelmintic drug seem {{to appeal to}} pig farmers for reasons of convenience (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). However, merely resorting to anthelmintic treatment could result in little or no improvement due to continuous reinfection. The use of anthelmintics therefore needs to be complemented by higher quality farm hygiene and more effective farm management practices if one strives to reduce the roundworm infection pressure on the farm.There are numerous aspects of farm management that can {{have a major impact}} on the epidemiology of A. suum. Undoubtedly, the type of production system, stable infrastructure and different management factors like the application of a quarantine for imported pigs, all-in-all-out practice, early weaning, and the efficiency of cleaning protocols will affect Ascaris epidemiology. The type of production system that is in use will be a key factor regarding the infection intensity on a farm (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). For obvious reasons, there is a higher diversity of parasite species and higher infection intensity on traditional farms and where pigs have access to outdoor facilities when compared to intensive indoor systems (Lai et al., 2011; Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Reducing contact of pigs with their own faecal deposits or from pigs from previous rounds is important. Consequentially, housing of pigs on slatted floors seems to reduce the chance of parasite infestation compared to solid or partially slatted floors (Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2010; Tielen et al., 1978). Increased risk is associated with bedding being present in the pens. The use of bedding material may provide extra refugia that promote egg embryonation and hamper the effectiveness of repeated cleaning and disinfection measures. Evidently, the stocking density in the pig house will also be important (Tielen et al., 1978), as chances of pens containing pigs with patent infections will increase. Positioning the water supply in the dung area instead of in the lying area or the feeding troughs seems to be associated with a decreased prevalence of A. suum (Roepstorff et al., 1999). Water spillage in areas where eggs are present will enhance the chances for survival of the eggs due to constant humidity. Despite the extremely rigid eggshell, eggs do not embryonate when relative humidity is low, for instance in the dry resting areas in pig pens, or when floor temperatures are lower than 15 °C. Additionally, pig urine also seems to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the development of A. suum eggs (Nilsson, 1982). Once in the environment, the eggs will embryonate until the infective larvae are present inside the egg. Only then, the egg is infective for a new host. In a Danish study it was shown that A. suum eggs could embryonate on a pasture within 4-6 weeks during a normal Danish summer (Roepstorff and Murrell, 1997). These results were supported by experiments in laboratory conditions, during which it was observed that, although motile larvae were noticed from 4 weeks post-incubation, an incubation period of at least 6 weeks at room temperature was needed for eggs to become infective in mice (Geenen et al., 1999). When environmental factors like temperature, oxygen availability and relative humidity are suboptimal, the time for larvae to become infective increases (Nilsson, 1982). This is reflected by the fact that white spot levels seem to vary within farms depending on the season. Presumably, the rising temperatures in spring and summer allow the eggs that have overwintered in the stables to massively develop into the infective larval stage, leading to heavier infective environments and subsequently higher liver condemnation rates in summer and early autumn (Lai et al., 2011; Menzies et al., 1994; Nilsson, 1982; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2012).In intensive indoor systems, the presence of a breeding stock on a farm seems to be associated with a lower chance of A. suum being present on the farm. More often than not, farmers are unaware of the parasite status of the pigs that are bought from external producers. Therefore, importing pigs from piglet producers evidently increases the risk of introducing new infections into the herd. Farmers with fattening herds are advised to buy piglets from larger piglet producers with good management and hygiene (Joachim et al., 2001b) and that were preferably treated prior to delivery. Whether weaners need to be treated at the beginning of fattening or not is open for discussion. However, if their worm-free status cannot be warranted, incoming pigs should be treated upon arrival, hereby reducing the risk of introducing the infection into their herd. Once A. suum is present on the farm, it is easily dispersed over the whole farm through moving animals and dirty materials and boots. Even flies have shown to carry A. suum eggs (Forster et al., 2009).Other management practices like the use of the all-in-all-out system, and early weaning are linked to lower prevalence of A. suum (Joachim et al., 2001b; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Roepstorff et al., 1999; Tielen et al., 1978). In the all-in-all-out production system, pigs are moved into and out of facilities in distinct groups with the hope that, by preventing the commingling of groups, the spread of disease is reduced. This practice also allows for a period of thorough cleaning and disinfecting between subsequent groups of animals. Early weaning of piglets (3-5 weeks) also seems to be associated with a reduced risk of A. suum infection (Roepstorff et al., 1999). However it is likely that this can be attributed to the fact that both these parameters are associated with other factors that are more important for parasite survival, like for instance, the use of more traditional rearing methods or poorer general pen hygiene.Frequent cleaning of the pens, preferably after each round, is indispensable to destroy or reduce the amount of eggs in the environment. Clearly, the presence of rough and uneven surfaces would provide a good microenvironment for egg development and have an impact on the efficiency of cleaning protocols. Joachim et al., (2001) indicated that in older pens, the prevalence of Ascaris infections was significantly higher (63,0%) than in the new pens (27,9%). Moreover, Nilsson (1982) found high number of eggs (up to 3,000 EPG) in the crevices of the floor between the slatted dung area and the resting area of the pen. Approximately half of these eggs appeared to be embryonated. In a study by Beloeil et al., (2003) 31% of the farms surveyed had residual dung in the <b>fattening</b> <b>pens</b> when restocking them with new fattening pigs, a practice, favouring the transmission of A. suum eggs. Even though careful cleaning of the pens with high-pressure water will remove most of the residual dung, it seems ineffective to completely remove all infective eggs (Nilsson, 1982). The use of disinfectants is very effective against bacteria, but is rather ineffective against A. suum eggs. Instead, steam cleaning and drying of the pens is a highly recommended management practice for killing roundworm eggs. These are, however, hard to comply with in practice.Looking to the future, the percentage of Ascaris-favourable production systems is expected to rise due to increasing consumer demand for drug free, biologically grown, free-range pork and the forthcoming implementation of new regulations for increased pig wellbeing. In Denmark for example, sprinkler systems should be applied in the pens of growing pigs and sows to accommodate a daily shower. Moreover, sows should not be tethered and housed in groups in enriched environments (bedding, wallowing) for part of the gestation (Roepstorff et al., 2011a; Thamsborg et al., 2010). As a result, the number of eggs surviving in the pens will increase and with it, the prevalence of Ascaris and other pig parasites (Haugegaard, 2010). Good diagnostic assessments will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in farm management will affect parasite epidemiology.|$|R
