5|$|<b>Diphenhydramine,</b> a first-generation H1 {{receptor}} antagonist {{or medicine}} that combats the H1 receptor that {{is associated with}} many allergic reactions, {{has been found to be}} the most potent antihistamine for this particular disease. Patients prescribed 50 milligrams four times per day have been able to sustain normal exposure to the sun without suffering a reaction.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{sedative}} properties, <b>diphenhydramine</b> {{is widely}} used in nonprescription sleep aids for insomnia. The drug is an ingredient in several products sold as sleep aids, either alone or {{in combination with other}} ingredients such as acetaminophen (paracetamol). An example of the latter is Tylenol PM. <b>Diphenhydramine</b> can cause minor psychological dependence. <b>Diphenhydramine</b> can cause sedation and has also been used as an anxiolytic.|$|E
25|$|Topical <b>diphenhydramine</b> is {{sometimes}} used especially {{for people in}} hospice. This use is without indication and topical <b>diphenhydramine</b> {{should not be used}} as treatment for nausea because research does not indicate this therapy is more effective than alternatives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> is {{category}} B in the FDA Classification of Drug Safety During Pregnancy. It is also excreted {{in breast}} milk. Paradoxical reactions to <b>diphenhydramine</b> have been documented, in particular among children, {{and it may}} cause excitation instead of sedation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} used {{to treat}} a number of conditions including allergic symptoms and itchiness, the common cold, insomnia, motion sickness, and extrapyramidal symptoms. <b>Diphenhydramine</b> also has local anesthetic properties, and {{has been used as}} such in people allergic to common local anesthetics such as lidocaine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> is used {{to treat}} Parkinson's disease-like {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms caused by antipsychotics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> {{also has}} {{antiemetic}} properties, which make it useful in treating the nausea {{that occurs in}} vertigo and motion sickness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> is {{effective}} in treatment of allergies. As of 2007, {{it was the most}} commonly used antihistamine for acute allergic reactions in the emergency department.|$|E
25|$|Several anti-itch {{medications}} are commercially available, {{including those}} taken orally, such as <b>diphenhydramine,</b> or topically applied antihistamines and, for more severe cases, corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and triamcinolone.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for antihistamine; they are thus not generally recommended. Sedative antihistamines, such as <b>diphenhydramine,</b> may be tried in those {{who are unable to}} sleep due to eczema.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{formulations}} of <b>diphenhydramine</b> are available, including creams, lotions, gels, and sprays. These {{are used to}} relieve itching, and {{have the advantage of}} causing fewer systemic effects (e.g., drowsiness) than oral forms.|$|E
25|$|A {{more refined}} method for {{creating}} Cheese heroin {{is done by}} taking #4 powder heroin and crushed <b>diphenhydramine</b> tablets, and adding them to water such that the active ingredients dissolve into the solution. The solution is then filtered via a micron filter to remove all the cuts and binders/fillers, leaving the user with a solution of high purity diamorphine HCl and <b>diphenhydramine</b> hcl. The water is then evaporated off, yielding a clumpy powder containing a highly purified mixture of heroin and DPH. It can also be further purified by titrating the solution with a weak to intermediate base such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to freebase the diamorphine and DPH.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{conjunctivitis}} usually resolves {{on its own}} {{and does}} not require any specific treatment. Antihistamines (e.g., <b>diphenhydramine)</b> or mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn) {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Povidone iodine has been suggested as a treatment, but as of 2008 evidence to support it was poor.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include sleepiness, poor coordination, and an upset stomach. Its use is not {{recommended}} in babies. There is no clear risk of harm when used during pregnancy; however, use during breastfeeding {{is not recommended}}. It is a first generation H1-antihistamine and works by blocking certain effects of histamine. <b>Diphenhydramine</b> is also an anticholinergic.|$|E
25|$|Different {{medications}} are {{tried in}} an effort to find a combination that is effective for a specific person. Not all people will respond well to the same medications. Medications that have had positive results in some include: <b>diphenhydramine,</b> benzatropine and atropine. anti-Parkinsons agents (such as ropinirole and bromocriptine), and muscle relaxants (such as diazepam).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} antiemetics are {{effective}} and safe in pregnancy including: pyridoxine/doxylamine, antihistamines (such as <b>diphenhydramine),</b> and phenothiazines (such as promethazine). With respect to effectiveness, {{it is unknown}} if one is superior to another for improving nausea or vomiting. Limited evidence from published clinical trials suggests the use of medications to treat hyperemesis gravidarum.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief by taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as <b>diphenhydramine</b> or doxylamine. <b>Diphenhydramine</b> and doxylamine are widely used in nonprescription sleep aids. They are the most effective over-the-counter sedatives currently available, at least in much of Europe, and in Canada, Australia, and the United States, and are more sedating than some prescription hypnotics. Antihistamine effectiveness for sleep may decrease over time, and anticholinergic side-effects (such as dry mouth) {{may also be a}} drawback with these particular drugs. While addiction {{does not seem to be}} an issue with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use. However, people whose insomnia is caused by restless legs syndrome may have worsened symptoms with antihistamines.|$|E
25|$|Medications such as anticholinergics (benztropine), which act as inhibitors of the {{neurotransmitter}} acetylcholine, {{may provide}} some relief. In {{the case of}} an acute dystonic reaction, <b>diphenhydramine</b> is sometimes used (though this drug is well known as an antihistamine, in this context it is being used primarily for its anticholinergic role).. See also Procyclidine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> is an {{antihistamine}} mainly used {{to treat}} allergies. It is also used for insomnia, symptoms of the common cold, tremor in parkinsonism, and nausea. It is used by mouth, injection into a vein, and injection into a muscle. Maximal effect is typically around two hours after a dose and effects can last for up to seven hours.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{hypersensitivity}} to neuroleptics, preventing DLB {{patients from}} taking these medications is important. People with DLB {{are at risk}} for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a life-threatening illness, because of their sensitivity to these medications, especially the older typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol. Other medications, including medications for urinary incontinence and the antihistamine medication <b>diphenhydramine</b> (Benadryl), also may worsen confusion.|$|E
25|$|Beyond initial first aid, antihistamines such as <b>diphenhydramine</b> (Benadryl) may control skin {{irritation}} (pruritus). Ice or fresh water {{is not usually}} applied to stings, since they may cause nematocysts to continue to release toxin. Immunobased antivenins have been available since the 1970s; administration requires medical personnel and refrigeration and are used in extreme cases as {{with regard to the}} box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} are CYP2D6 inhibitors {{and reduce}} or even completely block {{the conversion of}} codeine to morphine. The most well-known of these {{are two of the}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paroxetine (Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac) as well as the antihistamine <b>diphenhydramine</b> (Benadryl) and the antidepressant, bupropion (Wellbutrin, also known as Zyban). Other drugs, such as rifampicin and dexamethasone, induce CYP450 isozymes and thus increase the conversion rate.|$|E
25|$|Drugs which induce sleep, {{known as}} hypnotics, include Benzodiazepines, {{although}} these interfere with REM; Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata), and zolpidem (Ambien); Antihistamines, such as <b>diphenhydramine</b> (Benadryl) and doxylamine; Alcohol (ethanol), despite its rebound effect {{later in the}} night and interference with REM; barbiturates, which have the same problem; melatonin, a component of the circadian clock, and released naturally at night by the pineal gland; and cannabis, which may also interfere with REM.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the time}} of Cortez Jr.'s death and the {{announcement}} of his toxicology tests in late April, The Dallas Morning News published {{the results of a}} lengthy analysis of autopsy results between 2005 and 2007, conducted in concert with the Dallas County medical examiner's office, which suggested that as many as 17 deaths among adolescents during that period were attributable to cheese heroin, not including the Cortez death. The conclusion was based in part on the presence of both heroin and <b>diphenhydramine</b> in the blood of the deceased; additionally, the families of 11 victims confirmed the deceased had used cheese heroin. Some toxicologists questioned the results due to the absence of acetaminophen. Other experts argued that acetaminophen has a shorter half-life and might have been metabolized by the body prior to death. Susan Dalterio, a University of Texas at San Antonio pharmacology expert, insisted that the combination was unlikely to be a coincidence, as a person sleepy from <b>diphenhydramine</b> would be unlikely to be abusing heroin at the same time. It is common for users of heroin and other opioid drugs to take diphenhydramine-containing medications as an attempt to alleviate side effects resulting from histamine release induced by opioid administration, such as pruritus, as well as potentiate the sedative effects of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Although rarely fatal, the {{symptoms}} of the bite are often incredibly painful and medical attention is recommended following any Latrodectus species bite, as complications relating to the bite can arise. Treatment of bites is usually supportive, administering opiates for pain and benzodiazepines for spasms. An antidote is available in South Africa for the bites of both L. indistinctus and L. geometricus, however it is only used for severe cases of envenomation due to its potentially severe side effects. Individuals who are allergic to the venom may also require epinephrine (adrenaline) or <b>diphenhydramine</b> to treat subsequent anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} sickle-cell disease have {{intensely}} painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, {{and duration of}} these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with pain medications; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on NSAIDs (such as diclofenac or naproxen). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices are commonly used in this setting. <b>Diphenhydramine</b> is also an effective agent that doctors frequently prescribe to help control itching {{associated with the use}} of opioids.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or <b>diphenhydramine)</b> may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|The H1 {{receptor}} antagonism of doxepin {{is responsible}} for its hypnotic effects and its effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} insomnia at low doses. The incidence of side effects with doxepin and its safety at these doses was similar to that of placebo in clinical trials; the most frequent side effects were headache and somnolence/sedation, both with an incidence of less than 5%. Other side effects sometimes associated with antihistamines, including daytime sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain, all were not observed. Clinical evidence of H1 receptor antagonists and TCAs for the treatment insomnia shows mixed effectiveness and is limited in its quality due to weaknesses like small sample sizes and poor generalizability. However, doxepin is a unique and notable exception; it has been well-studied in the treatment of insomnia and shows consistent benefits with excellent tolerability and safety. Aside from <b>diphenhydramine</b> and doxylamine, which have historical approval as hypnotics, doxepin is the only H1 receptor antagonist that is specifically approved for the treatment of insomnia in the United States.|$|E
25|$|At {{very low}} doses, doxepin has not shown {{discontinuation}} or withdrawal effects nor rebound insomnia. Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies {{of up to}} 12weeks duration. This {{appears to be in}} contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like <b>diphenhydramine</b> and doxylamine and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of tolerance and dependence (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness. It is for this reason that, unlike doxepin, they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1week). It is not entirely clear why doxepin and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but {{it has been suggested that}} it may have to do with the lack of selectivity for the H1 receptor of the latter or may have to do with the use of optimal doses. Unlike very-low-dose doxepin, most first-generation antihistamines also have marked anticholinergic activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion. This is particularly true in older people, and antihistamines with concomitant anticholinergic effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65. Anticholinergic activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H1 receptor blockade.|$|E
500|$|Goldstein {{was found}} dead in his New York City {{apartment}} on August 28, 2009. Drug paraphernalia, including a crack pipe and a bag of crack, were found nearby. The New York medical examiner subsequently determined that Goldstein's death was an accident caused by [...] "acute intoxication" [...] from a combination of cocaine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, <b>diphenhydramine</b> and levamisole. Haley Wood denied rumors that an alleged recent separation from Goldstein had contributed to his relapse, saying that the couple had still been together at the time.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> is not {{recommended}} for people older than 60 or {{children under the age}} of six, unless a physician is consulted. These populations should be treated with second-generation antihistamines such as loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, and azelastine. Due to its strong anticholinergic effects, <b>diphenhydramine</b> is on the [...] "Beers list" [...] of drugs to avoid in the elderly.|$|E
2500|$|A {{large number}} of {{medications}} are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. Some types of medications known to inhibit CYP2D6 include certain SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, some antipsychotics, and the commonly available antihistamine <b>diphenhydramine.</b> Therefore, the potential of interactions exists between dextromethorphan and medications that inhibit this enzyme, particularly in slow metabolizers.|$|E
2500|$|Antihistamines can {{alleviate}} {{some of the}} milder {{symptoms of}} an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis. [...] Antihistamines block the action of histamine, which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins. Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals. [...] The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is <b>diphenhydramine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diphenhydramine</b> {{was first}} made by George Rieveschl and came into {{commercial}} use in 1946. It is {{available as a}} generic medication. The wholesale price {{in the developing world}} as of 2014 is about [...] per dose. In the United States, it costs less than [...] for a typical month supply. It is sold under the trade name Benadryl among others.|$|E
2500|$|... "Based on {{the role}} of {{histamine}} in keeping people awake (and hence the common side effect of anti-histamines such as <b>diphenhydramine</b> causing sleepiness), medications that act on histamine are under development for the treatment of excessive sleepiness." [...] It {{remains to be seen whether}} these H3 antagonists (i.e., compounds such as pitolisant that promote the release of the wake-promoting amine histamine) will be particularly useful as wake-promoting agents.|$|E
2500|$|... "Cheese" [...] or [...] "Tylenol with Smack" [...] is a heroin-based {{recreational}} drug {{that came to}} the attention of the media inside and outside the United States after a string of deaths among adolescents in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, between 2005 and 2007. [...] It is generally reported to be a mixture of heroin and Tylenol PM (an OTC acetaminophen and <b>diphenhydramine</b> combination) or its generic equivalent, in varying ratios.|$|E
