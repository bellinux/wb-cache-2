40|$|Abstract — Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) are selforganized networks envisioned {{to deploy}} with zero (or less) configuration effort {{in places where}} infrastructure networks are not available. In such a network, connectivity is enabled by automatic IP address allocation and dynamic routing. MANETs are highly dynamic with members joining and rejoining, leaving, moving around freely, network partitioning and merging, dynamic address allocation according to location closeness or according to host’s logical affiliation. These dynamics lead to potential frequent changes of a node’s IP address. Therefore, application programs {{are more likely to}} use well known <b>names</b> (<b>Domain</b> <b>Names)</b> that are unique, easy to remember and/or that bear logical semantics of the parties. On-the-scene translation from a node’s well known name to its newly assigned network address faces new challenges in MANETs, which obsoletes legacy Internet <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Systems.</b> In this paper, we present a distributed <b>naming</b> <b>system</b> that provides service robustly in the presence of mobility and node failures.

40|$|Abstract — Despite the {{increased}} focus on security, critical information systems remain vulnerable to cyber attacks. The trend lends {{importance to the}} concept of intrusion tolerance: there is a high probability that systems will be successfully attacked and a critical system must fend off or at least limit the damage caused by unknown and/or undetected attacks. In prior work, we developed a Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance (SCIT) architecture that achieves the above goal by constantly cleansing the servers and rotating the role of individual servers. In this paper 1, we show that SCIT operations can be incorruptibly enforced with hardware enhancements. We then present an incorruptible SCIT design for use by {{one of the most critical}} infrastructures of the Internet, the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>systems.</b> We will show the advantages of our designs in the following areas: (1) incorruptible intrusion tolerance, (2) high availability, (3) scalability, the support for using high degrees of hardware/server redundancy to improve both system security and service dependability, and (4) in the case of SCIT-based DNSSEC, protection of the DNS master file and cryptographic keys. It is our belief that incorruptible intrusion tolerance as presented here constitutes a new, effective layer of system defense for critical information systems.

40|$|Email {{should be}} one of the most {{powerful}} communication mediums at our disposal. However email abuse reduces the effectiveness of this medium for all users. Various technical means to combat abuses such as spam and phishing have been proposed, and in this paper one of those, DomainKeys, is examined. DomainKeys provides a means to digitally sign all email that emanates from a given domain. Public keys for the digital signature algorithm are distributed via the <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Systems</b> (DNS), rather than trying to set up a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Email recipients can retrieve the public key from DNS to validate the signature on the incoming email. The paper looks in detail at how DomainKeys achieves domain authentication for email, and then assesses how well it can meet the stated aim of improving the email user experience before comparing DomainKeys to other related systems. I conclude that DomainKeys succeeds in providing an authentication framework that is useful in and of itself, but that the usefulness of this framework in combating spam is limited. 1...|$|R
