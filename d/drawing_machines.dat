2500|$|Single block wire <b>drawing</b> <b>machines</b> include {{means for}} holding the dies {{accurately}} in position and for drawing the wire steadily through the holes. The usual design {{consists of a}} cast-iron bench or table having a bracket standing up to hold the die, and a vertical drum which rotates and by coiling the wire around its surface pulls it through the die, the coil of wire being stored upon another drum or [...] "swift" [...] which lies behind the die and reels off the wire as fast as required. The wire drum or [...] "block" [...] is provided with means for rapidly coupling or uncoupling it to its vertical shaft, so that {{the motion of the}} wire may be stopped or started instantly. The block is also tapered, so that the coil of wire may be easily slipped off upwards when finished. Before the wire can be attached to the block, a sufficient length of it must be pulled through the die; this is effected by a pair of gripping pincers {{on the end of a}} chain which is wound around a revolving drum, so drawing the wire until enough can be coiled two or three times on the block, where the end is secured by a small screw clamp or vice. When the wire is on the block, it is set in motion and the wire is drawn steadily through the die; it is very important that the block rotates evenly and that it runs true and pulls the wire at a constant velocity, otherwise [...] "snatching" [...] occurs which will weaken or even break the wire. The speeds at which wire is drawn vary greatly, according to the material and the amount of reduction.|$|E

50|$|A popular {{application}} {{for this type}} of robot is a computer numerical control machine (CNC machine) and 3D printing.

50|$|Initially, Mega Millions {{drawings}} {{were to be}} held at the WGN-TV studios; however, {{to entice}} the Georgia Lottery to switch from Powerball (Georgia wanted to offer both games for several months; instead, the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) booted it from Powerball soon after The Big Game began), The Big Game′s <b>drawing</b> <b>machines</b> were moved to Atlanta before its first drawing.
