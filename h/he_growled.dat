2500|$|In 1960, Reith {{returned}} to the BBC {{for an interview with}} John Freeman in the television series Face to Face. When he visited the BBC to record the programme, work was being undertaken, and Reith noticed with dismay the [...] "girlie" [...] pin-ups of the workmen. However, one picture was of a Henry Moore sculpture. [...] "A Third Programme carpenter, forsooth," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Denning died {{of cancer}} in Taunton in 2007. He {{is survived by his wife}} and two daughters. Brian Rose, Denning's former opening partner and Somerset Director of Cricket paid the {{following}} tribute to his former team mate: [...] "To me Peter epitomised all that should be good in a professional cricketer. He was hard, stubborn and made it difficult for the opposition – especially when <b>he</b> <b>growled</b> at them. His sad death is a tremendous loss to Somerset cricket." ...|$|E
60|$|This so annoyed {{the leopard}} that <b>he</b> <b>growled</b> horribly, and the monkey laughed at him.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>growls</b> as <b>he</b> storms the country,A villain big and bold.And {{the trees}} all shake and quiver and quake,As he robs {{them of their}} gold.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am {{not afraid}} of Betty's bar. <b>He</b> <b>growls</b> at me when I throw sticks at him, and snaps his teeth. Can I go with you next time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>he's</b> <b>growling</b> {{around a}} little, but that's all," [...] {{answered}} the young major. [...] "I'm not {{paying any attention}} to him, Ruth. I'm mighty glad that you didn't accept his invitation," [...] and {{he gave her a}} warm glance.|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{suddenly}} overclouding all his features, <b>he</b> <b>growled</b> in a hoarsened rasping {{voice as}} he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nowt that's not Langrigg's," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled,</b> {{grasping}} his stick. [...] "Gentry {{stands by}} yan anodder. Are you gan t' tell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oobooh, hooh boohooyah!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>growled</b> at last. [...] "Woobah yahwah oobooh! Bow wahbah woobooyah? Bow wow?" [...] {{he asked}} Bruno, severely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's a rum dog. Don't he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he's in company!' {{pursued the}} Dodger. 'Won't <b>he</b> <b>growl</b> at all, {{when he hears}} a fiddle playing! And don't he hate other dogs as ain't of his breed! Oh, no!' ...|$|R
60|$|LADY (naively). Yes: {{soldiers}} blush so easily! (<b>He</b> <b>growls</b> {{and turns}} away. She looks mischievously at him, balancing the despatches in her hand.) Wouldn't {{you like to}} read these before they're burnt, General? You must be dying with curiosity. Take a peep. (She throws the packet on the table, and turns her face away from it.) I won't look.|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. No. I am just {{preparing}} you. You see, darling, I can't {{call you}} Dad when {{my hair is}} up. I think I shall call you Parent. (<b>He</b> <b>growls.)</b> Parent dear, {{do you remember the}} days when your Margaret was a slip of a girl, and sat on your knee? How foolish we were, Parent, in those distant days.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wiggett coughed sourly. [...] "I’m fifty-nine," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled.</b> [...] "Nothing ’ll make {{me believe}} as Mrs. Pullen’s fifty-five, nor {{anywhere}} near it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a trump for gruel, Polly," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled,</b> {{returning}} the saucepan. [...] "Now then, {{up with the}} pyramid, {{and give us a}} nor'-wester." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>growled</b> in {{his throat}} like an angered cur, and his hands were jerked {{to the level of}} his breast, the fingers bending talon-wise.|$|E
5000|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Justin Falzon compares Webbe to [...] "a flexible mesh of Jonathan Davis and Beenie Man", {{writing that}} [...] "comparing his apparent vocal mastery {{to any one}} (or two) artists is nigh impossible. He screams, <b>he</b> wails, <b>he</b> <b>growls,</b> <b>he</b> rolls, and he jumps all over the register at will; it's an altogether astounding virtuoso performance. Unfortunately the music itself - slightly less funk than 311, slightly more punk than Limp Bizkit, and much more reggae than both - can't possibly keep up with Webbe's vocal apocalypse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be long," [...] said Wyndham quietly. [...] "I cannot grumble for myself; I'm {{thinking}} about Bob. It {{looks as if}} he must carry my load and his, but <b>he</b> won't <b>growl.</b> <b>He's</b> strong and his pluck's unbreakable. Pluck and honesty like Bob's are worth more than talent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Starve the dogs," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growls.</b> [...] "Starve 'm {{until they}} crawl aft and lick our shoes. Maybe {{you think the}} custom of {{carrying}} the stores aft just happened. Only it didn't. Before you and I were born it was long-established and it was established on brass tacks. They {{knew what they were}} about, the old cusses, when they put the grub in the lazarette." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay within!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled.</b> [...] "Never let {{the strangers}} see thy face. Next time you show {{yourself}} to strangers I shall kill you!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{determined}} that now {{was as good}} a time as any to discover just how deep was Raja's affection for me. One of us could be master, and logically I was the one. <b>He</b> <b>growled</b> at me. I cuffed him sharply across the nose. He looked it {{me for a moment}} in surprised bewilderment, and then <b>he</b> <b>growled</b> again. I made another feint at him, expecting that it would bring him at my throat; but instead he winced and crouched down.|$|E
6000|$|Milt {{wanted to}} trumpet her exquisiteness to the world, so <b>he</b> <b>growled</b> {{to a man}} {{standing}} beside him, [...] "Swell car. Nice-lookin' girl, kind of." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{with the}} man's {{movement}} in withdrawing the weapon {{from his shirt}} the lion's attitude suddenly altered and though <b>he</b> still <b>growled</b> <b>he</b> turned and sprang away, and then at last the Englishman stood almost {{at the foot of}} the tree that was his goal, and between him and safety sprawled a sleeping lion.|$|R
50|$|Ben is {{a little}} dusty white dog (whose name is derived from Osama Bin Laden) who isn't really {{appreciated}} by anyone but Paul Senior. He is permitted to do pretty much whatever he wants, whether eating on the counters or drinking beer. He understands human speech; <b>he</b> <b>growls</b> at Fred for having referred to Bin Laden negatively in his TV scripts. He is also the legal owner of the Bougons' fraudulent construction company.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here <b>he</b> is,' <b>growled</b> Newman, 'and {{somebody}} with him. Now it'll be [...] "Stop till this gentleman's gone." [...] But I won't. That's flat.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{touched her}} {{hand for a}} moment. The dog's face was {{wrinkled}} like a monkey's, <b>he</b> <b>growled,</b> and his narrow red tongue shot out threateningly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't keep posted," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled.</b> [...] "But {{everything}} was moving smoothly with us before this confounded social stunt began, as you must admit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you haven't any money, you'll have to {{work your}} passage," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled.</b> [...] "I can't afford to carry you to Australia for nothing." ...|$|E
50|$|As Dianne {{finds the}} first-aid kit to treat Dennis, she overhears his screams. She rushes to the den and finds Ryan eating Dennis' {{entrails}}. Ryan reveals {{that his family}} only eats living humans on their birthdays and just eats entrails from corpses to survive every day. However, Ryan wanted more and prefers to eat living humans every day. Dianne realizes that she was used by Ryan {{so that he can}} get rid of his family and their restrictions as <b>he</b> <b>growls</b> and pounces on her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Queen--he {{got tired}} layin' low," [...] went on Somers. [...] "He wanted action. I heerd him chewin' to himself, an' when I {{asked him what}} was eatin' him <b>he</b> up an' <b>growled</b> <b>he</b> was goin' to quit this Injun fightin'. An' he slipped off in the woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|Malcolm's heart felt easier, but <b>he</b> still <b>growled.</b> 'Then, Sir, if you assure me that I can do {{so without}} {{detriment}} to my honour, I will not quit you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tonal', man!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled</b> with a Gaelic expletive {{which it}} is {{impossible}} to spell, [...] "iss that a birch-bark canoe that I am seein'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, Pat, that's no joke. You {{may think}} it's funny, but it isn't," [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled,</b> {{and there was}} a note of real anger this time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why stand {{you there}} like a fool?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>growled.</b> [...] "Quench the light--stay, we may want it! Cast your cloak over it! Quick, man, quick!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Hammill's {{voice is}} a very {{distinctive}} element of his music. He sings in an emotional, often even dramatic way. As a former Jesuit chorister, his delivery is usually Received Pronunciation British English — notable exceptions are his Afrikaner accent on [...] "A Motor-bike in Afrika" [...] and his Cockney accent on [...] "Polaroid" [...] — and ranges in tone from peacefully celestial to screaming rants (which are nevertheless highly controlled). Singing in registers from baritone to high falsetto, <b>he</b> <b>growls,</b> croons, shrieks and shouts in ways that have drawn comparison with the guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix.|$|R
60|$|And {{all this}} means {{work for the}} men. Taking Mr. Pike's judgment, they are very inadequate, though by this time they know the ropes. <b>He</b> <b>growls</b> and grumbles, and snorts and sneers {{whenever}} he watches them doing anything. To-day, at eleven in the morning, the wind was so violent, continuing in greater gusts after having come in a great gust, that Mr. Pike ordered the mainsail taken off. The great crojack was already off. But the watch could not clew up the mainsail, and, after much vain sing- songing and pull-hauling, the watch below was routed out to bear a hand.|$|R
60|$|Then with a <b>growl</b> <b>he</b> leaped {{directly}} for the astonished youth.|$|R
