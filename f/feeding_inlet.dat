The uncomplete knowledge in soil modifications {{and a lack of}} clear design practices laid the foundation of this work. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine optimal hydraulic loads and to observe the main critical parameters affecting treating performances and hydraulic loads acceptance. For this purpose, a soil rich in clay and backfill was chosen to perform column infiltration tests with TWW. Two loading rates and two loading modes were compared to study the influence of an intermittent <b>feeding.</b> <b>Inlet</b> and outlet waters were periodically analysed and columns were instrumented with balances, tensiometers, O 2 and temperature probes. Soil physico-chemical characteristics were also taken into account to better understand the modification of the soil. One of the main expectations of tertiary treatment is to improve phosphate removal. A particular attention was thus given to phosphorus retention. The interest of an intermittent feeding in presence of a soil with high clay content was showed. This study highlighted that an intermittent feeding could make possible the use of a clay rich soil for water infiltration...|$|E

The modular fluidization allows the selective storage of heat or thermal transfer to the exchanger. At the basis of such use, there are the favorable features of thermal exchange of the fluidized beds and the effective convective conveyance of the heat subsequent to the mobility of the granular phase. Both these features are linked to the possibility of imparting a rheological behavior to a granular solid that is comparable to that of a fluid, actually thanks to the fluidization thereof. Such device mainly comprises: - a containment casing (2) provided with one or more cavities receiving the solar radiation (20); - a fluidizable bed of granular particles (3) suitable for thermal energy storage and conveyance, arranged inside the containment casing (2); - one feed inlet for feeding a fluidization gas through the bed (3) of particles by a suitable distributor (21); - a heat exchanger (4) immersed in the fluidizable granular bed and crossed by a working fluid; and - a <b>feeding</b> <b>inlet</b> for a fuel gas (401) as additional thermal input to increase the system management flexibility...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Biochar is a {{valuable}} co-product with increasing agronomic and environmental values produced during pyrolysis, which is a thermochemical conversion process of biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen. Accumulation of biochar in the bed may result in poor fluidization performance and product quality. The efficient removal of the separated biochar from the fluidized bed is therefore crucial for economical reasons. This thesis is structured in three sections. Section 1, provides an introduction and literature review on biomass pyrolysis covering the main types of processes and reactors focusing on fluidized bed technologies. It section addresses the mechanisms associated with mixing and separation processes in fluidized beds are briefly discussed. The significance of biochar recovery is also emphasized and the various current recovery methods are reviewed and discussed. Section 2 describes the methodology, the operating conditions and the variables investigated and measured in this work to generate the experimental data and ensure process reproducibility and accuracy experimental findings. Following this section, the section 3, addresses the experimental results and analysis leading to the conclusions and recommendations for future research directions. The primary objective of this research is to describe, through experimental investigations, the effects of geometrical and operating parameters on the separation efficiency and the yield of the recovered biochar in a cold simulator laboratory scale bubbling fluidized bed. A section of the bed simulates the pyrolysis reactor bed, is fluidized at high gas velocity to provide intense mixing, and a second section operates at a lower gas velocity to promote particle separation. Biochar is continuously fed to the well mixed zone to simulate the production in the reactor bed. An automated pulsating <b>feeding</b> <b>inlet</b> regulated by sleeve valves allowed continuous feeding of biochar while overflow ports in the separation section allowed for the continuous discharge of the biochar. The lab scale bubbling fluidized bed unit, made it feasible for continuous segregation and removal of biochar at an optimized separation efficiency range of 96. 40...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real time optimization scheme for a solar powered direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) water desalination system.

40|$|Silo {{feeding process}} via {{pneumatic}} transport pipe will generates the initial turbulence {{that causes the}} dispersion of particles in air. This phenomenon is known as dust cloud formation which is likelihood for an explosive atmosphere. Thus, understanding of dust cloud formation in silo is important for safety measures. This paper {{presents the results of}} flow field, in terms of mean and root mean square (RMS) velocity of dust cloud in a silo during axial feeding using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code,Fluent. The influence of grid size, modeling approach and discretization schemes were examined using turbulence model namely renormalization group k-ε (RNG) combined with disperse phase model (DPM) which follows Eulerian-Lagrangian (E-L) approach. The E-L approach treats solid particles as moving points in the computational domain and their movement is tracked as they moved through the gas flow. Two-way coupling effect was considered since the continuous phase flow field is impacted by the discrete phase. The profiles of mean and RMS velocity at five different axial locations Z = 750 mm, 1750 mm, 2750 mm, 3750 mm and 4750 mm were examined to recognized the flow pattern inside silo. Predicted mean and RMS velocity using combination of DPM and RNG turbulence model with various discretization and pressure interpolation schemes were plotted and compared against experimental measurement adopted from literature,showing a plausibly good agreement with second order upwind scheme and standard pressure interpolation scheme. It was found that predicted flow field has a great influence to the silo height. Higher mean velocity in downward direction was predicted in the center region closer {{to the top of the}} silo due to gravitational force on the particles. Moreover, it was found that turbulence flow (RMS velocity) is correspondingly increase with increasing the axial positions, indicating that region closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>inlet</b> favor the initial turbulence formation. This suggests that combination of RNG turbulence model and DPM could be employed in dust cloud formation study...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{growth of}} world {{population}} and industrialization is increasing the primary energy demand, {{and also the}} need for transport fuels. The increasing {{carbon dioxide and other}} emissions are fostering the political atmosphere to demand for a more sustainable development with more efficient usage of raw materials and resources. In order to improve some key processes in refineries, such as Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC), a better understanding of high-flux flow hydrodynamics is necessary. FCC units are producing a large proportion of gasoline world-wide, and some other valuable products such as light olefins and light cycle oil. Nearly all FCC units in production utilize a riser reactor, where the solids (catalyst) circulation rate could range from 400  kg/m 2 s to 1, 200  kg/m 2 s, and the superficial gas velocity from 6  m/s to 28  m/s. Therefore, it is surprising that nearly all studies of CFB pilot hydrodynamics have been carried out at low solids fluxes of less than 200  kg/m 2 s, whereas only a few limited but helpful studies are discussing higher solids fluxes of over 500  kg/m 2 s (Zhu and Bi, 1995). Such studies are regarded very useful for industrial processes and unit design, development and optimization. In comparison to those studies carried out in the dense suspension upflow (DSU) regime (Grace et al., 1999), this Thesis will discuss high-flux operations where the axial solids holdup profile is not flat and the cross-sectional solids concentration is clearly less than 10 %-vol in the upper portion of the riser. Consequently, the operation has similarities to both DSU and fast fluidization (FF) flow regimes. Since the cross-sectional solids concentration is also low (< 10 %-vol) in the upper portion of industrial FCC risers, another aim is to provide a detailed image of the radial solids concentration profiles and their development toward the top of a high-flux riser. Since there is confusion of how and why DSU flow regime would occupy a riser, some fundamental reasons are discussed in detail. It is shown that to realize a high-density circulating fluidized-bed operation (HFCFB), a high-flux circulating fluidized-bed (HFCFB) operation is essential but not sufficient. For having some experience enclosed from a low-flux riser, paper I is discussing the low-flux riser hydrodynamics concerning especially the flow structure near to the column wall. Paper II and III present the solids concentration and particle velocity profiles and flow development in a long and high-flux riser. Paper IV goes on to define a novel concept of four longitudinal sections in a HFCFB riser (but not in a HFCFB riser). This concept may be a very useful fundamental aid for industrial modeling of HFCFB risers. Paper V presents some operating experience of a high-flux riser with a novel design in the solids <b>feeding</b> <b>inlet.</b> Paper VI is discussing the particle aggregation in a HFCFB riser. The collected data in papers II to VI are believed to be useful for several industrial applications since not much measured data existed under high-solids fluxes. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the pumping {{direction}} of an axial flow impeller, the feeding rate {{and the number of}} <b>feed</b> <b>inlets</b> on the operation of a continuously-fed stirred tank has been studied using CFD. The flow patterns generated by the up-pumping and down-pumping impeller, under both ‘typical’ and ‘intensified’ operating conditions, are compared. The effect of various tank configurations on the performance of the vessel is assessed by analysing the flow and power numbers, as well as the concentration field of a non-reactive tracer. Furthermore, the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> jets are reduced using traditional jet similarity analysis and are compared with that of a typical round jet. The results show that up-pumping impellers improve circulation in {{the upper part of the}} tank and reduce shortcircuiting of the feed stream with only a small increase in power consumption. Furthermore, by using multiple <b>feed</b> <b>inlets</b> to increase the total throughput capacity, the amplitude of torque fluctuations is decreased and impeller bypassing is also decreased.
