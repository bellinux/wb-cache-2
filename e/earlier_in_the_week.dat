5|$|At 4p.m. PDT on May 22, the European Space Agency and Italian Space Agency {{arranged}} for a call to Endeavour by Pope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by {{the discovery of a}} gash in the Shuttle's fuselage—the Pope extended his blessing to Kelly's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, who had undergone skull surgery <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> The event marked the first time a Pope spoke to astronauts {{during the course of a}} mission.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2008, Fey {{once again}} portrayed Palin, {{this time in}} a sketch {{featuring}} the real John McCain, the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator. In the sketch, McCain poked fun at himself and his campaign, as well as Barack Obama's purchase of airtime on several major networks <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> In the sketch, McCain and Palin can only afford to buy airtime on QVC, a home-shopping channel. McCain's wife, Cindy, also made an appearance in the sketch as herself.|$|E
5|$|Although Irma stayed {{offshore}} the Philippines, moisture {{associated with}} the storm inundated areas already affected by Typhoon Hal <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> The capital city of Manila was 60% flooded, resulting in the evacuation of 40,000. Six drownings were reported in the nearby suburb of Quezon City, where 1,000families were evacuated. Citywide, eight people were killed. In Olongapo City, seven people were buried because of a landslide. Overall, more than 500,000people were directly affected by the typhoon throughout the country. A total of 253homes were destroyed, with 1,854others partially damaged. Nationwide, 65people were killed due to the typhoon and damage totaled $16million (1985USD).|$|E

5|$|Ten {{truckloads of}} bridge {{defenders}} {{were taken to}} jail and an estimated 500people were arrested in the city. Seventeen of the 47 professors at Huế University, who had resigned <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> in protest against the dismissal of the rector Cao Văn Luân, a Catholic priest and opponent of Archbishop Thục (elder brother of Diệm and Nhu) were also arrested. The raids were repeated in cities and towns across the country. The total number of dead and disappeared was never confirmed, but estimates range up to several hundred. At least 1,400 were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} Marlborough {{the rest of}} the van had mixed success. HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still {{suffering}} the effects of their exertions <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of Éole and America respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS Royal Sovereign, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible. In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely, Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.|$|E

5|$|In week six, on Day 39, Big Brother told Siavash and Dogface that, {{because they}} had {{discussed}} nominations <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> they would face eviction if they uttered a single profanity before 3 p.m. They both failed and therefore faced the public vote, along with Karly and Noirin who received the most nominations. The shopping task consisted of nine separate challenges from previous editions of Big Brother, in which housemates had to compete against former contestants (see the week seven shopping task section). The housemates failed to pass the required number of challenges and therefore failed the overall task. On Day 44, five new housemates, Kenneth, Bea, David, Hira and Tom entered the House and Karly became the seventh person to be evicted with 50.4% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Needing a draw at minimum, United {{were in a}} keen {{position}} to win their second-consecutive Challenge Cup. The club closed out their cup run with their third and final match against last-place Toronto FC; who had fallen to both Chicago and Charleston <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> The match started out heavily in favor of United, who scored off a Charlie Davies goal in the ninth minute. The 1–0 lead over the Reds was short-lived, as TFC quickly leveled off of a penalty kick scored by TFC captain, Dwayne De Rosario, leveling the match at one-all. Immediately minutes later, the Reds struck again, taking a 2–1 lead. The lead was Toronto's first in the entire tournament and, ironically, United's first time trailing in a match in the entire tournament.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{recorded}} {{their first}} win {{of the season}} on 9 September, beating newly promoted Charlton Athletic 4–1. Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskjær each scored a brace to overturn the visitor's early lead. The match was marred with demonstrations in and around Old Trafford against the proposed takeover of the club by BSkyB. Obscene chants were directed at chairman Martin Edwards, who had given his support to the merger. A 2–0 victory against Coventry City the following week put United in perfect stead for the clash at home to Barcelona, but a comprehensive defeat to champions Arsenal left the team in 10th position. This was Arsène Wenger's third straight victory over Ferguson (four in all competitions); goals from Tony Adams, Nicolas Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg condemned Manchester United to their heaviest away defeat {{in more than two}} years. To compound the misery midfielder Nicky Butt, who had been sent off in the Champions League match <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> was handed a second red card in the space of four days after a lunge on French international Patrick Vieira. United ended the month with a win, beating rivals Liverpool 2–0 to move into fifth spot.|$|E
40|$|The Swinburne Computer {{has been}} {{predicting}} match winners, margins, odds, and final ladder order since 1981. Although its predictions are published <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> before team selections are made, this paper shows the computer’s performance compares favourably {{with that of}} media experts and the public. This suggests that far from making predictive use of extra information, humans do not individually process correctly the publicly available information. Combining their forecasts may produce better predictions. Evidence suggests the computer’s predictions {{can be used to}} exploit market inefficiencies, not only <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> when prices are first set, but also late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> when prices have adjusted following team selections...|$|R

5|$|November started badly with a 7–0 {{defeat at}} Manchester City {{following}} a 4–0 defeat against Manchester United in the League Cup <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> This heavy defeat following on from {{a run of}} bad form resulted in calls from fans for Chris Hughton to be replaced as manager. Norwich responded to the defeat the following week with a 3–1 comeback win over West Ham United. Gary Hooper's first Premier League goal from the penalty spot marked {{the start of the}} comeback and it was completed with goals from Robert Snodgrass and Leroy Fer. Norwich's poor away form continued after the international break with a 2–1 defeat at Newcastle United which stretched their away record to five defeats out of six matches. The run of injuries continued when Anthony Pilkington was stretchered off with a suspected hamstring injury. The 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace was watched by a record all-seater home attendance at Carrow Road in a match which was Tony Pulis' first game in charge of the visitors.|$|E

One member of the Security Forces sustained injuries in a gun battle with the kidnappers and was transported to a hospital in Beirut.|$|E
