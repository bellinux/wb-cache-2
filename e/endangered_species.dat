5|$|Conservation efforts {{include both}} land and species protection. Approximately 8.95km2 (equal to 3.4% of total land area) divided among 34 {{reserves}} are protected in Puerto Rico. According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 reptiles, and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 reptiles under the Federal <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Act. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 reptiles, 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 <b>endangered</b> <b>species.</b> The DNER follows the IUCN classification scheme for species' priority assignment.|$|E
3000|$|The {{management}} {{of protected areas}} (PAs) is widely used in the conservation of <b>endangered</b> plant <b>species</b> under climate change. However, studies that have identified appropriate PAs for <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> are rare. To address this gap, we must develop a workflow to plan appropriate PAs for <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> that will be further impacted by climate change. Here, we used <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> in China as a case study, and we applied conservation planning software coupled with <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> distribution data and distribution modeling to plan conservation areas with high priority protection needs under climate change. We identified appropriate PAs for <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> under climate change based on the IUCN protected area categories (from Ia to VI) and planned additional PAs for <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species.</b> The high priority regions for protecting the <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> were distributed throughout southern China. With decreasing temperature seasonality, the priority ranking of all <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> is projected to increase in existing PAs. Accordingly, we need to establish conservation areas with low climate vulnerability in existing PAs and expand the conservation areas for <b>endangered</b> fern <b>species</b> in the high priority conservation regions.|$|R

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region.

Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an <b>endangered</b> <b>species.</b> However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
