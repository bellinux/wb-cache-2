5|$|B ^ The <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dog</b> breed {{was renamed}} in the UK by The Kennel Club in 1919 to Alsatian Wolf Dog. During the 1920s, the Wolf Dog {{part of the}} name fell out of use and dogs of this breed were simply known as Alsatians. The name had been reverted in most {{countries}} by 1977 to <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dog.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{more popular}} in American cities in 2008, ranking joint tenth (with American Bulldog) in Detroit and Orlando, ninth in Los Angeles, a joint seventh in Seattle (again, with the American Bulldog), but third in Honolulu, only bested by the Labrador Retriever and the <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dog.</b>|$|E
5|$|Type I is more {{widespread}} in Doberman Pinscher, but is as {{common in the}} Shetland Sheepdog as the Scottish Terrier. The condition appears in most breeds to some extent, but other breeds with an increased risk include the Golden Retriever, <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dog,</b> Basset Hound and Manchester Terrier.|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of serum alpha-tocopherol {{was measured in}} <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs</b> with chronic degenerative radiculomyopathy, and in <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs</b> and dogs of other breeds unaffected by the condition. The mean concentration was significantly higher in <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs</b> with the condition than in other breeds of dog unaffected by it, {{but it was not}} significantly higher than in unaffected <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs.</b> Estimates of components of variance indicated that the concentration varied more widely in individual affected dogs than in unaffected dogs, irrespective of breed. These results suggest that chronic degenerative radiculomyopathy in <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs</b> is unlikely to be due to uncomplicated vitamin E deficiency...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{evolution}} with age of the prostatic dimensions in <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs.</b> For the veterinarians, these results could help to recognize more easily a pathological state of the <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dog’s</b> prostate, only by an ultrasound examination. After examining 22 <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs,</b> for dogs of 2 to 5 years old, we obtained a mean prostatic volume of 16. 239 cmc, for dogs between 6 and 10 years old the mean prostatic volume was 37. 712 cmc and for dogs older than 10 years, the mean prostatic volume was 40. 327 cmc. In conclusion, regarding the results, it can be affirmed that in <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs,</b> prostate dimensions are increasing with age...|$|R
5|$|In {{both the}} United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over {{twice as many}} Labradors {{registered}} as the next most popular breed. If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3–5 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dog</b> and Golden Retriever.|$|E
5|$|The Terrier Group would {{continue}} to win until 1913 when a Bulldog, Ch. Strathtay Prince Albert, won the title. The Terrier Group is the most successful group, with 45 wins out of 103 occasions. The least successful group is the Herding Group, a group which was only comparatively recently created in 1983, with a single win by Ch.

5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>dog</b> who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E

25|$|It was in Continental Europe that {{dogs were}} first {{used on a}} large scale. Police in Paris began using dogs against roaming {{criminal}} gangs at night, {{but it was the}} police department in Ghent, Belgium that introduced the first organized police dog service program in 1899. These methods soon spread to Austria-Hungary and Germany; in the latter the first scientific developments in the field took place with experiments in dog breeding and training. The German police selected the <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dog</b> as the ideal breed for police work and opened up the first dog training school in 1920 in Greenheide. The dogs were systematically trained in obedience to their officers and tracking and attacking criminals.|$|E

40|$|Canine hip {{dysplasia}} (CHD) {{is the most}} common hereditary skeletal disorder in dogs. To identify common alleles associated with CHD, we genotyped 96 <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dogs</b> affected by mild, moderate and severe CHD and 96 breed, sex, age and birth year matched controls using the Affymetrix canine high density SNP chip. A mixed linear model analysis identified five SNPs associated with CHD scores on dog chromosomes (CFA) 19, 24, 26 and 34. These five SNPs were validated in a by sex, age, birth year and coancestry stratified sample of 843 <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dogs</b> including 277 unaffected dogs and 566 CHD-affected dogs. Mean coancestry coefficients among and within cases and controls were < 0. 1 %. Genotype effects of these SNPs explained 20 - 32 % of the phenotypic variance of CHD in <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dogs</b> employed for validation. Genome-wide significance in the validation data set could be shown for each one CHD-associated SNP on CFA 24, 26 and 34. These SNPs are located within or in close proximity of genes involved in bone formation and related through a joint network. The present study validated positional candidate genes within two previously known quantitative trait loci (QTL) and a novel QTL for CHD in <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> <b>Dogs...</b>|$|R

[...] Combat Tracker Teams consisted of one Labrador and four or five men: the handler, an observer, one or two cover men, and the team leader. [...] Labradors were {{selected by}} the military for tracking because of their distinct smelling qualities, and were used to locate wounded US servicemen, enemy patrols, and downed allied airmen in Vietnam.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common acquired canine heart diseases. It is particularly common in large and giant breed dogs. Although a great deal is known about the clinical progression and manifestations of the disease, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. One widely held belief is that calcium-handling abnormalities are critically involved in the disease process. This study investigates the changes in expression of the sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) isoforms in DCM myocardium from <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs.</b> ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Affected tissue samples were obtained from <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs</b> with DCM, euthanized for intractable congestive heart failure while normal myocardial tissue samples were obtained from <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs,</b> euthanized for non-cardiovascular reasons. Tissue microarrays containing normal and DCM myocardium samples were prepared, immunostained with SERCA 1 and SERCA 2 antibodies and analyzed. RESULTS: We were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that while there is little change in the expression of the cardiac isoform (SERCA 2), there is clear expression of the fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform SERCA 1 in the myocardium of dogs diagnosed with DCM. CONCLUSION: We propose that SERCA 1 expression is evidence of a natural adaptive response to the impaired Ca 2 + handling thought to occur in <b>German</b> <b>shepherd</b> <b>dogs</b> with DCM and heart failure...|$|R
