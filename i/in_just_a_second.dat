The markets for {{affected}} stocks and other financial instruments generally swing a lot starting the moment the news comes out and potentially lasting for a few hours. During this time momentum traders try to make money making very rapid trades based on the values of those financial instruments fluctuating wildly. They need lightning fast execution {{to enable them to}} grasp these opportunities; the difference between success or failure may be determined <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> A delay of seconds to minutes, as is common in traditional online trading, would therefore not be acceptable to such traders.|$|E

Our approach treats non-rigid registration as an optimization problem and solves it by alternating between correspondence and deformation optimization.

We iteratively learn an appropriate deformation discretization {{from the current}} set of correspondences {{and use it to}} update the corre- spondences in the next iteration.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years several systems for {{tridimensional}} face reconstruction based on the analysis of 2 D images have been proposed.

In this paper we propose a novel approach for a fast generation of detailed depth-maps of human faces based on a set of three calibrated cameras.

A drawback of field desorption is that it is slow, mainly due to the need of ramping the current to the emitter in order to volatilize and ionize molecules. APPI can ionize both polar and nonpolar species, and an APPI spectrum can be generated <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds.</b> However, APPI ionizes a broad range of compound classes and produces both protonated and molecular ion peaks, resulting in a complex mass spectrum.|$|R
