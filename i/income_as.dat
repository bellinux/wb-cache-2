5|$|Despite {{nationwide}} {{news coverage}} in both {{white and black}} newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion. Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, including children, took on odd jobs to make ends meet.

5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased <b>income.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic developing countries can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E
50|$|Income {{taxes are}} {{generally}} at least somewhat progressive.

Republicans estimate that the real cost of the monarchy, including security and potential income not claimed by the state, such as profits from the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall and rent of Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, is £334 million a year.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 {{after eight years of}} work. It may have taken so long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the Excise, a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable <b>income</b> <b>as</b> well as considerable power of patronage.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{publisher}} Alexander {{was born}} about 1830 {{and came to}} Oregon from Illinois as a pioneer in 1852. Alexander initially worked as a farmer, supplementing his <b>income</b> <b>as</b> a surveyor and local {{justice of the peace}} before learning the printing trade working for the town's earlier pro-Southern newspapers. Although his own venture as a publisher was short and unprofitable, Alexander unwittingly was the scion of a local newspaper dynasty in Oregon, with two of his sons later themselves publishing The Guard (following the tenure of several intermediate owners), while a grandson, George L. Alexander, would one day edit another Oregon paper, the Lebanon Express.|$|E

5|$|From 1916, Nielsen {{taught at}} the Royal Academy where he became {{director}} in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his <b>income.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of his}} teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1806 Jennings {{headed west}} to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an <b>income</b> <b>as</b> a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate on the sale of public lands.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{occupation}} {{came under}} two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US Dollars) {{by the end}} of the war, this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods. Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German <b>income</b> <b>as</b> the war went on.|$|E

5|$|McKinley's good {{standing}} with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions thought he could attract blue-collar voters, and in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff, defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his <b>income</b> <b>as</b> a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II, {{traditional}} Hispanic {{cultural values}} expected {{women to be}} homemakers, thus they rarely left the home to earn an <b>income.</b> <b>As</b> such, women were discouraged from joining the military. Only {{a small number of}} Hispanic women joined the military before World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, women such as Corporal Maria (Torres) Maes could attend to certain administrative duties left open by the men who were reassigned to combat zones. After completing boot camp at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, she was sent to Quartermaster School and assigned to the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Stokesay Castle is a {{fortified}} {{manor house}} in Stokesay, Shropshire, England. It {{was built in}} the late 13th century by Laurence of Ludlow, then the leading wool merchant in England, who intended it to form a secure private house and generate <b>income</b> <b>as</b> a commercial estate. Laurence's descendants continued to own the castle until the 16th century, when it passed through various private owners. By the time of the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1641, Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and a supporter of King Charles I. After the Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle in June and quickly forced its garrison to surrender. Parliament ordered the property to be slighted, but only minor damage was done to the walls, allowing Stokesay to continue {{to be used as a}} house by the Baldwyn family until the end of the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{system was}} {{relatively}} democratic {{for a period}} during which indirect elections were common in democracies. The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom, even after the reforms of 1832. At the time the only nations not requiring a minimum level of <b>income</b> <b>as</b> a qualification for voting were France and Switzerland where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no European country at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that any employed male citizen could qualify to vote. As an illustration, the lowest paid civil employee in 1876 was a janitor who earned Rs600$000 annually.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his <b>income</b> <b>as</b> a supervisor.

Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front of}} 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{was born}} in the Lying-In Hospital at 307 Second Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family. He was the first of two {{children}} of Jacob Leonard Kubrick (May 21, 1902– October 19, 1985), known as Jack or Jacques, and his wife Sadie Gertrude Kubrick (née Perveler; October 28, 1903– April 23, 1985), known as Gert. His sister, Barbara Mary Kubrick, {{was born in}} May 1934. Jack Kubrick, whose parents and paternal grandparents were of Polish Jewish, Austrian Jewish, and Romanian Jewish origin, was a doctor, graduating from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1927, the same year he married Kubrick's mother, the child of Austrian Jewish immigrants. Kubrick's great-grandfather, Hersh Kubrick (also spelled Kubrik or Kubrike), arrived at Ellis Island via Liverpool by ship on December 27, 1899, at the age of 47, leaving behind his wife and two grown children, one of whom was Stanley's grandfather Elias, {{to start a new life}} with a younger woman. Elias Kubrick followed in 1902. At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in the Bronx. Although his parents had been married in a Jewish ceremony, Kubrick did not have a religious upbringing, and would later profess an atheistic view of the universe. By the district standards of the West Bronx, the family was fairly wealthy, his father earning a good <b>income</b> <b>as</b> a physician.|$|E
