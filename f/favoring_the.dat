5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> New Court and Whigs <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> Old Court.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E

5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|By September 25, 24 {{exhibition}} {{games were}} canceled and training camps were postponed indefinitely {{as a result}} of stalled talks.

It {{was the first time in}} NBA history that games were canceled due to a labor dispute. On October 20, arbitrator John Feerick ruled that the owners did not have to pay players with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. Feerick's decision gave the owners leverage in bargaining talks. Another factor <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> owners was that their teams received money from the NBA's television broadcasters, whose contracts with the league called for payments to be made if games were not played.|$|E

5|$|In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the Kuomintang, {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E

5|$|The oldest fossils {{that fall}} {{within the range of}} the modern coyote date to 0.74–0.85 Ma (million years) in Hamilton Cave, West Virginia; 0.73 Ma in Irvington, California; 0.35–0.48 Ma in Porcupine Cave, Colorado and in Cumberland Cave, Pennsylvania. Modern coyotes arose 1,000 years after the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts, Pleistocene coyotes (C.l. orcutti) were larger and more robust, likely in response to larger competitors and prey. Pleistocene coyotes were likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants, as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat, showing fewer grinding surfaces suited for processing vegetation. Their reduction in size occurred within 1000 years of the Quaternary extinction event, when their large prey died out. Furthermore, Pleistocene coyotes were unable to exploit the big-game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf (C.dirus), as it was rapidly filled by gray wolves, which likely actively killed off the large coyotes, with natural selection <b>favoring</b> <b>the</b> modern gracile morph.|$|E

With Jay Cutler still out, Josh McCown continued to play as quarterback for the Bears, who had the eighth-best passing offense in the league with 261.7 yards per game, which competed against the Ravens' 18th-ranked pass defense. On the ground, the Ravens had the tenth-best rushing D with 102.6 rushing yards allowed per game, but offensively, had the 30th-ranked rushing offense, averaging just 73.1 yards per game, going against Chicago's defense which allowed 129.4 rushing yards per game.
