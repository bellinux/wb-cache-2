The other way is a window/wind-wing combo, using a wind-wing from a 65 Mustang in combination with a 1966 Ford LTD door glass and a regulator from a VW Karman Ghia.

50|$|Single-point locking {{may provide}} {{adequate}} security for some situations on tiered lockers, as the <b>doors</b> are <b>shorter,</b> {{and therefore more}} difficult to force open; however, the taller doors of full length lockers and cabinets {{are more susceptible to}} the application of leverage.
