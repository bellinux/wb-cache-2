5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an <b>insinuation</b> that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
5|$|Most mythological {{elements}} in Carnivàle relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures of Light and Darkness), fictional human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond <b>insinuation,</b> {{and makes the}} nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf {{did not respond to}} questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carnivàles first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon the assumed mythological rules.|$|E

They soon face public accusations of having a lesbian relationship.|$|E
25|$|The outcry that {{immediately}} followed Haig's <b>insinuation</b> {{prompted him to}} emphatically withdraw his speculative suggestions {{the very next day}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

25|$|In 1960, Connor {{was elected}} Democratic National Committeeman for Alabama, soon after filing {{a civil lawsuit}} against The New York Times for $1.5 million. He objected to what he claimed was their <b>insinuation</b> that he had {{promoted}} racial hatred. He dropped his claim for damages to $400,000; the case dragged on for six years until Connor lost a $40,000 judgment on appeal.|$|E
50|$|In Space and Place : The Perspective of Experience, Tuan {{contends that}} a space {{requires}} a movement {{from a place}} to another place. Similarly, a place requires a space to be a place. Hence, the two notions are co-dependent. He also relates space to having temporal <b>insinuations</b> and place as having physical <b>insinuations</b> which further clarifies the difference and codependency of the two concepts.|$|R

25|$|An inquiry by the Competition Commission – the country’s anti-trust regulator, has {{indicated}} that a difference in performance between foreign and local business owners has created a perception that foreigners are more successful than locals.

25|$|In most cultures, effeminacy is {{traditionally}} considered a vice or a weakness indicative of other negative character traits and often involving a negative <b>insinuation</b> of homosexual tendencies. The {{definition of what}} constitutes effeminate behavior varies greatly depending on {{the social and cultural}} context, {{as well as on the}} time period. While some effeminate behavior evokes stereotypical impressions of homosexuality in some people, others may simply view the behavior as unmanly without questioning the sexual orientation of the person in question.|$|E
25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{choose to}} use {{indirect}} methodologies to further their goals, rather than wield overt power themselves. They have noted the Taoist principle that whatever rises must fall; and so rather than taking direct control of the human race, they instead manipulate {{the social and political}} order with subtlety and <b>insinuation,</b> often using extraordinarily long-term stratagems spanning generations. The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing too rich or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for {{the rise and fall of}} governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash. To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee.|$|E

25|$|My {{attention}} has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour through England. I wish to state {{on behalf of the}} Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any <b>insinuation</b> of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness {{both on and off the}} field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their ability and integrity.|$|E

25|$|Since the 18th century, {{the civic}} {{dimension}} of gender identity has been eclipsed by the sexual dimension of gender identity, and, today, effeminacy {{has often been}} considered a vice, indicative of other negative character traits and often involving a pejorative <b>insinuation</b> of homosexual tendencies in boys or men. In other societies, by contrast, effeminate boys or men may be considered a distinct human gender (third gender), and may have a special social function, {{as is the case}} of Two-Spirits in some Native American groups. Furthermore, some see effeminacy to be a characteristic or trait, part of a particular person's gender role and in this sense would not be considered a vice or indicative of any other characteristics. An effeminate boy or man is similar to a fop or a dandy, though these tend to be archaic identities that are taken on by the individual rather than insulting labels.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, when Maryland {{basketball}} star Len Bias suffered a drug overdose, it sent a ripple-effect through the athletic department.

500|$|Singapore's {{response}} {{was that it}} did not have copies of the letters. Its archives were incomplete, and searches for them in other archives had been in vain. Furthermore, the letters {{were more likely to be}} in Malaysia's possession as the Governor had sent them to the Johor rulers. In his rebuttal of Malaysia's case on 19 November 2007, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar expressed disappointment with Malaysia's <b>insinuation</b> that Singapore had concealed the letters from the Court, which he termed [...] "most disturbing", [...] "baseless" [...] and [...] "distracting".|$|E
500|$|Although {{almost every}} Carnivàle episode has a {{distinctive}} {{story with a}} new carnival setting, all episodes {{are part of an}} overarching good-versus-evil story that only culminates and resolves very late in Season 2. The pilot episode begins with a prologue talking of [...] "a creature of light and a creature of darkness" [...] (also known as Avatars) being born [...] "to each generation" [...] preparing for a final battle. Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond <b>insinuation,</b> and makes the nature of suggested Avatars a central question. Reviewers believed Ben to be a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness.|$|E

500|$|Shand {{had nearly}} reduced Johnson to tears, having {{previously}} caused a senior police officer to cry during the hearing of a royal commission the year before. A colleague of Shand's recalled his [...] "capacity of <b>insinuation</b> in tone which could annoy {{and bring a}} witness into antagonism". Shand then asked Johnson about a hypothetical case of Barnes being selected in the future. Johnson evaded the matter of whether he would select the player until Shand asked him to assume that [...] "Barnes {{is in the best}} possible form and he is the best cricketer in Australia", to which Johnson replied that he would not.|$|E
500|$|Kantrowitz deemed Tillman [...] "the Senate's wild man", {{who applied}} the same {{techniques}} of accusation and <b>insinuation</b> that had {{served him well}} in South Carolina. In 1897, Tillman accused the Republicans, [...] "I certainly {{do not want to}} attack any member of the committee who does not deserve to be attacked [...] nobody denies that there have been rooms occupied for two months by the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee at the Arlington Hotel... in easy reach of the sugar trust". Simkins, though, opined that Tillman's speeches in the Senate were only inflammatory because of his injection of personalities, and if that is disregarded, his speeches, when read, come across as well-reasoned and even conservative.|$|E
500|$|When hunting other jumping spiders {{and when}} the {{background}} matches its coloration, Phaeacius uses [...] "insinuation", in which it waits, sometimes up to an hour, while a jumping spider moves around nearby, and then Phaeacius suddenly turns up to 180° toward the prey and then resumes the flattened pose. Phaeacius then moves a few millimetres toward the prey and resumes the flattened pose. If the prey moves away, Phaeacius continues the <b>insinuation</b> manoeuvre, but if the prey moves toward it, Phaeacius lunges. Other jumping spiders show no awareness of a flattened Phaeacius on a matching background, and apparently survive by luck. When the background does not matches Phaeacius′ coloration, other jumping spiders recognise Phaeacius as a threat.|$|E
