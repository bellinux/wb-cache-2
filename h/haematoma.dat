5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a <b>haematoma</b> around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural <b>haematoma</b> is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E

Despite advances in obstetric care, practice and technique, vulvo-vaginal <b>haematomas</b> do occur especially in complicated vaginal deliveries.

2500|$|During this period, {{like most}} amateur triathletes, {{she had also}} {{continued}} entering running races. She had previously run the London Marathon for charity in 2002, finishing in 3:08:17, making her the fastest woman from her running club in that race. That result prompted her to get a running coach, Frank Horwill – whom she regarded as [...] "legendary and ever inspiring" [...] – and to take her running training much more seriously. She had hoped to improve her marathon time in the April 2003 London Marathon, but in March she collided with a car while riding her commuter bike in Clapham. The accident resulted in a <b>haematoma</b> in her left thigh, causing – in an example of myositis ossificans – a 5cm spur of bone to grow from her femur. Unable to run the marathon, she took up swimming again, leading her to try triathlon racing in 2004. After her ITU victory, she took up cross-country racing for the first time, {{as a means of}} building strength for her triathlon races. She enjoyed some success in B and C grade cross-country events around London, winning several races including the South of Thames Championship in December 2006.|$|E

Two eight-‎electrode layouts, a standard ring full array (FA) and a semi-array (SA), were investigated for their ability to ‎detect, localise and quantify simulated intracranial <b>haematomas</b> in vitro on ovine models for the purpose of ‎early diagnosis. SA layout speeds up electrode application and avoids the need to move and lift the patient's ‎head. <b>Haematomas</b> were simulated using gel samples with the same conductivity as blood. Both layouts, FA ‎and SA, could detect the presence of <b>haematomas</b> at any location within the skull. The mean of the relative ‎radial position error with respect to the brain radius was 7 % for FA and 6 % for SA, for <b>haematomas</b> close to the ‎electrodes, and 11 % for SA for <b>haematomas</b> far from the electrodes {{at the back of the}} head. Size estimation ‎was not as good; the worst size estimation error for FA being around 30 % while the best for SA was 50 % for ‎simulated <b>haematomas</b> close to the electrodes. ...|$|R

30|$|Screw {{loosening}} is a {{very important}} finding in 13 patients (56.5  %) in this series. We assume that slowly progressing loosening of screws causes repeated micro-fractures in pedicles and endplates.

Subsequent infection of these <b>haematomas</b> in previously infected and operated spinal region is likely to occur, especially in multi-morbid patients with poor general condition.|$|R

The definitive version is available at: [URL] evaluation of a portable digital electrical impedance tomography system to detect <b>haematomas</b> using phantom and sheep models is presented. Experiments have been performed using 8 -electrode full array configuration. Conductivity changes were detected in phantom model while anomalies were placed at center {{and close to the}} edge of the tank. Bleeding rate was successfully monitored in sheep model while blood-like conductivity solution was injecting via the brainstem. EIT images were reconstructed sequentially for different injection volumes and the quantity index (QI) was calculated as a function of the injected solution volume. The results show a linear relationship of QI to the injected volume. Images of the sheep experiment with the simulated <b>haematomas,</b> blood-like conductivity gel, placed on top of the parietal lobes of the brain on the left and right sides were reconstructed and <b>haematomas</b> are clearly detected and localized.

40|$|Our aim was {{to perform}} a {{systematic}} {{review of the literature}} to assess the incidence of post-operative epidural <b>haematomas</b> and wound infections after one-, or two-level, non-complex, lumbar surgery for degenerative disease in patients with, or without post-operative wound drainage. Studies were identified from PubMed and EMBASE, up to and including 27 August 2015, for papers describing one- or two-level lumbar discectomy and/or laminectomy for degenerative disease in adults which reported any form of subcutaneous or subfascial drainage. Eight papers describing 1333 patients were included. Clinically relevant post-operative epidural <b>haematomas</b> occurred in two (0. 15 %), and wound infections in ten (0. 75 %) patients. Epidural <b>haematomas</b> occurred in two (0. 47 %) patients who had wound drainage (n = 423) and in none of those without wound drainage (n = 910). Wound infections occurred in two (0. 47 %) patients with wound drainage and in eight (0. 88 %) patients without wound drainage. These data suggest that the routine use of a wound drain in non-complex lumbar surgery does not prevent post-operative epidural <b>haematomas</b> and that the absence of a drain does not lead to a significant change in the incidence of wound infection.
