40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-quantitative mathematical {{model of the}} changes over time in the statistical distribution of well-being of individuals in a society. The model predicts that when individuals overvalue the more socially conspicuous aspects of well-being in their lifestyle choices, then the average well-being of the overall population may experience continuous decline. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade-off</b> cost and overvaluation, we identify statistical variation in individuals' well-being and turnover within the population as key factors driving negative trends. We investigate {{the influence of the}} effects of heterogeneity in the population, as well as economic and/or technological progress. Comment: 20 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

40|$|Trade-offs {{is one of}} {{important}} elements for engineering design problems characterized by multiple conflicting design objectives to be simultaneously improved. In many design problems such as aerodynamic design, due to computational reasons, {{only a limited number}} of evaluations can be allowed for industrial use.

40|$|Uncertainty in the {{parameters}} of an optimization problem has a large impact {{on the outcome of}} the optimization results. Intuitionistic fuzzy chance constrained programming (IFCCP) is one technique used to handle optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problems. This technique assumes uncertain parameters as intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, which is a super set of conventional fuzzy numbers. With the assumption of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, different degrees of risk can be modeled considering different viewpoints, e. g., optimistic, pessimistic, and mixed approaches. This generic concept of IFCCP has been applied on two different multiobjective optimization problems: the Binh korn test function, where uncertain parameters are linearly related, and a real life case study of an industrial grinding process, in which uncertain parameters are nonlinearly related. The proposed approach is generic and can be applied to any OUU problem. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the <b>trade-off</b> between solution optimality and quality, sensitivity analysis has also been carried out...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the fundamental trade-offs in engineering the mobility, current saturation and ON- OFF ratios in graphene transistors. Surprisingly, the trade-offs arise solely from an asymptotic constraint {{on the high}} energy bandstructure and independent of scattering processes. This places graphite derivatives (bulk monolayer graphene, uniaxially strained graphene nanoribbons, carbon nanotubes and bilayer graphene) on the same 3 -parameter mobility-bandgap-scattering length (μ - Egap -λ) plot, proximal <b>to</b> other semiconductors. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> this low-bias <b>trade-off,</b> the high bias current bears signatures of the underlying saturation mechanism, arising through phonon scattering or Γ-point suppressed density of states opening bandgap...|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> {{the general}} <b>trade-off,</b> another {{important}} factor is standardization. Once a standard has been chosen, and equipment, infrastructure, and training calibrated to that standard, conversion becomes difficult and expensive. This {{also makes it}} easier to adopt an existing standard than to invent a new one. This is true of many technologies, including railroad gauges. For rail gauge in particular, break-of-gauge often causes inefficiency far in excess of the merits of any particular gauge. The reduced cost, greater efficiency, and greater economic opportunity offered by the use of a common standard explains why a small number of gauges predominate worldwide.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of endogenous competitiveness on multinational activity. Competitiveness is endogenized by assuming that firms differ on R&D commitment power, i. e. : some firms are leaders in R&D. We show that firms with higher commitment power tend to invest more in R&D and consequently {{also tend to be}} more competitive than rivals that lack such capability. As a result, firms with higher commitment power have higher propensity to become multinationals than firms with lower commitment power. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> the former use the R&D leader advantage to compel the latter to not enter the market or, in case of entry, to force them to adopt the domestic strategy.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{collective}} rights organizations (CROs) on upstream innovation. CROs are established to facilitate downstream use, such as production and downstream innovation, of upstream intellectual property. We compare CROs with two alternative royalty redistribution rules, two different upstream innovation environments and two different anti-trust rules. Most CROs increase upstream R&D incentives by increasing licensing profit but this may lead to over-investment. We observe that when the market is ex-ante asymmetric (only one firm has ability to develop one of the technologies), unequal royalty distribution in favor of the one firm may be ex-post efficient but may result in under investment in the complementary technology. Thus <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> balancing the <b>trade-off</b> between ex-ante (dynamic) efficiency and ex-post (static) efficiency {{as in the case of}} a single intellectual property, CROs must achieve the balance among members.

40|$|Natural {{selection}} optimizes an organism's genotype {{within the}} context of its environment. Adaptations to one environment can decrease fitness in another, revealing evolutionary trade-offs. Here, we show that the cost of gene expression underlies a trade-off between growth rate and mating efficiency in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During asexual growth, mutations that eliminate the ability to mate provide an ≈ 2 % per-generation growth-rate advantage. Some strains, including most laboratory strains, carry an allele of GPA 1 (an upstream component of the mating pathway) that increases mating efficiency by ≈ 30 % per round of mating at the cost of an ≈ 1 % per-generation growth-rate disadvantage. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> demonstrating a <b>trade-off</b> between growth rate and mating efficiency, our results illustrate differences in the selective pressures defining fitness in the laboratory versus the natural environment and show that selection, acting on the cost of gene expression, can optimize expression levels and promote gene loss...|$|R
40|$|The set of {{orthogonal}} eigen-vectors built via {{principal component}} analysis (PCA), while very effective for compression, can often lead to loss of crucial discriminative information in signals. In this work, we build a new basis set using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target images via non-negative matrix approximations (NNMAs). Owing to the underlying physics, we expect a non-negative basis and an accompanying non-negative coefficient set {{to be a more}} accurate generative model for SAR profiles than the PCA basis which lacks direct physical interpretation. The NNMA basis vectors while not orthogonal capture discriminative local components of SAR target images. We test the merits of the NNMA basis representation for the problem of automatic target recognition using SAR images with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments on the benchmark MSTAR database reveal the merits of basis selection techniques that can model imaging physics more closely and can capture inter-class variability, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> identifying a <b>trade-off</b> between classification performance and availability of training...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{streaming}} applications use reliable transport protocols such as TCP to deliver content over the Internet. However, head-of-line blocking due to packet loss recovery can often result in unwanted behavior and poor application layer performance. Transport layer coding can help mitigate this issue by helping to recover from lost packets without waiting for retransmissions. We consider {{the use of an}} on-line network code that inserts coded packets at strategic locations within the underlying packet stream. If retransmissions are necessary, additional coding packets are transmitted to ensure the receiver's ability to decode. An analysis of this scheme is provided that helps determine both the expected in-order packet delivery delay and its variance. Numerical results are then used to determine when and how many coded packets should be inserted into the packet stream, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> determining the <b>trade-offs</b> between reducing the in-order delay and the achievable rate. The analytical results are finally compared with experimental results to provide insight into how to minimize the delay of existing transport layer protocols...|$|R
30|$|The {{demand for}} low-power, high-speed, and {{high-density}} non-volatile memory devices has increased drastically {{over the past}} decade due to the growing market of consumer electronics. However, current flash memory devices are expected to face two major challenges in the near future: density and voltage scaling. The density of the memory is related to the gate length scaling which is constrained by the gate stack, precisely, the tunnel oxide thickness. In fact, the gate length is required to be adequate with the gate stack in order to maintain a good gate control and to avoid short channel effects. However, in conventional flash memories, the tunnel oxide thickness has a lower limit of 6 – 8 nm (depending on NOR or NAND structure) in order to avoid back-tunneling and thus leakage of charges which destroys the necessary retention characteristic of the memory (> 10 years). The second problem which needs to be solved is the high program and erase operating voltages. Once again, the limitation to operating voltage scaling is the inability to reduce gate stack thickness. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the <b>trade-off</b> relationship between tunnel oxide thickness and retention characteristic of the memory where the retention of charges is exponentially degraded as the tunnel oxide thickness is scaled down, there exists another trade-off relationship between the tunnel oxide thickness and the resulting program time, where a thicker tunnel oxide causes the extension of the time needed for the charges to be transported from the channel to the charge trapping layer and vice-versa. Therefore, it is imperative to find novel structures and materials to be incorporated in the memory cells which would allow tunnel oxide and voltage scaling.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of a templated C++ class for vectors. The vector class is templated both for vector length and vector component type; the vector length is fixed at template instantiation time. The vector implementation is such that for a vector of N components of type T, {{the total number of}} bytes required by the vector is equal to N * size of (T), where size of is the built-in C operator. The property of having a size no bigger than that required by the components themselves is key in many numerical computing applications, where one may allocate very large arrays of small, fixed-length vectors. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the design <b>trade-offs</b> motivating our fixed-length vector design choice, we review some of the C++ template features essential to an efficient, succinct implementation.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the modem dynamic computing systems has motivated software engineering researchers to explore new sources of inspiration for equipping such systems with autonomic behaviours. Self-awareness has recently gained considerable attention as a prominent property for enriching the self-adaptation capabilities in systems operating in dynamic, heterogeneous and open environments. This thesis investigates the role of knowledge and its dynamic management in realising various levels of self-awareness for enabling self­adaptivity with different capabilities and strengths. The thesis develops a novel multi-level dynamic knowledge management approach for managing and representing the evolving knowledge. The approach is able to acquire 'richer' knowledge about the system's internal state and its environment <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> managing the <b>trade-offs</b> arising from the adaptation conflicting goals.

40|$|The {{pressure}} assisted osmosis (PAO) {{process has}} been recently considered as a new strategy to enhance water flux and to limit reverse salt transport (RST), hereby overcoming two critical limitations of forward osmosis (FO) operation {{through the use of}} additional pressure on the feed side. With the aim to achieve higher (economically sustainable) fluxes, the use of commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membranes under PAO operating conditions is considered {{for the first time in}} this study. When operated under PAO mode, the tested commercial NF membranes clearly outperform the state of the art FO membrane with fluxes up to 36 L m− 2 h− 1 and RST below 0. 01 g L− 1, demonstrating the relative potential of PAO-NF. For flat sheet NF membrane osmotic contribution was minimal due to intense internal concentration polarisation. However, the tested hollow fiber NF membrane allowed for low internal concentration polarisation and exhibited significant flux even in FO operation. However, transmission of salts from feed to draw solutions (forward salt transport, FST) also occurred and was observed to be linearly proportional with the NF top layer rejection. Therefore, it is an important parameter to consider in the membrane selection <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the <b>trade-off</b> between large flux and low RST. The PAO-NF concept also proved to be more efficient in terms of water flux than direct NF operation, owing to a small but significant contribution of osmotic pressure. A modelling study demonstrated that further flux enhancement could be obtained through modification of NF membranes support layer to improve the osmotic contribution. These encouraging initial results warrant the need for a more detailed assessment of the long-term operation and energy requirement of the PAO-NF concept for a range of industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Large {{traders in}} {{financial}} markets care {{a lot about}} the supply of liquidity - factors that allow them to trade quickly without incurring a significant cost - since the size of their trading can cause a large market impact if they demand more liquidity than is currently available. The first study examines an important and recurring cause of liquidity shocks in futures markets - the accumulation of extreme and opposing positions by hedgers and speculators. These two classes of traders are found to differ in the impact their trades have on market prices and their response to market-relevant news and past returns. As their positions diverge sufficiently, these differences affect the number and heterogeneity of available counterparties, and can cause increased volatility, high bid-ask spreads, and return regularities. The second study examines the limits of anonymity available <b>to</b> largeblock traders. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> the <b>trade-off</b> between price risk and price impact that block-traders face, this paper introduces an additional, strategic, consideration: by trading with large volume for several periods, block traders risk losing their anonymity and attracting opportunistic strategic traders who want to `ride 2 ̆ 7 the block traders 2 ̆ 7 market impact. In simulated markets, block traders lose their anonymity under several parameter configurations and strategic traders are able to profitably exploit the knowledge of their presence.

40|$|Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) {{should be}} able to produce an optimal level of bundle of Ecosystem Services (ES), thus {{ensuring}} more resilient forest ecosystems also creating benefits for local population and human well-being. Yet, choosing between alternative forest management practices is not straightforward as it necessarily involves ES trade-offs. Forest management decisions have to reconcile the socio-economic and ecological contributions of forest ecosystems by fostering a synergistic relation between multiple ES while lowering ES trade-offs. The aim of the study is to analyze different forest management practices (selective and traditional thinning) in black pine peri-urban forest in Central Italy, by investigating their contribution in terms of provisioning (wood production), cultural (recreational benefits), regulating (climate change mitigation) ES. For each management option was performed: (1) the biophysical assessment of selected ES by using primary data and calculating indicators for wood production with special regard to biomass for energy use (living trees and deadwood volume harvested), recreational benefits (tourists’ preferences for each forest management practice), climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration in above-ground and below-ground biomass), and (2) the economic valuation of wood production, recreational benefits and climate change mitigation ES using direct and indirect methods (environmental evaluation techniques). The results show that the effects of the selective thinning on ES is higher that the effects of the traditional thinning. The economic value of the three ES provided by traditional and selective thinning are respectively: bioenergy production 154. 2 € ha - 1 yr - 1 and 223. 3 € ha - 1 yr - 1; recreational benefits 193. 2 € ha - 1 yr - 1 and 231. 9 € ha - 1 yr - 1; carbon sequestration 29. 0 € ha - 1 yr - 1 and 36. 2 € ha - 1 yr - 1.

40|$|Ultrafast (< 1 ps-long pulses) cathodes with {{spatially}} structured emission are an {{enabling technology}} for exciting {{applications such as}} free-electron lasers, tabletop coherent x-ray sources, and ultrafast imaging. In this thesis, we explore the scaling down and multiplexing limits of ultrafast photon-triggered field emission cathodes composed of arrays of nano-sharp high-aspect-ratio silicon pillars. We are interested in exploring how the geometry of the array and the morphology of the pillars affect the emission of the electrons. Both the multi-photon regime and the strong-field tunneling regime of the emission process were studied using near-IR pulses at various pulse energies. We model the structure using 2 D and 3 D COMSOL Multiphysics, collect the charge-energy characteristics of the actual devices, compare and interpret the results from both simulations and experiments. We find that the field factor is a strictly increasing function of the pitch at the fixed height, and the field factor saturates when the pitch is very large. The field factor is also strictly increasing {{with respect to the}} height with a diminishing return. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> due <b>to</b> the <b>trade-off</b> between the field factor and the pitch scaling, there exists an optimum pitch at 2. 5 [mu]m, which yields the highest emission of electrons. This work also confirms earlier work by the group on the emission characteristics and polarization dependence: at low pulse energy, the emission is in the multiphoton regime and has an sin² ([theta]) dependence on the polarization; at high pulse energy, the emission is in the strong-field tunneling regime and has an sin²([theta]) dependence on the polarization. by Chen Dan Dong.

40|$|Abstract: Resource-constrained project {{scheduling}} involves the scheduling of project activities subject to precedence and resource constraints {{in order to}} meet the objective(s) in the best possible way. The area covers a wide variety of problem types. The objective of this paper is to provide a survey of what we believe are important recent in the area. Our main focus will be on the recent progress made in and the encouraging computational experience gained with the use of optimal solution procedures for the basic resource-constrained {{project scheduling}} problem (RCPSP) and important extensions. The RCPSP involves the scheduling of a project its duration subject to zero-lag finish-start precedence constraints of the PERT/CPM type and constant availability constraints on the required set of renewable resources. We discuss recent striking advances in dealing with this problem using a new depth-first branch-and-bound procedure, elaborating on the effective and efficient branching scheme, bounding calculations and dominance rules, and discuss the potential of using truncated branch-and-bound. We derive a set of conclusions from the research on optimal solution procedures for the basis RCPSP and subsequently illustrate how effective and efficient branching rules and several of the strong dominance and bounding arguments can be extended to a rich and realistic variety of related problems. The preemptive resource-constrained project scheduling problem (PRCPSP) relaxes the nonpreemption condition of the RCPSP, thus allowing activities to be interrupted at integer points in time and resumed later without additional penalty cost. The generalized resource-constrained project scheduling (GRCPSP) extends the RCPSP to the case of precedence diagramming type of precedence constraints (minimal finish-start, start-start, start-finish, finish-finish precedence relations), activity ready times, deadlines and variable resource availability's. The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with generalized precedence relations (RCPSP-GPR) allows for start-start, finish-start and finish-finish constraints with minimal and maximal time lags. The MAX-NPV problem aims at scheduling project activities in order to maximize the net present value of the project in the absence of resource constraints. The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows (RCPSP-DC) aims at the same non-regular objective in the presence of resource constraints. The resource availability cost problem (RACP) aims at determining the cheapest resource availability amounts for which a feasible solution exists that does not violate the project deadline. In the discrete time/cost trade-off problem (DTCTP) the duration of an activity is a discrete, non-increasing function of the amount of a single nonrenewable resource committed to it. In the discrete time/resource trade-off problem (DTRTP) the duration of an activity is a discrete, non-increasing function of the amount of a single renewable resource. Each activity must then be scheduled in one of its possible execution modes. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> time/resource <b>trade-offs,</b> the multi-mode project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) allows for resource/resource trade-offs and constraints on renewable, nonrenewable and doubly-constrained resources.
