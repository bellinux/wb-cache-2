5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal <b>hyperthyroidism</b> (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical <b>hyperthyroidism</b> (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of <b>hyperthyroidism</b> or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with <b>hyperthyroidism</b> and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E
5|$|After women give birth, about 5% develop {{postpartum}} thyroiditis {{which can}} occur up {{to nine months}} afterwards. This {{is characterized by a}} short period of <b>hyperthyroidism</b> followed by a period of hypothyroidism; 20–40% remain permanently hypothyroid.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its role}} in facilitating iron uptake, copper {{deficiency}} can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of the hypokalemia, {{followed}} by correction of the <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> leads to complete {{resolution of the}} attacks. It occurs predominantly in males of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent. TPP {{is one of several}} conditions that can cause periodic paralysis.|$|E
5|$|After iodine {{fortification}} {{programs such}} as iodisation of salt have been implemented, some cases of iodine-induced <b>hyperthyroidism</b> have been observed (so-called Jod-Basedow phenomenon). The condition seems to occur mainly in people over forty, and the risk appears higher when iodine deficiency is severe and the initial rise in iodine intake is high.|$|E
5|$|For TSH, basal {{measurements}} are usually sufficient, {{as well as}} measurements of thyroxine {{to ensure that the}} pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to <b>hyperthyroidism</b> (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. Prolactin can be measured by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} periodic paralysis (especially hypokalemic periodic paralysis) with thyroid function tests on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of <b>hyperthyroidism.</b>|$|E
5|$|TPP occurs {{predominantly}} {{in males}} of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent, {{as well as}} Thais, with much lower rates in people of other ethnicities. In Chinese and Japanese people with <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> 1.8–1.9% experience TPP. This {{is in contrast to}} North America, where studies report a rate of 0.1–0.2%. Native Americans, who share a genetic background with East Asians, are at an increased risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis, toxic nodular goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced <b>hyperthyroidism.</b>|$|E
5|$|There may be {{symptoms}} of thyroid overactivity, such as weight loss, a fast heart rate, tremor, and perspiration; but such symptoms occur in {{only half of}} all cases. The {{most common type of}} <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> Graves' disease, may additionally cause eye problems (Graves' ophthalmopathy) and skin changes of the legs (pretibial myxedema). Thyroid disease may also cause muscle weakness in the form of thyrotoxic myopathy, but this is constant rather than episodic.|$|E
5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring attacks of muscle weakness {{in the presence of}} <b>hyperthyroidism</b> (overactivity of the thyroid gland). Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of <b>hyperthyroidism.</b> In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause <b>hyperthyroidism.</b> Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E
5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} cretinism, myxoedema {{their relationship}} with the thyroid in the nineteenth century. Charles Mayo coined the term <b>hyperthyroidism</b> in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, and autoantibodies were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Domery's {{appetite}} is not known. While {{there are other}} documented cases of similar behaviour from this period none of the subjects other than Domery's contemporary Tarrare were autopsied, {{and there have been}} no modern documented cases of polyphagia (excessive appetite) as extreme as Domery. <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> can induce an extreme appetite and rapid weight loss, while Bondeson(2006) speculates that Domery possibly suffered from a damaged amygdala or ventromedial nucleus; it is known that injuries to the amygdala or ventromedial nucleus in animals can induce polyphagia.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Tarrare's {{behaviour}} is not known. While {{there are other}} documented cases of similar behaviour from the period, none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied {{and there have been}} no modern documented cases resembling Tarrare. <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> can induce an extreme appetite, rapid weight loss, profuse sweating, heat intolerance, and fine hair. Bondeson (2006) speculates that Tarrare suffered from a damaged amygdala; it is known that injuries to the amygdala in animals can induce polyphagia.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an autoimmune disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an autoimmune disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing <b>hyperthyroidism.</b> When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that the enzyme becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The enzyme activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, the enzyme activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of <b>hyperthyroidism</b> may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while <b>hyperthyroidism</b> (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} and {{diseases of the}} thyroid have been noted and treated for thousands of years, although the gland itself has only been described and named since the renaissance. The first recorded mention of the thyroid {{is in terms of}} goitre in Chinese texts circa 2700 BCE, of which there is general agreement. In 1600 BCE burnt sponge and seaweed were used within China for the treatment of goitres, a practice which has developed {{in many parts of the}} world. In Ayurvedic medicine, the book Sushruta Samhita written about 1400 BCE describes <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> hypothyroidism and goitre. Aristotle and Xenophon in the fifth century BCE describe cases of Grave's disease, which receives its name over two millennia later owing to descriptions provided by Robert James Graves in 1834, Hippocrates and Plato in the fourth century BCE provided some of the first descriptions of the gland itself, proposing its function as a salivary gland. Pliny the Elder in the first century BCE referred to epidemics of goitre in the Alps and proposed treatment with burnt seaweed, a practice also referred to by Galen in the second century, referred to burnt sponge for the treatment of goitre.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of <b>hyperthyroidism</b> {{typically}} {{leads to}} improvement in {{cognitive and behavioral}} impairments. Agitation, inattention, and frontal lobe impairment may improve more rapidly than other cognitive functions. However, several studies confirm that a substantial proportion of patients with <b>hyperthyroidism</b> have psychiatric disorders or mental symptoms and decreased quality of life even after successful treatment of their <b>hyperthyroidism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another sign of Graves' {{disease is}} <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> i.e., {{overproduction}} of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though {{it is not}} the cause of the Graves' disease). <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.|$|E
25|$|Major uses of 131I {{include the}} {{treatment}} of thyrotoxicosis (<b>hyperthyroidism)</b> and some types of thyroid cancer that absorb iodine. The 131I is thus used as direct radioisotope therapy to treat <b>hyperthyroidism</b> due to Graves' disease, and sometimes hyperactive thyroid nodules (abnormally active thyroid tissue that is not malignant). The therapeutic use of radioiodine to treat <b>hyperthyroidism</b> from Graves' disease was first reported by Saul Hertz in 1941.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperthyroidism</b> is the {{condition}} that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. Thyrotoxicosis is {{the condition}} that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes <b>hyperthyroidism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{point out}} that the {{severity}} of psychiatric symptoms could easily result in an inappropriate referral to a psychiatrist prior to the diagnosis of <b>hyperthyroidism.</b> Consequently, undiagnosed <b>hyperthyroidism</b> sometimes results in inappropriate use of psychotropic medications; prompt recognition of <b>hyperthyroidism</b> (or hypothyroidism) through thyroid function screening is therefore recommended in the evaluation of patients with psychiatric symptoms. Naturally, the management of patients would be improved by collaboration between an endocrinologist and a psychiatrist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperthyroidism</b> (an overactive thyroid, {{due to the}} Jod-Basedow Effect) {{can also}} occur. However, in the SAFE trial, the {{increased}} rate of <b>hyperthyroidism</b> (5.3% compared to 2.4%) was not statistically significant. Most hyperthyroid patients (defined as TSH <0.35 mU/l) were asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|In {{subclinical}} <b>hyperthyroidism,</b> serum TSH is abnormally low, but T4- and T3-levels {{fall within}} laboratory reference ranges. It primarily affects the skeleton and the cardiovascular system (abnormalities in other systems {{have also been}} reported), in a similar but less severe and less frequent way than overt <b>hyperthyroidism</b> does. It can alter cardiac function, with increased heart rate, increased left ventricular mass index, increased cardiac contractility, diastolic dysfunction, and induction of ectopic atrial beats. Long-term mild excess of thyroid hormone can thus cause impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity. In a large population-based study of 2008, the odds of having poorer cognitive function were greater for subclinical <b>hyperthyroidism</b> than for stroke, diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's disease. Subclinical <b>hyperthyroidism</b> might modestly {{increase the risk of}} cognitive impairment and dementia.|$|E
25|$|However, while {{clinical}} <b>hyperthyroidism</b> {{is associated}} with frank neuropsychological and affective alterations, the occurrence of these alterations and their treatment in mild and subclinical <b>hyperthyroidism</b> remains a controversial issue. Regardless of the inconsistent findings, a 2007 study by Andersen et al. states that the distinction between subclinical and overt thyroid disease is in any case somewhat arbitrary. Subclinical <b>hyperthyroidism</b> {{has been reported in}} 63% of euthyroid Graves' disease., but only in 4% of cases where Graves' disease was in remission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hyperthyroidism</b> has unique {{effects in}} {{children}} on growth and pubertal development, e.g. causing epiphyseal maturation. In growing children, accelerated bone growth from <b>hyperthyroidism</b> can increase osteogenesis {{in the short}} term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights. Pubertal development tends to be delayed, or slowed. Girls who have undergone menarche may develop secondary amenorrhea. <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> is associated with high sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which may result in high serum estradiol levels in girls and testosterone levels in boys. However, unbound or free levels of these hormones are decreased. <b>Hyperthyroidism</b> {{before the age of}} four may cause neurodevelopmental delay. A study by Segni et al. suggests that permanent brain damage can occur {{as a result of the}} illness.|$|E
25|$|It can {{sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish between eye symptoms due to <b>hyperthyroidism</b> and those due to Graves' antibodies, {{not in the least}} because the two often occur coincidently. What can make things particularly difficult, is that many patients with <b>hyperthyroidism</b> have lid retraction, which leads to stare and lid lag (due to contraction of the levator palpebrae muscles of the eyelids). This stare may then give the appearance of protruding eyeballs (proptosis), when none in fact exists. This subsides when the <b>hyperthyroidism</b> is treated.|$|E
