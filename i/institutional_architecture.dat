25|$|Early {{architecture}} in Fairfield includes Victorian houses designed by George Franklin Barber as well a 1915 house designed by Barry Byrne, who trained under Frank Lloyd Wright. A 1930s bank building was {{designed in the}} Streamline Moderne style. Commercial and <b>institutional</b> <b>architecture</b> were influenced by the Louden Industries, including the Louden Foundry. Fairfield {{is the site of}} the prototype Carnegie library. In 1892 Senator, James F.

Parsons College later received a grant to build a Carnegie Library. Fairfield became one of the few cities that had two Carnegie Libraries. The Richardsonian Romanesque work is now operated by Indian Hills Community College as a satellite campus building, as a new library was built in 1996.|$|E

40|$|How {{and why do}} <b>institutional</b> <b>architectures,</b> and {{the roles}} of private {{institutions}} therein, differ across separate areas of climate governance? Here, institutional complexity is {{explained in terms of}} the problem-structural characteristics of an issue area and the associated demand for, and supply of, private authority. These characteristics can help explain the degree of centrality of intergovernmental institutions, as well as the distribution of governance functions between these and private governance institutions. This framework is applied to three emerging areas of climate governance: reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), and climate engineering. Conflicts over means and values, as well as over relatively and absolutely assessed goods, lead to considerable variations in the emergence and roles of private institutions across these three cases...|$|R
40|$|Persistent {{inconsistency}} between {{predictions of}} standard theoretical models and empirical evidence {{of international trade}} dynamics suggests that the traditional understanding of the determinants of actual international trade patterns is incomplete. What is missing? A recent literature suggests {{paying more attention to}} the role of the domestic institutional environment. The level and nature of development of the relevant institutions may be shown to affect competitiveness, by altering both production and transaction costs. In the extreme case, alternative <b>institutional</b> <b>architectures</b> that emerge in different countries may be interpreted as the cause of relative advantage/disadvantage even if technological levels, factor endowments and tastes are identical everywhere. Although in standard international trade models institutions remain implicit, it is hard to explain trade patterns and international competitiveness without taking institutions explicitly into consideration. By reviewing and reorganizing the most interesting contributions on this issue, this survey discusses how institutional diversity affects comparative advantage and international trade dynamics.

40|$|We {{describe}} a theoretical model aiming {{to discuss the}} welfare implications of different <b>institutional</b> <b>architectures,</b> varying from complete centralised political choices to different degrees of subnational political autonomy, {{for the management of}} territorially located environmental resources like forest or ecological sensitive areas. By voting citizens express preferences regarding the desired political decision level. This issue is expressively important in the environment context since despite the increasing awareness of environmental questions, environmental degradation remains. Sustainability requires environmental governance which is only feasible if citizens are engaged and mobilised for it, which is ensured when their preferences are considered. The subnational political autonomy proposed in the model can assume two forms: the implementation of isolated communities or definition of a region. A trade-off between costsharing of environmental protection and the loss that result from sharing it with individuals holding different preferences is widely pondered. This model allows us to conclude that in the absence of inter-community compensatory transfers and {{in the presence of a}} unanimity voting system, citizens’ voice, stability and efficiency conditions are only guaranteed when citizens are completely segregated into homogenous communities or when there is a centralised political regime.

40|$|Following up {{on recent}} debates about sectoral systems of {{innovation}} and production, the paper introduces a heuristic framework for analyzing and explaining distinct patterns of technology-based sectoral change. The concept {{is based on}} two interrelated influencing factors. The first is the sectoral-specific transformative capacity of new technologies themselves, that is, their substantial or incremental impact on socioeconomic and institutional change in a given sectoral system. The second is the sectoral adaptability of socioeconomic structures, institutions, and actors confronted with the opportunities presented by new technologies. The first factor the sectoral transformative capacity of new technologies enables us to identify the technology-driven pressure to change and adjust the structural and <b>institutional</b> <b>architectures</b> of the sectoral system. The second, complementary factor sectoral adaptability helps us to discern the distinct social patterns of anticipating and absorbing this technology-based pressure. The specific interplay between the two influencing factors creates distinguishable modes of sectoral transformation, ranging from anticipative and smooth adjustments to reactive and crisis-ridden patterns of change. Even processes of radical sectoral change continue over longer periods of mismatch, characterized by a cumulation of numerous and mostly gradual organizational, structural, and institutional transformations.

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} the {{institutional}} negotiation of public engagement {{in matters of}} science and technology. We take {{the example of the}} Science in Society dialogue program initiated by the UK’s Royal Society, but set this case within the wider experience of the public engagement activities of a range of charities, corporations, governmental departments, and scientific institutions. The novelty of the analysis lies in the linking of an account of the dialogue event and its outcomes to the values, practices, and imperatives—the institutional rationality—of the commissioning organization. We argue that the often tacit institutional construction of scientific citizenship is a critical, and relatively undeveloped, element of analysis—one that offers considerable insight into the practice and democratic implications of engaging publics in science and science policy. We also present evidence indicating that over time the expanding ‘‘capacities’’ associated with dialogue can act in subtle ways to enroll other elements of <b>institutional</b> <b>architectures</b> into more reflexive modes of thinking and acting. In the concluding section of the article, we consider the ways in which research and practice could (and we believe should) engage more squarely with facets of institutional context and culture...|$|R

40|$|Change in {{the social}} {{organization}} of markets involves the state, economic actors, and civil society in a mutually conditioning and dynamic relation. While much is known about this relation, the processes and mechanisms used by economic actors to influence regulatory institutions to shape their economic spaces over time remain insufficiently specified. Based on a most-different case approach of wine in California and Pennsylvania across time, we explain why and how these states adopted very different regulatory frameworks for alcohol governance: a license and state control system, respectively. Our findings indicate that winemakers who created and effectively deployed ‘institutional footholds’ during periods of ‘regulatory ambiguity’ were better positioned to exert influence over regulatory outcomes. Here we define ‘institutional footholds’ as mechanisms used to create spaces of political traction within the state apparatus. A form of critical juncture, ‘regulatory ambiguity’ refers to moments of uncertainty that precede {{a shift in the}} existing norms and rules governing particular economic spaces. We find that over time, this mutually conditioning process generates what we term ‘institutional sedimentation’, where the rules governing particular economic spaces become part of more permanent <b>institutional</b> <b>architectures.</b> The results of a recent survey with Pennsylvania winemakers conducted by the authors serve to further underscore divergence in the micro-foundations of collectivities and their strategic actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{delivery}} of safe food and health governance is challenging and contested, 1 and knowledge and institutions independent of vested interests {{are essential for}} public health. [2], [3] and [4] In the 1990 s, new <b>institutional</b> <b>architectures</b> for food and health regulation were created to serve two purposes. First, governments sought to rebuild public confidence in both food safety and policy making {{in the wake of}} crises, including salmonella, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, pesticides, dioxins, hormones, and antibiotic residues. Second, in response to commercial pressure to liberalise international trade, which portrayed differences in national food regulations as protectionist barriers, ostensibly scientific bodies were created to provide a uniform international regime. A decade on, how is the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) doing? The FSA, set up in 2000, despite undoubted progress in some domains, struggles in others. One such tussle is about front-of-pack nutritional labelling. The FSA along with British consumers and their representatives favour a traffic-light system, but food-industry heavyweights prefer a quantitative percentage system with guideline daily amounts. After intense lobbying from the industry, European Commissioner Markos Kyprianou proposed to adopt percentage guidelines, a decision viewed by some as potentially compromising public health. 5 The FSA and the European Food Safety Authority have, however, also been criticised for failing to respond robustly about additives and hyperactivity, toxic effects of aspartame, trans fats, and acrylamide...|$|R
