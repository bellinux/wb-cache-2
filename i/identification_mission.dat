Dynamic objects of type “neutral ” or “target ” move through a discretized environment. Probabilistic {{representation of the}} current level of situational awareness – knowledge or belief of object locations and identities – is updated with imperfect observations. Optimization of search is formulated as a mixed-integer program to maximize the expected number of targets found and solved efficiently in a receding horizon approach. The search effort is conducted in tandem with object identification and target interception tasks, and a method for assignment of these missions among agents is developed.

40|$|Fish {{accounts}} for about 77 percent of total animal food consumption in Malawi, but production has not risen {{to keep pace with}} population growth in recent years. For this reason, the Government has wished to explore the largely untapped potential of reservoirs and impoundments in the Central and Northern Regions. A first inventory was undertaken by projects MLW/ 79 / 015 and MLW/ 84 / 003, `National Water Resources Master Plan', and published in 1986. The present project was intended to complete that inventory, and determine the possible usage of these water bodies for increased fish production. It provided the services of a consultant in remote sensing, who undertook a study of satellite imagery, and identified 112 suitable water bodies. In the process, five members of the Malawi Fisheries Department were trained in the visual analysis of satellite data. An aquaculture and fishing consultant then assisted in a ground verification of this information, as a result of which it was shown that, of the 112 barrage ponds and reservoirs identified, 86 of them alone had a total surface area of over 3 400 ha. Experimental fishing was undertaken on 12 reservoirs, which showed that all had been either poorly stocked, or not stocked at allIt was estimated that, by stocking the 112 water bodies with tilapia and catfish, an annual yield in the range of 300 tons could be achieved. This was equivalent to the annual per caput fish consumption of some 34 000 Malawians. It was therefore recommended that the Government pursue a policy of rapidly developing production in these water bodies.

40|$|This report {{contains}} the findings and recommendations on antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) practice and policies in Indonesia. The observations {{were made by}} a team of Dutch and Indonesian experts during an <b>identification</b> <b>mission</b> in August 2015. The mission did address AMU/AMR in both human and veterinary health. It was found that the use of antimicrobials in Indonesia was widespread and uncontrolled on both the human and the veterinary side. This situation was recognised by the Indonesian public and private stakeholders. The awareness on AMR is low within the general public but also within {{a large part of the}} professional stakeholders. There are only limited data available on antimicrobial usage in the human and veterinary sector or on the development of antimicrobial resistance. Research in this area is fragmented and poorly coordinated and reporting lines are not clear. Several initiatives have been taken on both the human and veterinary side to reduce the use of antibiotics, through regulation and increasing awareness of public and professionals. However, from the interviews it appeared that the actual use is not being reduced. The Ministry of Health has drafted a road map on the implementation of existing regulations and guidelines. However, human and financial resources are lacking to support the implementation of this roadmap and to measure the effect of the implementation. The Ministry of Agriculture has recently approved a regulation to ban the use of antibiotics as growth promotor. However, no plan has been made to implement this regulation or to enforce this regulation. On the veterinary side a road map to support the reduction of antibiotic use in the livestock sector is not available. Recommendations are given in this report to support the reduction of AMU/AMR on both the human and veterinary side. On the veterinary side the development of a road map describing a feasible strategy should be the first priority. Second priority should be to establish an intersectoral coordinating mechanism for AMU/AMR involving both human and veterinary stakeholders. The development of monitoring and surveillance programmes for AMU/AMR and capacity building is important to support the policy and intervention programmes and is a logical third step...|$|E

One is based on the statistical properties of the integrated spectrum, the other is based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The sensitivity of the estimators is discussed theoretically for independent data, then the algorithms are tested on LPF synthetic data. The test on realistic LPF data allows the effect of spectral data correlations on the efficiency of the different noise excess estimators to be highlighted. It also reveals the versatility of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov approach, which can be adapted to provide reasonable results on correlated data from {{a modified version of the}} standard equations for the inversion of the test statistic. Closely related to excess noise detection, the problem of noise parameter identification in non-Gaussian data is approached in two ways. One procedure is based on maximum likelihood estimator and another is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit estimator. Both approaches provide unbiased and accurate results for noise parameter estimation and demonstrate superior performance with respect to standard weighted least-squares and Huber's norm.

The purpose of this thesis is to compare the impact of formal and informal institutional influences and of professional identity on performance outcomes such as <b>identification</b> with <b>mission</b> statement and commitment to the mission statement. After a theoretical review of the key concepts within these influences on performance outcomes, a qualitative approach tests their occurrence in Laerdal using interviews with sales representatives working in Scandinavia and in North America. The analysis of data answers five questions that link formal and informal institutional influences, talent management, professional identity and performance outcomes. The results of the study show that both cross-national distance and professional identity can be found, but that professional identity overrides culture divergences {{in the context of a}} mission-driven company. Firstly, the comparison between Scandinavia and the United States demonstrates that management performance and evaluation are influenced by their respective regions. However, cultural influences do not affect either the professional identity that characterises Laerdal’s sales representatives or the performance outcomes. Secondly, talent management cautiously selects and trains salespeople with a strong professional identity in alignment with the mission statement. This in turn leads to employees identifying with, and committing to, the mission statement. The thesis concludes with the suggestion that if an effective selection and onboarding process are in place, coupled with a meaningful mission statement, professional identity will cancel the cross-national distance that can arise in mission-driven companies such as Laerdal...|$|R

The Chairman now assumes many additional roles and responsibilities including the development of the Department of Defense (DoD) budget submission to the President. Two critical elements of this development are the Chairman's Program Assessment (CPA) and the Chairman's Program Recommendation (CPR). This thesis analyzes the CPA and CPR development process. The modem military of today must engage in a complex game of mixing requirements, capabilities, <b>mission</b> <b>identification,</b> threat, and politics to field the world's premier military force. The introduction of the Joint Warfighting Capability Assessment (JWCA) process improved the process of service requirements analysis. The Chairman combines these assessments and recommendations into the CPA and CPR. Extensive research was conducted into the historical role of the Chairman relating to the requirements generation and resource allocation processes within the DoD. Numerous interviews of current Joint Staff and Navy Staff personnel familiar with the CPA and CPR were also conducted. Findings show the CPA and CPR are closely held documents considered personal correspondence between the Chairman and the Secretary of Defense. This situation creates the potential to dramatically alter Service and Agency POM submissions[URL] Commander, United States Naval ReserveResource allocatio...|$|R
