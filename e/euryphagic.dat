40|$|Ophichthus Rufus is a Mediterranean benthic {{fish with}} nocturnal habits. It lives in sand or mud bottoms at depths between 50 and 150 m. Until now, nothing about its feeding habits was known. Stomach {{contents}} of 689 individuals, collected between 1985 and 1987, were analysed. The diet is basically composed of benthic organisms, among which the decapods processa canaliculata and Alpheus glaber and the teleost fish Callionymus maculatus are prominent. Young {{of both sexes}} and adult males have a <b>euryphagic</b> carnivorous diet, whereas adult females are closer to a stenophagic piscivorous die...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the feeding habits of Cataetyx alleni, the fifth most abundant species below 1000 m depth on the deep {{slope of the}} Catalan sea (western Mediterranean), between 1000 and 1800 m depth. Cataetyx alleni is a <b>euryphagic</b> predator, feeding on small epibenthic and endobenthic crustaceans and polychaetes. Predominate prey are small isopods and gammaridean amphipods and, in some cases, endobenthic and epibenthic decapods. Cataetyx alleni has bathymetric changes in diet marked by the capture of different prey-items and also by {{the reduction in the}} size of the prey with increasing depth. Seasonal fluctuations in the feeding pattern are clearly seen among the individuals of the same depths...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} stomach {{contents of}} 80 Plethodon albagula (Western Slimy Salamander) from two mountain ranges in Arkansas (Ozark and Ouachita) to examine if regional differences in diet occur. Museum specimens from 1985 to 2005 were used from locations throughout each mountain range. Although {{a wide variety}} of prey were found in stomachs, Hymenoptera: Formicidae and Coleoptera: Carabidae were found {{to be the most important}} food items in the diet of P. albagula. Ants and beetles constituted 85 % abundance of their total diet (79. 6 % Ozark and 90. 1 % Ouachita) and 52. 2 % of their total biomass (42. 6 % Ozark and 64. 1 % Ouachita). Seventy-eight and 87 % of individuals examined from the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, respectively, consumed ants (65 % total, 83 % for animals with food items in their stomachs), whereas 55 % in the Ozarks and 58 % in the Ouachitas consumed at least one family of beetle. Occurrence and biomass of prey items that did not include ants and beetles showed P. albagula to be a <b>euryphagic</b> predator, with 9. 7 % of diet being comprised of other prey types (27. 3 % biomass). Furthermore, importance values indicate ants were the most important prey item for P. albagula in both the Ozark and Ouachita samples, with carabid beetles (Ozark) and all beetles (Ouachita) being second most important. Jaccard Index indicated Ozark and Ouachita specimens shared 80 % similarity in diet. Our data suggest P. albagula in Arkansas have high dependence upon ants and beetles, yet appears to be an opportunistic and <b>euryphagic</b> predator...|$|E
40|$|The dietary {{importance}} of prey of estuary perch (Macquaria colonorum; Percicthyidae: Günthe r) was examined spatially, temporally and among size classes. Fish {{were collected from}} the Hopkins River, south-western Victoria, from September 1998 to February 1999. The species is a euryhaline, <b>euryphagic</b> carnivore with spatial, temporal and size class variations in diets. Fish caught from estuarine locations consumed primarily Paratya australiensis (40 % IRI) while freshwater fish consumed mostly Tricopteran larvae (63. 5 % IRI). In both freshwater and estuarine locations, the relative {{importance of}} P. australiensis decreased with increasing length of fish.

40|$|General {{trends in}} the feeding habits of the main {{families}} of Africans freshwater fishes are discussed, and dietary changes at different ages and in different seasons are described. The main conclusions reached are : feeding habits within a genus are usually similar, even over a wide distribution area, fishes grouped in some genera are specialized feeders e. g. piscivores (#Lates, Hydrocynus, Bagrus,$ etc), microphages #(Tilapia, Citharinus, Labeo) $, benthic insectivores #(Mormyrus, Marcusenius, Auchenoglanis) $ whereas other genera comprise mainly omnivores (e. g. #Alestes, Eutropius, Clarias, Schilbe, Heterotis$), ommivores and some piscivores, due to their <b>euryphagic</b> habits, {{are better able to}} adapt to harsh environmental conditions, generally speaking, freshwater fishes inhabiting african freshwaters appear to exploit most food resources available in natural waterbodie...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} done on {{sympatric}} populations of Plethodon glutinosus and P. dorsalis in northwestern Arkansas to determine the relative distribution of the two species {{and the relationship between}} their distribution and the utilization of available prey. Upon capture, total length, location, and habitat type were recorded for each salamander. Stomach content samples were obtained by forced regurgitation, and the animals were released. Samples of the local litter fauna were taken to determine prey availability. Habitat data were obtained for 171 salamanders; 76 P. glutinosus and 95 P. dorsalis. Stomach content samples were taken from 67 salamanders; 32 P. glutinosus and 35 P. dorsalis. An apparent relationship was found between environment and utilization of certain prey taxa. Prey related factors, such as relative size of prey and salamander, were also found to affect utilization. Both species were <b>euryphagic...</b>|$|E
40|$|The 20 - 30 {{species of}} the genus Boiga (Colubridae, Boiginae) range from {{tropical}} Africa through southern Asia to Melanesia and Australia (Leviton, 1968). Collectively, they are known as catsnakes, mangrove snakes, or treesnakes (Obst et al., 1988; Greene, 1989). The common name 2 ̆ 2 catsnakes 2 ̆ 2 is sometimes used for snakes in the genus Telescopus as well (Obst et 1, 1988). Members of the genus Boiga are nocturnal, oviparous, opisthoglyphic, <b>euryphagic,</b> and slender; they have vertical elliptical pupils (thus “cat” snakes) set in large eyes, and short, blunt heads that are noticeably larger than their necks. With one exception they are arboreal or semiarboreal (Obst et al., 1988), but they are found on the ground more frequently than some other arboreal snakes. Most inhabit forested areas, although the one terrestrial species, Boiga trigonata, ranges into the steppes of central Asia (Obst et al., 1988). Little {{is known about the}} catsnakes. Not much has been published about most species other than basic descriptions (Leviton, 1968) and scattered natural history notes (Woodward, 1960; Jones, 196 1; Rosevear, 1965). Boiga dendrophila is sold commonly as a pet and zoo animal; its venom and habits have been studied, as have those of several other species (especially B. cyanea and B. blandingfi, mostly in captivity (Barach, 1952; F. Groves, 1973; J. D. Groves, 1974; Burger, 1975; Sakai et al., 1984; R. D. Howard, 1984; C. J. Howard, 1987; Minton and Dunson, 1978). The gut contents of Boiga museum specimens were tabulated by Greene (1989) and Shine (1991).

40|$|Symposium on Integrating New Advances in Mediterranean Oceanography and Marine Biology, 26 - 29 November 2013, Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC), Barcelona, Catalunya, SpainMyctophids, gonostomatids and hatched-fishes {{constitute}} {{the most abundant}} pelagic fishes worldwide. Most myctophids perform extensive nyctimeral migrations across the water column from 200 to 1000 m depth, but gonostomatids and hatched-fishes remain under the epipelagic zone, the former tightly associated to the Deep Scattering Layer. As important components of the comprehensive mesopelagial, numerically, and as vehicles in the energy and matter fluxes through the feeding webs, the diet of 11 species of these fishes (Ceratoscopelus maderensis, Benthosema glaciale, Hygophum hygomii, H. benoiti, Lampanyctus crocodilus, L. pusillus, Lobianchia dofleini, Myctophum puctatum, Notoscopelus elongatus, Cyclotone braueri and Argyropelecus hemigymnus) was analyzed. In general, these predators were mainly zooplanktivores. A dietary shift towards larger or more nutritive prey was evident from transforming stages to adults. Medium-size myctophids contained mainly large calanoid copepods, while diets of transforming or smaller sizes of myctophids and hatched fishes were predominated by non-calanoids and microzooplankton. The adults of myctophid species that cease migrating or dwell longer periods close to the sea bottom, fed on macrozooplankton; {{in the case of}} L. crocodilus, on benthonic amphipods or decapods. Most myctophids showed high overlap of trophic niches, opposing to the general assumption of more selective strategies for oligotrophic areas with scarcity of food resources. However, certain degree of diet discrimination might be also detected. N. elongatus, L. pusillus and L. crocodilus captured with pelagic nets, ingested great proportions of Pleuromamma spp. and euphausiids. C. maderensis and L. dofleini consumed a miscellaneous of calanoids and, regularly, non-calanoids and soft prey such as larvaceans. M. punctatum and Hygophum spp. were <b>euryphagic,</b> and probably prey nonselectively upon the aggregated mesofauna. The stomiiforms, A. hemigymnus and C. braueri, fed almost exclusively on calanoids and oncaeids. A complementary examination of stable isotope (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of both zooplankton and fishes cited above, allowed determining their trophic positions. Mesopelagic fishes ranged between the 3 rd and the 4 th level, the lowest value for the small non-migrating C. braueri. L. crocodilus showed significant higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N values in bottom-dwellers, which coincides with the unlike diet preferences observed in migrants of the same speciesPeer reviewe...|$|E
