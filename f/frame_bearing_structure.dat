40|$|Aim of {{the work}} This work {{is focused on the}} {{synthesis}} of new Ru and Os complexes with potential anticancer activity. The design of the new compounds has been based on metal <b>frames</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>structures</b> with ascertained anticancer activity (ruthenium, and osmium arenes, simil-NAMI,); such metal frames have been associated with newly prepared suitable ligands. The new ligands have been designed and obtained by coupling a skeleton containing one heteroatom (N or P), able to coordinate Ru and Os centers, with a fragment derived from ethacrynic acid. In particular, pyridines and PPh 3 have been used to the purpose, since both types of compounds have been reported to act as enhancers of antiproliferative activity. The synthesis of the Os complexes has been carried out at the University of Zaragoza (E), under the supervision of Prof. M. A. Esteruelas. The anticancer activity of the prepared Ru and Os complexes will be tested at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) ...|$|R
