5|$|In 1976 a {{memorial}} to the demolished school was placed {{to the side of}} the Clal Center, facing Jaffa Road. The memorial consists of a decorative iron gate etched with the name of the school in French. The gate <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> between two stone pillars; it is not standing in its original location.|$|E
5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates {{the amount of}} gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
50|$|The 8-inch and 10-inch Rodman guns could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{all three}} types of carriages. The 15-inch Rodman guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on both types of barbette carriage. The two 20-inch guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on front-pintle barbette carriages.|$|R
50|$|Located just {{northwest}} of Mambajao <b>is</b> <b>Mount</b> Catarman. Its highest peak <b>is</b> <b>Mount</b> Hibok-Hibok which measures 1,250 m in elevation and {{is classified as}} an active stratovolcano. Mount Tres Marias and Mount Vulcan Daan (Old Volcano) <b>are</b> <b>Mount</b> Catarman's other peaks.|$|R

5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Each canvas <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on two {{boards of}} equal width, {{which have been}} cut {{vertically}} and appear {{have come from the}} same tree. Tree-ring dating of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and underpainted in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Egwene {{begins to}} expose the Black Ajah among the rebels, {{requiring}} every sister to re-swear her allegiances. Fifty sisters are exposed and executed, while twenty are able to escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just before the attack <b>is</b> <b>mounted,</b> the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, {{and that they would}} have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E
5000|$|June 2014 - piling {{is totally}} completed. 264 piles <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> for {{the tower of}} Lakhta Center, 848 piles <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> for the mixed-use {{building}} and entrance arch and 968 piles <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> for the stylobate (undergroung parking). All in all 2080 piles were dug in.|$|R

50|$|The {{highest peak}} is Hakkenzan 1914.6 m in the Ōmine Mountains. Other {{peaks in the}} central group <b>are</b> <b>Mount</b> Shakka(1800m) and Mount Sanjō (1719m). To the East in the Daikō Mountains <b>is</b> <b>Mount</b> Ōdaigahara (1695m). In the South <b>is</b> <b>Mount</b> Daitō 大塔山(1122m). The Obako Mountains {{separate}} Nara Prefecture from Wakayama Prefecture.|$|R
5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on the starboard side at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the aircraft's centerline. The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) ammunition drum can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, armor plates of differing thicknesses between the aircraft skin and the drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} emblem {{that was used}} {{at the time of}} the BNR and post-Soviet independence was called the Pahonia (the chase). On the base of a red shield, an armored white knight <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on a silver horse, with a sword drawn and charging to the left. On the shield of the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed. A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E
50|$|The motored 6000 cars <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on bolsterless S-DT62 bogies, and the non-powered 6100 and 6200 trailer cars <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on S-TR62 bogies.|$|R
50|$|Bellerophon was {{the first}} British ironclad to carry the 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading gun. All ten of the 9 in guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on the main deck, five on each side. Five 7-inch rifled muzzle-loaders <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> outside the battery as chase guns. Four of these <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in pairs fore and aft on the main deck; the last gun <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the upper deck at the stern. The ship also had four breech-loading 12-pounder Armstrong guns for use as saluting guns.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 1853, the American Ebenezer Talbot also {{patented}} a TBM {{that employed}} Wilson's cutting discs, although they <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on rotating arms, {{which in turn}} <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on a rotating plate. [...] In the 1870s, John D. Brunton of England built a machine employing cutting discs that <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on rotating plates, which in turn <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on a rotating plate, so that the cutting discs would travel over {{almost all of the}} rock face that was to be removed.|$|R
5|$|Blamey is honoured in Australia {{in various}} ways, {{including}} a square {{named after him}} which is situated outside the Russell Offices headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and Department of Defence in the national capital, Canberra. A statue of Blamey stands in Kings Domain, Melbourne, {{on the corner of}} Government House Drive and Birdwood Avenue, opposite that of John Monash. It was sculptured from granite and bronze by Raymond B. Ewers and presented to the city in February 1960. Controversially, Blamey <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on a jeep instead of the traditional horse. Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, where the Army Recruit Training Centre is located, is also named in his honour, as is Blamey Street and Blamey Park in North Ryde, New South Wales. His papers are held in the Australian War Memorial, where his field marshal's baton is on display.|$|E
5|$|Early F-16s {{could be}} armed {{with up to}} six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking {{short-range}} air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> inside the fuselage {{to the left of the}} cockpit.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that {{rests on the}} masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
50|$|The motored cars <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on DT21A coil-spring bogies {{based on}} the bogies used on the 101 series {{commuter}} EMUs. The non-motored trailer cars <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on TR62 bogies.|$|R
50|$|The {{gear change}} <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the {{steering}} column. The direction indicator switch <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> in the instrument panel. The headlamp dip switch was foot operated. The starter switch <b>was</b> push-operated and <b>mounted</b> on the floor panel below the handbrake.|$|R
5000|$|MR-03 Sports 2 (The {{advanced}} gyro unit (MZW431) {{that can}} <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the Mini-Z AWD Sports, is {{also able to}} <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the MINI-Z Racer Sports 2 MR-03).|$|R
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. U.S. Patent 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral feed ramp and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{display is}} poorly recorded. Ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith observed a display {{in which the}} male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups {{of two or more}} males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden sparrow have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|A small {{platform}} that carried a [...] rangefinder <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> above the rear torpedo locker and a [...] searchlight <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on a tower behind the rear funnel. The two license-built Vickers [...] (pom pom) anti-aircraft guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on an elevated platform {{at the front}} of the rear funnel. Curiously they were another case where the designer exceeded the requirements laid down by the Navy.|$|R
50|$|Final drives <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> in {{the front}} and the idler {{sprockets}} with track tensioners <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> at the rear. The running gear has six road wheel stations per side, which guide a lightweight steel or segmented rubber band-type track. The road wheels <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on a suspension system comprising swing arms with conventional torsion bars and damper systems, this set-up is proven to be reliable and cost-efficient.|$|R
50|$|The 6.6-inch Howitzer {{was used}} a semi-mobile siege artillery, so could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on a {{travelling}} siege carriage with limber. In addition a limbered ammunition trailer was also deployed with each gun. Alternatively the howitzer could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on fixed bed and ground platform. Numbers of howitzers <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in fixed defences, including Fort Widley and Fort Nelson, Portsmouth which in 1898 show a number mounted.|$|R
5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
5|$|When {{a crystal}} <b>is</b> <b>mounted</b> and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E

500|$|The seven [...] 35-caliber guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{broadside}} pivot mounts in hull embrasures, {{except for}} one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. The eight [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in small embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Four [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water [...] torpedo tubes, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.|$|R
50|$|Stabilizers <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at various}} points on the bow. Common with {{competitive}} archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.|$|R
