5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, {{so as to be}} indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E

Following the massacre there was popular disapproval and censure of the leading perpetrator, Frederick Taylor, so that Taylor's River was renamed to Mount Emu Creek. The massacre effectively destroyed the Tarnbeere Gundidj clan.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of this prehistorical art site remains its rareness and extension; although there are numerous prehistorical art sites in caves, open-air sites are rarer (and only include Mazouco (Portugal), Fornols-Haut (France), Domingo García and the Siega Verde (both in Spain). Yet, the {{importance of}} the Côa Valley <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of these designs, which extend sporadically in a space 17 kilometres. Archaeologists acknowledge sites like this as open-air sanctuaries of prehistoric humankind.|$|E
25|$|The Wombat State Forest {{contains}} {{the headwaters of}} the Lerderderg, Campaspe and Loddon rivers. A notable feature in the forest <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of mineral springs which is said to account for 80% of Australia’s mineral springs. The mineral waters are rich in calcium, silica, magnesium, iron and sulphur. The volcanic activity of the region has supplemented the creation of mineral water- carbon dioxide mix that is seen in the form of bubbles emerging from the springs.|$|E

25|$|The Ballad of Yoel Moshe Salomon was {{recorded}} in 1970 by Arik Einstein, a popular artist in the then emerging Israeli rock music genre. It was the final track on Einstein’s and composer Shalom Hanoch’s influential album Shablul ‘Snail’, and was featured in an accompanying film by the same name. The ballad was also included on Arik Einstein’s album Good Old Israel in 1973. A measure of the ballad’s popularity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which its version of events {{has become part of}} the public memory of the foundation of Petah Tikva.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared {{as a result}} of our linguistic capacity. Some of our bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the eyebrow flash on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other primates. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human body language does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.|$|E
25|$|Ignatian Spirituality {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} earlier spiritual traditions: finding God in all things, or being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the Gospels has {{roots in the}} Benedictine Lectio Divina. However, Ignatian Spirituality is adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning {{to the events of}} Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the Lord.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of Chartres Cathedral <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which architectural structure has been adapted {{to meet the}} needs of stained glass. The use of a three-part elevation with external buttressing allowed for far larger windows than earlier designs, particularly at the clerestory level. Most cathedrals of the period had a mixture of windows containing plain or grisaille glass and windows containing dense stained glass panels, with the result that the brightness of the former tended to diminish the impact and legibility of the latter. At Chartres, nearly all of the 176 windows were filled with equally dense stained glass, creating a relatively dark but richly coloured interior in which the light filtering through the myriad narrative and symbolic windows was the main source of illumination.|$|E
25|$|Long {{discussed}} {{but so far}} unresolved is {{the question}} of how many artists participated in producing the Gigantomachy. Just as disputed <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which the character of individual artists can be identified in this work of art. There is agreement that at least the basic design of the frieze was the work of a single artist. In view of its consistency down to the level of details, the plan must have been worked out to its smallest elements; nothing had been left to chance. Already in the arrangement of the fighting groups it can be noted that each group is unique and, for example, that the hairstyle and the footwear of the goddesses always differ. Each of the pairs of fighters is individually arranged. Thus, the figures in themselves reveal their distinctive character rather than this being the result of the artists’ personal styles.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} of Lions Park {{is a series}} of long terraces, formed by boulder walls and garden beds that descend the steep slope falling from Canberra Terrace. A number of trees are planted {{throughout}} this area, including wind-stunted endemic Eucalypt species and Grevillea robusta. Along the Canberra Terrace boundary is a small car park with a garden bed at the southern end. A sandstone block in this garden displays a plaque containing historical information about the lighthouses. To the east of the garden bed is a boulder set in a round concrete footing with a memorial plaque dedicated to World War II servicemen attached (erected 1991). With the exception of the memorial, none of the remainder of these elements is considered to be of state-level cultural heritage significance. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of the largely undeveloped site (part of the original lighthouse reserve) that is significant, rather than the elements that comprise the park.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Shaker Village Work Group {{compared}} to typical summer camps <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which <b>the</b> Villagers <b>were</b> autonomous, without direct counselor supervision.

500|$|After the Second World War, {{a stained}} glass window {{designed}} by the Belgian artist Eugeen Yoors {{was placed in the}} Kingsley Hall community centre in Bow, as a memorial to Lansbury. His memory is further sustained by [...] streets and housing developments named after him, most notably the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, completed in 1951 A further enduring memorial, Attlee suggests, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which the then-revolutionary social policies that Lansbury began advocating [...] {{before the turn of the}} 20th century [...] had become [...] accepted mainstream doctrine little more than [...] a decade after his death.|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi {{retained}} {{emotional and}} political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote for it, or undertook to write, {{large amounts of}} stage music including at least four operas. The ballet Tirsi e Clori survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, {{but the rest of}} the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> to which they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi's early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: [...] "Without these links... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage". Likewise, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.|$|E
