5|$|Nordberg station {{opened on}} 10 October 1934 as a {{station on the}} Sognsvann Line. The line was built by the municipally owned company Akersbanerne. The line was double-tracked from Majorstuen to Korsvoll, and single-tracked <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Sognsvann. In 1939, the section Korsvoll–Sognsvann was {{upgraded}} to double track, and the station Korsvoll had its name changed to Østhorn.|$|E

5|$|The California State Legislature defined Route 26 as a {{route from}} Lucerne Valley to Morongo Valley in 1959. SR 247 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering as a route from SR 62 in Yucca Valley to SR 18 near Lucerne Valley, and then <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> I-15 in Barstow. That year, the Lucerne Valley Chamber of Commerce began {{an effort to}} have a state highway designated from Lucerne Valley to Yucca Valley along Old Woman Springs Road. By 1969, county roads had been constructed from Barstow to Lucerne Valley, and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Yucca Valley. Barstow Road and Old Woman Springs Road {{were given to the}} state by San Bernardino County in 1972, although the county had agreed to perform some improvements on the two roads after the state began to maintain them.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} number of Muslims managed to escape to France and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> the Muslim North Africa. Some revolted against this orderfor example, a revolt broke out in the Serra d'Espadà. The crown's troops {{defeated}} this rebellion in a campaign which included the killing of 5,000 Muslims. After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally converted to Christianity. Mosques were demolished, first names and family names were changed, and the religious practice of Islam was driven underground.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakr {{was born}} around 1321 to his sultan father an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341) and his {{concubine}} mother, Narjis. Narjis also {{gave birth to}} Abu Bakr's younger full brothers Ramadan (died 1343) and Yusuf (died 1346). Information about Abu Bakr's early childhood is unavailable in the Mamluk sources. The first mention of Abu Bakr came in 1332. At that time, Abu Bakr {{had been sent to}} the desert fortress of al-Karak to join his half-brothers Ahmad and Ibrahim in their military training. Also during that year, Abu Bakr left al-Karak to accompany his father and half-brothers Anuk and Ahmad at al-Aqaba and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, an-Nasir Muhammad had them return to al-Karak before the trek to Mecca.|$|E

5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> the National Coal Board. Due to the {{expansion}} of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E
5|$|Although Hananu's revolt {{was largely}} suppressed, a {{low-level}} insurgency involving small ′iṣābāt persisted in Aleppo's countryside. Al-Sa'dun and Uwaid opted {{to continue the}} armed struggle, fleeing to the coastal mountains and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Turkey in December 1921. From the frontier area with Syria, they staged hit-and-run attacks against French forces. With 100 of his fighters, al-Sa'dun entered Jabal Zawiya {{in the summer of}} 1922 to punish those who defected from the rebels or residents who switched allegiance. On 26 August, al-Sa'dun's ′iṣābā assaulted a postal convoy in al-Darakiya, a village between Darkush and Antioch. In 1923, rebel commander Aqil al-Saqati and ten of his fighters launched numerous attacks against the French, including an assault against a government building in al-Safira, southeast of Aleppo, and Jisr al-Hadid near Antakya.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Maréchal, {{who was now}} Archbishop of Baltimore, {{was ordered}} to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he {{appointed}} a priest from his diocese, William Matthews, as apostolic administrator. Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828. Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden {{to return to his}} diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe. He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia. Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Baltimore, where the First Provincial Council of Baltimore was in session.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of her American-Hawaiian career, American sailed in {{scheduled}} service from New York and Philadelphia around South America via the Straits of Magellan, up to San Francisco and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Honolulu. Along the way, she was refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile. The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship's funnel; the quality and fire danger were key reasons that all subsequent American-Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife {{remained}} at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on Joy in the Morning. With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.|$|E

From there she passed by {{the west coast of}} South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 and moved on to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later the {{warships}} sailed for Honolulu, Hawaii, and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Auckland, New Zealand, arriving 9 August.

5|$|By 1948, Rothenberg's {{father had}} died and his mother, Lotte (1894–1990), had become a {{naturalized}} United States citizen. To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, he crossed the international border into the United States at Buffalo, with $12.00 in his pocket. In 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to the Air Force, and served in the Korean War until 1955. He remained guided by {{a deep sense of}} duty and a strong sense of American patriotism throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|By the 1870s, the OSN Company, {{owned by}} the Northern Pacific Railroad, was {{operating}} seven steamboats for transporting wheat and grain from the productive Palouse region along the Snake and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports. These boats were the Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West, {{all of which were}} built on the Columbia River. However, there were more resources along the Snake River than wheat and grain. In the 1890s, a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon. Several ships were built specifically to transport ore <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> Lewiston: these included Imnaha, Mountain Gem, and Norma. In 1893 the Annie Faxon suffered a boiler explosion and sank on the Snake below Lewiston.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and <b>from</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> the end consumer.|$|E
