25|$|Later in 2008–2010 new {{infrared}} spectroscopic observations with {{a higher}} signal-to-noise ratio revealed additional spectral features. Among them are a deep water ice absorption band at 1.65μm, which is an evidence of the crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} Orcus, and a new absorption band at 2.22μm. The origin of the latter feature is not completely clear. It can be caused either by ammonia/ammonium dissolved in the water ice or by methane/ethane ices. The radiative transfer modeling showed that a mixture of water ice, tholins (as a <b>darkening</b> <b>agent),</b> ethane ice and ammonium ion (NH4+) provides the best match to the spectra, whereas a combination of water ice, tholins, methane ice and ammonia hydrate gives a slightly inferior result. On the other hand, a mixture of only ammonia hydrate, tholins and water ice failed to provide a satisfactory match. So, as of 2010, the only reliably identified compounds on the surface of Orcus are crystalline water ice and, possibly, dark tholins. A firm identification of ammonia, methane and other hydrocarbons requires better infrared spectra.|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing {{data suggest}} Mercury’s surface has {{compositional}} variations spatially associated with crater and basin ejecta, the so-called “Low-Reflectance Material ” (LRM), {{which has been}} suggested to be enriched in a subsur-face native <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> that is excavated and redeposited onto the surface. This unit may record the evidence of impact-induced mixing of Mercury’s outer layers during its early history. Here, we develop a fully three-dimensional Monte Carlo model of impact cratering, excavation, and ejecta blanket deposition {{on a global scale}} for Mercury. New dynamical simulations of the early evolution of the asteroid belt hint at the presence of additional asteroids in a region interior to the present-day belt, known as the “E-belt”. We use Monte Carlo methods to show that the predicted bombardment from this population matches the observed spatial crater densities on Mercury. Impacts large enough to pierce through the crust create surface ejecta deposits rich in mantle material. Later impacts onto enriched ejecta deposits redistribute mantle material away from the basins. For the suggested average mercurian crustal thickness of 50 km, the surface has, on average, ∼ 0. 4 % mantle material by volume; the most enriched areas have ∼ 30 % mantle by volume. The regional coverage of impact-induced compositional changes is strongly dependent on the thickness to the subsurface source. Because observations indicate LRM covers ∼ 15 % of Mercury’s surface, our model suggests the <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> is ∼ 30 km deep. Considering the current estimated average mercurian crustal thickness of 50 km, this implies the <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> is likely located within a chemically distinct lower crust...|$|E

Compared to Uranus, the greater abundance and shorter lifetimes of Neptunian particulates in the stratospheric region irradiated by the solar UV flux indicate that such radiation is the <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> of stratospheric aerosols on both planets...|$|E

50|$|There {{has always}} been an {{interest}} in producing a completely black budgerigar, so far without success, and the darkening effect of the Slate mutation prompted attempts to combine this mutation with other <b>darkening</b> <b>agents</b> to achieve this. W H James, of Flixton, near Manchester, {{was one of the first}} to cross-breed Violets and Slates, attempting it first in 1955, and Cyril Rogers also investigated the effect of combining several darkening mutations in one bird in the late 1950s and early 1960s. These attempts certainly produced dark budgerigars, but because the pale grey to white colour of the barbules of the body feathers is unaffected by any mutation known to date, the admixture of their colour with the colour of the underlying barbs would still produce a grey appearance, even if the barbs themselves were jet black.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Vesta is the {{asteroid}} {{with the largest}} albedo variation among the known rocky Solar System objects and shows a widespread occurrence of dark material (DM) and bright material (BM) units. In the first observation phases by the Dawn spacecraft, two main extensions of low albedo areas were identified on Vesta and found to be closely correlated with carbonaceous, OH-rich, material. In this work we use the hyperspectral data provided by the VIR-Dawn imaging spectrometer onboard Dawn to detect and analyze individual, well-defined, dark material units. We define {DM} units assuming a relative criterion, i. e. reflectance lower than the surroundings. By coupling visible and infrared images of the same area {{we are able to}} select real dark material units, discarding false detections created by shadowing effects. A detailed final catalogue of 123 dark units is presented, containing the geographical parameters and the main spectral characteristics for each unit. Independently of the geological context of the dark units, all {DMs} show similar spectral properties, dominated by the pyroxene absorption features, as is the average spectrum of Vesta. This finding suggests a similar composition, with the presence of <b>darkening</b> <b>agents</b> that also weaken pyroxene band depths. The majority (90) of the {DM} units shows a positive correlation between low albedo and an {OH} band centered at 2. 8 |$|R
40|$|Photomicrography and {{reflectance}} microphotometry {{were used}} to monitor melanosome movement in frog skin melanocytes in vitro in response to hormonal stimulation and cytochalasin B (CB). Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), theophylline, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DiBcAMP) induced melanosome dispersion (darkening) which was promptly arrested by cytochalasin B in concentrations of 5 - 20 µg/ml. Melanosome aggregation (skin lightening) occurred only after removal of the <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> (MSH, theophylline, or DiBcAMP) and proceeded in {{the presence or absence}} of CB. When CB was added to darkened skins, they did not lighten and melanosomes remained in the dispersed state. Use of CB has permitted the dissection of cyclic AMP-mediated melanosome dispersion into two distinct events. The first, induction of melanosome dispersion, is CB sensitive. The second action of intracellular cyclic AMP involves an uncoupling of the centripetal motive force, and is CB insensitive. In the latter process, production of cyclic AMP appears to produce the same result as application of microtubule-disrupting agents...|$|E

These observations were before significant EUV/FUV coma signatures were observed by Alice. The resulting coadded spectrum has high signal to noise and reveals: (1) a very FUV-dark surface with (2) a blue spectral slope and (3) no evidence of significant H 2 O ice absorption in the FUV. We fit the measured reflectance spectrum with a model including 99. 5 % tholins, 0. 5 % H 2 O-ice, and a neutral <b>darkening</b> <b>agent.</b> Since we could not find any natural material with sufficiently low EUV/FUV reflectance, we interpret the low I/F as evidence of a fluffy, light-trapping surface. We interpret the blue spectral slope as consistent with a surface consisting primarily of tholins, though it may alternatively {{be the result of}} Rayleigh scattering by fine particles in the regolith...|$|E
40|$|Results {{from the}} MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) {{spacecraft}} have shown elevated abundances of carbon {{on the surface}} of Mercury. Furthermore, the X-Ray Spectrometer on board MESSENGER measured elevated abundances of sulfur and low abundances of iron, suggesting the planet's oxygen fugacity (fO 2) is several log 10 units below the Iron-Wstite (IW) buffer. Similar to the role of other volatiles (e. g. sulfur) on highly reducing planetary bodies, carbon is expected to behave differently than it would under higher fO 2. As discussed by Nittler et al. and Hauck et al., under such highly reducing conditions, the majority of the iron partitions into the core. On Mercury, this resulted in a relatively large core and a thin mantle. Using a composition similar to the largest volcanic field on the planet (the northern volcanic plains), Vander Kaaden and McCubbin conducted sink-float experiments to determine the density of melts and minerals on Mercury. They showed that graphite would be the only buoyant mineral in a mercurian magma ocean. Therefore, Vander Kaaden and McCubbin proposed a possible primary flotation crust on the planet composed of graphite. Concurrently, Peplowski et al. used GRS data from MESSENGER to show an average northern hemisphere abundance of C on the planet of 1. 4 +/- 0. 9 wt%. However, as this result was only at the one-sigma detection limit, possible carbon abundances at the three-sigma detection limit for Mercury range from 0 to 4. 1 wt% carbon. Additionally, Murchie et al. investigated the possible <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> on Mercury and concluded that coarse-grained graphite could darken high reflectance plains to the low reflectance material. To further test the possibility of elevated abundances of carbon in Mercury's crust, Peplowski et al. used the low-altitude MESSENGER data to show that carbon is the only material consistent with both the visible to near-infrared spectra and the neutron measurements of low reflectance material on Mercury, confirming that C is the primary <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> on Mercury. Confirmation of carbon on the planet prompts many questions regarding the role of carbon during the differentiation and evolution of Mercury. Given the elevated abundances of both S and C on Mercury's surface, it begs the question, what is the core composition of the planet? This study seeks to understand the impact of C as a light element on potential core compositions on Mercury...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of 0. 25 - 5 µm {{reflectance}} spectra {{provided by}} the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) onboard Rosetta orbiter revealed that the surface of 67 P/CG is dark from the near-UV to the IR and is enriched in refractory phases such as organic and opaque components. The broadness {{and complexity of the}} ubiquitous absorption feature around 3. 2 µm suggest a variety of cometary organic constituents. For example, complex hydrocarbons (aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic) can contribute to the feature between 3. 3 and 3. 5 µm and to the low reflectance of the surface in the visible. Here we present the 0. 25 - 5 µm reflectance spectra of well-characterized terrestrial hydrocarbon materials (solid oil bitumens, coals) and discuss their relevance as spectral analogues for a hydrocarbon part of 67 P/CG's complex organics. However, the expected low degree of thermal processing of cometary hydrocarbons (high (H+O+N+S) /C ratios and low carbon aromaticities) suggests high IR reflectance, intense 3. 3 - 3. 5 µm absorption bands and steep red IR slopes that are not observed in the VIRTIS spectra. Fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g., iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) intimately mixed with other surface components are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low intensities of absorption bands in the VIRTIS spectra of the 67 P/CG surface. In particular, iron sulfides are common constituents of cometary dust, "cometary" chondritic IDPs, and efficient <b>darkening</b> <b>agents</b> in primitive carbonaceous chondrites. Their effect on reflectance spectra of an intimate mixture is strongly affected by grain size. We report and discuss the 0. 25 - 5 µm reflectance spectra of iron sulfides (meteoritic troilite and several terrestrial pyrrhotites) ground and sieved to various particle sizes. In addition, we present reflectance spectra of several intimate mixtures of powdered iron sulfides and solid oil bitumens. Based on the reported laboratory data, we discuss the ability of iron sulfides to suppress absorption bands of other cometary refractory components and to affect the spectral slopes and reflectance values of the 67 P/CG surface at different wavelengths from the near-UV to the IR...|$|R

For example, complex hydrocarbons can contribute to the feature between 3. 2 and 3. 5 μm and to the low reflectance of the surface in the visible. Relevance of natural macromolecular solids, such as solid oil bitumens (asphaltites, kerites, anthraxolites) and coals as spectral analogs for the hydrocarbon part of cometary refractory organics were discussed in detail in the literature. Fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g. iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low contrast of the 3. 2 μm absorption band. Other non-icy constituents that may contribute to spectral reflectance properties of the 67 P surface include amorphous and crystalline silicates. Here we report and discuss the 0. 3 - 5 μm reflectance spectra of relevant Fe-sulfides (meteoritic troilite and several terrestrial pyrrhotites) ground and sieved to various particle sizes. We report the results of the synthesis, analyses, and/or spectral reflectance measurements of Fe-free low-Ca pyroxenes (ortho- and clinoenstatites), forsterites, and a high-Ca pyroxene (diopside). We present reflectance spectra of intimate mixtures of powdered Fe-sulfides with kerite (as an example of a relevant macromolecular organic solid) and synthetic orthoenstatite. We investigate and discuss the ability of Fe-sulfides to suppress absorption bands of other cometary refractory components and to affect the spectral slopes and reflectance values of the 67 P/CG surface at different wavelengths from the near-UV to the IR. Finally, we discuss the evolution of organic absorption bands as a function of sulfide content in the mixtures and the possibility for detection of individual C-H stretching bands in the VIRTIS spectra of 67 P/CG. We show that spectral reflectance of the ubiquitous dark material on the surface of 67 P is mostly controlled by fine-grained opaques and organic refractories, while silicate components play a less significant role and are unlikely to contribute significantly to the VIRTIS spectra and to the observed spectral variations across the 67 P surface. We demonstrate that fine-grained Fe-sulfides (troilite and pyrrhotite) are effective <b>darkening</b> <b>agents</b> from the near UV to IR that can explain the very low IR reflectance of the 67 P nucleus. The shape of the VIRTIS spectra in the visible range is consistent with the presence of polyaromatic-rich organics together with Fe-sulfides. Fe-sulfides intimately mixed with other components significantly influence shapes and relative contrasts of absorption bands of other phases. If real, the fine structure in the VIRTIS spectra between 3. 2 and 3. 5 μm could be indicative of individual C-H absorption bands in aromatic structures, methyl and methylene groups. Further work is needed to clarify which species contribute to the broad complex 3. 2 -μm band in the VIRTIS spectra and to the spectral shape between 1. 5 and 2. 5 μm...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Leucaena leucocephala, (leucaena) is {{a fast-growing}} leguminous tree with many {{positive}} applications, ranging from biofuel/biomass to animal fodder. This research aims to improve digestibility of leucaena {{by reducing the}} concentration of the toxic amino acid mimosine. The approach to accomplish this was transformation of leucaena with isolated genes from Rhizobium sp. strain TAL 1145 {{that are involved in}} degradation of 3 -hydroxy 4 pyridone, which is a precursor of mimosine biosynthesis. The main focus of this work was to improve the existing transformation protocols by overcoming problems with tissue regeneration and DNA transfer, which have been the limiting factors in replicating previous work. Our experimental trials indicated three key limiting factors: (i) production of phenolic exudates by explants, which deter tissue growth, (ii) accumulation of necrotic material at explant cut surface, and (iii) inefficient rooting as a hindrance for regeneration. We hypothesized that overcoming these three specific barriers would improve tissue regeneration and genetic transformation significantly. Reduced production of phenolic exudates was accomplished by introducing 0. 8 - 1. 0 % activated charcoal to adsorb the phenolics released into the growth media. Introduction of a cell recovery phase and supplementation of the medium with activated charcoal prevented development of necrotic cell material. Proper root induction was achieved through two means: (i) elongation media development: which enabled explants to elongate shoots prior to root induction; and (ii) activated charcoal was utilized as a <b>darkening</b> media <b>agent</b> for improved root induction. Our results thus far have established that prevention of necrotic cell death coupled with timely induction of a healthy root system through darkened media, improves both tissue regeneration and transformation frequency of leucaena. PCR analysis has shown the presence of the transgenes in 16 individuals. These explants originated from four independent Agrobacterium-mediated transformation experiments. This research contributes towards the development of mimosine-free leucaena and also the improvement of transformation protocols for woody legumes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we provide {{measurements}} of the bidirectional reflectance in the VIS-NIR spectral range for a selection of laboratory samples to deduce parameters such as their visible spectrum, phase curve, hemispheric albedo and phase reddening. The aim is to simulate the reflectance of the comet nucleus in order to aid the interpretation of data {{from the surface of}} comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P) acquired by the Rosetta OSIRIS imaging system. We produced a broad variety of well characterised and reproducible samples containing water ice, carbonaceous compounds and complex organic molecules. We were able to reproduce the individual global spectrophotometric parameters (albedo, spectrum, phase reddening, phase curve) of 67 P by using mixtures of activated charcoal, tholins and water ice. However, no mixture was able to fit all parameters simultaneously. The samples with highest porosities best match the phase curve of 67 P. Spectral considerations from our experiments show that the particle size of the <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> on the cometary surface should have a lower limit of a few hundred nanometres to several micrometres and cannot be dominated by particles in the range of some tens of nanometres. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the bright ice patches observed by OSIRIS and VIRTIS should be relatively dust free at small scale...|$|E
40|$|Calcium ions are {{required}} in the medium for the full darkening action of melanocyte- stimulating hormone, but not for its second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, on isolated frog skin. Thus, the possible effect of the divalent cation ionophore A 23187 was studied, using the skin of Rana pipiens. It is a potent <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> over the range of 1 – 2 μM, as measured by reflectance change and microscopic observation. During the darkening response to A 23187, melanosome dispersion takes place in both dermal and epidermal melanophores, as well as aggregation of iridophore reflecting platelets. The darkening is slowly reversible in Ringer's solution, thus it is not due to toxicity. The darkening is partially dependent {{on the presence of}} calcium in the medium under certain conditions, suggesting that the response involves both the uptake and release of calcium ions. Cytochalasin B reversibly inhibits the darkening produced by A 23187. Since this drug is known to bring about the breakdown of microfilaments, its inhibitory action is in accord with the concept that the ionophore is stimulating microfilament function. A 23187 administered to tissue cultured embryonic salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) melanophores produced an irreversible rounding up of the cells, suggesting a toxic effect. The results with frog skin are interpreted as supporting the concept that the action of melanocyte-stimulating hormone involves the production of pigment granule movements {{as a result of the}} interaction of calcium ions with intracellular microfilaments and possible also the breakdown of microtubules. The mobilization of calcium ions could be brought about by cyclic adenosine monophosphate...|$|E
40|$|Landforms {{unique to}} Mercury, hollows are shallow, flat-floored {{irregular}} depressions notable for their relatively high reflectance and characteristic color. Here we document {{the range of}} geological settings in which hollows occur. Most are associated with impact structures (simple bowl-shaped craters to multiring basins, and ranging from Kuiperian to Calorian in age). Hollows {{are found in the}} low-reflectance material global color unit and in low-reflectance blue plains, but they appear to be absent from high-reflectance red plains. Hollows may occur preferentially on equator- or hot-pole-facing slopes, implying that their formation is linked to solar heating. Evidence suggests that hollows form because of loss of volatile material. We describe hypotheses for the origin of the volatiles and for how such loss proceeds. Intense space weathering and solar heating are likely contributors to the loss of volatiles; contact heating by melts could promote the formation of hollows in some locations. Lunar Ina-type depressions differ from hollows on Mercury in a number of characteristics, so it is unclear if they represent a good analog. We also use MESSENGER multispectral images to characterize a variety of surfaces on Mercury, including hollows, within a framework defined by laboratory spectra for analog minerals and lunar samples. Data from MESSENGER's X-Ray Spectrometer indicate that the planet’s surface contains up to 4 % sulfur. We conclude that nanophase or microphase sulfide minerals could contribute to the low reflectance of the low-reflectance material relative to average surface material. Hollows may owe their relatively high reflectance to destruction of the <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> (sulfides), the presence of alteration minerals, and/or physical differences in particle size, texture, or scattering behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{integument}} is {{the body}} organ interfacing between {{the internal and external}} environments of a lizard. This study explores aspects of its structure, texture, and coloration, relating them to survival strategies of horned lizards. The dermal chromatophore structure of Phrynosoma modestum is described. Color change depends on two cell types, melanophores and iridophores. This cellular arrangement may be typical of lizards utilizing color change for thermoregulation. Color pigment cells (xanthophores and erythrophores) function in pattern formation and background color matching. Experiments on the regulation of color change revealed that (1) -MSH is the prime skin <b>darkening</b> <b>agent,</b> (2) - and -adrenergic receptors also play a role in color change, and (3) temperature is a factor in in vitro and in vivo darkening and lightening responses. Apparently the primary role of color change is thermoregulation. Intraepidermal mechanoreceptors on dorsal body, limb, and head scales were studied, their ultrastructure is described, and their role in defense and survival is explored. The use of the integument for "rain-harvesting" of drinking water by P. cornutum is described, including stereotyped behavior, stereoscopic SEM examination of interscalar channels, experiments on capillary water flow, and an evaluation of micro-ornamentation. Comparisons are made with the putative use of the integument for the collection of rain, fog, or dew for drinking by Moloch and Phrynocephalus. A stereotypic behavior that utilizes positioning of occipital horns and dorsal scale armament is described and hypothesized to be an ophidian antipredator defense. Attacks by Onychomys torridus on P. cornutum and P. modestum were studied to further evaluate the role of occipital horns, dorsal scalation, and dermal collagen as antipredator defenses. Attack behaviors of the grasshopper mice and defense behaviors of the lizards are detailed. The use of color pattern, integumental structures, and mimetic behavior by P. modestum in avoidance of predator detection, through "stone-mimicry," is hypothesized and supported. Aspects of social communication in four species were studied. The importance of olfaction for intraspecific communication and lack of visual color signals is related to the need for chromatic crypticity in order to avoid detection by predators...|$|E

We combine this investigation with linear spectral fitting results from mid-infrared spectra and compare derived oxide abundances with mercurian formation models and lunar samples. Hapke modeling results indicate a regolith that is optically dominated by finely comminuted particles with average area weighted grain size near 20 lm. Mercury shows lunar-style space weathering, with maturation-produced microphase iron present at ~ 0. 065 wt. % abundance, with only small variations between mature and immature sites, the amount of which is unable to explain Mercury’s low brightness relative to the Moon. The average modal mineralogies for the flyby 1 spectra derived from Hapke modeling are 35 – 70 % Na-rich plagioclase or orthoclase, up to 30 % Mg-rich clinopyroxene, < 5 % Mg-rich orthopyroxene, minute olivine, ~ 20 – 45 % low-Fe, low-Ti agglutinitic glass, and < 10 % {{of one or more}} lunar-like opaque minerals. Mercurian average oxide abundances derived from Hapke models and mid-infrared linear fitting include 40 – 50 wt. % SiO 2, 10 – 35 wt. % Al 2 O 3, 1 – 8 wt. % FeO, and < 25 wt. % TiO 2; the inferred rock type is basalt. Lunar-like opaques or glasses with high Fe and/or Ti abundances cannot on their own, or in combination, explain Mercury’s low brightness. The linear mixing results indicate the presence of clinopyroxenes that contain up to 21 wt. % MnO and the presence of a Mn-rich hedenbergite. Mn in M 1 crystalline lattice sites of hedenbergite suppresses the strong 1 and 2 lm crystal field absorption bands and may thus act as a strong <b>darkening</b> <b>agent</b> on Mercury. Also, one or more of thermally darkened silicates, Fepoor opaques and matured glasses, or Mercury-unique Ostwald-ripened microphase iron nickel may lower the albedo. A major part of the total microphase iron present in Mercury’s regolith is likely derived from FeO that is not intrinsic to the crust but has been subsequently delivered by exogenic sources...|$|E
