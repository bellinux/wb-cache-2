40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author studied the <b>forewords</b> in detective stories by Agatha Christie, John Dickson Carr, and Ellery Queen. These <b>forewords</b> are classified into two types. The first type consists of dedications to people containing names, {{with or without}} short personal messages. The second type {{is made up of}} several sentences and sometimes paragraphs. Of his 48 books, Carr has only five first-type <b>forewords</b> and one second-type. His <b>forewords</b> are usually shorter than those of the other two writers. In his 26 books, Queen has only two first-type <b>forewords.</b> One of his books has not only a first-type but also a second-type <b>forewords</b> with a list of characters. Four of his books have second-type <b>forewords,</b> all of which are lengthy. Lastly Christie has many more <b>forewords</b> than the other two writers, 58 in 90 books of hers. In the previous paper, only twelve second-type <b>forewords</b> of Agatha Christie were discussed. In this paper, the author studies the rest of her first-type <b>forewords...</b>|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author studied eighty-two “Perry Mason” detective stories by Erle Stanley Gardner. In his day, Gardner was well-known as a detective story writer who once sold 26, 000 books {{a day at}} the peak of his career. In those days, all of his “Perry Mason” books were as famous and popular as those by Agatha Christie, John Dickson Carr, and Ellery Queen. Now those “Perry Mason” books have disappeared from bookstores and have been forgotten, while the books by Christie, Carr, and Queen are still on the shelves. That paper discussed the reasons for the disappearance of books about Perry Mason. In this paper, the distinctive features of <b>forewords</b> by Gardner, Christie, Carr and Queen are compared and contrasted. The <b>forewords</b> by the latter three writers are classified into two types. However, Gardner’s <b>forewords</b> are distinctively different and categorized into a third type. In this paper, which is the first of two parts, the <b>forewords</b> by Christie, Carr and Queen are discussed. In the second paper, the <b>forewords</b> by Gardner will be discussed...|$|R
