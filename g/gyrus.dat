5|$|The EC, {{is located}} in the parahippocampal <b>gyrus,</b> a {{cortical}} region adjacent to the hippocampus. This <b>gyrus</b> conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal <b>gyrus</b> also includes the perirhinal cortex which {{plays an important role in}} the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.|$|E
5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate <b>gyrus</b> and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate <b>gyrus</b> and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E
5|$|A buyback of {{preferred}} shares for $530–590million was authorised by the Olympus board. Axam subsequently negotiated a further {{increase in the}} value of the shares, for which Olympus finally paid $620million in March 2010. According to a UK corporate filing for <b>Gyrus,</b> the value of the securities at the time was disclosed as $177million. Bloomberg notes that executives Olympus had delayed accounting for the true cost of the 'success fees' of <b>Gyrus</b> until March 2011, by which time Axam Investments had been struck off by the Cayman Islands registrar for nine months.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is one of}} the few {{brain regions}} where new neurons are generated. This process of neurogenesis is confined to the dentate <b>gyrus.</b> The production of new neurons can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate <b>gyrus.</b> Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal <b>gyrus</b> increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal <b>gyrus</b> {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as <b>Gyrus</b> in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) {{is another}} {{midbrain}} area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the mesocorticolimbic projection. The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the amygdala, cingulate <b>gyrus,</b> hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Mesocorticolimbic neurons {{play a central role}} in reward and other aspects of motivation.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal <b>gyrus</b> in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal <b>gyrus</b> of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate <b>gyrus</b> of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate <b>gyrus</b> (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal <b>gyrus.</b> Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal <b>gyrus,</b> and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals {{the fact that most}} of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or <b>gyrus</b> in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E
5|$|Thomson Reuters {{reported}} that a fee of US$687million, equal to 31percent of the <b>Gyrus</b> acquisition price, was paid to a middle-man, whereas this is usually 1–2percent. As part of his proof, Woodford released the report from PwC which showed that the sum of $670million of the advisory payments was paid over to AXAM Investments Ltd., a Cayman Islands company. In June 2010, three months after receiving its final fees from Olympus, it was struck off by local company registry for non-payment of license fees. Olympus revealed that the Axes fee included fees paid to Perella Weinberg Partners UK, who acted as financial advisor, and US law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who acted as legal advisers.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal <b>gyrus</b> and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
25|$|Reduced Cerebral Blood Flow in Angular <b>Gyrus.</b> A {{couple of}} studies found reduced {{cerebral}} blood flow in angular <b>gyrus</b> of murderers and impulsive, violent criminals.|$|E
25|$|Unilateral {{activation}} of the amygdala due to fearful stimuli may also produce unilateral {{activation of}} other regions. The right middle temporal <b>gyrus,</b> right brainstem, left hippocampus, right cerebellum, right fuisform <b>gyrus,</b> and left lingual <b>gyrus</b> were also activated during fearful stimuli. Activation of multiple brain regions both indicates that emotions are processed {{in many parts of}} the brain and that emotions are complex.|$|E
25|$|Lesions (or {{the absence}} of) in {{associations}} between the right temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe. In nine of ten tone-deaf people, the superior arcuate fasciculus {{in the right}} hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior temporal <b>gyrus</b> and the posterior inferior frontal <b>gyrus.</b> Researchers suggested the posterior superior temporal <b>gyrus</b> was {{the origin of the}} disorder.|$|E
25|$|The right {{superior}} temporal <b>gyrus</b> was {{the most}} significantly activated area during the processing happiness. The right superior temporal <b>gyrus</b> increasingly responds to an increasingly happy stimuli, while the left pulvinar increasingly responds to increasingly fearful stimuli. The right pulvinar is activated during aversive conditioning.|$|E
25|$|Studies using PET {{have come}} to the same {{conclusions}} regarding the use of the parahippocampal <b>gyrus</b> for prospective memory. The parahippocampal <b>gyrus</b> is activated in paired-associate prospective memory tasks, in which participants must learn a pair of words and be able to remember one half of the word pair in later trials. It is suspected that the parahippocampal <b>gyrus</b> is additionally involved in monitoring the novelty of presented stimuli. If not monitored properly, new stimuli can be distracting during attempts to remember intentions for the future.|$|E
25|$|Damage to the {{inferior}} parietal region including the anterior (supramarginal <b>gyrus)</b> and posterior (angular <b>gyrus)</b> regions resulted in reduced SCR. Damage {{to the right}} hemisphere in these regions resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in SCR while {{the damage to the}} left hemisphere of these regions did not (p > 0.05).|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} {{part of the}} insula {{is formed}} by a long <b>gyrus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} frontal <b>gyrus</b> is {{the most}} significantly activated region while processing sadness.|$|E
25|$|Situations that {{contradict}} moral teachings generally produce negative emotions. Watching people behave badly {{by breaking}} moral codes most significantly activates the right parahippocampal <b>gyrus,</b> the right medial frontal <b>gyrus,</b> and left amygdala. Watching emotionally negative situations most significantly activates the right amygdala. This {{study indicates that}} lateral processing of emotions extends beyond the basic emotions to higher cognitive responses.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone, {{probably}} acting through mineralocorticoid receptors, may positively influence neurogenesis in the dentate <b>gyrus.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} shown that in TOT state the {{activation}} of the parahippocampal <b>gyrus</b> is decreased.|$|E
25|$|Age-related {{memory loss}} is {{believed}} to originate in the dentate <b>gyrus,</b> whereas Alzheimer's {{is believed to}} originate in the entorhinal cortex.|$|E
25|$|When both sensory {{pathways}} {{reach the}} integrating center {{that is the}} thalamus, they make their final ascent to the somatosensory areas in the postcentral <b>gyrus</b> of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{cortical}} stimulation mapping {{dates back to}} the late 19th century. Neurologists David Ferrier and Victor Horsley were some of the first to utilize this technique. Ferrier and Horsley employed CSM to further grasp the structure and function of the pre-Rolandic and post-Rolandic areas, also known as the pre central <b>gyrus</b> and post central <b>gyrus.</b> Prior to the development of more advanced methods, in 1888 C.B. Nancrede utilized a battery operated bipolar probe in order to map the motor cortex. In 1937, Wilder Penfield and Boldrey were able to show that stimulating the precentral <b>gyrus</b> elicited a response contralaterally; a significant finding given that it correlated to the anatomy based on which part of the brain was stimulated. In the early 1900s Charles Sherrington began to use monopolar stimulation in order to elicit a motor response. This technique allowed Sherrington to determine that the precentral <b>gyrus</b> (pre-Rolandic area) is a motor cortex and the postcentral <b>gyrus</b> (post-Rolandic area) is a sensory cortex. These findings, which were repeated by Harvey Cushing through the early 1900s, show that the Rolandic fissure is the point of separation between the motor and sensory cortices. Cushing's work with CSM moved it from an experimental technique to one that became a staple neurosurgery technique used to map the brain and treat epilepsy. Cushing took work that had previously been done on animals, specifically chimpanzees and orangutans, and was able to utilize cortical stimulation mapping to account for the differences between these species and humans. Cushing's work dramatically increased the effectiveness of the treatment utilizing cortical stimulation mapping, as neurosurgeons were now utilizing a more updated picture of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the {{analysis}} of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as contour (pitch direction) and interval (frequency ratio between successive notes) information. The right superior temporal <b>gyrus</b> recruits and evaluates contour information, while both right and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information. In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's <b>gyrus</b> (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{separation}} {{is the ability}} to differentiate one memory from other stored memories. Pattern separation begins in the dentate <b>gyrus,</b> a section of the hippocampus involved in memory formation and retrieval. Granule cells in the dentate <b>gyrus</b> process sensory information using competitive learning, and relay a preliminary representation to form place fields. Place fields are extremely specific, as they are capable of remapping and adjusting firing rates in response to subtle sensory signal changes. This specificity is critical for pattern separation, as it distinguishes memories from one another.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} ventral pathway being {{important}} for visual processing, {{it is also}} important for processing auditory information. During processing, when sound waves enter the ear, this information is transduced into an unanalyzed auditory object. The subcortical auditory pathway then relays the information to the auditory cortex in the dorsal superior temporal <b>gyrus</b> (dSTG). In the dSTG, it is then divided into its constituent phones. These phones are then recognized into phonetic words in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). The information first enters the ventral stream at the posterior middle temporal <b>gyrus</b> and the posterior inferior temporal sulcus p(MTG+ITS). Here the auditory words are converted into semantic words. These words are then converted into a semantic phrase by the first combinatorial net at the anterior portion of the middle temporal lobe and then converted into a syntactic noun phrase at the second combinatorial net. This second combinatorial net is location in the anterior inferior temporal <b>gyrus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Functional Disturbances of the Hippocampus and Its Parahippocampal <b>Gyrus.</b> A {{number of}} studies suggest that this region of the brain is not working {{properly}} in murders and violent offenders in general.|$|E
25|$|When markers for {{different}} types of cells were analyzed, Einstein's brain was discovered to contain significantly more glia than normal brains in the left angular <b>gyrus,</b> an area thought {{to be responsible for}} mathematical processing and language.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they were looking at the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed {{to create a sense of}} how speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal <b>gyrus,</b> inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal <b>gyrus.</b> The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal <b>gyrus,</b> anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E
25|$|The orbital frontal cortex {{has been}} thought {{to play a}} role in {{behavioral}} disinhibition, and damage to the right inferior frontal <b>gyrus,</b> a specific subregion of the PFC, has been associated with deficits in stop-signal inhibition.|$|E
