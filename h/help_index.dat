When the received signals at the relaying nodes are in low SNR regime and the cooperation rates are not sufficiently high, compressed/quantized observations at relaying nodes become useless and only decoding can <b>help.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Low SNR, distributed receivers, network equiv-alence, peaky FSK, MMSE I...|$|E
40|$|As {{the amount}} of {{information}} stored on the Web increases at an amazing pace, it gets harder for search engines to retrieve the information relevant to a user. Recently, attention in the Web community has focused on the potentiality offered by hyperlinks to <b>help</b> <b>index</b> and organize information. Several methods have been proposed to take account of the knowledge induced by hyperlinks, with different objectives in mind. In this paper, we focus on three of them: improving document ranking by a propagation of document scores through the hyperlink structure, estimating the popularity of a Web page, and extracting the most important hubs and authorities related to a given topic. Using probabilistic argumentation systems, a technique for dealing with uncertain knowledge which integrate propositional logic and probability theory, we show how all these techniques can be modeled in a unified logical framework. This allows comparisons of the different methods for using hyperlinks, and illustrates some of their weaknesses. Some experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach. ...|$|E

Four perfonnance metrics arc measured by varying {{the maximum speed}} of mobile hosts, the number of connections, and the network size. Monle Carlo simulation method is used to estimate the expectation values of perfonnance metrics. The correlation between network topology changes and mobility is investi-gated by using linear regression analysis.

Our observation indicates that always sending packets through the shortest routes might cause congestion in sparse networks, but rarely in dense ones.

Fish populations of Great Meadows Salt Marsh in Stratford, Connecticut were sampled twice monthly over a 1 -year period using a beach seine. Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen was measured at each of 5 stations preceding each seine haul. A total of 6, 806 individuals comprising 17 species and weighing 21, 302. 5 grams were collected. One other species not collected in the day samples was collected in a night sample. Fundulus heteroclitus was found to be the most abundant species comprising over 70 percent of all the individuals collected. Three species; Fundulus heteroclitus. F. majalis, and Menidia menidia; were present in all four seasons. The number of species, number of individuals, and total biomass was seasonally correlated. Species diversity as measured by the Shannon-Wiener index (H'), Margalef index of richness (D), and the <b>Help</b> <b>index</b> of eveness (E), all fluctuated widely throughout the year with no seasonal correlation.

40|$|Pictures are {{important}} to the successful communication of scientific information. Drawing the right pictures and explaining them well is a vital part of statistical analysis, and plots accompany almost all the statistical techniques discussed in the text. The most useful types of pictures are: • Histograms, which display estimates of the probability distribution function or density for the observations when the observations are independent identically distributed, or otherwise replicated representatively. These are very useful for identifying features of the data distribution, such as skewness. • QQ plots, for example normal probability plots, are visual indications of whether the data approximately follow a specified probability distribution. They {{are important}} primarily in checking assumptions underlying statistical techniques. • Scatter plots, which look at pairs of random variable values, help in visual screening of relationships. Residual plots are an important sub-category, used in determining whether what is left after subtracting model-predicted values from observations is sufficiently patternless. These plots, charts, and diagrams can be created in SAS using PROC CHART and PROC PLOT, but these procedures produce very low quality graphics fit for printing on line printers. There is almost no point in bothering with these, as you want to be looking at the best resolution graphics available when plotting. SAS provides the procedures GPLOT and GCHART among others, which are not discussed in the text. Assistance can be found from the Help button on the ToolBox, or by calling on SAS System Help on the window Help menus. These bring you to a page with a heading GRAPHICS, clicking on which takes you to a page listing GCHART, GPLOT, Graphics Statements and Options, and all high level graphics commands. You cannot access these pages directly from the <b>Help</b> <b>Index,</b> since these commands {{are not part of the}} basic SAS programming language. There are many useful books on effective graphical methods that go far beyond those considered in this course. Many works can be found by searching the UMCP Library database under the subjects Graphic Methods and Statistics Graphic Methods. Among the most useful books are those of Tufte (1983, 1990) and Cleveland (1993) ...|$|E

The satisfactory evaluation results obtained at several stages show the importance of our approach in bridging the gap between meeting documents, independently from the language and domain.

Experimental results with the ORL database as the external face database and a real collection of historical photographs have shown the viability of the proposed tool.
