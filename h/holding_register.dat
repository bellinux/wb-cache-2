30|$|Software: The Java {{software}} application SmartGridFetch collects data over Modbus TCP/IP from the energy analyzers. For each device, the application starts a thread which requests 18 measurements {{at the same}} time every second. For each measurement, we request 2 registers with 2 bytes over the Read <b>Holding</b> <b>Register</b> function and so each measurement has a size of 4 bytes.|$|E
30|$|The {{software}} SmartGridFetch {{was implemented}} at a previous student work and continually developed and adjusted {{on the circumstances}} of the current work. It runs on the virtual machine of IM, collects data from energy analyzers over Modbus protocol, and saves them in the Apache Cassandra database. The software is written in Java and consists essentially of two main classes for requesting and receiving data over the Modbus TCP/IP protocol and for saving the values in a database. The software starts a thread pool with several threads for requesting data from energy analyzers. Each thread requests 18 measurements from one device every second. After receiving the response, each thread saves the measurements with a timestamp at database. The settings and device parameter like IP address, device description, measurements to be requested, and further settings can be set over an option class. The measurements were requested over the Modbus Read <b>Holding</b> <b>Register</b> function, so several continuous registers can be read out in one request. The initial SmartGridFetch application only provides requests of continuous register blocks over Modbus TCP/IP and only Siemens PAC 4200 devices. For the current work, we adjust the application, so {{that it is possible to}} request measurements saved at discontinuous register blocks and to support different device types, especially the Janitza devices we use. With these features, the software is more flexible.|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{transistors}} integrated on a chip continues to increase, a growing challenge is accurately modeling per-formance {{in the early stages}} of processor design. Analytical models have been employed to rapidly search for higher performance designs, and can provide insights that detailed simulators may not. This paper proposes techniques to predict the impact of pending cache hits, hardware prefetching, and realistic miss status <b>holding</b> <b>register</b> (MSHR) resources on superscalar performance in the presence of long latency memory systems when employing hybrid analytical models that apply instruction trace analysis. Pending cache hits are secondary references to a cache block for which a request has already been initiated but has not yet completed. We find pending hits resulting from spatial locality and the fine-grained selection of instruction profile window blocks used for analysis both have non-negligible influences on the accuracy of hybrid analytical models and subsequently propose techniques to account for their effects. We then introduce techniques to estimate the performance impact of data prefetching by modeling the timeliness of prefetches and to account for a limited number of MSHRs by restricting the size of profile window blocks. As with earlier hybrid analytical models, our approach is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than detailed simulations. When modeling pending hits for a processor with unlimited outstanding misses we improve the accuracy of our baseline by a factor of 3. 9, decreasing average error from 39. 7 % to 10. 3 %. When modeling a processor with data prefetching, a limited number of MSHRs, or both, the techniques result in an average error of 13. 8 %, 9. 5 % and 17. 8 %, respectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method of test {{generation}} for acyclic sequential circuits with <b>hold</b> <b>registers.</b> A complete (100 % fault efficiency) test sequence for an acyclic sequential circuit {{can be obtained by}} applying a combinational test generator to all the maximal time-expansion models (TEMs) of the circuit. We propose a class of acyclic sequential circuits for which the number of maximal TEMs is one, i. e, the maximum TEM exists. For a circuit in the class, test generation can be performed by using only the maximum TEM. The proposed class of sequential circuits with the maximum TEM properly includes several known classes of acyclic sequential circuits such as balanced structures and acyclic sequential circuits without <b>hold</b> <b>registers</b> for which test generation can be also performed by using a combinational test generator. Therefore, in general, the hardware overhead for partial scan based on the proposed structure is smaller than that based on balanced or acyclic sequential structure without <b>hold</b> <b>registers.</b> [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{universal}} {{serial bus}} (USB) is a Full duplex serial bus interface. USB devices receive the data from Transmitter Macro cell interface: a transmitter and a receiver section both of which uses 2 lines D+ and D- for transmission and reception. There are three functional blocks present in USB controller: Serial Interface Engine (SIE), UTMI and Device Specific Logic (DSL). The transmit <b>hold</b> <b>register</b> <b>holds</b> the data received from SIE and is converted to serial data and is send to transmit shift register. This serial data is added to some extra bits known as bit stuffing in order for clock synchronization and Manchester encoding. Then the encoded data is sent on to the serial bus. When the data is received on the serial bus, it is decoded, bit unstuffed and is sent to receive shift register. After the shift register is full, the Data is sent to receive <b>hold</b> <b>register.</b> The same can be designed using VHDL code and synthesize...|$|R

UTMI consists of transmitting and receiving sections, in which the transmitter of the UTMI sends data to different USB devices through D+ and D- lines whereas the receiver gets data on the same lines. UTMI {{is one of the}} important functional blocks of USB controller, which can transmit and receive data to or from USB devices. There are three functional blocks present in USB controller; those are Serial Interface Engine (SIE), UTMI and Device Specific Logic (DSL).
