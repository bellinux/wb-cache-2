40|$|The {{microturbine}} {{seems to}} be a viable option for implementation into Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) systems. A microturbine was constructed in the Gas Turbine Simulation software GSP in order to assess its viability for a low-power range extender. Due to the small magnitude of the turbine, scale effects need to be incorporated into the performance models. A microturbine has various advantages over other heat engines (Wankel, Piston, or Fuel Cell), and the capabilities in terms of range extension of the HEV are potentially superior. Through the use of the Engineering Design Process, a new microturbine design was developed that allows the system to be implemented into the HEV system. Aspects such as geometric size, weight, cost, availability, and ease of production were used to compare the different concepts and determine their feasibility. Empirical loss models previously researched were adapted and implemented into scheduling components of the microturbine base model. The model was used to simulate the required output data (Mechanical/ Electric Power, CO_ 2 emissions, Fuel flow rate, Exhaust gas temperature and Exhaust gas mass flow) for a range of predefined design powers (9, 15, 22, 30, 36 kW). Power-to-weight ratios and component dimensions were also calculated and sent for analysis. The data above was generated under two control schemes (fixed and variable speed) and at three power codes; maximum power (100 %), part load (60 %) and idle (20 %). The HEV model used this data to configure and size its own system. Simulations of design and optimization are important as it restricts the size of the HEV. The results suggest that the variable speed control scheme will extend the life of the system and reduce emissions substantially. If the microturbine is operated at or below <b>ISA</b> <b>conditions</b> the scheme offers numerous other advantages. However the control system is far more complex and will cost more to develop. Recommendations have been highlighted for model configuration improvement and focus on the control system is important for continued programme development.

40|$|Gas turbine {{diagnostics}} {{is as old}} as the {{gas turbine}} itself. Over the years, performance based diagnostics allowed for a shift from time-based maintenance to more economical condition based maintenance playing a fundamental role in enhancing the availability and reliability of gas turbines. By monitoring the condition of the engine over time, maintenance actions can be taken based on information collected from the field. MTT (Micro Turbine Technology) is currently developing a low cost 3 kWe micro-turbine CHP (Combined Heat and Power) -system by using off-the-shelf technologies. Once the system will be launched on the market an organized, cost-effective maintenance procedure will be required. The objective of this M. Sc. thesis project was to develop and demonstrate a Gas Path Analysis diagnostic concept for the micro-turbine. Gas Path Analysis (GPA) is a method to assess the condition of the gas turbine by using performance measurements from the gas path. The feasibility of the diagnostic concept was demonstrated by some case studies using data from the first generation field test units. After reviewing a number of gas turbine diagnostic techniques, a non-linear model based gas path analysis approach was chosen. For the development of the diagnostic concept, a non-linear model of a healthy reference engine was used to simulate the off-design behaviour of the engine and derive healthy performance parameter baselines. These baselines are used to compare the performance of field engines against. A component based modelling environment called GSP or the Gas turbine Simulation Program was used to simulate the effect of ambient conditions and deterioration on performance. The diagnostic concept relies on the principle that deterioration causes corrected measurement parameters to shift from the healthy reference baselines. Measurement performance parameters are first corrected to standard <b>ISA</b> <b>conditions</b> before being compared against the healthy baselines. By modelling specific types of deterioration in GSP, signature parameter shifts could be recorded for each of the deterioration modes. These signature parameter shifts are used to compare shifts in performance parameters against and determine the closest pattern-match which can be used to identify the most probable cause of deterioration. The proposed concept is capable of performing engine level diagnostics and partially component level diagnostics. Multiple fault diagnostics and quantifying the level of deterioration are more difficult due to the limited number of sensors and the relatively large impact of second-order effects such as heat-loss, auxiliary power take-off, mechanical losses, etc. The performance parameter baselines together with the derived rulesets can easily be implemented in a maintenance tool making the concept flexible and easy to use.

In this paper we re-examine the UIP condition for four major currencies using weekly data. Our study has a number of novel features. Thus we conduct specification tests using residuals from the LUS class in addition to the OLS class and implement error orthogonality tests which, in contrast to many of the extant empirical efficiency tests, use a specific selection criterion.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of CO 2 emissions is strongly {{linked with the}} improvement of engine specific fuel consumption, along with the {{reduction of}} engine nacelle drag and weight. One alternative design approach to improving specific fuel consumption is to consider a geared fan combined with an increased overall pressure ratio intercooled core performance cycle. The thermal benefits from intercooling have been well documented in the literature. Nevertheless, {{there is very little}} information available in the public domain with respect to design space exploration of such an engine concept when combined with a geared fan. The present work uses a multidisciplinary conceptual design tool to analyze the option of an intercooled core geared fan aero engine for long haul applications with a 2020 entry into service technology level assumption. With minimum mission fuel in mind, the results indicate as optimal values a pressure ratio split exponent of 0. 38 and an intercooler mass flow ratio of 1. 18 at hot-day top of climb <b>conditions.</b> At <b>ISA</b> midcruise <b>conditions</b> a specific thrust of 86 m/s, a jet velocity ratio of 0. 83, an intercooler effectiveness of 56 %, and an overall pressure ratio value of 76 are likely to be a good choice. A 70, 000 lbf intercooled turbofan engine is large enough to make efficient use of an all-axial compression system, particularly within a geared fan configuration, but intercooling is perhaps more likely to be applied to even larger engines. The proposed optimal jet velocity ratio is actually higher than the value one would expect by using standard analytical expressions, primarily because this design variable affects core efficiency at midcruise due to a combination of several different subtle changes to the core cycle and core component efficiencies at this condition. The analytical expressions do not consider changes in core efficiency and the beneficial effect of intercooling on transfer efficiency, nor do they account for losses in the bypass duct and jet pipe, while a relatively detailed engine performance model, such as the one utilized in this study, does. Mission fuel results from a surrogate model are in good agreement with the results obtained from a rubberized-wing aircraft model for some of the design parameters. This indicates {{that it is possible to}} replace an aircraft model with specific fuel consumption and weight penalty exchange rates. Nevertheless, drag count exchange rates have to be utilized to properly assess changes in mission fuel for those design parameters that affect nacelle diameter...|$|R

In recent years, a paradigm shift has occurred for the treatment of MDD in that clinicians are aiming toward achieving re-mission (score ≤ 7 on the 17 -item Hamil-ton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D 17]) instead of just response (≥ 50 % reduction in symptoms).

The Pearl River Delta (PRD), the 3 rd most important economic district of China, is chosen in this paper to extract the ISA information based on Landsat images of 1998, 2003 and 2008 by using a linear spectral un-mixing method and to monitor impervious surface change by analyzing the multi-temporal Landsat-derived fractional impervious surface. Results of this study were as follows: (1) the area of ISA in the PRD increased 79. 09 % from 1998 to 2003 and 26. 88 % from 2003 to 2008 separately; (2) the spatial distribution of ISA was described according to the 1998 / 2003 percentage respectively. Most of middle and high percentage ISA was located in northwestern and southeastern of the whole delta, and middle percentage ISA was mainly located in the city interior, high percentage ISA was mainly located in the suburban around the city accordingly; (3) the expanding direction and trend of high percentage ISA was discussed {{in order to understand the}} change of urban in this delta; High percentage ISA moved from inner city to edge of urban area during 1998 – 2003 and moved to the suburban area that far from the urban area mixed with jumpily and gradually during 2003 – 2008. According to the discussion of high percentage ISA spatial expanded direction, it could be found out that high percentage ISA moved outward from the centre line of Pearl River of the whole delta while a high ISA percentage in both shores of the Pearl River Estuary moved toward the Pearl River; (4) combining the change of <b>ISA</b> with social <b>conditions,</b> the driving relationship was analyzed in detail.

40|$|One of {{the current}} {{proposed}} strategies for the disposal of intermediate level radioactive waste (ILW) is that of an underground facility termed a geological disposal facility (GDF). Under the anoxic alkaline conditions (10. 5 13) expected to develop within an ILW-GDF cellulose will undergo chemical degradation {{to a range of}} cellulose degradation products (CDP). The major components of which will be the isosaccharinic acids (ISA). ISA is of particular interest with regards to the long term performance of a GDF due to its ability to complex radionuclides altering their solubility and thus the long term retention of such radionuclides. The removal of these complexants by microbial action could therefore have an impact upon the long term performance of an ILW-GDF. The biofilm mode of existence is able to increase the resistance of microbes to environmental stresses and could be a mechanism for microbial survival under ILW-GDF conditions. Recent research has shown the ability of microbes from an ILW-GDF anthropogenic analogue site to degrade <b>ISA</b> under hyperalkaline <b>conditions,</b> however, no studies have yet looked at the ability of alkaliphilic biofilms to survive under these <b>conditions</b> whilst using <b>ISA</b> as a carbon source. The aim of this work was to ascertain the ability of alkaliphilic biofilm consortia to survive and degrade ISA under near field conditions and to further investigate the mechanisms of this survival. Using cotton bait, biofilm was able to be grown in-situ at an analogue site located at Harpur Hill, Buxton, UK. Enrichment of this biofilm using CDP driven microcosms under both sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions at pH 11 showed the degradation of the α-ISA, β-ISA and xylo ISA types through a fermentation pathway to acetate and hydrogen. Investigation into the morphology of these microcosms revealed the microbes to existing within flocs or aggregates of EPS which had a complex EPS composition. Microelectrode profiling of these flocs revealed areas of lower pH than the external pH to be present within the interior of these flocs, a finding which was attributed to microbial survival under the alkaline conditions. Floc cultures were able to form thick dense biofilm within sand columns which enhanced the rate of ISA degradation and facilitated the production of methane and sulphide under relevant conditions. Micro-electrode pH profiling again demonstrated low pH areas within the biofilm which contributed towards biofilm survival and ISA degradation up to pH 13. Biofilms were able to impact ILW-GDF relevant surfaces with evidence of carbonation and EPS substances found upon NRVB, steel and graphite surfaces. The ability of biofilms to form under ILW-GDF conditions could facilitate microbial survival under ILW-GDF conditions and have an impact upon the long term performance of an ILW-GDF. This could be through the carbonation of NRVB surfaces, the blocking of pore throats, gas production, microbial induced corrosion related to sulphide production and through the removal of radionuclide complexants...|$|R
40|$|In the {{conventional}} helicopter, the transmission and powerplant systems {{are the major}} production and operator direct operating cost drivers. Additionally, they are related to helicopter safety and reliability concerns and impose performance boundaries. As a consequence, {{they need to be}} addressed. Adapting the transmission and powerplant systems with the introduction of more electric technologies, which are reported to be more reliable and cost friendly, involves a gross weight penalty, which cannot be accepted from a performance viewpoint. The implementation of liquid hydrogen, with the objective to introduce a sustainable energy carrier and free cold source for the high temperature superconductive devices driving the tail rotor, appears unattractive, from either a weight or a exploitation standpoint. Biodiesel could be an alternative to Avgas driven configurations, but at the moment, it has questionable chemical characteristics and is therefore discarded. Conceptual alternatives to {{the conventional}} helicopter explored in an attempt to verify their ability to overcome the stated performance, safety and cost aspects, are subjected to the same problems, the Turbine Driven Rotor (TDR) helicopter configuration excepted. The TDR helicopter drives a coaxial rotor configuration by means of a rotor embedded Ljungstr¨om turbine, omitting the need for a mechanical transmission system. Three TDR helicopter thermodynamic cycles are proposed. The piston engine powered TDR cycle shows to be of interest for the low weight class helicopters. The turbofan powered TDR cycle is preferred in the mid and high weight categories, benefitting from its configurational simplicity. The more complex turboshaft powered TDR cycle requires a heat exchanger, is heavier and thus not recommended. With respect to the Ljungstrom turbine, the loss models of Soderberg and Ainley and Mathieson used to establish its geometry and performance characteristics are generally acceptable and appear coherent, while a deviation angle correction is developed to cope with the radial outflow configuration of the turbine. Similarly, loss models for the internal leakage and disk friction are proposed. However, these models could not be substantiated by means of experiments. A design methodology to implement the Ljungstrom turbine in the helicopter rotor head is presented and allows adjusting the thermodynamic cycle characteristics such as to maximise the performance gain with respect to the conventional helicopter. For nominal operating <b>conditions,</b> <b>ISA</b> SLS, a VLR-class TDR helicopter shows to bear a performance gain of 10 % over a conventional helicopter when equipped with an Avgas engine and 14 % when a Diesel engine is used. Hereby, the cycle pressure ratio remained low, i. e. approximately 1. 25, allowing a turbine polytropic effciency of 87 %. An identical study with a NH- 90 -class TDR helicopter proved to offer a performance potential of 50 % at a cycle pressure ratio around 1. 6 and a turbine polytropic effciency of 90 %. In all cases, the gas temperature at the inlet of Ljungstrom turbine remained below the rotor bearing temperature limit of 400 K...|$|R
