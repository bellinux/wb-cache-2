Material as needed was sent from the surge hopper through a jaw crusher {{and into a}} shelf type oxidation furnace. Here the metallic uranium was oxidized to triuranium octoxide (U3O8). The material discharged from the furnace was lifted to a surge hopper and then as needed was sent through a roll mill and ground to -325 mesh size. It was then fed into carbon brick digestion tanks where the uranium was dissolved in hydrochloric acid containing a little sodium chlorate. The undissolved solids were filtered off and dumped into a truck, which hauls the spent material to a scrap dump.

40|$|Manganese furnace dust {{is made up}} of {{volatiles}} {{and fine}} particles of the raw materials collected from the off-gas during smelting of manganese alloys. Impediments to the recycling of the manganese furnace dust back to the ferroalloy furnaces are handling due to the presence of tar, and the potential accumulation of zinc in the furnaces, which can cause irregularities in their operation. The aim of the thesis was to establish conditions for zinc removal from the dust and assess the feasibility of the dust recycling in the Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company sinter plant. Major findings are: - Manganese furnace dust taken from the settling ponds contained water, carbonaceous materials (tar), and metal oxides. The carbon content of the <b>dried</b> <b>furnace</b> dust was about 20 % and the average manganese and zinc contents were 33. 4 and 1. 29 %, respectively. Moisture content was 30 - 60 %. - The tar components were aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, their derivatives, and sulphur- and oxygen-containing compounds {{with a wide range of}} carbon number (15 - 28) and boiling point (230 - 530 oC). Light hydrocarbons were not detected. - If manganese furnace dust was recycled to ferroalloy furnaces through the sintering plant, the overall zinc input had increased by 51 - 143 %. Sustainable utilisation of manganese furnace dust should include enhanced zinc removal. - Reduction of zinc oxide from manganese furnace dust pellets started at 800 oC. Zinc oxide was reduced to zinc vapour by tar in the dust. Temperature and gas atmosphere were key parameters affecting the zinc removal from the dust. The zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature and was close to completion at 1100 oC. - Optimal conditions for removal of zinc from the furnace dust include: temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust fraction in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. - Zinc removal in the processing of manganese furnace dust in the sinter plant was low because of zinc reoxidation in the sinter bed.

The experience in the operation of such systems has shown that one of the problems of their functioning is a significant discrepancy between the actual and the calculated distribution of the heat flow in the combustion chamber.

In these circumstances, there is the need for work on the definition of state of the most thermal stress elements, an estimation of their residual life, issuing recommendations to remove them from operation or development of a relatively economical measures to prolong the life of these units. One of the main elements of flame installations, from the characteristics of which depends largely their effectiveness, terms of work, the formation of the distribution of heat flow in the combustion chamber, etc. is a burner device. Operating experience of burners, which used in power generation and industry, shows that in many cases they have low technical and economic performance, especially when they working on variable parameters of the working process, mainly due to the outdated methods of organization in their workflow. The main approach to the development of highly efficient burners is that they used schems of mixing fuel and oxidizer, which provides optimum ratio of the combustion components, implemented mikroflame highly efficient combustion of fuel in the stabilizer system of a relatively small size.

The samples were crushed, <b>dried</b> in controlled <b>furnace</b> for around twenty four hours, and then stored for four weeks in l plastic Marinelli beakers. The gamma radiation of the samples was measured, employing high resolution γ- ray spectroscopy with an accumulating time for about 80000 sec. each. From the measured γ-ray spectra, activity concentrations were determined for marble samples 238 U (0. 71 - 44. 1 Bq/kg), 232 Th (0. 10 - 32. 0 Bq/kg), 226 Ra (0. 36 - 32. 4 Bq/kg) and 40 K (0. 68 - 897. 1 Bq/kg) while for granite 238 U (0. 03 - 314. 4 Bq/kg), 232 Th (0. 02 - 186. 4 Bq/kg), 226 Ra (0. 03 - 147. 0 Bq/kg) and 40 K (0. 28 – 1531. 7 Bq/kg). The radium equivalent activity, radiation hazard indices and absorbed dose rate for all samples were estimated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a feasibility study of recycling manganese furnace dust generated in production of ferromanganese and silicomanganese at Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company, Australia. <b>Dried</b> man-ganese <b>furnace</b> dust contains about 20 wt % of carbon, in average 33. 4 wt % of manganese and 1. 3 wt % of zinc. Manganese in the dust {{is in the form}} of MnO, Mn 3 O 4 and MnCO 3; zinc is mainly in the form of ZnO and ZnSO 4. Analysis of the zinc balance with dust recycling showed that to keep zinc intake at the acceptable level, it should be partly removed from the dust. In the reduction laboratory experiments, zinc oxide was reduced to zinc vapour by tar of the dust. Reduction of zinc oxide started at 800 oC and zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature; removal of zinc was close to completion at 1100 oC. Optimal conditions for removing zinc from the dust include temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust frac-tion in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. In the sintering of manganese ore with addition of manganese dust in the sintering pot, zinc was reoxidised and deposited in the sinter bed. Removal of zinc in the sintering pot tests was in the range 4 - 17 %. Up to 30 % zinc removal was achieved from the bottom layer of the sinter bed. It can be concluded that zinc removal will be low during the processing of manganese fur-nace dust in the sinter plant. The zinc removal rate will be the highest when pelletised manganese furnace dust is added to the bottom layer of the sintering bed...|$|R
