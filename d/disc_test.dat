Numerous breeding programs have been established worldwide in order to screen and test for local hybrids for disease resistant of Phytophthora spp. For example, a study in Cameroon assessed the performance of local cocoa cultivars (the southern and northern Cameroon cultivar) compared to the local and international gene bank cultivars. The local genebank cultivar consisted of F1 hybrid of Upper Amazon X Trinidad, and an international cultivar from Papua New Guinea, and Latin America were provided through International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad.

A total of 1, 407 Candida strains of different species were tested, and the results were compared with the MIC results. The recently published National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoint criteria have been used. Isolates were classified as susceptible if the MIC for the isolates was ≤ 8 μg/ml, susceptible-dose dependent (S-DD) if the MIC was 16 to 32 μg/ml, and resistant if the MIC was ≥ 64 μg/ml. All 77 resistant strains and 121 of 122 S-DD strains had fluconazole zone diameters of ≤ 21 mm, and most of the strains (91 %) had zone diameters of ≤ 15 mm. It was not possible to distinguish between resistant and S-DD strains by the <b>disc</b> <b>test.</b> Among a total of 1, 208 strains found to be susceptible by the microdilution method, 49 (4. 1 %) yielded fluconazole zone sizes of ≤ 21 mm and would have been misclassified as resistant or S-DD strains {{on the basis of the}} <b>disc</b> <b>test.</b> For the majority (86 %) of these 49 strains the fluconazole MIC was 8 μg/ml.

The aim of this study was to determine the Nx susceptibility for S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates (1991 - 2001) associated with enteric fever in Kolkata, India. Materials and methods: The clinical S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates (n= 421) were subjected to Nx (the prototype quinolone, which is used for in vitro screening tests for fluoroquinolone resistance) susceptibility <b>testing</b> by <b>disc</b> diffusion and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. The test results, from the two methods, were compared by scattergram analysis, and the sensitivity and specificity in determining Nx resistance by <b>disc</b> <b>testing,</b> with respect to MIC values, were calculated. Results: The S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates were categorized into resistant, intermediate and susceptible to Nx by <b>disc</b> <b>testing</b> and MIC. The isolates showed year-wise increment of Nx MICs (0. 5 - 256 g/ml) during 1991 - 2001. High sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (92. 96 %) in determining Nx resistance by <b>disc</b> <b>testing,</b> compared to MIC values were obtained for the isolates. Conclusion: Increasing trend of Nx resistance, as determined by two in vitro methods, among S. enterica serovar Typhi isolates was noticed; such Nx resistance may help predict decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (an anti-typhoid fluoroquinolone) among emerging S. enterica serovar Typhi in our part of the globe...|$|R

Imipenem resistance was determined by three different methods (disc-diffusion, Vitek 2 and E test). Screening for MBL production was done by imipenem-EDTA combined <b>disc</b> <b>test,</b> imipenem-EDTA double-disc synergy test, imipenem-EDTA MBL E test and EDTA disc potentiation using four cephalosporins.

40|$|The tensile {{strength}} and fracturing behavior of Carrara marble {{subjected to the}} dynamic Brazilian <b>disc</b> <b>test</b> using the split Hopkinson pressure bar technique are determined and compared with those obtained by the conventional quasistatic Brazilian <b>disc</b> <b>test.</b> Detailed observation of the cracking processes is aided by high-speed video footage captured at a frame rate of 100, 000 frames per second. The dynamic increase factor is computed, revealing a strong strain rate dependence of the Carrara marble when subjected to strain rates above 1 s- 1. Similar to the quasistatic loading tests, conspicuous white zones/patches commonly appear prior to the initiation of visible cracks in the dynamic loading tests. Identification of the white patch initiation and evolution is aided by image comparison software. Comparing the cracking and failure processes under quasistatic and dynamic loading, some distinct differences in the white patch geometry and initiation load are observed. In addition, {{the extent of the}} compressive failure zones around the contact points between the loading platens and specimens is found to increase with the strain rate. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

40|$|Resistance to broad {{spectrum}} &# 946; lactams, mediated by extended spectrum beta lactamase (ES&# 946;L) and AmpC &# 946;L enzymes {{is an increasing}} problem worldwide. Presence of these in clinical infections can result in treatment failure {{if one of the}} second or third generation cephalosporins is used. Therefore, it is recommended that any ES&# 946;L-producing organism according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) criteria can be reported as resistant to all extended spectrum &# 946; lactam antibiotics regardless of the susceptibility test results. In this study, a total of 250 Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates were subjected to Double <b>disc</b> <b>test</b> and AmpC <b>disc</b> <b>test</b> for the detection of ES&# 946;L- and AmpC &# 946;L-producing strains, respectively. Prevalence of ES&# 946;L- and AmpC &# 946;L-producing strains among E. coli isolates, over a 3 -month-period in the hospital-based population of Jaipur, was 64. 80 &#x 0025; (162 / 250). AmpC &# 946;L producers were 24. 00 &#x 0025; (60 / 250) and co-existence of ES&# 946;L and AmpC &# 946;L was detected in 8. 00 &#x 0025; (20 / 250) of the isolates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} the split Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar technique was used together with {{high speed photography}} and digital image correlation to investigate the dynamic tension behavior of Kuru Granite. High speed photography at 200. 000 fps was combined with digital image correlation technique to obtain the displacement and strain fields {{on the surface of}} Brazilian <b>disc</b> <b>test</b> samples. The advantage of such a high frequency is that strains prior to the dynamic failure can be observed even if the material is brittle...|$|E
40|$|Regression {{lines were}} {{calculated}} for cephalothin, cephalexin, and cephaloridine by relating zone diameters of inhibition to minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) obtained in Mueller-Hinton agar and in Trypticase Soy Agar. A regression line was calculated for cephaloglycin by obtaining MIC values in Trypticase Soy Agar at pH 6. 6. Regression lines calculated from MIC values in Mueller-Hinton agar were practically superimposable on those based on MIC values in Trypticase Soy Agar. Organisms susceptible by <b>disc</b> <b>testing</b> to cephalothin were usually susceptible to cephalexin and cephaloridine...|$|R
40|$|Cefoxitin is {{a potent}} inducer of the mecA {{regulatory}} system. It is being recommended for detection of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) when using disk diffusion testing. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of cefoxitin <b>disc</b> diffusion <b>test</b> to characterize MRSA and compare it with oxacillin agar screening and detection of mecA gene by PCR. Materials and Methods: Fifty strains of S. aureus isolated from clinical samples {{were used in the}} study. Routine antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed including oxacillin disk. Oxacillin screen agar plates with 4 &#x 0025; NaCl and 6 &#x 00 B 5;g/ml of oxacillin were inoculated and interpreted as per standard guidelines. Cefoxitin <b>disc</b> diffusion <b>test</b> was performed using 30 &#x 00 B 5;g disc and zone sizes were measured. PCR for amplification of the mecA gene was performed. Results: Out of the 50 isolates, 28 were found to be methicillin resistant by oxacillin <b>disc</b> diffusion <b>test,</b> 30 were resistant by oxacillin screen agar method, and 32 were resistant with cefoxitin disc diffusion. For these 32 isolates mecA gene was positive. Conclusion: Results of cefoxitin <b>disc</b> diffusion <b>test</b> is in concordance with the PCR for mecA gene. Thus, the test can be an alternative to PCR for detection of MRSA in resource constraint settings...|$|R
40|$|A {{concentration}} of 16 mg/l spectinomycin incorporated in agar gave the best discrimination between Neisseria gonorrhoeae sensitive and resistant to spectinomycin. This method was compared with spectinomycin sensitivity testing with 25 micrograms or 100 micrograms discs. Both methods agreed fully for 197 spectinomycin sensitive and three spectinomycin resistant gonococci. The agar incorporation "breakpoint" concentration technique failed {{to detect a}} small spectinomycin resistant population in a fourth isolate, which was detected by <b>disc</b> <b>testing.</b> It {{may be possible to}} predict the emergence of spectinomycin resistance among strains of N gonorrhoeae...|$|R
