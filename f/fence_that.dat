5|$|The square {{once was}} {{surrounded}} by an iron <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> was no longer present by 1905. By the 1860s, the square was a heavily wooded park. In 1876-7, trees that lined the square along main street were removed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> {{separates}} the park {{from the city}} runs along a highway leaving the airport, this is one fact many Kenyans are proud of – this park is the only natural safari park that has a city scape background {{that can be seen}} from almost any part of the park, as seen in the picture below of the giraffe and the sky scrapers.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was also}} once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 {{and many of}} the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and (less securely) to the site boundary.|$|E

5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> surrounds Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.|$|E
5|$|The site of Pickett's Charge {{is one of}} the best-maintained {{portions}} of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road {{in the direction of the}} Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault—Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E

50|$|Fences {{are most}} often {{designed}} so that pressure placed upon them by the animal does not damage {{the integrity of the}} fence. The exact type of fencing used depends on the species being housed in the exhibit. “Apron fencing” or <b>fencing</b> <b>that</b> extends underground is used to enclose species that can dig. “Overhang fencing”, or <b>fencing</b> <b>that</b> curves towards the inside of the exhibit at the top is used to enclose species that can jump or climb. A new movement in enclosure design is to disguise safety fences with natural features such as ivy, or to paint them black so they appear invisible when viewed from a distance.|$|R
50|$|There {{are eight}} tennis courts altogether, {{each one of}} them being a hard court. A unique feature to its design are the “California Corners”, which {{includes}} quarter <b>fences</b> <b>that</b> run along the sidelines to allow uninterrupted play.|$|R
50|$|One {{should be}} {{extremely}} careful while exploring the area, as open pits leading down into old mine shafts present a hazard for falling. While some pits may have <b>fences</b> <b>that</b> mark such dangerous cavities, many {{have fallen into}} disuse, leading to possible injury.|$|R
25|$|Installation of a <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> {{divides the}} {{location}} into two areas. Most {{of these activities}} have also been documented by ISIS in satellite imagery reports, dated 29 November 2012, 12 December 2012 and 25 January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Scrap metals {{were needed}} to build tanks and aircraft, so {{hundreds}} of Penarth homes lost their traditional Victorian iron railings from the front gardens during the war years. Even All Saints' Church in Victoria Square lost its magnificently ornate gates and the railing <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> surrounded the square's green.|$|E
25|$|The regulation-sized UC San Diego {{softball}} {{field is}} located {{just south of}} Triton Soccer Stadium. It is usually separated {{from the rest of}} RIMAC Field by a <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> measures 220 feet from home plate. In 2008, the school spent $8.6 million to expand the bleachers, improve the dugouts and field, and add a press box.|$|E
50|$|In October 2016, a group named Complexe de Baseball Victoria (CBV) officially {{took over}} {{management}} of the stadium from the city. An estimated 3.3 M$ will be invested to install a synthetic field and <b>fences</b> <b>that</b> can be moved to create 2-3 smaller fields.|$|R

25|$|On November 15, 2007, {{gaps in the}} <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> {{had been}} left to allow access to Memorial Stadium for California's final home game were filled in, and barbed wire was mounted around the top.

25|$|The {{stars of}} Pisces were {{incorporated}} into several constellations in Chinese astronomy. Wai-ping ("Outer Enclosure") was a <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> kept a pig farmer from falling into the marshes and kept the pigs where they belonged. It was represented by Alpha, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Mu, Nu, and Xi Piscium. The marshes were represented by the four stars designated Phi Ceti. The northern fish of Pisces {{was a part of}} the House of the Sandal, Koui-siou.|$|E
25|$|The American troops crossed Charlestown {{neck and}} {{proceeded}} up the gentle slopes of Bunker Hill. From there Prescott, {{for reasons that}} were never made completely clear, went against orders, assembled a separate party of 1200 men and continued on two hundred yards further down the peninsula to Breed's Hill and {{under cover of darkness}} began construction of a redoubt and a rail <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> extended to Mystic River, with Gridley in command of construction, while the secondary fortifications were constructed on Bunker Hill. This later proved to be a major tactical error.|$|E
50|$|The desert mimosa {{is often}} used as food for cattle and livestock, as fuel, {{construction}} material as well as living <b>fences</b> <b>that</b> grow into barriers in the wild {{and can be used}} as decorative fences. The pink flowers of the mimosa make it a good ground cover for gardens.|$|R
50|$|The {{documentary}} film One Day in September claims that {{security in the}} athletes' village was unfit for the Games and that athletes could {{come and go as}} they pleased. Athletes could sneak past security, and go to other countries' rooms, by going over the <b>fencing</b> <b>that</b> encompassed the village.|$|R
5000|$|Marathon Futurex {{has more}} than 15 sky gardens with glass <b>fences</b> <b>that</b> act as heat {{barriers}} during the day. There is a rain water harvesting system [...] and a captive sewage-disposal-plant that aims at zero discharge of water thus helping in water conservation when the building becomes fully functional.|$|R
25|$|Mongolia's Southern and Central Zones occupy terrain {{traditionally}} used by nomadic herdsmen. Diverting already scarce {{water resources}} to mining could jeopardize their livelihoods. In harsh conditions of Gobi desert herders {{have a very}} specific way of organizing summer pasture and its rotation, access to water, hay collection and hay storage. Any changes to these unique practises hamper the livelihoods of nomads. Steel <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> surrounds the gaping mine blocks traditional herding corridors and {{makes it difficult for}} the herd animals to find water. Roads constructed by the mine owners present additional barriers to animals.|$|E
25|$|Carol covers {{herself in}} walker viscera to {{blend into the}} horde as to {{approach}} the train yard unseen. She ignites a propane tank near the <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> explodes, creating a breach for the walkers to enter; this creates a panic throughout Terminus that allows Rick and the others to overpower their captors and kill them. They free {{the others in the}} box car and make their way out of Terminus. Carol, meanwhile, discovers the supplies taken from Rick's group and recovers some of them. She then finds Mary, and gets into a fight with her when she refuses to tell her where Rick's group was kept. When Carol gets the upper hand, Mary pleads for her life, insisting they were good people once, but Carol, disgusted with their cannibalism, shoots at her leg and leaves her to be overwhelmed by walkers.|$|E
25|$|The Hustlin' Rebels are the {{baseball}} team at UNLV and play their games at Earl E. Wilson Stadium at Roger Barnson Field which seats 3,000 {{and is on the}} UNLV campus. The stadium opened in 1994. In 1997, the infield playing surface was replaced and the outfield fences was replaced with a new <b>fence</b> <b>that</b> stands 12ft high. In 2007 the stadium received a new playing surface. In 2010, the infield grass was replaced, new black padding was installed behind the backstop, a fresh halo was installed around the batting circle and the facility received a fresh coat of red paint. Future plans call for a new clubhouse, a new synthetic outfield surface, an overhang for the bleachers, a two-story press box, new batting cages and a video scoreboard to replace the scoreboard which was installed in 2009.|$|E
