5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>tanager</b> and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey-headed</b> <b>tanager</b> (Eucometis penicillata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae, {{the only one in}} the genus Eucometis.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by the German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius MÃ¼ller in 1776. Molecular analysis has shown that along with C. pileatus, the grey pileated finch, this species belongs in the Thraupidae, the tanager family. The pair form a sister group to a group containing the fulvous-crested tanager, the black-goggled tanager, the shrike tanagers and the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>tanager.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{observed}} in the park include the rufous-tailed jacamar (Galbula ruficauda), squirrel cuckoo (Piaya cayana), southern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum), purple-throated euphonia (Euphonia chlorotica), <b>grey-headed</b> <b>tanager</b> (Eucometis penicillata), barred antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus), pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus), sepia-capped flycatcher (Leptopogon amaurocephalus), silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), planalto tyrannulet (Phyllomyias fasciatus), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus).|$|E

50|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by the German naturalist Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied in 1821. Molecular analysis has shown that C. pileatus and the red pileated finch (C. cucullatus) belong in the tanager family, Thraupidae, and form a sister group to a group containing the fulvous-crested tanager, the black-goggled tanager, the shrike tanagers and the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>tanager.</b> There are three recognised subspecies; C. p. brevicaudus from northern Colombia and northern Venezuela; C. p. rostratus from the upper Magdalena River Valley, Colombia; and C. p. pileatus from central and eastern Brazil.|$|E
40|$|There are 23 {{species of}} Myrsidea {{recognized}} from passerine thraupid hosts. Five new species parasitic on {{members of this}} avian family are described. They and their type hosts are Myrsidea rozsai ex the Thick-billed Euphonia, Euphonia laniirostris d'Orbigny & Lafresnaye, M. cruickshanki ex the Carmiol's Tanager, Chlorothraupis carmioli (Lawrence), M. patersoni ex the <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Tanager,</b> Eucometis penicillata (Spix), M. pagei ex the Crimson-backed Tanager, Ramphocelus dimidiatus Lafresnaye, and M. valimi ex the Tawny-capped Euphonia, Euphonia anneae Cassin. The first species {{is placed in the}} bonariensis species group, while the remaining four are placed in the fusca species group. Sequences of a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene were compared to other species of Myrsidea and were highly divergent...|$|E
