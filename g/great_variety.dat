5|$|A Literary Polish {{language}} breakthrough {{came under}} the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his Brief Discourse, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a <b>great</b> <b>variety</b> of literary pieces. Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.|$|E

Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found {{in all parts of}} the city.

5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} <b>great</b> <b>variety</b> of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending {{on energy and}} carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

The large continuous capital that encircles the central pillar of the chapter house is markedly different in style to the stiff-leaf of the Early English period. In contrast to the bold projections and undercutting of the earlier work, it has a rippling form and is clearly identifiable as grapevine.|$|E

Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which {{are able to}} digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|Concerning literature, {{there is}} a <b>great</b> <b>variety</b> of authors, genres, and editions {{produced}} in Polish.
