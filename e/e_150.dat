40|$|This EFSA {{statement}} is a refined exposure assessment of caramel colours (<b>E</b> <b>150</b> a, <b>E</b> <b>150</b> c and <b>E</b> <b>150</b> d) {{taking into account}} additional information on its use in foods as consumed. The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of caramel colours (<b>E</b> <b>150</b> a, <b>E</b> <b>150</b> b, <b>E</b> <b>150</b> c, <b>E</b> <b>150</b> d) used as food additives in 2011.

40|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a {{heterogeneous}} group of hereditary disorders of the retina caused by mutation in genes of the photoreceptor proteins with an autosomal dominant (adRP), autosomal recessive (arRP), or X-linked pattern of inheritance. Although {{there are over}} 100 identified mutations in the opsin gene associated with RP, {{only a few of}} them are inherited with the arRP pattern. <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K is the first reported missense mutation associated with arRP. This opsin mutation is located in the second cytoplasmic loop of this G protein-coupled receptor. <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K opsin expressed in HEK 293 cells and reconstituted with 11 -cis-retinal displayed an absorption spectrum similar to the wild type (WT) counterpart and activated G protein transducin slightly faster than WT receptor.

40|$|Rhodopsin is the rod {{photoreceptor}} G protein-coupled receptor {{responsible for}} capturing light. Mutations in the gene encoding this protein {{can lead to}} a blinding disease called retinitis pigmentosa, which is inherited frequently in an autosomal dominant manner. The <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K opsin mutant associated with rarely occurring autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa localizes to trans-Golgi network membranes rather than to plasma membranes of rod photoreceptor cells. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying opsin retention in the Golgi apparatus. Electrostatic calculations reveal that the <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K mutant features an overall accumulation of positive charges between helices H-IV and H-II. Human <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K and several other closely related opsin mutants were then expressed in HEK- 293 cells. Spectral characteristics and functional biochemistry of each mutant were analyzed after reconstitution with the cis-retinoid chromophore. UV-visible spectra and rhodopsin/transducin activation assays revealed only minor differences between the purified wild type control and rhodopsin mutants. However, partial restoration of the surface electrostatic charge in the compensatory R 69 E/E 150 K double mutant rescues the plasma membrane localization of opsin. These findings emphasize the fundamental importance of electrostatic interactions for appropriate membrane trafficking of opsin and advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa due to the <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K mutation...|$|E

40|$|The polysialic acid (polySia) capsule of Escherichia coli Kl {{is a key}} {{virulence}} {{determinant of}} the organism, allowing it to evade host defenses. The proteins necessary for expres-sion of the capsule are encoded by the 17 kb kps gene cluster. This cluster contains two genes, kpsM and kpsT, that are required for polySia transport across the cytoplas-mic membrane. KpsM is a hydrophobic integral inner membrane protein, while KpsT is a peripheral inner mem-brane protein that binds ATP. They belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters. To study the role of KpsT in polySia translocation, we used PCR mutagenesis to isolate dominant negative mutations of plasmid-encoded kpsT. All mutations mapped to the same glutamic acid residue at position 150, adjacent to Walker motif B of KpsT. Wild-type (kps+) cells harboring one such allele, <b>E</b> <b>150</b> G, did not transport polySia to the cell surface but accumulated intracellular polysaccharide and pro-duced small colonies containing cells that grew as long fila-ments. The <b>E</b> <b>150</b> G protein still bound ATP as shown by 8 -azidoATP photolabeling assays. We combined the <b>E</b> <b>150</b> G allele with each of five mutations isolated previously in kpsT. Mutations that disrupt ATP-binding (K 44 E) or alter regions of the protein thought to interact with KpsM (G 84 D, S 126 F) suppressed the dominant negative pheno-type while mutations in the C-terminal portion of the pro-tein (C 163 Y, H 181 Y) did not suppress.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to unravel the {{molecular}} pathogenesis of an unusual retinitis pigmentosa (RP) phenotype observed in a Turkish consanguineous family. Homozygosity mapping revealed two candidate genes, SAMD 7 and RHO. A homozygous RHO mutation c. 448 G > A, p. <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K was found in two affected siblings, while no coding SAMD 7 mutations were identified. Interestingly, four non-coding homozygous variants were found in two SAMD 7 genomic regions relevant for binding of the retinal transcription factor CRX (CRX-bound regions, CBRs) in these affected siblings. Three variants are located in a promoter CBR termed CBR 1, while the fourth is located more downstream in CBR 2. Transcriptional activity of these variants was assessed by luciferase assays and electroporation of mouse retinal explants with reporter constructs of wild-type and variant SAMD 7 CBRs. The combined CBR 2 /CBR 1 variant construct showed significantly decreased SAMD 7 reporter activity compared to the wild-type sequence, suggesting a cis-regulatory effect on SAMD 7 expression. As Samd 7 is a recently identified Crx-regulated transcriptional repressor in retina, we hypothesize that these SAMD 7 variants might contribute to the retinal phenotype observed here, characterized by unusual, recognizable pigment deposits, differing from the classic spicular intraretinal pigmentation observed in other individuals homozygous for p. <b>E</b> <b>150</b> K, and typically associated with RP in general.

A randomized complete block design replicated three times was used. Mixed cropping was significant for grain yields of each crop species. The highest total grain yield, maize yield equivalent (MYE), land equivalent ratio (LER) and system productivity index (SPI) were obtained when maize plants were mixed {{at a rate of}} 150 % with full and 50 % seed rate of broad bean relative to their optimum densities (i. <b>e.</b> <b>150</b> : 50 and 150 : 100).
