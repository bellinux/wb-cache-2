25|$|Some of the {{understanding}} {{needed by the}} mind depends on familiarity with the object. To <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all {{in much the same}} terms.|$|E
25|$|By 3–5 years, {{children}} {{usually have}} difficulty using words correctly. Children experience many {{problems such as}} underextensions, taking a general word and applying it specifically (for example, 'cartoons' specifically for 'Mickey Mouse') and overextensions, taking a specific word and applying it too generally (example, 'ant' for any insect). However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child may not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> chef is). Children can also understand metaphors.|$|E
25|$|An {{inhabitant}} {{of ancient}} Troy, {{she was a}} brief companion of the First Doctor. The character was devised {{to act as a}} companion. However this was re-evaluated by the writers and Katarina was killed off during the following serial having appeared in just five episodes. As such, she was the first companion in the series to die. The writers, including producer John Wiles decided to write out Katarina as soon as possible, as they realized the writing challenges that came with the character. The writing challenges included the fact that the character was so very unused to modern concepts. For example, Katarina did not even <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> key was. However, they decided to write her out in the most dramatic way possible.|$|E

25|$|Beerus awakens from a 39-year {{sleep and}} goes {{in search of}} a Super Saiyan God. He travels to meet Goku after {{learning}} that he had defeated Freeza, and easily defeated him despite his advanced stages of the Super Saiyan transformation. Beerus next travels to Earth, coming across partygoers of Bulma's birthday party, including Vegeta, who met Beerus during his youth and is fearful of him due to his superior strength. Although Beerus is disappointed that Vegeta does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> Super Saiyan God is, he stays at Bulma's party because he enjoys Earth's cuisine. Beerus is mostly calm until requesting some pudding from Majin Boo, who refuses to share, causing him to become enraged and easily beat Boo, Gotenks, Gohan, Android 18, Piccolo, and Tenshinhan in combat. Bulma slaps Beerus, who he slaps back and in doing so causes an angered Vegeta to grow in strength and seemingly surpass him. Beerus then easily defeats Vegeta after powering up, and moves to destroy the Earth until Goku pleads for him to allow the Earthlings time to find a way of making a Super Saiyan God appear. After the Saiyans perform a ritual, which sees Goku transform into a Super Saiyan God, Beerus duels him and though defeating him, spares him and the Earth. During Freeza's resurrection and subsequent battle with the heroes, Beerus observes the fight and worries Freeza that he will become involved until Beerus confirms he will not.|$|E

So you are kind of trying to teach us something else."

"Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] {{in general}} advocates {{the concept of}} inner beauty by showing how miserable Mr. Garrison becomes after having his nose job; as a model, he becomes a burnout and heroin addict who only finds {{happiness}} once he sheds his new outer image and becomes his old self. The episode also demonstrates the lack of understanding many have about the gay community by portraying the characters as seeking to become lesbians {{in order to win}} Ms. Ellen's affection, even though they do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> lesbian is.|$|E

[...] While Fish was dining with General Scott in New York a telegram was received that announced the Confederates had attacked the Star of the West in Charleston Bay.

Afterwards, he recalled the moment, [...] "For me, it wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> tumor was. Once I found out, it was tough to hear I had one." [...] The condition was treated in the Hoag Memorial Hospital following several charitable donations from around the area. A married couple who lived in Huntington Beach, California, a city close to N'Diaye's future school, offered to become his guardians to ease his commute for medical treatment.|$|E

Jim does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> rundown is, but is {{too embarrassed to}} ask {{because he has been}} making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles. Jim spends much of the day {{trying to figure out what}} a rundown is, making several failed attempts to figure it out by chatting vaguely about it with Charles and other coworkers. When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not look at it and simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim does not know what the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E

Before the release the song was remixed by Sadkin at RAK Studios, in London. About the process Bailey commented: [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> great producer is? It's someone who takes great ideas and makes them into good records. In our field, great music is a hit record." [...] The song became the Thompson Twins' biggest hit in America, {{but at the same time}} it pressured the band to produce top-selling music, even if they were not completely comfortable with that, as Alannah Currie stated in an interview with David Oriard of The Spokesman-Review: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was co-directed by Ray Kay and Beyoncé for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was {{released}} the same month: {{it was one}} of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. Everyone wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it. Everyone has their own version, so we had so many women — of different races, sizes, shapes, ages — because we all have those dresses we pull out when we need to shut it down." ...|$|E
500|$|On Bennett's {{return to}} London {{he took up}} a {{teaching}} post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June.

Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> fool they had made out of me until I grew up and started to read real history”.|$|E

[...] In some instances, the police responded that [...] "You can't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol," [...] and even asked Feiden [...] "Listen lady, how would you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> real gun looked like?" [...] In a 2009 interview with James Barron of The New York Times, Feiden said that she did know that Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it.

500|$|LaBeouf stated that, {{during his}} first meeting with Stone, the {{director}} was [...] "really expedient about killing any ego or conceit on my part", saying not to worry because Tom Cruise was not an actor when he first worked with him either, which LaBeouf considered a knife to his heart. LaBeouf said that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> credit derivative is or what a CP, LP, or LVC were, commenting [...] "You gotta know ticker names." [...] He also said that he has [...] "no concept" [...] of the [...] "ins and outs of the financial world" [...] and, as part of getting into character, he chose to stay thin to be like hedge funders. To prepare for the film he traded with different firms, playing with up to $1 million and became so interested in trading that he began studying for the Series 7 Exam.|$|E

In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, she said to me that she would like to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E
