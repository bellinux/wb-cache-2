40|$|The {{biology of}} a lesser known goby, Stenogobius gymnopomus was studied from the {{freshwater}} systems of southern Kerala. Dietary {{analysis showed that}} S. gymnopomus is a <b>euryphagous</b> feeder and an omnivore. Cladocerans, together with fish eggs and scales, constituted the major food items. The minimum size at first maturity for male S. gymnopomus is 78 mm and for females 72 mm. This species {{was found to be}} a batch spawner with a prolonged spawning season extending from August to December. Fecundity ranged from 46, 323 to 61, 291 eggs.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} trophic niche of a poorly studied cave salamander, Speleomantes italicus. We {{examined}} Central Appennine hypogean populations that inhabit seven caves situated in three limestone areas in Umbria Region (Italy). Adults displayed feeding activity from May to December and the Vacuity Index analysis revealed a discontinuous trophic activity pattern {{throughout the year}} related to prey phenology. According to the qualitative analysis of the trophic spectrum, the populations in question {{can be defined as}} <b>euryphagous,</b> while the quantitative analysis (in terms of number and volume of preyed taxa) revealed a specialist strategy with a clear preference towards Diptera Limnobiidae. Both sexes presented similar trophic niche breadth and a high diet overlap, showing no intersexual differences. The hypogean populations of S. italicus, similarly to S. strinatii, showed a narrower trophic niche than epigeans of the same species, probably due to the limited food availability in the cave habitat...|$|E
40|$|It is {{not clear}} if rodents express {{inducible}} defenses in response to reptilian predators such as snakes. We tested the hypothesis that adult house mice Mus musculus decrease aspects of their reproductive effort upon 1 hour of exposure every 48 hours for a 25 -day period to the fecal material and shed skins of a <b>euryphagous</b> ophidian predator, the kingsnake Lampropeltis getula, that had been fed mice. We found {{no significant differences in}} the total number of offspring born, the number of pups per litter, and the mean weight of pups in litters born to male and female mice that were exposed to predator cues and those mice that were not exposed to such cues. The lack of an inducible response may be associated with the low cost of an effective defense, or the lack of an effective defense against a generalist snake predator [Current Zoology 59 (1) : 135 – 141, 2013]...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} one hundred and three (103) prawn (Macrobranchium vollenhovenii) samples were {{collected}} from Ndibe beach in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi state which is composed of 21 prawns from the month of September, 20 prawns for the months of October, 34 prawns {{for the month of}} November and 24 prawns for the month of December. The feeding capacity of M. vollenhovenii varied with time, highest in October with full stomach (28. 5 %) were observed and the lowest (8. 3 %) were observed in December. Plankton was the highest food such as cladocers, copepoda, diatoms (brown algae) and dinoflagellates. Others were also identified such as sand grains, macrophytes, insect parts, palm flesh and shell. The overall monthly condition factor values in the abundance of the M. vollenhovenii species indicate an increase in the condition factor of the total length of prawn length from the month of September to December. More especially for the month of November which had the highest condition factor values of 3. 98. M. vollenhovenii exhibits different feeding habits and may be considered as <b>euryphagous...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{abundance}} and distribution, length-weight, condition factor, diet and reproduction of Synodontis schall and S. nigrita from the Ouémé (Bénin) are described. S. nigrita is less abundant than S. schall in the river. Both species are <b>euryphagous</b> with their diet containing {{a wide variety}} of food items that include various types of plankton, invertebrates and plants. This high diversity of the food composition indicates a wide adaptability to the habitats in which they live. This is an important strategy for survival and an advantage over the fish species compet-ing for a specific food item. Size at maturity differs between species for both males (15 cm TL for S. schall and 21 cm TL for S. nigrita) and females (16 cm and 22 cm, respectively). Fecundity range is higher for S. schall (1841 - 15076 oocytes) compared to that of S. nigrita (2647 - 9212). Peak values of GSI for males and females in both spe-cies occurred from mid- to late July, indicating one season of major spawning activity per year...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © Springer-Verlag 2011. Coccinella undecimpunctata L. is a <b>euryphagous</b> {{predator}} {{established in}} Azores that offers interesting {{potential as a}} control agent {{in the context of}} integrated pest management (IPM). However, to further develop IPM against aphids, it is important to evaluate the effects that insecticides might have on voracity. Thus, we proposed to evaluate the effects of pirimicarb and pymetrozine on the voracity of 4 th instar larvae and adults of C. undecimpunctata, under distinct scenarios of exposure to chemicals within a prey/plant system. Voracity of C. undecimpunctata was not significantly affected by pirimicarb or pymetrozine when treatments were directly sprayed on the predator; however, when insecticides were sprayed on the prey/plant system, the predator’s voracity was significantly increased. Results suggest that C. undecimpunctata does not detect the insecticide on the aphids and indicate that the increase in voracity may be due to a decrease in the mobility of insecticide-treated aphids, since their capture should be easier than highly mobile non-treated prey. The consequences of such increase in the voracity for IPM programs are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of stomach contents {{was conducted in}} sandpipers of five species (Calidris alpina, Xenus cinereus, Tringa brevipes, T. glareola, T. hypoleucos) collected on the north coast of the Sea of Ariake. A great number of polychaetes and gastropod molluscs were found in C. alpina, {{and a lot of}} polychaetes were also found in X. cinereus. In T. brevipes only fragments of crabs were found. In both T. glareola and T. hypoleucos were found a number of skeletons of frogs. Analysing the relation between the invertebrates and the aggregation of birds, the distribution of T. brevipes closely related with that of Crustacea, especially that of Brachyura. And the distribution of C. tenuirostris closely related with that of small molluscs. In both C. alpina and X. cinereus, however, no relation was found between their distributions and any specific prey. There seemed to be two types of the sandpipers {{at the time of their}} migration. The first was relatively stenophagous species, such as T. brevipes and C. tenuirostris, which showed the specific preferences to the prey species. The second was the considerably <b>euryphagous</b> species, such as C. alpina and X. cineveus, which showed fairly wide preferences to their preys...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} the {{axillary}} seabream, Pagellus acarne (Risso, 1810), from the Gulf of Tunis were investigated in relation to season, sex and fish size (juveniles TL < 14. 5 cm and adults TL ≥ 14. 5 cm). A total of 536 specimens (males, females, unsexed and hermaphroditic), ranging between 11. 0 and 25. 2 cm TL, were collected with trammel nets from June 2005 to July 2006. Their stomach contents were analysed. Of {{the total number of}} examined stomachs, 279 stomachs were empty (Vacuity index, VI = 52 %). The VI did not reveal significant seasonal differences when all of the specimens were analysed together; however, significant seasonal variations were observed for females. The diet of the axillary seabream was composed of 36 different prey species. The most important prey were Arthropoda, Mollusca and Echinodermata. Both the dietary indices and the Spearman’s coefficient of correlation indicated seasonal variations in the diet. The diet was more diversified in adults than in juveniles. The axillary seabream fed {{on a wide range of}} prey items, endofauna and nekton, and can be considered a carnivorous and <b>euryphagous</b> predator...|$|E
40|$|Brown trout, Salmo trutta fario, has a {{wide range}} of {{distribution}} in the north of Iran and in Karaj, Lighvanchai and Karun Rivers, but there is no report about its feeding behavior in some water resources including the Lar Natural Park. In order to study feeding behavior of this fish during spawning season, a survey was carried out in the rivers of Elarm, Aab-Sefid, Kamardasht and Delichayi in fall 2008. A total of 140 individuals of brown trout were caught by cast net and electro fishing. Mean weight and length of the samples were 130 ± 79. 5 g and 216. 9 ± 39 mm, respectively. The age of fish was 2 to 6 years and mean age was 3. 02 ± 1. 3. The mean relative gut length (RLG) of samples was 0. 86 ± 1. It was found that brown trout fed on various preys (32 animal groups), that Chironomidae (88. 6 %), Simulidae (60 %), Baetidae (51. 4 %) and Tipulidae (50 %) have had the most frequency in the gut of brown trout. The proportion of food consumed by trout was Diptera 91. 5 % (Chironomidae pupa and larvae 85. 8 %), Coleoptera 6. 4 % and others 2. 1 %. Cannibalism was seen scarcely. In conclusion, brown trout consumes {{a wide range of}} food items in its spawning season. Therefore, it can be classified as <b>euryphagous</b> and carnivaorou...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMetazoan parasites {{were studied}} in 96 Alosa alosa and 78 Alosa fallax from North-East Atlantic coastal waters and {{connected}} rivers (among them three sympatric sites) {{in order to}} increase knowledge on these anadromous endangered fish and measure the parasitic impact on host condition. All shads were infected by one to six metazoan parasite taxa among the 12 identified in the whole sampling, with a mean abundance of parasites higher for A. alosa (167 +/- 10) than for A. fallax (112 +/- 11). Helminths, mostly trophically transmitted, were the best represented (eight taxa, prevalence up to 99 %) in contrast with crustaceans and Petromyzontidae that rarely occurred (four taxa, prevalence < 6 %). Despite some quantitative differences, metazoan parasite communities of A. alosa and A. fallax remained stable in composition whatever the host developmental stage, sex, sample site, and salinity. Among the nine parasite taxa harbored by each Alosa species, six were shared with some differences in distribution patterns including in sympatric conditions, suggesting increasing dissimilarities between A. alosa and A. fallax with the age. Information on feeding ecology provided by trophically transmitted helminths confirmed <b>euryphagous</b> opportunistic diet of immatures and adults of both shad species, and assessed feeding of adults during spawning migrations. Our study also revealed the significant negative impact of Hemiurus appendiculatus on A. alosa and Pronoprymna ventricosa on A. fallax. Because helminth parasites are omnipresent in the shads and decrease their fitness, parasitological data must be included in further investigations and management programs on A. alosa and A. fallax...|$|E
40|$|Phytophagous insects which feed on {{the leaves}} of {{herbaceous}} host plants have to adapt their life histories {{to the fact that}} protein nitrogen is usually highest in growing tissues in spring. We monitored field populations of larvae and adults of three chrysomelid species (Galeruca tanaceti (L.) (main host Achillea millefolium (L.) Yarrow), Cassida rubiginosa (Mueller) (main host Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) and Oreina luctuosa (Suffrian) (host Centaurea scabiosa (L.)) together with the amount of protein nitrogen of their food resources and host plant biomass. As expected, the development of host quality, measured as concentration of protein nitrogen, and host plant biomass showed inverse trends during the season. The <b>euryphagous</b> G. tanaceti attacks Achillea early and profits from high nitrogen concentrations in the leaves. Occasional overexploitations of local populations of Achillea are compensated by the capacity to move to other host species. In C. rubiginosa, a species with a host range restricted to the Cardueae, the main larval feeding activity is postponed to a period when the nitrogen content of the host leaves had dropped to 50 % of its initial value, but when host plant biomass had increased by 30 %. In the monophagous O. luctuosa the larval development is synchronized with a still later phase of host phenology, at which the nitrogen content is below 50 % but plant biomass has reached its maximum. There seem to be selection factors, which oppose the use of high quality food in spring and which force the latter two species to postpone thei...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{the feeding}} habits of aquatic organisms are a {{requirement}} for the management and sustainable use of marine ecosystems. The aim of the present research was to analyze the habits and trophic similarities of decapods, starfish and fish in order to propose trophic relationships between taxa, using Hennigian methods of phylogenetic systematics. This new grouping hypothesis, based on shared and exclusive food items and food types, corresponds to the broad taxonomic groups used in the analysis. Our results indicate that algae, Mollusca, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Echinodermata and Actinopterygii are the most exploited common resources among the species studied. Starfish were differentiated from other organisms for being stenophagic, and were grouped for feeding on bivalve mollusks. A larger group of fish and crustaceans shares algae and mainly crustaceans as food items. A third group united all eight species of Actinopterygii. This largest subgroup of fish is typically carnivorous, feeding on Anthozoa and a great quantity of Crustacea. Synodus foetens has a special position among fishes, due to its unique feeding on nematodes. A Euclidean distance dendrogram obtained in a previous publication grouped S. foetens with starfish. That result {{was based on a}} few non-exclusive shared similarities in feeding modes, as well as on shared absences of items, which are not an adequate grouping factor. Starfish are stenophagic, eating bivalves almost exclusively. Synodus foetens and Isopisthus parvipinnis have restricted food items, and are thus intermediary in relation to starfish, decapods, and other fish, which are <b>euryphagous.</b> The trophic cladogram displays details of food items, whether or not shared by all species. The resulting trophic analysis is consistent with known historical relationships...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Presentation date: 1982 - 11 - 24 Euphausiids {{constituted}} the major food of five co-occuring species of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.). Copepods, decapods, cephalopods, amphipods, fishes and other pelagic prey were also consumed but were less {{important to the}} overall diet. Two species, S. flavidus and S. diploproa, were relatively <b>euryphagous,</b> utilizing {{a high number of}} prey taxa. The other species, S. pinniger, S. alutus and S. crameri, had a more restricted diet comprised mostly of euphausiids. The numerical composition of prey in the diet of all species was similar due to the preponderance of the two dominant euphausiid species. Diet overlaps based on weight composition were high for S. pinniger, S. diploproa and S. alutus but were moderate for most comparisons involving S. flavidus and S. crameri. The diets of S. flavidus and S. pinniger were examined in more detail to explain some of the variability associated with their food habits. Both species exhibited peak feeding periods at the same times during the day and consumed about the same mean size of prey; although S. flavidus consumed a wider size range of prey. Neither species showed much variation in size or type of prey consumed throughout the size range of fish examined. There were significant seasonal, geographical and diel differences in food composition for both species which may be a function of varying food availability. The rates of gastric evacuation of two food types, squid (Loligo opalescens) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), were measured in the laboratory for adult black rockfish (Sebastes melanops), held nominally at 11 °C. Linear, logarithmic and square root regression models were applied to analyze the data expressed as both wet and dry weight proportions of the original meal. The linear model provided the best fit for the wet weight relationship of squid. The dry weight of squid and both the wet and dry weight relationships of eulachon were best described by a logarithmic function, or by a square root function when the regressions were forced through the original meal size. The instantaneous evacuation rates (about 6...|$|E
40|$|This is {{an account}} of {{some aspects of the}} ecology of the eastern Cape rocky, Sandelia bainsii Castelnau in the Tyume river in the eastern Cape. Previous {{unpublished}} work carried out by the Zoology Department of the University of Fort Hare in the mid-seventies indicated that the species was rare in the Tyume river. Because of its uncertain conservation status, its restricted geographic distribution and the lack of information on its biology, demography, feeding and reproductive biology were studied. The species occurs in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Tyume river and is common in rocky, shallow habitats in the middle reaches of the system. The most important threats to the survival of S. bainsii appear to be habitat alteration and alien species. The presence of these threats and the small size of the population suggest that the species may be vulnerable to local extinction. As the total range of the species extends to only a few rivers in the eastern Cape, the species might face extinction if these threats are faced throughout its range. A detailed study on the autecology of S. bainsii was therefore carried out in order to provide a basis for rational conservation and management of the remaining populations of the species. The age structure and the growth rate of S. bainsii was determined using checks on scales and otoliths. Males grow faster and reach a larger size than females. The maximum length of S. bainsii is compared to that of other anabantids. The longevity of males is 5 years and that of females 3 years. Food preferences were determined by three different methods and the indices of relative importance of food items calculated for different length groups and seasons. S. bainsii was found to be an <b>euryphagous</b> and opportunistic predator whose diet consists largely of insects. A considerable overlap was found between the diet of S. bainsii and that of the two alien species, Salmo gairdneri and Micropterus salmoides which indicates a possibility of competition for food. Mark and recapture experiments showed that S. bainsii is a "sedentary " species which is unlikely to be seriously affected by man-made barriers to fish migration, such as weirs. The species reaches maturity during its second growing season (males 80 - 89 mm and females 60 - 69 mm) and the length at maturity is related to the modal length of males and females. A large proportion of the fish are thus mature at any given time. The fish spawn repeatedly during the summer breeding season, October to February resulting in near continuous recruitment. The possible adaptive value of this habit is discussed. An attempt is made to evaluate the life history style of S. bainsii in terms of the theory of r - and K- selection and altricial and precocial life history style...|$|E
