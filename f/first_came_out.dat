5|$|When Rotting <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> it stirred a {{huge amount}} of {{controversy}} due to its cover art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1924 {{science fiction}} novel recounts {{the course of}} human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global {{struggle}} between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) presciently invokes such topics as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Stylistically and structurally experimental, it {{was regarded as a}} difficult work when it <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> and has often polarized critics. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} worked with YA editors; my work {{has never been}} marketed that way until Tor put a YA cover and a new ISBN on Ender’s Game—fifteen years after the book <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> and long after it had become popular with young readers. Ender's Game was written with no {{concessions}} to young readers. My protagonists were children, but the book was definitely not aimed at kids. I was perfectly aware that {{the rule of thumb}} for children’s literature is that the protagonist must be a couple of years older than the target audience. You want ten-year-old readers, you have a twelve-year-old hero.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated [...] "When we <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started!". Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before we <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!". According to Mike Inez, they were always the metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.|$|E

500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1986 Carlos Fuentes, for The New York Times, {{wrote of}} Roa Bastos: [...] "He is his country's most eminent writer; his works are few, {{self-contained}} (very Paraguayan) and brilliantly written.

She was the keynote speaker for the 1997 national Parents, Families, & Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) convention, and has since become one of the LGBT community's most vocal advocates.

To be honest, I was a little worried when it <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} grew uncomfortable with their success, {{with much of}} the burden of Pearl Jam's {{popularity}} falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for [...] "Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for [...] "Black" [...] in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that [...] "Before music videos <b>first</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> you’d listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you’d come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression." ...|$|E
