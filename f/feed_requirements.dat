5000|$|Feed {{conversion}} ratios (feed {{input to}} tuna weight gain) of approximately 15:1 or higher result in significant <b>feed</b> <b>requirements</b> for captive {{southern bluefin tuna}} and resultant nutrient pollution. The feed conversion ratio {{is a consequence of}} the fish's carnivorous diet and the high metabolic costs of the species. Removing tuna from the wild before they have spawned also impacts wild populations. Clean Seas has previously attempted to address this by focusing research effort on closing the life-cycle of the species with the potential benefit of alleviating some of the fishing pressure on declining stocks. In 2016, South Australia's southern bluefin tuna ranching industry received a Sustainability Certificate from Friend of the Sea. industry spokesperson Brian Jeffriess said of the certification: [...] "This {{is one of the few}} awards to actually cover both the wild fish catching and the whole farming supply chain and within that labour standards, crew safety, traceability, carbon footprint...every conceivable sustainability test." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis ~ Present feed production {{was obtained from}} published data. Livestock <b>feed</b> <b>requirements</b> were calculated using factors published in Lives tock- Feed Relationships, {{a publication of the}} United States Department of Agriculture. The projections of <b>feed</b> <b>requirements</b> to 1980 were made by projecting livestock numbers based on a least squares analysis of past trends. Utilizing the projected numbers permits calculation of t he <b>feed</b> <b>requirements.</b> Feed production in 1980 was obtained by projecting past feed production and by applying least squares analysis to obtain a predicting equation that allows projection to 1980. Separate predictions were made for roughage and feed grains. Utah will have a feed grain deficit totaling about 407, 000 tons in 1980. The state will have an estimated roughage surplus ranging from about 250, 000 tons to 825, 000 t ons depending on the base period selected...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the interaction between slaughter age and restricted feed, as well as the influence of each factor on the production of rex rabbits pelt. Randomized Block Design with Factorial was used in this experiment with the first factor was 3 levels of restricted feeding treatment where the amount of feed as follow: P 1 = 100 % from the total <b>feed</b> <b>requirement,</b> P 2 = 80 % from total <b>feed</b> <b>requirement</b> and P 3 = 60 % from the total <b>feed</b> <b>requirement.</b> <b>Feed</b> was given in the amount of rabbits requirement, in which 100 % of the total requirement was calculated based on body weight (6. 7 % of body weight in dry matter basis), and second factor was 3 levels of slaughter age (U 1 = 120 d, U 2 = 150 d, U 3 = 180 d) and each treatment was repeated 6 times. The data were analyzed by Anova, and analyzing between the treatments used Contrast Orthogonal. The variable measured were pelt production (weight pelt, width pelt, thickness dermis and epidermis) of Rex rabbit. There was an interaction betwen slaughtered age and the amount of feed given to Rex rabbits. Feeding 80 % from the total <b>feed</b> <b>requirement</b> and the slaughtered age at 150 d were the most efficient in producing pelt of Rex rabbits, with weight 261. 0 ± 30. 33 g, width 928. 0 ± 75. 5 cm 2, and epidermal thickness 32. 50 ± 1. 1 µ, and dermis 2685. 50 ± 15. 0 µ...|$|R

40|$|Lamb {{producers}} {{have the option}} to market lambs at a range of slaughter weights. However, there are limited price premiums for heavier carcasses on a per kilogram basis. Any economic advantage of heavy lambs is realised by extra weight and not price. Both genetic and on-farm factors contribute to extra weight gain. Firstly, lamb weight and growth is correlated to its mature size and lambs from larger parents grow faster and reach heavier weights, but also have greater <b>feed</b> <b>requirements.</b> Secondly, stocking and reproductive rate account for the majority of variation in whole-farm profit, but increasing these also increases <b>feed</b> <b>requirements.</b> The production of heavy lambs is therefore a trade-off with maximising stocking and reproductive rate within the pool of available feed resources. We hypothesise that slaughter weight does not increase with mature size, due to the priority to increase stocking and reproductive rate for profit maximisation...|$|E
