40|$|Background: The markets {{conditions}} are changing and recent research {{show that the}} era of offshoring manufacturing and jobs to foreign countries now {{is coming to an}} end. Nearshoring gives the possibility to overcome the challenges that offshoring causes. Furthermore, both the internal parameters and <b>key</b> <b>driving</b> forces in the environment is important to consider in the decision of where to locate the future supplier base. Purpose: The purpose for this thesis is to identify how the future supplier base for the glass lighting segment should be located, taken into consideration the internal parameters availability, sustainability, product quality and cost, and the <b>key</b> <b>driving</b> forces in the environment. Methodology: In this thesis a case study approach is used, with a positivistic perspective and an abductive approach. To identify the <b>key</b> <b>driving</b> forces, the methodology of a scenario analysis is used. Conclusions: Considering the internal parameters and the <b>key</b> <b>driving</b> forces in the environment a use of three nearshoring hubs, closely located to the sales markets, Asia, Europe and North America, is supported for the future supplier base for the glass lighting segment. ...|$|R

40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented a finite mixture model, using the scaled Dirichlet {{distribution for the}} cluster analysis of multivariate proportional data. In this thesis, the task of cluster analysis first involves model selection which helps to discover the number of natural groupings underlying a dataset. This activity is then followed by that of estimating the model parameters for those natural groupings using the expectation maximization framework. This work, aims to address the flexibility challenge of the Dirichlet distribution by introduction of a distribution with an extra model parameter. This is important because scientists and researchers are constantly searching for the best models that can fully describe the intrinsic characteristics of the observed data and flexible models are increasingly used to achieve such purposes. In addition, we have applied our estimation and model selection algorithm to both synthetic and real datasets. Most importantly, we considered two areas of application in software modules defect prediction and in customer segmentation. Today, {{there is a growing}} challenge of detecting defected modules early in complex software development projects.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) {{in the liver}} {{as well as in}} many organs comprises a peripheral network linking numerous macromolecules typically classified into collagens, microfibrillar proteins, proteoglycans, chemokines, growth factors and glycoproteins. In addition to its role as an essential structural and physiological component, it plays a vital role in <b>driving</b> <b>key</b> cellular events such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. Any structural inherited or acquired defect and/or metabolic or pathologic alteration in the hepatic ECM may cause cellular and organ responses leading to the development or progression of liver disease. Therefore, the ECM molecules are key players in tissue engraftment and in the pathophysiology of liver disease. In this review we provide a snapshot on current efforts for understanding its role in physiological and non-physiological states, by describing how tissue engineering platforms can enhance in vitro and in vivo models of liver disease, by providing examples where bioengineered ECM can serve as systems biology approaches to study the ECM, and then by evaluating pathological protein regulatory networks in the liver using systems biology tools.

40|$|The Federal Highway Administration {{proposed}} {{guidelines for}} highway design {{to increase the}} safe-driving ability of older drivers; however, little empirical evidence exists to support these guidelines. This study investigated the effects of improved versus unimproved intersections, using a high-fidelity driving simulator. Kinematics measures and behavioral evaluations were ob-tained to determine whether driving performance during negotiation of improved intersections was safer for older (65 – 85 years) and younger (25 – 45) drivers. Five pairs of intersections were compared. Three of the 5 comparisons indicated significantly greater lateral control stability (as measured by maximum yaw rate) during turns at the improved intersections. This preliminary report is {{based on data from}} 19 subjects (5 young and 14 older adults). Despite the small sample size, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that some of the Federal Highway Administration guide-lines for implementing safe road conditions are helpful in defining intersection characteristics that could lead to safer driving by both older and younger adults. These results may yield critical information for engineers, planners, policymakers, and others involved in the design of road-way systems to enhance safe <b>driving.</b> <b>Key</b> words: driving kinematics, driving simulation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEarly brain {{development}} is {{regulated by the}} coordinated actions of multiple signaling centers at key boundaries between compartments. Three telencephalic midline structures {{are in a position}} to play such roles in forebrain patterning: The cortical hem, the septum, and the thalamic eminence at the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary. These structures express unique complements of signaling molecules, and they also produce distinct populations of Cajal-Retzius cells, which are thought to act as "mobile patterning units," migrating tangentially to cover the telencephalic surface. We show that these 3 structures require the transcription factor Lhx 2 to delimit their extent. In the absence of Lhx 2 function, all 3 structures are greatly expanded, and the Cajal-Retzius cell population is dramatically increased. We propose that the hem, septum, and thalamic eminence together form a "forebrain hem system" that defines and regulates the formation of the telencephalic midline. Disruptions in the forebrain hem system may be implicated in severe brain malformations such as holoprosencephaly. Lhx 2 functions as a central regulator of this system's development. Since all components of the forebrain hem system have been identified across several vertebrate species, the mechanisms that regulate them may have played a fundamental role in <b>driving</b> <b>key</b> aspects of forebrain evolution...|$|E

Their identication is therefore necessary to understand not only complex formation but also the higher level organization of the cell. With the advent of "high-throughput" techniques in molecular biology, signi¯cant amount of physical interaction data has been cataloged from organisms such as yeast, which has in turn fueled computational approaches to systematically mine complexes from the network of physical interactions among proteins (PPI network). In this survey, we review, classify and evaluate some of the key computational methods developed till date for the identi¯cation of protein complexes from PPI networks. We present two insightful taxonomies that re°ect how these methods have evolved over the years toward improving automated complex prediction. We also discuss some open challenges facing accurate reconstruction of complexes, the crucial ones being the presence of high proportion of errors and noise in current high-throughput datasets and some key aspects overlooked by current complex detection methods. We hope this review will not only help to condense the history of computational complex detection for easy reference but also provide valuable insights to drive further research in this area...|$|E

40|$|Live imaging is the {{requisite}} tool for studying cell behaviors driving embryonic development and tissue formation. Genetically encoded reporters expressed under cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements that drive fluorescent protein expression at sufficient levels for visualization in living specimens have become indispensable for these studies. Increasingly dual-color (red-green) imaging {{is used for}} studying the coordinate behaviors of two cell populations of interest, identifying and characterizing subsets within broader cell populations or subcellular features. Many reporters have been generated using green fluorescent protein (GFP) due to its brightness and developmental neutrality. To compliment the large cohort of available GFP reporters that label cellular populations in early mouse embryos, we have generated a red fluorescent protein (RFP) -based transgenic reporter using the red fluorescent tdTomato protein driven by cis-regulatory elements from the mouse Hex locus. The Hex-tdTomato reporter predominantly labels endodermal cells. It is a bright RFP-based reporter of the distal visceral endoderm (DVE) /anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), a migratory population within the early post-implantation embryo. It also labels cells of the definitive endoderm (DE), which emerges at gastrulation. Dual-color visualization of these different early endodermal populations will provide a detailed understanding of the cellular behaviors <b>driving</b> <b>key</b> morphogenetic events involving the endoderm...|$|E

It is becoming increasingly clear that airway epithelium {{plays a key role}} in <b>driving</b> <b>key</b> initiating steps of immune defence (either protective or deleterious) against inhaled antigens and particles. Epithelial cells respond to changes in the external environment by secreting a large array of antimicrobial host defence molecules, cytokines and chemokines following exposure to and activation by pathogen molecular patterns, and link in concert with dendritic cells innate to antigen-specific adaptive immunity. However, the type of epithelial response to `pathogens' and danger signals may differ between upper and lower airways, as well as according to genetic background. This review provides an updated, extensive and comparative review of immune defence mechanisms of the respiratory tract, in upper versus lower airways, including most relevant changes observed during chronic airway diseases and how these may translate into different clinical features...|$|E
40|$|Shedding {{new light}} on the {{foundations}} of European competition law, this volume is a legal and historical study of the emerging law and its evolution through the 1980 s. It retraces the development and critical junctures of competition law not only {{at the level of the}} European Economic Community but also at the level of major Member States of the EEC. Intensely researched and rich with insights, the chapters in this volume reflect a close collaboration among an expert group of lawyers and historians and capitalize on previously unavailable source materials. The book examines several key themes including: the influence of national and international competition law on the development of EEC competition law; the drafting of the regulations that lead to the development of modern EU competition law; the role of the European Court of Justice in establishing the protection of competition as a central pillar of the Common Market; the internal dynamics, ideologies and tensions within the Competition Directorate General (DG IV) of the European Commission; and the role of industrial policy in European integration. Combining legal analysis with a meticulous excavation of historical evidence to reveal the forces <b>driving</b> <b>key</b> actors and the interactions among them, this volume rediscovers a past largely forgotten but essential to understanding the genesis of competition law in Europe, its role in Europe's construction, its hybrid institutional traits, and its often unique substance...|$|E
