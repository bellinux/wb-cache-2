For 1967, power windows became standard on the Calais line, although power seats were still optional even in the later-year models. Coupes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 New York World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. New standard Calais features included non-glare rear-view mirror, electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, <b>Hazard</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>system,</b> outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation.

40|$|The advent and {{evolution}} of geohazard <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{is a very interesting}} study. The two broad fields that are immediately visible are that of geohazard evaluation and subsequent warning dissemination. Evidently, the latter field lacks any systematic study or standards. Arbitrarily organized and vague data and information on warning techniques create confusion and indecision. The purpose of this review is to try and systematize the available bulk of information on <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> so that meaningful insights can be derived through decidable flowcharts, and a developmental process can be undertaken. Hence, the methods and technologies for numerous geohazard <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> have been assessed by putting them into suitable categories for better understanding of possible ways to analyze their efficacy as well as shortcomings. By establishing a classification scheme based on extent, control, time period, and advancements in technology, the geohazard <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> available in any literature could be comprehensively analyzed and evaluated. Although major advancements have taken place in geohazard <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> in recent times, they have been lacking a complete purpose. Some systems just assess the hazard and wait for other means to communicate, and some are designed only for communication and wait for the hazard information to be provided, which usually is after the mishap. Primarily, systems are left at the mercy of administrators and service providers and are not in real time. An integrated <b>hazard</b> evaluation and <b>warning</b> dissemination <b>system</b> could solve this problem. Warning systems have also suffered from complexity of nature, requirement of expert-level monitoring, extensive and dedicated infrastructural setups, and so on. The user community, which would greatly appreciate having a convenient, fast, and generalized warning methodology, is surveyed in this review.

FRP is observed from MODIS sensors aboard the sun-synchronous Terra and Aqua satellites and provides a unique way to incorporate active wildfire information into climate models and weather forecasting. Observations have shown that the amount of FRP is related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed, linking it directly to the fuel load of ecosystems. The impact of meteorological variables on the behavior of FRP, on a daily basis, is expected to show an observable relationship. Modeling this relationship is the primary objective of the thesis.

40|$|Abstract Remote sensing {{instruments}} {{have been}} used to identify, track and in some cases quantify atmospheric constituents from space-borne platforms for nearly 30 years. These data have proven to be extremely useful for detecting hazardous ash and gas (principally SO 2) clouds emitted by volcanoes and which have the potential to intersect global air routes. The remoteness of volcanoes, the sporadic timings of eruptions and the ability of the upper atmosphere winds to quickly spread ash and gas, make satellite remote sensing a key tool for developing <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> It is easily recognized how powerful these tools are for hazard detection and yet {{there has not been a}} single instrument designed specifically for this use. Instead, researchers have had to make use of instruments and data designed for other purposes. In this article the satellite instruments, algorithms and techniques used for ash and gas detection are described from a historical perspective with a view to elucidating their value and shortcomings. Volcanic clouds residing in the mid- to upper-troposphere (heights above 5 km) have the greatest potential of intersecting air routes and can be dispersed over many 1, 000 s of kilometres by the prevailing winds.

To {{better understand the}} occurrence of these hazards and to prevent populations from their dangers, the knowledge of rainfall quantities at high temporal and spatial resolution iscrucial. While the rain-gauge network is not dense enough to capture all the variability of precipitations, especially in rugged regions, radars can be very efficient. However, to install them in mountains {{as well as to}} retrieve real-time useful information remains a big challenge. To improve this radar information to elaborate warning services useful for the management of natural risks is another one.

40|$|Debris flows {{associated}} with rainstorms are a frequent and devastating hazard in the Southern Appalachians in the United States. Whereas warm season events are clearly {{associated with}} heavy rainfall intensity, the same cannot {{be said for}} the cold season events. Instead, there is a relationship between large (cumulative) rainfall events independently of season, and thus hydrometeorological regime, and debris flows. This suggests that the dynamics of subsurface hydrologic processes play an important role as a trigger mechanism, specifically through soil moisture redistribution by interflow. The first objective {{of this study is to}} investigate this hypothesis. The second objective is to assess the physical basis for a regional coupled flood prediction and debris flow warning system. For this purpose, uncalibrated model simulations of well-documented debris flows in headwater catchments of the Southern Appalachians using a 3 -D surface-groundwater hydrologic model coupled with slope stability models are examined in detail. Specifically, we focus on two vulnerable headwater catchments that experience frequent debris flows, the Big Creek and the Jonathan Creek in the Upper Pigeon River Basin, North Carolina, and three distinct weather systems: an extremely heavy summertime convective storm in 2011; a persistent winter storm lasting several days; and a severe winter storm in 2009. These events were selected due to the optimal availability of rainfall observations, availability of detailed field surveys of the landslides shortly after they occurred, which can be used to evaluate model predictions, and because they are representative of events that cause major economic losses in the region. The model results substantiate that interflow is a useful prognostic of conditions necessary for the initiation of slope instability, and should therefore be considered explicitly in landslide hazard assessments. Moreover, the relationships between slope stability and interflow are strongly modulated by the topography and catchment specific geomorphologic features that determine subsurface flow convergence zones. The three case-studies demonstrate the value of coupled prediction of flood response and debris flow initiation potential in the context of developing a regional <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|Risk {{perception}} for rare, low-probability hazards, such as tsunamis, {{tends to}} be low due to individual's unfamiliarity with them and the tendency {{to see them as}} synonymous with non-occurrence events. Visitors to an area tend to have even lower risk perception and knowledge of <b>hazards,</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> and appropriate actions to take during an event. Risk perception, however, can increase, if only temporarily, after a catastrophic event, such as the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. To determine the changes in resident's knowledge and perception and the differences between those of residents and visitors two surveys were conducted. In the first survey interview style surveying was conducted at eleven locations in the coastal Christchurch and Banks Peninsula area of the Canterbury Region The questionnaire was composed of scaled, open, and closed ended questions and the main themes included knowledge of risk, preparation and warnings, what to do during a tsunami, and changes since the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The second survey of five coastal communities was conducted via a postal questionnaire and was aimed at obtaining residential views. Survey data was then analysed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) statistical software. The residential data was compared with that of the non-residents to determine the differences in perception of residents and visitors. The residential information was then compared with survey data from the 2003 National Coastal Survey. Visitors knew less about general tsunami information such as when the last tsunami occurred and were less likely to believe that a tsunami could occur imminently. Non-residents reported less receipt of information and did considerably less information seeking. Differences in knowledge of <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> were difficult to ascertain.

The easy to observe degree of peat humification provided good guidance for {{the assignment of}} more difficult to measure saturated hydraulic conductivities to the acrotelm¿catotelm hydrological system. Ideally, to prevent subsidence and fire, groundwater levels should be maintained between 40 cm below and 100 cm above the peat surface. Calculated groundwater levels for different years and for different months within a single year showed that these levels can drop deeper than the critical threshold of 40 cm below the peat surface whilst flooding of more than 100 cm above the surface was also observed. In July 1997, a dry El Niño year, areas for which deep groundwater levels were calculated coincided with areas that were on fire as detected from radar images. The relatively intact peatland showed resilience towards disturbance of its hydrological integrity whereas the degraded peatland was susceptible to fire. Hydropedological modelling identified areas with good restoration potential based on predicted flooding depth and duration. Groundwater level prediction maps {{can be used in}} fire <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> as well as in land utilization and restoration planning.

Many tide gauges now afford 1 min or more frequent sampling and have shown such events to be a common occurrence. Their origins and spatial distribution are diverse and must be well understood in order to correctly design and interpret, for example, the automatic detection algorithms used by tsunami warning centers. Two events recorded recently in European Atlantic waters are analyzed here: possible wave-induced seiches that occurred along the North coast of Spain during the storms of January and February of 2014, and oscillations detected after an earthquake in the mid-Atlantic the 13 th of February of 2015. The former caused significant flooding in towns and villages and a huge increase in wave-induced coastal damage that was reported in the media for weeks. The second was a smaller signal present in several tide gauges along the Atlantic coast that, that coincided with the occurrence of this earthquake, leading to a debate on the potential detection of a very small tsunami and how it might yield significant information for tsunami wave modelers and for the development of tsunami detection software.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-exhausting overview of early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for emerging foodborne hazards that are {{operating in the}} various places in the world. Special attention is given to endpoint-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. ECDC, ISIS and GPHIN) and hazard-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. FVO, RASFF and OIE) and their merit to successfully identify a food safety problem in an early stage is discussed. Besides these early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{which are based on}} monitoring of either disease symptoms or <b>hazards,</b> also early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> and/or activities that intend to predict the occurrence of a food safety hazard in its very beginning of development or before that are described. Examples are trend analysis, horizon scanning, early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for mycotoxins in maize and/or wheat and information exchange networks (e. g. OIE and GIEWS). Furthermore, recent initiatives that aim to develop predictive early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> based on the holistic principle are discussed. The assumption of the researchers applying this principle is that developments outside the food production chain that are either directly or indirectly related {{to the development of a}} particular food safety hazard may also provide valuable information to predict the development of this hazard...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Environmental {{monitoring}} {{requires the}} combination of various distributed and heterogeneous data sources. The situational awareness ap-proach aims at replacing monolithic and often incompatible measurement systems by a service-based sensor infrastructure. The proposed open-standards-based method allows for the integration of different live and ar-chived data sources, which are {{the basis of a}} direct assessment of environ-mental conditions. The aim is to provide a framework for {{the combination of}} local and distrib-uted data to achieve situational awareness in near real-time by using GIS analysis methods on the server side. The methodology can be applied to dif-ferent scenarios in the fields of environmental monitoring, natural <b>hazard</b> prediction, early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> or security-specific applications. ...|$|R

The development of a practical method for the evaluation of driver capacity is described, and the method has been tested in AICC (Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control) - pilotstudies at Daimler Benz/Opel. A functional specification of electronic <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> and avoiding <b>systems</b> is presented. Observation and evaluation of research work on software dependability are summed up in an overview. A reliability handbook for vehicle electronics has been compiled, and demands of safe practice on the architecture of networks in automobiles are formulated.

40|$|International audienceRainfall-triggered {{landslides}} {{are part}} of a natural process of hillslope erosion that can result in catastrophic loss of life and extensive property damage in mountainous, densely populated areas. As global population expansion on or near steep hillslopes continues, the human and economic costs associated with landslides will increase. Landslide hazard mitigation strategies generally involve <b>hazard</b> assessment mapping, <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> control structures, and regional landslide planning and policy development. To be sustainable, hazard mitigation requires that management of natural resources is closely connected to local economic and social interests. A successful strategy is dependent on a combination of multi-disciplinary scientific and engineering approaches, and the political will to take action at the local community to national scale...|$|R
40|$|A global ocean observing {{system for}} the {{physical}} climate system, comprising both in situ and satellite components, was conceived largely at the Ocean Observations conference in St. Raphael, France, in October 1999. It was recognized that adequate information was not available {{on the state of}} the world ocean or its regional variations to address a range of important societal needs. Subsequent work by the marine carbon community and others in the ocean science and operational communities led to an agreed international plan described in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Implementation Plan (GCOS- 92, 2004). This foundation observing system was designed to meet climate requirements, but also supports weather prediction, global and coastal ocean prediction, marine <b>hazard</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> transportation, marine environment and ecosystem monitoring, and naval applications. Here, we describe efforts made to reach the goals set out in the international plan. Thanks to these efforts, most of the ice-free ocean above 2000 m is now being observed systematically for the first time, and a global repeat hydrographic survey and selected transport measurements supplement these networks. The system is both integrated and composite. It depends upon in situ and satellite networks that measure the same variable using different sensors. In this way, optimum use is made of all available platforms and sensors to maximize coverage and attain maximum accuracy. Wherever feasible, observations are transmitted in real time or near real time to maximize their utility, from short-term ocean forecasting to estimation of century-long trends. Because our historical knowledge of oceanic variability is limited, we are learning about the sampling requirements and needed accuracies as the system is implemented and exploited. The system will evolve as technology and knowledge improve. The biggest challenge for the greater oceanographic community—including both research and operational components—will be demonstrating impacts and benefits sufficient to justify the funds needed to complete the observing system, as well as to sustain its funding for the long term...|$|R
40|$|Most of today's Advanced Driver Assistance <b>Systems</b> (ADAS) issue <b>warnings</b> {{to guide}} the driver in {{critical}} situations. Thus, the optimal design of warnings {{is one of the}} crucial aspects for the effectiveness and acceptance of ADAS. According to research findings on uni-modal and spatial warning signals a new visual warning concept has been developed and implemented in a driving simulator. A total of 6 LED based visual warning indicators were placed at specific positions in the vehicle interior in order {{to guide the}} driver's visual attention to the direction of a particular <b>hazard.</b> The <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> has been experimentally compared against conventional visual warnings on the instrument cluster in a driving simulator study. Results indicate a clear advantage of distributed warnings: The frequency of collisions could be reduced; driver reacted quicker to the warning stimulus and subjectively rated the distributed warnings to be more useful than the visual warning on the instrument cluster. The results confirm the hypothesis that spatially distributed visual warnings can improve the effectiveness and acceptance of ADAS warnings...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of a tsunami, {{a set of}} oceans waves caused by any large, abrupt disturbance of the sea surface, hitting a vulnerable system on land can cause massive loss of life, destruction of coastal infrastructure and disruption of economic activity. Vulnerability assessment and risk modelling are important components for an effective end-to-end <b>hazard</b> early <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> and therefore contribute significantly to disaster risk reduction. The focus {{of this study is}} on the capabilities and synergistic usage of multisensoral remotely sensed data to contribute to these complex tasks. We use medium and high resolution optical satellite data (Landsat and Ikonos), high resolution radar data from TerraSAR-X as well as a digital elevation model to provide multiple products for the assessment of spatial vulnerability in case of a tsunami impact on the heterogeneous and highly structured coastal urban area of Padang, Indonesia. Results include physical indicators like dimension and location of urbanization, quantification of potentially affected buildings, the identification of safe areas as well as a time-dependent population assessment...|$|R
