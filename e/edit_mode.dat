25|$|<b>Edit</b> <b>mode</b> {{allows the}} {{creation}} of tracks. Players can lay track pieces that come in an assortment of sizes and shapes. Each piece has a list of obstacles available. Track pieces are valued at varying points, for example, larger pieces are worth more points. A track may have up to 255 points. Players can participate in races on them, or setup camera angles to spectate artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled racers. Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and shared with other players via Game Link Cable. The game can also generate a track-specific password that can be inputted on any Climax cartridge for conversion back to the custom track.|$|E
2500|$|Recordset: A {{recordset}} is a {{group of}} records, and can either come from a base table or {{as the result of a}} query to the table. The RecordSet object contains a Fields collection and a Properties collection. The Fields collection is a set of Field objects, which are the corresponding columns in the table. The Properties collection is a set of Property objects, which defines a particular functionality of an OLE DB provider. The RecordSet has numerous methods and properties for examining the data that exists within it. Records can be updated in the recordset by changing the values in the record and then calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Adding new records is performed through the AddNew function and then by calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Records are also deleted in the recordset with the Delete method and then by calling on the Update method. However, if for some reason the deletion cannot occur, such as because of violations in referential integrity, then the recordset will remain in <b>edit</b> <b>mode</b> after the call to the Update method. The programmer must explicitly call on the CancelUpdate function to cancel the update. Additionally, ADO can roll back transactions (if this is supported) and cancel batch updates. Recordsets can also be updated in one of three ways: via an immediate update, via a batch update, or through the use of transactions: ...|$|E

50|$|Editing modes: The {{two primary}} modes of work are Object Mode and <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode,</b> which are toggled with the Tab key. Object mode {{is used to}} {{manipulate}} individual objects as a unit, while <b>Edit</b> <b>mode</b> is used to manipulate the actual object data. For example, Object Mode {{can be used to}} move, scale, and rotate entire polygon meshes, and <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode</b> can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh. There are also several other modes, such as Vertex Paint, Weight Paint, and Sculpt Mode.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the modes}} in Elebits is [...] "Edit Mode". In <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode,</b> players can {{create their own}} stages by placing {{different}} kinds of objects and Elebits throughout any of the 29 stages in the game. Levels are only available in <b>edit</b> <b>mode</b> if they have previously been completed in Story Mode. One can also adjust the gameplay by changing the watts needed for completion, how strong the gravity is, or what kind of items the player can use. The furniture and objects {{that can be used}} in <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode</b> are also dependent on the completion of Story Mode. The player must get at least a 'B' rank in a stage before they can use the stage-specific items.|$|E

Also, ThinkFree Online supports a synchronization manager utility to keep documents on the desktop, online and mobile workspaces automatically updated.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, a {{computer}} program that has two modes of operation might employ low-key feedback to keep the user informed about the current mode. If the program had a view mode and an <b>edit</b> <b>mode,</b> background color of the workspace might subtly change from white to pale yellow when switching to <b>edit</b> <b>mode.</b> A web browser application could {{keep track of the}} pages the user has visited and alter the colors of links that point to pages the user has already viewed.|$|E
50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} Fire Pro Wrestling series of games, particularly the later games in the series, is the inclusion of an extensive and highly detailed wrestler creation and <b>edit</b> <b>mode.</b> The <b>edit</b> <b>mode</b> of Fire Pro Wrestling games allows players to build game characters {{with a high level}} of attention to detail. Appearance characteristics, such as clothing and ring attire, and physical build, head and facial features, can be customized for a created wrestler. A detailed set of wrestling and fighting moves, drawn from the large pool of moves built into each game, can also be assigned to a created wrestler. The <b>edit</b> <b>mode</b> of Fire Pro Wrestling games also allows players to make detailed changes to the CPU logic of an edited wrestler, making it possible for a skilled creator to create a wrestler that behaves very much like his real-life counterpart, even when controlled by the computer.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{previous}} DOS versions, WordPerfect 6.0 for DOS (released in 1993) could {{switch between}} its traditional text-based <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> and a graphical <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> {{that showed the}} document as it would print out known as WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), including fonts. The previous text-based versions used different colors or text color inversions to indicate various markups, and (starting with version 5.0) used a graphic mode only for an uneditable print preview that used generic fonts rather than the actual fonts that appeared on the printed page.|$|R
50|$|Since version 1.15, {{released}} in December 2013, Calibre also contains {{an application for}} creating and editing e-books directly, similar to the more full-featured Sigil application, but without that application's WYSIWYG <b>editing</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{is always}} 'live' {{and there is}} no separate <b>edit</b> <b>mode.</b> All changes and edits to the patch can be done while the patch is playing.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the game's standard rhythm game feature, is the ability for user-generated content in the game's <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode.</b> The <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode</b> allows users {{to create their own}} custom Promotional Video (PV) or Music Video, which either uses songs already in the game or any MP3 format music file from the player for the PV. Players can customize the video playing in the background, the various modules, backgrounds, costumes and even dance moves by the modules in the PV. Players can also modify the module's face to make the module appear to be singing so as to lip-sync the custom song to the video. Other than the <b>Edit</b> <b>Mode,</b> there is also a Diva's Room mode in which players can buy and obtain items throughout the game or from the in-game store to decorate their module's room with. Players can also take screenshots of their modules whilst they are playing in their room.|$|E
50|$|Beatmania Append 5thMIX (March 2, 2000): Append disc port of {{the arcade}} 5thMix. All new {{songs from the}} arcade were included, with several console-exclusive songs {{available}} in Bonus <b>Edit</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the model, the design principles and {{the prototype of}} a refactoring toolset for Erlang programs. With this toolset one can incrementally carry out programmer-guided meaning-preserving program transformations. Erlang is a mostly dynamically typed language, {{and many of its}} seman-tical rules are also dynamic. Therefore the main challenge in this research is {{to ensure the safety of}} (the statically performed) refactoring steps. The paper analyses the language constructs of Erlang with respect to refactoring. A novelty of the presented approach is that programs are rep-resented, stored and manipulated in a relational database. This feature makes it possible to express refactoring steps in a fairly compact and comprehensible way. The proposed software development environment with the in-tegrated refactoring tool provides multiple <b>editing</b> <b>modes.</b> These <b>editing</b> <b>modes</b> support changes ranging from fully controlled (allowing only meaning-preserving transformations) to uncon-trolled (editing program text freely). Transformations are per-formed more safely and efficiently in an <b>editing</b> <b>mode</b> with higher control. Keywords Erlang · refactoring tool · semantical analysis · functional languag...|$|R
