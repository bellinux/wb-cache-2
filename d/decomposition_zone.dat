40|$|We have {{investigated}} the distributions and carbon isotopic compositions of archaeal membrane lipids in gas-hydrate-bearing sediments collected from the northern Cascadia Margin offshore from Vancouver Island (Sites U 1327 and U 1328) by the R/V JOIDES Resolution during IODP Expedition 311. Archaeal lipid biomarkers, including glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), tend to become abundant below 100 mbsf (meters below sea floor). Tricyclic biphytane (BP[3]; which is a robust biomarker derived from GDGT), crenarchaeol, and other BPs exhibit d 13 C values of ca. - 20 per mil, and become abundant between 130 and 230 mbsf at Site U 1328. In this depth range, concentrations of ammonium and phosphate in interstitial waters also increase, suggesting that a larger population and higher activity of heterotrophic community consisting of crenarchaeota and other archaea decompose the sedimentary organic matter, thereby liberating ammonium and phosphate. Such crenarchaeotic activity can produce other metabolic products such as molecular hydrogen by fermentation of organic matter during diagenesis. Furthermore, near the organic matter <b>decomposition</b> <b>zone</b> (130 to 230 mbsf), a probable methanogen biomarker (13 C-depleted BP[1] with d 13 C values as low as - 48. 8 per mil) becomes abundant, indicating that methanogens utilize these diagenetic products.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the Solid Propulsion Integrity Program (SPIP) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is development of thermal analysis codes capable of accurately predicting the temperature field, pore pressure field and the surface recession experienced by decomposing polymers which are used as thermal barriers in solid rocket nozzles. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide means for verifications of thermal analysis codes developed for modeling of flow and heat transfer in solid rocket nozzles. In order to meet the stated objective, a test facility was designed and constructed for measurement of the transient temperature field in a sample composite subjected to a constant heat flux boundary condition. The heating was provided via a steel thin-foil with a thickness of 0. 025 mm. The designed electrical circuit can provide a heating rate of 1800 W. The heater was sandwiched between two identical samples, and thus ensure equal power distribution between them. The samples were fitted with Type K thermocouples, and the exact location of the thermocouples were determined via X-rays. The experiments were modeled via a one-dimensional code (UT 1 D) as a conduction and phase change heat transfer process. Since the pyrolysis gas flow was in the direction normal to the heat flow, the numerical model could not account for the convection cooling effect of the pyrolysis gas flow. Therefore, the predicted values in the <b>decomposition</b> <b>zone</b> are considered to be an upper estimate of the temperature. From the analysis of the experimental and the numerical results the following are concluded: (1) The virgin and char specific heat data for FM 5055 as reported by SoRI can not be used to obtain any reasonable agreement between the measured temperatures and the predictions. However, use of virgin and char specific heat data given in Acurex report produced good agreement for most of the measured temperatures. (2) Constant heat flux heating process can produce a much higher heating rate than the radiative heating process. The results show that heating rates of 125 C/s (225 F/s) can be achieved. (3) The electrical resistance of the FM 5055 samples were about 150 Omega in the virgin state, and decreased to about 35 Omega when charred. A reliable scheme must be developed to electrically insulate the composite from the heater foil in order to prevent any current leakage into the sample which can result in volumetric heating of the char zone of the composite...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The domain {{decomposition}} method and the zonal methods are efficient techniques in the numerical solution of boundary value problems in computational fluid dynamics. The numerical simulation of the exterior boundary value problems, as for example transonic flow around an airfoil, requires the decomposition {{of the initial}} unbounded domain into a bounded computational domain and the far field, see [1], [4], [7], [8], [10], [11].

40|$|Differential area {{profiles}} (DAPs) are point-based multiscale descriptors used in {{pattern analysis}} and image segmentation. They are defined through sets of size-based connected morphological filters that constitute a joint area opening top-hat and area closing bottom-hat scale-space of the input image. The work {{presented in this}} paper explores the properties of this image decomposition through sets of area zones. An area zone defines a single plane of the DAP vector field and contains all the peak components of the input image, whose size is between the zone’s attribute extrema. Area zones can be computed efficiently from hierarchical image representation structures, in a way similar to regular attribute filters. Operations on the DAP vector field can then be computed without the need for exporting it first, and an example with the leveling-like convex/concave segmentation scheme is given.

30|$|While {{many studies}} have shown that {{inoculation}} can enhance composting, most have focused on specific microorganisms and/or large-scale composting systems. Initially, as the microbial population begins to decompose the degradable material in a compost pile, the heat generated is trapped by the compost material, resulting in a temperature rise. If the pile is too large, anaerobic zones occur near the center, slowing <b>decomposition</b> in these <b>zones.</b> If the pile is too small, it loses heat quickly, and also slows down the process. As a result, microorganism activity may vary in different-sized piles. Only two studies have determined the effect of microbial inoculants in small-scale composting. Nair and Okamitsu (2010) used Effective Microorganism (EM) and Trichoderma sp. in composting of putrescible kitchen waste. They combined thermocomposting and vermicomposting and found that ligno-cellulolytic inoculants are not essential to accelerating composting for onsite, small-scale, household organic waste treatment. However, EM inoculation enhanced the reproductive rate of earthworms. Another study was conducted by Abdullah et al. (2013) who determined the effects of using a solution of mixed bacteria of Bacillus sp., Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Aspergillus sp., Cellulomonas sp., Chaetomium sp., Penicillium sp. and Trichoderma sp. as starter culture on kitchen-waste composting consisting of vegetable scraps and fish processing waste in an in-vessel system.

However, {{factors such as the}} depth to the water table below the riverbed, which could determine the quality of the hyporheic refuge, are not well understood. We explored how depth to the water table (control, − 5 [*]cm, − 30 [*]cm and completely dry) during a 1 -week drying event affected the survival and return to the substrate surface (%RTS) of Gammarus pulex (Crustacea[*]:[*]Amphipoda) using laboratory mesocosms. We measured litter decomposition and Gammarus energy stores to examine effects on ecosystem function and energetic costs for organisms crawling deeper into the hyporheic zone. Two populations, collected from intermittent and perennial rivers, were used to evaluate inter-population variability in response to drying. Survival and %RTS were reduced by ≤ 39 % and 52 %, respectively, in the − 30 [*]cm and dry treatments, and this had consequences for decomposition (≤ 46 % reduction). Differences between populations in %RTS were high across treatments but did not generally affect survival and decomposition. Our results suggest that increases in depth to the water table during river drying, which often result from longer drying duration and water abstraction, could reduce invertebrate resilience and litter decomposition by diminishing the role of the hyporheic zone as a source of colonists...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} infinities (divergent integrals) {{appearing}} in {{quantum field theory}} or elementary particle physics are treated by renormalization in the current theories. By this perturbative tool the desired finite quantities are produced by differences of infinities. This paper gives a new non-perturbative approach to this problem. Namely, the Hilbert space on which the quantum Hamilton operator $H$ is acting, is decomposed into subspaces, called Zeeman zones, which are invariant under the actions both of $H$ and the natural complex Heisenberg group representation. Thus well defined particle theory and zonal geometry can be developed on each zone separately. One of the most surprising {{result is that the}} quantities which appear as infinities on the global setting become well defined finite ones on the zonal setting. For instance, both the Wiener-Kac and the Dirac-Feynman kernels become of the trace class on the zones, both defining the corresponding zonal measures on the path-spaces rigorously. The Hamilton operators, $H$, considered in this paper are those corresponding to electrons orbiting in a constant magnetic field. This {{is one of the most}} important Hamiltonians, introduced for explaining the Zeeman effect. This Hamiltonian is identified with the Laplacian of certain Riemannian,so called Zeeman manifolds. The spectral Zeeman <b>zone</b> <b>decomposition</b> is introduced, by one of the definitions, by the spectrum of the angular momentum operator.

40|$|The Fibonacci grid, {{proposed}} by Swinbank and Purser (see companion abstract), provides attractive properties for global numerical atmospheric prediction by offering an optimally homogeneous, geometrically regular, and approximately isotropic discretization, {{with only the}} polar regions requiring special numerical treatment. It is a mathematical idealization, applied to the sphere, of the multi-spiral patterns often found in botanical structures, such as in pine cones and sunflower heads. Computationally, it is natural to organize the domain, into zones, in each of which the same pair, or triple, of "Fibonacci spirals" dominate. But the further subdivision of such zones into "tiles" of a shape and size suitable for distribution to the processors of a massively parallel computer requires very careful consideration if the subsequent spatial computations along the respective spirals, especially those computations (such as compact differencing schemes) that involve recursion, can be implemented in an efficient "load-balanced "manner without requiring excessive amounts of inter-processor communications. In this paper we show how certain "number theoretic" properties of the Fibonacci sequence (whose numbers prescribe the multiplicity of successive spirals) may be exploited in the <b>decomposition</b> of grid <b>zones</b> into tidy arrangements of triangular grid tiles, each tile possessing one side approximately parallel to the constant-latitude zone boundary.

Their role in ecosystem processes in surface soil has been studied extensively, but effects of burrowing species on processes in subsurface soil remain poorly known. We investigated the effects of burrowing and grazing by plains vizcachas (Lagostomus maximus, Chinchilidae), a large colonial burrowing rodent native to South America, on the distribution and dynamics of C and N in soil of a semi-arid scrub ecosystem in central Argentina. In situ N mineralization (Nmin), potential Nmin and CO 2 emissions were measured in surface soil (0 - 10 cm) and soil at the mean depth of burrows (65 ± 10 cm; mean ± 1 SD) in five colonial burrow systems and adjacent grazed and ungrazed <b>zones.</b> <b>Decomposition</b> and N dynamics of vizcacha feces on the soil surface and in burrow soil was assessed using litterbags.

Inorganic N, particularly NO 3 -, was consistently highest in burrows, intermediate in surface soil on burrow systems, and relatively low in all other zones. Despite high C and N content in all burrows, in situ net Nmin was highly variable in burrow soil. Feces decomposed and released N more rapidly in burrow soil.

This zone has been the scene of several large-scale ecological restoration efforts since the late 1990 s, and has witnessed significant changes in climate and human activities. Assessing the relative roles of different causal factors on NPP variability in TNSP zone is very important for establishing reasonable local policies to realize the emission reduction targets for central government. In this study, we examined the relative roles of drought and land cover conversion(LCC) on inter-annual changes of TNSP zone for 2001 - 2010. We applied integrated correlation and decomposition analyses to a Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and MODIS land cover dataset. Our results show that the 10 -year average NPP within this region was about 420 Tg C. We found that about 60 % of total annual NPP over the study area was significantly correlated with SPEI (p< 0. 05). The LCC-NPP relationship, which is especially evident for forests in the south-central area, indicates that ecological programs {{have a positive impact on}} C sequestration in the TNSP <b>zone.</b> <b>Decomposition</b> analysis generally indicated that the contributions of LCC, drought, and other Natural or Anthropogenic activities (ONA) to changes in NPP generally had a consistent distribution pattern for consecutive years.

40|$|Leaf litter {{is a major}} {{component}} in the organic matter budgets of streams worldwide. Shredding invertebrates are widely considered to be of central importance for the breakdown of allochthonous organic material in temperate-zone streams. However, various authors report an absence of this group in tropical streams. Various phenomena, including hydraulic disturbance, chemical leaf quality, and biotic control through macroconsumers, may cause variable shredder performance in streams. Our paper discusses the hypothesis that biogeographic distribution and the life-cycle strategies of the shredders are additional factors affecting the contribution of invertebrates to lotic decomposition processes. As a case study, we analyzed the type of organic matter inputs, the community of benthic invertebrate shredders, and the <b>decomposition</b> of temperate <b>zone</b> leaves (alder, Alnus glutinosa) in the Breitenbach (BRB), a temperate stream in Hesse, Germany, and in the Córrego Tenente Amaral (CTA), a neotropical Cerrado stream in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Quantities of natural leaf-litter inputs were comparable in the 2 systems (CTA: 820 g m - 2 y - 1, BRB: 700 g m - 2 y - 1), but the diversity of trees varied from 60 species/ha in CTA to 5 in BRB. Several shredding species were found in CTA, but in very low abundances. Larvae of the shredding calamoceratid caddisfly Phylloicus sp. were found only in lateral pools {{and not in the}} stream channel at CTA. Earlier decomposition experiments with naturally fallen native leaves did not indicate any importance of shredders at CTA, but green leaves of A. glutinosa were rapidly consumed by mining chironomids (Stenochironomus sp.). Decomposition rates were faster in CTA (–k= 0. 035 ± 0. 006) than in BRB during wintertime (0. 0095 ± 0. 0021). We conclude that detritivorous neotropical insects may have 2 different species traits.

40|$|Physically based {{deformable}} {{models have}} become ubiquitous in computer graphics. It allow to synthetize real behaviors, {{based on the}} physical laws from continuum mechanics. In this thesis, we focus on interactive simulations such as to video games or surgical simulators. The majority of the existing works focused up to here on the animation of objects made of homogeneous materials. Nevertheless, plenty of real objects, for instance like the biological structures, consist of multiple imbricated materials. Their <b>decomposition</b> in homogeneous <b>zones</b> requires a high-resolution spatial discretization to solve the variations of the material properties, which requires prohibitive computation time. In this context, we present new real time simulation techniques for deformable objects which can be cut. First of all, we present a real time method for cutting deformable objects in which, contrary to the previous methods, the object deforms on the cutting tool contact and cuts occur only when the pressure reaches a certain level. The independence of the physical, collision and visual models makes the topological changes easier. The GPU computing and local modifications enable fast execution. Then, a dynamic meshless method is described, which uses reference frames as control nodes instead of using points, with a displacement field formulation similar to skinning. It allows to easily tune the weights and benefits from the rigor of physical methods as the finite elements. The introduction of integration points, reducing the samples number by a least squares approximation, speeds up the spatial integrations. Other pre-computations are proposed in order {{to speed up the}} simulation time. Finally, new anisotropic shape functions are defined to encode the variations of material properties thanks to the introduction of the compliance distance. These complex shape functions uncouple the material resolution of the displacement functions ones. It allow an extremely sparse nodes sampling. The use of the compliance distance allows an automatic nodes distribution with regard to the material properties. Cette thèse consiste à explorer une nouvelle approche pour la simulation d'objets flexibles par la mécanique des milieux continus, dans le cadre d'applications graphiques interactives telles que le jeu vidéo ou l'entraînement aux gestes chirurgicaux. Elle s'inscrit en continuité d'un stage de M 2 -R sur ce même sujet. Il est important de pouvoir régler simplement un compromis entre précision et temps de calcul suivant la nature de l'application. Les approches actuelles de simulation utilisent principalement la méthode des éléments finis. Celle-ci repose sur un maillage volumique des objets qu'il est souvent difficile d'adapter dynamiquement aux besoins de l'application. La nouveauté introduite par cette thèse est d'utiliser des repères déformables comme primitives cinématiques, avec des champs de déplacements inspirés des méthodes de 'skinning' utilisées en informatique graphique. Le but est d'éviter ainsi les difficultés liées au maillage volumique, ainsi que de faciliter le raffinement et la simplification adaptatives par simple ajout ou suppression de repère déformable là où c'est souhaitable. Ce travail est financé par le projet européen 'Passport for Virtual Surgery', dont le but est de créer automatiquement des modèles physiques pour l'entraînement aux gestes de chirurgie hépatique, à partir de données médicales et anatomiques personnalisées. Dans ce contexte, Guillaume, en collaboration avec d'autres membres du projet, mettra en place les outils nécessaires pour construire la scène physique à partir d'images médicales segmentées et de connaissances anatomiques génériques. Le foie sera dans un premier temps représenté par des modèles physiques précédemment développés à EVASION et étendus aux opérations de découpe. Par la suite, il y appliquera son nouveau modèle mécanique basé sur des repères déformables. The aim of this thesis is to develop a new approach for the simulation of flexible objects based on the continous middle method, related with interactive graphics applications such as video games or training in surgery. It is a continuity of the M 2 research internship on the same topic. It is important to simply settle a compromise between accuracy and time computing according to the application. Current simulation approaches mainly use the finite element method, which is based on a volumetric mesh of the simulated objects. It is often difficult to dynamically adapt the needs to the application. The novelty of this thesis is to use deformable reference frames as kinematic primitives, with displacement fields based on 'skinning' methods used in computer graphics. The aim is to avoid the difficulties associated with volumetric mesh, and make the refinement and the adaptive simplification easier by adding or deleting deformable reference frames if necessary.
