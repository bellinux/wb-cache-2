40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} multiple types of fire sensors for early and reliable mine fire detection. Background The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has evaluated the effectiveness of multiple types of fire sensors for early mine fire detection and nuisance signal discrimination. Reliable early fire detection in underground mine can be hindered by <b>false</b> <b>fire</b> alarms produced by carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke particulate emissions from diesel equipment, welding, and metal-burning activities. Another <b>false</b> <b>fire</b> alarm source is the cross-interference of hydrogen (H 2) produced by battery-charging operations with a CO sensor's chemical cell. Workers can learn to ignore repetitious "false" alarms associated with these emissions. This jeopardizes their safety {{in the event of}} a mine fire...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT] The {{main purpose}} of this work was to {{construct}} an efficient algorithm for forest fire detection method using NOAA satellite images. The forest fire analysis using this NOAA satellite {{has been done by}} various researchers. However, most of the method can detect the fire but a lot of <b>false</b> <b>fire</b> also appeared in the results and missing of actual fire also happened in some cases. Here we analyzed four satellite based fire detection methods to compare the fundamental differences, problems and effectiveness. To do so we used the data from AVHRR of NOAA- 16 of a period of three to six months for Sakhalin and Japan region. Considering their problems and drawbacks an improved fire detection method with statistical analysis has been constructed here. Our method has reduced the <b>false</b> <b>fire</b> detection very significantly as well as detected the actual fire with high accuracy. This method can be applied to a real time forest fire monitoring system for Russia and Southeast Asian region, which is very important for early warning and early detection of fire for reducing the damages of forest fire. And also this study applied Siberian forest fire analysis for several years...|$|R
25|$|At {{first the}} {{beginning}} of each Jewish month was signaled to the communities of Israel and beyond by fires lit on mountaintops, but after the Samaritans began to light <b>false</b> <b>fires,</b> messengers were sent. The inability of the messengers to reach communities outside Israel before mid-month High Holy Days (Succot and Passover) led outlying communities to celebrate scriptural festivals for two days rather than one, observing the second feast-day of the Jewish diaspora because of uncertainty of whether the previous month ended after 29 or 30 days.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though the}} tanks were removed in 1824, aqua drama {{was a part}} of a long lasting theatre’s history. The legacy left behind of aquatic theatre is only a few pages in books and websites, and a {{painting}} or two, but Sadler’s Wells legacy has been alive and well since Richard Sadler first opened his music house in 1683. Since then the theatre has seen many triumphs and tragedies. After Charles Dibdin, Jr. resigned there was a <b>false</b> <b>fire</b> alarm during one of the shows which lead to 18 people being stampeded to death.|$|R
50|$|In 1905, the sophomores {{erected a}} large {{barricade}} {{of snow and}} wire.

In order to win, the freshmen had to keep the cannon in the firing area for fifteen minutes; the sophomores rushed them and a melee ensued, but the freshmen were able to hold their position. Meanwhile, the fire department, annoyed at the false alarm and the melee, drenched the students with their fire hoses.|$|R

40|$|Forests play an {{important}} role in the society and economy of Scandinavian countries and Finland. Airborne and ground based means of surveillance are not enough to detect forest fires in the vast areas of forest of these countries. Satellite-borne detection of forest fires based on remote sensing techniques facilitates the early recognition of forest fires in remote places, augmenting the traditional methods of detection. The purpose of this thesis is to develop an algorithm to detect forest fires in Scandinavia and Finland using data from one of the most used sensors in fire detection, the AVHRR instrument carried onboard NOAA environmental satellites. AVHRR data, provided in form of data sets, contain the brightness temperatures and albedos of different wavelength channels from measurements taken by the instrument. The working principles of the algorithm are based on comparing the brightness temperatures of the 3. 7 μm channel and other channels with a series of thresholds to select those hot pixels caused by true forest <b>fires</b> and exclude <b>false</b> <b>fire</b> pixels. Several tests based on thresholds have been developed to be applied to the data sets in order to detect true forest <b>fires</b> and eliminate <b>false</b> <b>fires</b> caused by non-fire objects. As output, the algorithm gives the location of the forest fires. The number of true forest fires detected depends on the thresholds selected and the spatial resolution of the sensors and the data. The satellite detected fire pixels are later calibrated with ground truth data. By means of calibration of the algorithm, the thresholds are set in order to detect as many true forest fires as possible without getting too many <b>false</b> <b>fires.</b> On the basis of the results obtained from the algorithm, it has been demonstrated that the algorithm accomplishes with the task of detecting forest fires in Scandinavia and Finland. However, a large number of forest fires are missed due to the reduced resolution data employed and the process of obtaining it, which excludes a large part of the observations. This suggests that complete higher resolution data should be used in forest fire detection algorithms based on satellite data to improve their reliability.
