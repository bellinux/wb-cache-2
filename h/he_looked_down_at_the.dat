500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> setlist taped {{to the body of}} the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I knew for sure {{he was going to do}} it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E
2500|$|Henri Pélissier was {{the first}} French winner of the Tour de France since 1911, and ended a series of seven Belgian victories. Desgrange, {{who had been in}} a fight with Pélissier for three years, wrote [...] "The {{mountains}} seemed to sink lower, sunk by the victorious thrust of his muscle. More than a score of times on the most vicious gradients, hands on the tops of the bars, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> valley bottoms, like an eagle staring at his prey". The French victory was good for the organising newspaper l'Auto: the circulation increased to almost half a million copies, while it peaked at one million the morning after Pélissier's victory.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground, {{his voice}} tailing off into silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his feet, thoughtfully {{considering}} the proposition.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her face, luminous, quivering with excitement--and understood.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his table-desk, {{fingering}} the starry enameled vase.|$|R
60|$|Lingard rose. His face cleared, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> anxious Babalatchi {{with sudden}} benevolence.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{briefcase}} on the floor. Underneath {{them the}} jets murmured and vibrated evenly, {{as the ship}} moved through space toward distant Terra.|$|E
60|$|He {{was going}} to tell him to keep away, but he relented as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{harmless}} little man, with his thin, boyish face.|$|E
60|$|Unclasping {{his arms}} and {{stepping}} back, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> himself.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{his voice}} faltered somewhat, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} a quick frown. Decidedly he was annoyed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{floor on}} either side of him in the old manner, looked up in the old manner, and {{repeated}} in the old low voice: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{inspector}} {{glanced over}} his shoulder at that inner room, from which fitful gleams of light still came. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heap of pistols and ammunition by his side.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I couldn’t be a chrysalis," [...] he said, slowly, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{recumbent}} {{figure of}} the captain, [...] "do you know what I would like to be?" ...|$|E
60|$|Victoria {{glanced at}} him with {{interest}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Meader.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me like {{a father}} gazing tenderly at the wayward child.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a curly {{head and}} a sweet pretty face that he knew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my boy," [...] {{replied the}} man, [...] "and {{what about my}} dog?" [...] and, as he said this, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dog, which was lying upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|She painfully penciled a {{note and}} handed it to him as she came past to the blackboard. He was putting on his coat to go, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{crumpled}} note, with its Spencerian handwriting.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hearthrug, {{and tried}} to throw off a memory of his Princhester classes for young women, that oppressed him. His manner he forced to a more {{familiar}} note. He stuck {{his hands into his}} trouser pockets.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her for {{a moment}} as he held her close to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Ann and was {{surprised}} to see a joyless thoughtfulness upon her face.|$|R
60|$|The colour burned {{once more}} in his cheeks. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his attire with dissatisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|He bore it, in cors, like a Trojin, {{and in a}} {{month he}} too was well, and his wound heel'd; but I never see a man look so like a devvle as he used sometimes, when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stump! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tiller in his hands. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{should like}} to tell you about myself. I {{should like to}} know what you think of the kind of man I am. Will you be honest if I will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will be hard}} on Julia," [...] Lambert slowly responded. [...] "She hasn't {{much else}} but the girl and her religion." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor. [...] "Yes, that is a rough sentence, professor, but I shouldn't wonder if you were right." ...|$|E
60|$|The Duke {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his cigar and then {{suddenly}} up again.|$|R
60|$|When {{the doctor}} came {{in some time}} later <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Aynsley before <b>he</b> turned to Ruth.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, and his {{expression}} softened. He needed comfort, and never was she more welcome to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Umslopogaas, {{leaning on}} his red axe, [...] "there remains but one thing to do, make a good end, though I would that it were in a greater cause. At least we must either fight or fly," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wounded.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{card with}} a certain vague sense of inarticulate disapproval. But he noticed {{at the same time}} it was finer and clearer and more delicately {{engraved}} than any other card he had ever yet come across. It bore in simple unobtrusive letters the unknown name, [...] "Mr. Bertram Ingledew." ...|$|E
60|$|Something in {{his tone}} seemed to suggest to Andrew a new idea. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clothes he wore beneath his oilskins--the clothes almost of a working man. He glanced {{for a moment at}} his hands, {{hardened}} and blistered with the actual toil which he loved--and he looked his brother straight in the face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her. Her {{eyes were}} dark and soft and unfolded, with a {{stricken}} look that roused him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his companion--her {{eyes were}} lowered; {{he could not}} tell at all what she was {{thinking}} of.|$|R
60|$|She {{had taken}} her seat. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her dusky young face. Her voice was always clear and measured.|$|R
