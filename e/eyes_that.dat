5|$|Aletheia– The former Oracle of Delphi who was gifted with prophetic sight. When she was {{encountered}} by Kratos, she {{was shown to}} be an elderly woman who had no eyes. Castor and Pollux crushed her under rocks so that Kratos could not see her. Her dying words to Kratos told him to seek the Eyes of Truth across the sea in the Lantern of Delos—the Eyes being her own <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> were taken by the Furies. The character was voiced by Adrienne Barbeau in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> were used to hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging {{on the ground or}} onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
5|$|Medusae {{and complex}} {{swimming}} colonies such as siphonophores and chondrophores sense tilt and acceleration {{by means of}} statocysts, chambers lined with hairs which detect the movements of internal mineral grains called statoliths. If the body tilts in the wrong direction, the animal rights itself by increasing {{the strength of the}} swimming movements on the side that is too low. Most species have ocelli ("simple eyes"), which can detect sources of light. However the agile Box Jellyfish are unique among Medusae because they possess four kinds of true <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> have retinas, corneas and lenses. Although the eyes probably do not form images, Cubozoa can clearly distinguish the direction from which light is coming as well as negotiate around solid-colored objects.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenology}} of T. T. Cloete This {{article is}} {{an exploration of}} the way phenomena are treated in the poetry of T. T. Cloete. Four important aspects of Cloete's way of looking are discussed, viz. the collecting <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> connects everything with everything, the <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> discovers correspondences, the deological <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> reads signs of God’s presence, and the reflecting eye. A critique of reflection is developed by means of a more detailed analysis of “Blydskap” (Joy). These four ways of seeing indicate links between Cloete's poetry and Husserl’s Phenomenology...|$|R
5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The head, having {{mouthparts}} projecting {{forward or}} sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and is sometimes very large. The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, {{as in the}} case of the aquatic whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and weevils have divided eyes, while many have <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> are notched, and a few have ocelli, small, simple eyes usually farther back on the head (on the vertex); these are more common in larvae than in adults. Ocelli are found in the adult carpet beetle (Dermestidae), some rove beetles (Omaliinae), and the Derodontidae.|$|E

5|$|William and Peter safely land in Jacksonville, and Peter directs them to {{find the}} home among the {{military}} housing where Olivia stayed at as a child, marked by a red-painted door by her birth-father. Once there, Peter finds the adult Olivia waiting for him, but realizes by her <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> this is not her. A younger Olivia reveals herself as Olivia's true ego; assured of Peter's identity, she willingly goes with him and Bell. However, they are attacked by {{the image of her}} step-father and several military personnel. Peter sacrifices himself to protect her, waking back up in the real world. Olivia is able to stand up against her past fears and stops their advance. William explains that she will be able to return to possession of her body as Walter, in the real world, attempts to extract William's mind.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E
50|$|The pupil is a hole {{located in}} the center of the iris of the <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> allows light to strike the retina.
