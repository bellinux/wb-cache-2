30|$|For eye irritation, the {{situation}} is essentially quite similar. The replacement of the Draize test for eye irritation again was achieved by two methods. The ex vivo Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP; [51, 52]) <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> is used to identify strong eye irritation potential and the in vitro EpiOcular™ <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> (EIT) is {{used to evaluate the}} irritation potential of compounds to the eye. The BCOP and similar ex vivo tests utilize slaughterhouse material to assess the severe eye irritation potential of a test substance through its ability to induce opacity and increased permeability in, for example, an isolated bovine cornea. In contrast, the EIT and similar tests use the commercially available reconstructed human cornea-like epithelium (RhCE), which closely mimics the histological, morphological, biochemical and physiological properties of the human corneal epithelium to determine if a test substance is an eye irritant based on its ability to induce cytotoxicity in RhCE tissue, as measured by the MTT assay. These tests, and alternatives, are again used {{within the context of a}} simple testing strategy and described in further detail elsewhere [52 – 56].|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of eye and skin irritation potential {{is essential to}} ensuring the safety of human in contact {{with a wide variety}} of substances. Despite this importance of irritation test, little is known with respect to the irritation potency of lomefloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, which has been known to cause photo-toxicity with an abnormal reaction of the skin. Thus, to investigate the tendency of lomefloxacin to cause eye and skin irritation, we carried out in vitro <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> using Balb/c 3 T 3, and in vitro skin irrita-tion test using KeraSkin TM human skin model system. 3 T 3 neutral red uptake assay has been proposed as a potential replacement alternative for the Draize <b>Eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test.</b> In this study, the IC 50 value obtained for lomefloxacin was 375 µg. According to the classification model used for determining in vitro categories, lomefloxacin was classified as moderately irritant. For {{evaluation of}} skin irritation, engineered epidermal equivalents (KeraSkin TM) were subjected to 10 and 25 mg of lomefloxacin for 15 minutes. Tissue damage was assessed by tissue viability evaluation, and by the release of a pro-inflammatory mediator, interleukin- 1 α. Lomefloxacin increased the interleukin- 1 α release after 15 minutes of exposure and 42 hours of post incubation, although no decrease in viability was observed. Therefore, lomefloxacin is considered to be moderately irritant to skin and eye...|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, the {{development}} of alternative testing methods in Europe was largely driven by ethical rationales such that studies were targeted for their use of many animals, or for their high potential to result in pain and suffering (e.g. skin and <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>testing).</b> Regulatory rationales were also an additional driver of alternative test methods, particularly those that identified compounds with alerts for “cut-off” hazards, such as mutagenicity and endocrine disruption.

40|$|The human cornea, and in {{particular}} the corneal epithelium, provides a transparent barrier for the passage of numerous potentially harmful substances and protects the intraocular tissues. In addition, the epithelium limits the access of exogenous applied pharmaceutical products into the eye. To this day, both the potential eye irritating effects of chemicals and the permeation behaviour of ophthalmologic medications are studied in animal experiments. Until now, several alternative <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>tests</b> have been validated and gained regulatory acceptance within the test strategy according to OECD Test Guideline 405. However, despite several efforts for many years, the Draize rabbit eye test could not have been replaced completely and none of the alternative methods allow the classification of moderate to mild irritants. Hence, establishing non-animal methods for the prediction of eye corrosion/irritation {{is still one of the}} challenges for the assessment of potentially harmful substances. In the present work an SV 40 -immortalised human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE) was characterised with respect to its suitability to serve as a model to study both the <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> potential of chemicals and the permeation of pharmaceuticals. For this reason different commercialised serum-containing and serum-free media were tested on HCE cells in order to assess the effects of serum and other supplements on different cellular characteristics such as growth, morphology and barrier properties. In detail, epithelial multilayers were subjected to histology for the evaluation of tissue morphology and cell proliferation. Barrier functions were investigated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) as well as the permeation of the hydrophilic marker fluorescein. Since barrier function in the normal cornea is maintained by tight junctions (zonulae occludentes) in the apical corneal epithelium, the expression of ZO- 1 as a marker molecule for the presence of tight junctions was studied. The formation of tight-junctions was further investigated using transmission electron micrographs (TEM). It could be shown that high concentrations of serum interfered with cellular differentiation and proliferation. Epithelia cultivated in serum containing medium showed hyperproliferation. Under serum-free culture conditions the layer morphology was comparable to the in vivo situation, epithelial cells stratified without intercellular spaces and vacuolisation. Ultra-structural quality of the KGM+++-models, as studied by TEM, revealed typical corneal features such as surface cell microvilli and intercellular adhesive junctions (numerous tight junctions, and desmosomes). In accordance to TEM results, models cultured serum-free developed a tighter barrier function which was confirmed by measuring its TEER values and tight junction-related proteins. Moreover, KGM+++-models were less permeable for fluorescein than cultured serum-containing. With decreasing TEER values, the permeability of fluorescein increased in linear correlation. Finally, in the context of this work, the esterase activity was detected. KGM+++-model showed metabolic activity. Furthermore, it was possible to expand the epithelium-model by a cross-linked collagen matrix embedded with stromal cells.

Results: Significant QSAR models for estimating <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> potential were constructed in which solute aqueous solvation free energy and solute-membrane interaction energies are the principle correlation descriptors. These physicochemical descriptors were selected from a trial set of 95 descriptors. Conclusion: Combining intermolecular solute-membrane interaction descriptors with intramolecular solute descriptors yields statistically significant <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> QSAR models. The resultant QSAR models support an <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> mechanism of the action in which increased aqueous solubility of the irritant, and its strength of binding to the membrane, both increase <b>eye</b> <b>irritation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Several {{suspected}} causal {{factors in}} our environment {{have been studied}} so far. One hypothesis is that indoor air pollution may cause <b>eye</b> and airway <b>irritation.</b> [...] <b>Eye</b> <b>irritation</b> depends somewhat on destabilization of the outer-eye tear film, in which the formation of dry spots on the cornea, resulting in ocular discomfort. [...] Occupational factors {{are also likely to}} influence the perception of <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> Some of these are lighting (glare and poor contrast), gaze position, reduced blink rate, limited number of breaks from visual tasking, and a constant combination of accommodation, musculoskeletal burden, and impairment of the visual nervous system. [...] Another factor that may be related is work stress. [...] In addition, psychological factors have been found in multivariate analyses to be associated with an increase in <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> among VDU users. [...] Other risk factors, such as chemical toxins/irritants (e.g. amines, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, N-decane, VOCs, ozone, pesticides and preservatives, allergens, etc.) might cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> as well.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: The Ex Vivo <b>Eye</b> <b>Irritation</b> <b>Test</b> (EVEIT) is used {{to analyse}} the {{clinical}} observations of corneal calcification attributed {{to the presence of}} phosphate within applied eye drops used in treating glaucoma, Still-Chauffard syndrome, ocular burns and dry eyes. Method: Live corneas from abattoir rabbit eyes were cultured in order to study epithelial healing following mechanical abrasion of the corneal surface combined with repeated exposure to various eye drops. Results: Obvious corneal calcification of the wound area along with a complete epithelial healing covering the calcified area was observed following exposure to phosphate hyaluronate eye drops. Epithelial healing without calcification was achieved using citrate hyaluronate eye drops. Conclusion: Clinical observations show that topical use of artificial tears containing phosphate on injured eyes may lead to sight-threatening corneal complications. Simulation of such treatment conditions by the EVEIT convincingly demonstrate that changes in the composition of the pharmaceutically used treatments can prevent this undesired side effect. Although considerable healing was achieved during the repeated application of eye drops, using either phosphate or citrate buffered, only the drops containing citrate did not develop corneal calcification on the eye. We therefore recommend discontinuing the use of phosphate buffered eye drops, or other topically applied solutions, to avoid further injury to the patient...|$|E
40|$|Agrochemicals and {{veterinary}} products must undergo numerous toxicological tests before registration. The use {{of animals}} in these studies is a controversial issue. The Draize <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of the}} most criticised methods because of the injuries inflicted on the test animals. Several in vitro methods have been used to investigate the toxicity of potential eye irritants with a view to replacing in vivo eye irritation testing. One of these alternative methods is the Hen’s Egg Test — Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) test. In the present studies comparative screening was performed with a set of agrochemicals to establish parallel data on in vitro (HET-CAM) and in vivo (Draize) results. The examined materials were: Totril (ioxynil), Omite 57 E (propargit), Actellic 50 EC (pyrimiphos-methyl), Stomp 330 EC (pendimethalin), Mospilan 3 EC (acetamiprid), Alirox 80 EC (EPTC), Match 050 EC (lufenuron), Nonit (dioctyl sulphosuccinate sodium), Perenal (haloxyfop-R methyl ester), Pyrinex 48 EC (chlorpyrifos). These experiments showed good correlation between results obtained by the HET-CAM test and those of the Draize rabbit eye test in most cases. The present form of the HET-CAM test can be proposed as a pre-screening method for the determination of eye irritative potential, therefore the number of test animals can be reduced and/or experimental animals can be replaced...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the years, animal {{models have}} been used {{extensively}} for toxicological safety assessment. Alternative methods {{that do not require}} animals have been developed extensively, but are adopted scarcely in spite of scientific, economical and societal deficiencies of animal models. This is believed {{to be part of a}} transition problem, which refers to the structural reorientation of an entire sector, in this case the life sciences. One example where technological change did happen is in the field of eye irritation testing. The Draize <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> using live rabbits has been (partially) replaced in OECD guidelines with the Isolated Chicken Eye (ICE) test and the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP) test. For this reason, the ICE and BCOP test serve as a case study to how and why they were successful in replacing the Draize test. The main research question is: Which sociotechnical factors influenced the successful technological development and regulatory validation of the BCOP and ICE test methods for (partially) replacing the Draize <b>eye</b> <b>irritation</b> <b>test</b> in the field of toxicological safety testing? The multi-level perspective (MLP) on transitions is employed as an analytical framework to analyze the case study according to the different levels (i. e. niche, regime and landscape) of the MLP. Data is obtained through literature review and interviews with twelve international experts in the field of toxicology. The results indicate that a globally operating, multi-actor network forms the basis of the safety-testing regime. It can be concluded that the safety-testing regime has undergone a transformation path: moderate landscape pressure in the form an effective anti-Draize campaign happened at a moment when the ICE and BCOP niche-innovations had not been sufficiently developed to fully substitute the Draize test. The safety-testing regime was disrupted enough for regime actors, industry and public authorities in particular, to pick up on the niche innovation. They responded by modifying the innovation activities that were needed to get organotypic methods validated for use in formal regulatory safety-assessment. From the moment that the first validation studies took place, the ICE and BCOP test have coexisted in symbiotic fashion next to the Draize test. Cumulative adjustments and reorientations in the safety-testing regime had to take place to validate the ICE and BCOP test: legislation was created that forced the development of alternatives methods. Industry in collaboration with public authorities and public research support actors started extensive validation programs, which have improved considerably through learning, by including prediction models, protocols and a tiered testing strategy. Under the landscape pressure of globalization, the EU and US saw increased collaboration that resulted in a retrospective validation study, which paved the way for US federal endorsement and OECD acceptance of the ICE and BCOP test...|$|E
50|$|Certain {{volatile}} organic compounds that are both chemically reactive and airway irritants may cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritation.</b> Personal factors (e.g. use of contact lenses, eye make-up, and certain medications) may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms. Nevertheless, if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause <b>eye</b> <b>irritation,</b> their content of surface-active compounds must be high.
