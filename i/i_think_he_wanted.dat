500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Pickard {{explained}} Tony's {{reason for}} marrying Cindy saying: [...] "he’s {{looking forward to}} someone {{not so much to}} fall in love with, but for more practical reasons – so he lets himself be swept off his feet by Cindy". Shortly before the wedding Tony becomes intoxicated and has sex with a woman who Darren has paid. Tony admits this to Cindy who in turn admits she and Darren had been planning to scam Tony. Waring said Tony has [...] "been a good man telling the truth and Cindy takes that as her opportunity to tell him the truth. All the cards are on the table". Pickard said he was [...] "surprised that Tony would go through with it because of their volatile relationship and the fact that Tony knows Cindy's into Darren. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to just go for it with her, and hopefully it'll work out for him". Pickard later stated that he didn't think Cindy was right for Tony stating: [...] "I don't think she's the one for him, to be honest". Tony meets Gabby Sharpe (Phina Oruche) which allows him to realise [...] "his marriage is over and he intends to tell Cindy that as soon as he gets home".|$|E

6000|$|... "Wedding invitations, eh?" [...] The {{proprietor}} smiled. [...] "Here is a {{young man}} about to get married," [...] he thought. [...] "By his looks, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> something rather nice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Caleb, {{looking up}} gravely, [...] "there is {{something}} wrong--a stranger, {{who is very}} ill, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> a doctor, and I came to tell you of that. His name is Raffles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{wanted me}} to marry Lord Nidderdale and Lord Grasslough, but I hated them both. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> me to marry Lord Nidderdale again now. He hasn't said so, but mamma tells me. But I never will,--never!' ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not express}} himself quite like this. He used {{gestures}} instead of adjectives, and he halted. I have put {{into my own}} words what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to see you, but I wasn't {{going to}} let him. Not until to-night, when you're going to burst upon every one like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! WE'RE GOING TO SHOP!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leslie {{passed her}} up the gangway," [...] said another man, adding, with a suggestive laugh as he {{answered}} another question: [...] "Why did he do it? Well, perhaps he's had his fortune told, or you can ask him. Anyway, although <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to, he dared not turn her back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} of {{anything}} but YOU. But I have, since last evening, a new hope. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to give me an opening. I do believe that--poor little exquisite wretch!--he wants to speak. Last evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours {{as if it were}} just coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, whom I shall always hate for it, {{has been}} telling that at some battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen {{crouching}} behind a tree. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to injure you in my regard, which he knows the story would do if I believed it. I could bear to hear of my soldier lover's death, but not of his cowardice." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 Varney {{generated}} controversy for his {{commentary on}} Pope Francis, who had criticized the wealth gap and denounced unfettered capitalism {{as a system}} which [...] "rules rather than serves." [...] Varney stated, [...] "I go to church to save my soul. It’s {{got nothing to do}} with my vote. Pope Francis has linked the two. He has offered direct criticism of a specific political system. He has characterized, negatively, that system. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to influence my politics." ...|$|R
60|$|January 12.--Mathews {{last night}} {{gave us a}} very perfect {{imitation}} of old Cumberland, who carried the poetic jealousy and irritability further than any man I ever saw. He was a great flatterer too, the old rogue. Will Erskine used to admire him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> originality. A very high-bred man in point of manners in society.|$|E
6000|$|I heard Cavor's {{voice in}} alarm and entreaty. Even then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{compromise}} with these creatures. [...] "I say, Bedford," [...] he cried, [...] "I know a way!" [...] But {{the sting of}} that second stab seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had held us unresisting {{in the hands of}} these moon creatures. For that second, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad. The chain was twisted round my fist.|$|E
60|$|The {{next night}} he came again. I should {{say he was}} a bird {{with a sense of}} humour. Thinking this might happen, I had, however, taken the {{precaution}} to have a few stones ready. I opened the window wide, and fired them one after another into the tree. After I had closed the window, he hopped down nearer, and cawed louder than ever. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me to throw more stones at him: he appeared to regard the whole proceeding as a game. On the third night, as I heard nothing of him, I flattered myself that, in spite of his bravado, I had discouraged him. I might have known rooks better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because he is a brute," [...] she {{answered}} quietly. [...] "We have been separated {{for more than}} a year. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to marry again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Personally," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "I {{believe that it}} is just the call of England to a man who lived very near the soil--her heart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> the smell of spring flowers, the stillness of an English autumn, the winds of February in the woods he was brought up in. It is a form of heart-sickness, you know. I have felt it myself so often. It is {{scarcely}} possible that after all these years he is still nursing that bitter hatred of us both." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to {{quarrel with}} any one;--but above all {{he must not}} quarrel with me. Lord Fawn has quarrelled with him, and that's a misfortune,--just for the present." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{truth of}} that was very soon in evidence. Cubby would not let well enough alone, {{and he would not}} have a slack rope. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to choke himself or pull my arms out. When I {{realized}} that Cubby was three times as strong as I was I began to see that my work was cut out for me. The more, however, that he jerked me and hauled me along, the more I determined to hang on. I thought I had a genuine love for him up to the time he had almost knocked my head off, but it was funny how easily he roused my anger after that. What would have happened had he taken a notion to go through the brush? Luckily he kept to the trail, which certainly was rough enough. So, with watching the cub and keeping my feet free of roots and rocks, I had no chance to look ahead. Still I had no concern about this, for the old hunter was at my heels, and I knew he would keep a sharp lookout.|$|E
60|$|You are {{figuring}} me, I hope, as a {{dark and}} sullen lout in shabby, cheap, old-world clothes that are shiny at all the wearing surfaces, and with a discolored red tie and frayed linen. My left hand keeps in my pocket as though there is something it prefers to keep a grip upon there. Mr. Gabbitas was shorter than I, and the first note he struck in the impression he made upon any one was of something bright and birdlike. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be birdlike, he possessed {{the possibility of an}} avian charm, but, as a matter of fact, there was nothing of the glowing vitality of the bird in his being. And a bird is never out of breath and with an open mouth. He was in the clerical dress of that time, that costume that seems now almost the strangest of all our old-world clothing, and he presented it in its cheapest form--black of a poor texture, ill-fitting, strangely cut. Its long skirts accentuated the tubbiness of his body, the shortness of his legs. The white tie below his all-round collar, beneath his innocent large-spectacled face, was a little grubby, and between his not very clean teeth he held a briar pipe. His complexion was whitish, and although he was only thirty-three or four perhaps, his sandy hair was already thinning from the top of his head.|$|E
60|$|We {{made up a}} {{party and}} walked over. It's at {{the western end of}} the town, and about a mile from the hotel. Mr. and Mrs. Chipperton were with us, and a lady from Chicago, and Mr. Burgan. The other yellow-legs went out riding with his wife, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to go with us. The fort is {{on the top of a}} hill, and a colored {{shoemaker}} is in command. He sits and cobbles all day, except when visitors come, and then he shows them around. He lighted a lamp and took us down into the dark, quiet rooms and cells, that were cut out of the solid rock, down deep into the hill, and it was almost like being in a coal-mine, only it was a great deal cleaner and not so deep. But it seemed just as much out of the world. In some of the rooms there were bats hanging to the ceilings. We didn't disturb them. One of the rooms was called the governor's room. There wasn't any governor there, of course, but it had been made by the jolly old earl who had the place cut out,--and who was governor here at the time,--as a place where he might retire when he wanted to be private. It was the most private apartment I ever saw. This earl was the same old Dunmore we used to study about in our histories. He came over here when the Revolution threw him out of business in our country. He had some good ideas about chiselling rock.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll reach Echo Lodge {{before the}} rain gets very heavy, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Anyway, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to go back}} tonight. Well, I've had a splendid visit, but I'm {{glad to see you}} dear folks again. 'East, west, hame's best.' Davy, have you been growing again lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> outside now. <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> what <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> Would you--would {{you mind}} being {{kind enough to}} go and send him away?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{believe in}} God. I'm not a {{religious}} fanatic. I can't {{remember the last time}} I went to church. My faith has carried me a long way. It's Sheilaism. Just my own little voice...It's just try to love yourself and be gentle with yourself. You know, I guess, take care of each other. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> would <b>want</b> us to take care of each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--only that I {{ought to}} do what my father wished. He did not follow our {{religion}} at New York, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me not to know much about it. But because {{my mother used to}} take me to the synagogue, and I remembered sitting on her knee and looking through the railing and hearing the chanting and singing, I longed to go. One day when I was quite small I slipped out and tried to find the synagogue, but I lost myself a long while till a peddler questioned me and took me home. My father, missing me, had been much in fear, and was very angry. I too had been so frightened at losing myself that it was long before I thought of venturing out again. But after Signora left us we went to rooms where our landlady was a Jewess and observed her religion. I asked her to take me with her to the synagogue; and I read in her prayer-books and Bible, and when I had money enough I asked her to buy me books of my own, for these books seemed a closer companionship with my mother: I knew that she must have looked at the very words and said them. In that way I have come to know a little of our religion, and the history of our people, besides piecing together what I read in plays and other books about Jews and Jewesses; because I was sure my mother obeyed her religion. I had left off asking my father about her. It is very dreadful to say it, but I began to disbelieve him. I had found that he did not always tell the truth, and made promises without meaning to keep them; and that raised my suspicion that my mother and brother were still alive though he had told me they were dead. For in going over the past again as I got older and knew more, I felt sure that my mother had been deceived, and had expected to see us back again after a very little while; and my father taking me on his knee and telling me that my mother and brother were both dead seemed to me now but a bit of acting, to set my mind at rest. The cruelty of that falsehood sank into me, and I hated all untruth because of it. I wrote to my mother secretly: I knew the street, Colman Street, where we lived, and that it was not Blackfriars Bridge and the Coburg, and that our name was Cohen then, though my father called us Lapidoth, because, he said, it was a name of his forefathers in Poland. I sent my letter secretly; but no answer came, and I thought there was no hope for me. Our life in America did not last much longer. My father suddenly told me we were to pack up and go to Hamburg, and I was rather glad. I hoped we might get among a different sort of people, and I knew German quite well--some German plays almost all by heart. My father spoke it better than he spoke English. I was thirteen then, and I seemed to myself quite old--I knew so much, and yet so little. I think other children cannot feel as I did. I had often wished that I had been drowned when I was going away from my mother. But I set myself to obey and suffer: what else could I do? One day when we were on our voyage, a new thought came into my mind. I was not very ill that time, and I kept on deck a good deal. My father acted and sang and joked to amuse people on board, and I used often to hear remarks about him. One day, when I was looking at the sea and nobody took notice of me, I overheard a gentleman say, 'Oh, he is one of those clever Jews--a rascal, I shouldn't wonder. There's no race like them for cunning in the men and beauty in the women. I wonder what market he means that daughter for.' When I heard this it darted into my mind that the unhappiness in my life came from my being a Jewess, and that always to the end the world would think slightly of me and that I must bear it, for I should be judged by that name; and it comforted me to believe that my suffering was part of the affliction of my people, my part in the long song of mourning that has been going on through ages and ages. For if many of our race were wicked and made merry in their wickedness--what was that but part of the affliction borne by the just among them, who were despised for the sins of their brethren?--But you have not rejected me." ...|$|E

According to Smith {{in an interview with}} HitQuarters, [...] "Kwasi had no shortage of beats and cool sounding production, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to try and break through into the mainstream, and I had some experience crossing underground over into mainstream having worked with artists like Craig David." ...|$|E
