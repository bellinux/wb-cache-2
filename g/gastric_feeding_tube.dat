This study evaluated the question of whether <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> occlude more frequently when they are used for checking gastric residuals by aspirating acidic gastric juices into the tube than when gastric residuals are not checked. Patients who were fed intragastrically via a small-bore <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> with intact protein formulas were divided into two groups.

50|$|In medicine, Fowler's {{position}} {{is a standard}} patient position. It is an intervention used to promote oxygenation via maximum chest expansion and is implemented during events of respiratory distress. Fowler's position facilitates the relaxing of tension of the abdominal muscles, allowing for improved breathing. In immobile patients and infants, the Fowler's position alleviates compression of the chest that occurs due to gravity. Fowler's position increases comfort during eating and other activities, is used in postpartum women to improve uterine drainage, and in infants when signs of respiratory distress present. The patient is placed in a semi-upright sitting position (45-60 degrees) and may have knees either bent or straight. Fowler's {{position is}} also used when oral or nasal <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> have been implemented as it minimizes the risk of aspiration.

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesThis study {{aimed to}} assess the dose-dependent effect of {{antioxidants}} in protection against cardiovascular changes induced by exposure to cigarette smoke. Design and settingThis was an experimental study, conducted at King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University. Materials and methodsThis study was carried out on 57 male albino rats divided into nine groups. Rats of experimental groups were exposed to cigarette smoke from a total of 100 cigarettes per week for four weeks in a specially designed chamber. The antioxidants used (vitamin C, E, and B-carotene) were administrated at low (9, 7. 2, and 0. 27 mg/day) and high doses (18, 14. 4, and 0. 54 mg/day), respectively, through <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> The lipid profile was estimated, and the carotids and heart were removed, weighed, and then processed, and the carotid intima-media thickness was measured. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. ResultsThe lipid profile was significantly improved in all groups treated with low or high doses of antioxidants after or during the exposure to cigarette smoke. Improvement was marked in the group treated with a high dose of antioxidants. The histological changes, {{as well as the}} intima-medial thickness of the carotid artery induced by exposure to cigarette smoke, have been improved by treatment with antioxidants (at either low or high doses), either after or during exposure to cigarette smoke. Improvement was marked in the group treated with a low dose of antioxidant. Treatment with antioxidants could not improve degenerated cardiac muscle fibers, while they could reduce the thickness of the branches of the coronary vessels. ConclusionThese results indicated that antioxidants ameliorated the cigarette smoke contribution to atherosclerosis, but they could not completely reverse the changes induced by cigarette smoke.

5000|$|A <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> (G-tube or [...] "button") is a tube {{inserted}} {{through a}} small incision in the abdomen into the stomach and is used for long-term enteral nutrition. One type is the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube which is placed endoscopically. The position of the endoscope can be visualized {{on the outside of}} the patient's abdomen because it contains a powerful light source. A needle is inserted through the abdomen, visualized within the stomach by the endoscope, and a suture passed through the needle is grasped by the endoscope and pulled up through the esophagus. The suture is then tied to the end of the PEG tube that will be external, and pulled back down through the esophagus, stomach, and out through the abdominal wall. The insertion takes about 20 minutes. The tube is kept within the stomach either by a balloon on its tip (which can be deflated) or by a retention dome which is wider than the tract of the tube. G-tubes may also be placed surgically, using either an open or laparoscopic technique.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Placement of enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> is an {{important}} clinical issue. Previous studies suggest that paracetamol absorption is very fast after jejunal administration. The aim {{was to determine whether}} paracetamol serum concentration measured by immunoassay can determine the tip position of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> METHODS: Thirty-three critically ill patients requiring enteral nutrition with either <b>gastric</b> or post-pyloric <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> were enrolled prospectively in the surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital. Paracetamol was administered in the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> (15 mg/kg) after a baseline blood sample (T 0). Thereafter, 8 blood samples were taken between 2. 5 and 240 minutes. Paracetamol was analyzed using an automated homogenous immunoassay. RESULTS: The patients did not differ with respect to age or severity of disease. Peak paracetamol concentrations were significantly higher after post-pyloric administration with 42. 6 +/- 13. 5 versus 20. 5 +/- 7. 5 mg/L (p <. 0001). Time-to-peak paracetamol concentration was significantly shorter with post-pyloric tubes (median, 5 versus 60 minutes; p <. 0001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed the highest sensitivity and specificity at 5 minutes with 94. 1 % and 100 %, respectively, for discriminating between gastric and post-pyloric location. CONCLUSIONS: Because of paracetamol's rapid absorption after jejunal administration, the test seems to be a safe and inexpensive alternative to X-ray control for assessment of the enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> location. Its value in clinical practice remains to be established...|$|R

5000|$|Administration {{through the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract is sometimes termed enteral or enteric administration (literally meaning 'through the intestines'). Enteral/enteric administration usually includes oral (through the mouth) and rectal (into the rectum) administration, {{in the sense}} that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as enteral, such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a contrast enema, whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects.Many drugs as tablets, capsules, or drops are taken orally. Administration methods directly into the stomach include those by <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and enteral nutrition. Enteric coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach.The rectal route is an effective route of administration for many medications, especially those used at the end of life. The walls of the rectum absorb many medications quickly and effectively. Medications delivered to the distal one-third of the rectum at least partially avoid the [...] "first pass effect" [...] through the liver, which allows for greater bio-availability of many medications than that of the oral route. Rectal mucosa is highly vascularized tissue that allows for rapid and effective absorption of medications. A suppository is a solid dosage form that fits for rectal administration. In hospice care, a specialized rectal catheter, designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications provides a practical way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the distal rectum, giving health practitioners a way to leverage the established benefits of rectal administration.|$|E

However, common bedside methods of {{differentiating}} tracheal from <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> placement are neither accurate nor practical. Therefore, we conducted an animal study to verify feeding tube placement by syringe aspiration test. Methods: A total of 26 pigs were anesthetized and intubated with tracheal tubes in the trachea and the esophagus. The animals {{were divided into two}} groups. The animals in the mechanical ventilation group were paralysed and received mechanical ventilation. The animals in the spontaneous breathing group maintained spontaneous breathing. The feeding tubes were then inserted through the tracheal tubes, into the trachea and esophagus, so that the anterior openings of the feeding tubes were located in the trachea and esophagus. A feeding syringe was then attached and 30  ml of air was aspirated into the syringe. The ability to aspirate air without resistance was defined as a positive syringe aspiration test. If there was resistance as air was aspirated, it was defined as a negative syringe aspiration test. In the next step, 20 esophageal ventilations were given to create a distended stomach in the experimental animals, and the syringe aspiration test was repeated in the same manner described above. Results: The syringe aspiration test was positive for feeding tubes placed in the trachea and was negative for feeding tubes located in the esophagus in both the mechanical ventilation group and the spontaneous breathing group.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} endoscopic-vacuum assisted closure (E-VAC) therapy {{in the treatment of}} cervical esophageal leakage. METHODS: Between May and November 2012, three male patients who developed post-operative cervical esophageal leakage were treated with E-VAC therapy. One patient had undergone surgical excision of a pharyngo-cervical liposarcoma with partial esophageal resection, and the other two patients had received surgical treatment for symptomatic Zenker&#x 2019;s diverticulum. Following endoscopic verification of the leakage, a trimmed polyurethane sponge was fixed to the distal end of a nasogastric silicone tube and endoscopically positioned into the wound cavity, and with decreasing cavity size the sponge was positioned intraluminally to cover the leak. Continuous suction was applied, and the vacuum drainage system was changed twice a week. RESULTS: The initial E-VAC placement was technically successful for all three patients, and complete closure of the esophageal leak was achieved without any procedure-related complications. In all three patients, the insufficiencies were located either above or slightly below the upper esophageal sphincter. The median duration of the E-VAC drainage was 29 d (range: 19 - 49 d), with a median of seven sponge exchanges (range: 5 - 12 sponge exchanges). In addition, the E-VAC therapy reduced inflammatory markers to within normal range for all three patients. Two of the patients were immediately fitted with a percutaneous enteral <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> with jejunal extension, and the third patient received parenteral feeding.

However, {{many of these}} patients have atonic stomach and do not tolerate early <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding.</b> It is suggested that small bowel feeding will improve the patient"s tolerance of early enteral feeding. &# 13; Methods. In a randomized clinical trial, sixty patients with moderate and severe head injury were divided in two equal groups. In experimental group, a <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> with a length, equal to distance from nose to earlobe and umblicus was inserted and interavenous metuclopramide was injected every 6 hours (10 mg in adults, 5 mg in children between 6 - 14 years old and 0. 1 mg/kg in children less than 6 years old).

40|$|CONTEXT: Monocarboxylate {{transporter}} 8 (MCT 8) is a thyroid hormone-specific {{cell membrane}} transporter. MCT 8 deficiency causes severe psychomotor retardation and abnormal thyroid tests. The {{great majority of}} affected children cannot walk or talk, and all have elevated serum T(3) levels, causing peripheral tissue hypermetabolism and inability to maintain weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone is ineffective. In Mct 8 -deficient mice, the thyroid hormone analog, diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), does not require MCT 8 to enter tissues and could be an effective alternative to thyroid hormone treatment in humans. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect and efficacy of DITPA in children with MCT 8 deficiency. METHODS: This was a multicenter report of four affected children given DITPA on compassionate grounds for 26 - 40 months. Treatment was initiated at ages 8. 5 - 25 months, beginning with a small dose of 1. 8 mg, increasing to a maximal 30 mg/d (2. 1 - 2. 4 mg/kg · d), given in three divided doses. RESULTS: DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg · d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The following significant changes were also observed: decline in SHBG (in all subjects), heart rate (in three of four), and ferritin (in one of four). Cholesterol increased in two subjects. There was no weight loss and weight gain occurred in two. None of the treated children required a <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> or developed seizures. No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSION: DITPA (1 - 2 mg/kg · d) almost completely normalizes thyroid tests and reduces the hypermetabolism and the tendency for weight loss.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPneumonia {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the elderly population. Nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP) is probably the largest health problem in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). It is the second most common infection in LTCFs and frequently requires hospitalization. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence rate of NHAP among LTCF residents, its microbial etiology, and the frequency of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Risk factors for NHAP were analyzed. MethodsThis was a prospective study conducted on a group of 217 elderly subjects aged ≥ 65 years, recruited from the inhabitants of LTCFs, with disabled elderly individuals living in the community serving as controls. Continuous surveillance was carried out from December 1, 2009 to November 30, 2010. ResultsThe incidence rate of NHAP in the observed population of Polish residents was 0. 6 / 1000 resident-days. Vulnerability to NHAP was due to the poor general condition of residents, expressed by low Barthel index values (relative risk (RR) 1. 6), the activities of daily living (ADL) score (RR 1. 7), the Katz scale (RR 1. 2), and limited physical activity (RR 1. 6). Also significant were malnutrition (RR 2. 3), the use of a bladder catheter (RR 1. 3), dysphagia (RR 1. 7), tracheotomy tube (RR 3. 1), and <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> (RR 3. 5). Enterobacteriaceae were the predominant etiological agents of NHAP (56. 3 %). ConclusionsThe significance of risk factors for NHAP among residents in LTCFs was confirmed. Unfortunately, we also found that a lack of proper supervision with regard to the microbiology of infections is characteristic of Polish health care and LTCFs. There is an opportunity to improve the medical care of patients with severe disabilities, limit the rise in antimicrobial resistance and the need for hospitalization, and improve the prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} found a {{positive}} correlation between hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia. Increasing evidence implicates oxidative stress as one of the initiating events closely linked to the homocysteine’s ability to damage endothelium, subsequently causing vascular dysfunction. We previously found that heparin protects cultured endothelial cells from free radical injury and oral heparin at 1 mg/kg/ 48 h prevents venous thrombosis in a rat model in vivo. Our objective was to study the protective effects of oral heparin in a rat model with elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations, and begin to elucidate whether the pathophysiological effects of Hcy are mediated through an oxidative mechanism causing endothelial dysfunction. Elevated plasma Hcy levels were induced by feeding male Wistar Kyoto rats a diet containing an additional 1. 7 % methionine for 8 weeks. Groups included rats fed additional methionine, methionine plus oral heparin (1 mg/kg/ 48 h by <b>gastric</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube),</b> and age-matched controls fed normal rat chow. At the end of 8 weeks of treatment, rats were anesthetized using 1. 5 % isoflurane in 100 % oxygen. Hemodynamics parameters were assessed by inserting a Millar Mikro Tip pressure transducer into the left ventricular chamber and the thoracic aorta. Fasting plasma total Hcy levels were measured using a Hcy immunoassay kit with an Abbott IMx instrument. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations, a lipid peroxidation product and marker for oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometric method in serum and tissue samples. Glutathione (GSH) concentrations, an important antioxidant for low-level oxidative stress was measured by HPLC in plasma and tissues samples. Lastly, tissue samples from each experimental group were stained with the TUNEL method to assess their respective percentage of apoptotic endothelial cells. Results were expressed as mean ± S. E. Unpaired Student’s two-tailed t-test was employed to assess the difference between groups with p < 0. 05 considered significant. Plasma Hcy was significantly elevated after 8 weeks in the methionine (7. 17 ± 0. 46 umol/L) and methionine plus heparin treated rats (7. 02 ± 0. 40 umol/L) compared to control (5. 46 ± 0. 36 umol/L). All measures of arterial pressure, systolic (SP) and diastolic pressure (DP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), were significantly elevated in rats fed the methionine diet without heparin (119. 9 ± 3. 9 mmHg; 90. 3 ± 3. 5 mmHg; 97. 7 ± 2. 9 mmHg, respectively) compared to controls (107. 8 ± 2. 5 mmHg; 79. 2 ± 2. 1 mmHg; 88. 8 ± 2. 2 mmHg, respectively) but not compared to heparin (114. 7 ± 3. 3 mmHg; 83. 4 ± 2. 4 mmHg; 93. 8 ± 2. 7 mmHg, respectively). Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly elevated with the methionine diet without heparin (14. 2 ± 2. 5 mmHg) but not with heparin treatment (8. 4 ± 1. 9 mmHg) versus controls (7. 1 ± 1. 1 mmHg). Also, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) was significantly elevated in the methionine fed rats after 8 weeks (122. 6 ± 3. 2 mmHg) compared to controls (112. 3. ± 2. 9 mmHg). Heparin treatment had no effect on LVSP (119. 9 ± 3. 2 mmHg). Additionally, {{the results of this study}} showed that oral heparin treatment significantly decreased liver MDA concentrations (2. 42 ± 0. 28 nmol/mg protein) compared to the methionine treated group (5. 10 ± 0. 96 nmol/mg protein) and methionine treatment alone significantly reduced MDA concentrations in kidney tissue (1. 59 ± 0. 12 nmol/mg protein) compared with controls (3. 26 ± 0. 66 nmol/mg protein). Methionine diet significantly decreased GSH concentrations in plasma (0. 59 ± 0. 59 µmol/L) compared with controls (4. 24 ± 0. 94 µmol/L) and oral heparin treatment significantly attenuated the decrease in GSH concentrations in left ventricle tissue samples (0. 0229 ± 0. 0023 µmol/mg protein) compared with methionine treatment alone (0. 0135 ± 0. 0016 µmol/mg protein). Elevated plasma homocysteine levels, induced by methionine diet feeding significantly increased the percent of apoptotic endothelial cells in the aortas (17. 04 ± 3. 74 %) and superior mesenteric arteries (17. 99 ± 1. 90 %) of WKY rats compared with control aortas and mesenteric arteries (6. 08 ± 3. 24 %; 7. 43 ± 1. 62 %, respectively) and compared to oral heparin treated mesenteric arteries (7. 31 ± 1. 18 %). The results of this study showed that elevated plasma levels of Hcy correlate with the development of hypertension, defined as significantly increased arterial pressure. Oral heparin treatment prevented the significant increase in arterial pressures and LVEDP, decreased MDA concentrations and therefore the oxidative stress on the liver, attenuated the decrease caused by elevated plasma Hcy in left ventricle GSH concentrations, and significantly reduced the number of apoptotic endothelial cells in the superior mesenteric artery of high methionine fed rats. We conclude that elevated levels of plasma Hcy contributes to the development of hypertension and furthermore towards the onset of heart failure likely through an oxidative mechanism and that oral heparin reduces the overall oxidative stress in specific physiological environments, preventing Hcy mediated endothelial cell apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Maternal {{uniparental disomy}} of {{chromosome}} 20 (UPD(20) mat) {{has been reported}} in only four patients, three of whom also had mosaicism for complete or partial trisomy of chromosome 20. We sought to evaluate the clinical significance of isolated UPD(20) mat in eight individuals. Methods: We evaluated phenotypic and genomic findings of a series of eight new patients with UPD(20) mat. Results: All eight individuals with UPD(20) mat had intrauterine growth restriction, short stature, and prominent feeding difficulties with failure to thrive. As a common feature, they often required <b>gastric</b> <b>tube</b> <b>feeds.</b> Genomic data in most patients are indicative of UPD as a result of trisomy rescue after meiosis II nondisjunction. Conclusion: We describe the first natural history of the disorder and the results of therapeutic interventions, including the frequent requirement of direct gastric feedings only during {{the first few years of}} life, and propose that growth hormone supplementation is probably safe and effective for this condition. We suggest that UPD(20) mat can be regarded as a new imprinting disorder and its identification requires specialized molecular testing, which should be performed in patients with early-onset idiopathic isolated growth failure. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Small-bore {{flexible}} <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> {{decrease the}} risk of ulceration of the nose, pharynx, and stomach compared with large-bore and more rigid <b>tubes.</b> However, small-bore <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> have more respiratory system complications, such as pneumothorax, hydropneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula, and pneumonia, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, {{it is important to}} confirm the correct position of <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes.</b> Chest X-ray is the gold standard to detect tracheal malpositioning of the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> We present three cases in which intubated patients exhibited an altered mental state.
