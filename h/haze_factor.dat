The influence of the deposition parameters (argon and oxygen flow rates, and substrate temperature) and effect of coating thickness on the optical, electrical, structural and microstructural properties of ITO thin films deposited on FEP was investigated. The thickness of the ITO coatings was varied from 10 to 180 nm. The optimized ITO coating (10 nm thick) exhibited high IR emittance (79 %) on FEP substrate with high average solar transmittance (94 %) and moderate sheet resistance (3 kΩ/sq.). We also investigated in detail the angular dependence of reflectance as well as <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> of thin ITO coatings. Our results suggest that 10 nm thick ITO coating exhibits an average <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> of 8. 6 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of the surface roughness of front TCO layers on the amorphous silicon solar cell performance. The same amorphous p-i-n silicon solar cell was deposited on four front ZnO substrates with different surface roughnesses. Starting from a flat sputtered ZnO layer and ending at an etched rough ZnO deposited by the Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition process, the <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> of these layers was progressively increased. The analysis of the spectral response of the solar cells shows that the <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> alone of the front TCO layer is not sufficient to characterize fully its influence to the light trapping of an amorphous silicon solar cell. The structure of the TCO surface has to be taken into account, as the latter will directly influence the topology of the amorphous solar cell deposited on this layer and additionally affect the light trapping potential in the cell...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for energy {{that human beings are}} faced with, the photovoltaics (PV) technology which converts solar radiation into electricity has undergone increasingly development. Although the current PV market is mainly dominated by the crystalline Si based technologies, thin film PV still bears the hope to become the solution to the energy crisis in the future due to its much lower cost and reasonable efficiency. Transparent conductive materials (TCMs), mostly transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), are an essential component in most types of thin film solar cells as the current-collecting electrode on the sun-facing side of the cell. In order to improve the optical absorption (which is restricted by the limited absorber thickness) in thin film solar cells, the TCOs are often desired to be textured (with significant surface roughness) to show high values of <b>haze</b> <b>factor.</b> <b>Haze</b> <b>factor</b> is defined as the ratio of the diffuse transmittance/reflectance to the total transmittance/reflectance. The hazier a TCO is (i. e. with higher <b>haze</b> <b>factor),</b> the more light it scatters. As a consequence, the optical path length is increased and thus the light trapping in the solar cell is improved, giving rise to higher light absorption in the active layers and photon-to-current conversion efficiency of the solar cells. In this work, innovative nanocomposites of fluorine doped SnO 2 (FTO) in combination with ZnO, S:TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles have been developed using an economic and facile 2 -step process.

Doped indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films are the predominant transparent conductor material. However, ITO thin films are brittle, making them unsuitable for the emerging flexible devices, and suffer from high material and processing cost. In my thesis, we developed a variety of transparent conductors toward a performance comparable with or superior to ITO thin films, with lower cost and potential for scalable manufacturing. Metal nanomesh (NM), hierarchical graphene/metal microgrid (MG), and hierarchical metal NM/MG materials were investigated. Simulation methods were used as a powerful tool to predict the transparency and sheet resistance of the transparent conductors by solving Maxwell’s equations and Poisson’s equation. Affordable and scalable fabrication processes were developed thereafter. Transparent conductors with over 90 % transparency and less than 10 Ω/square sheet resistance were successfully fabricated on both rigid and flexible substrates. Durability tests, such as bending, heating and tape tests, were carried out to evaluate the robustness of the samples. <b>Haze</b> <b>factor,</b> which characterizes how blurry a transparent conductor appears, was also studied in-depth using analytical calculation and numerical simulation. We demonstrated a tunable <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> for metal NM transparent conductors and analyzed the principle for tuning the <b>haze</b> <b>factor.</b> Plasmonic effects, excited by some transparent conductors, can lead to enhanced performance in photovoltaic devices.

On {{the basis of these}} numbers, simple static energy balance considera-tions suggest that the light-absorbing haze over the northern reflecting ice cap creates an earth-atmosphere warming of 0. 1 to l.

Mass concentration and size distribution of aerosol particles as well as aerosol optical properties were concurrently measured at the Beijing urban atmospheric environment monitoring station. Gaseous pollutants (SO 2 , NO-NO 2 -NOx, O 3 , CO) and meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind direction, and relative humidity (RH)) were simultaneously monitored. Meanwhile, aerosol spatial distribution and the height of planetary boundary layer (PBL) were retrieved from the signal of satellite and LIDAR (light detection and ranging). Results showed that high intensity of local pollutants from Beijing urban source is the fundamental cause that led to the regional <b>haze.</b> Meteorological <b>factors</b> such as higher RH, weak surface wind speed, and decreasing height of PBL played an important role on the deterioration of air quality.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{thin-film}} photovoltaic industry, {{to achieve}} a high light scattering {{in one or more}} of the cell interfaces is one of the strategies that allow an enhancement of light absorption inside the cell and, therefore, a better device behavior and efficiency.

40|$|White wine clarity is essential, {{but it can}} be {{marred by}} the {{presence}} of a protein haze. This protein haze is predominantly formed by grape-derived thaumatin-like proteins and chitinases, which can slowly denature and aggregate if left in bottled wines. Currently bentonite fining is used by the wine industry to prevent protein haze. Bentonite consists of fine clay particles that, when added to wine, bind and remove the haze-forming proteins. However this method is inconvenient, time-consuming, and causes significant losses of wine. It is estimated that this process costs the Australian wine industry $ 50 m annually in wine losses alone. Alternatives are thus being investigated. The principal objective of this thesis was to investigate the sensory effects on wine of an alternative method to bentonite fining: addition of <b>haze</b> protective <b>factor</b> 2, known as Hpf 2. Hpf 2 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannoprotein that has been shown to reduce protein haze in wines. It is a highly mannosylated 180 kDa protein, of which approximately 75 % by weight is mannose. Previous work has shown that the addition of approximately 200 mg L⁻¹ Hpf 2 to wines reduces the visible haze in wine by approximately 50 %. Hpf 2 is naturally present in wines at concentrations of less than 10 ng L⁻¹, much lower than the concentration required for haze protection activity. However, the sensory impacts involved with the addition of such high concentrations of Hpf 2 in wine have never been studied. This knowledge is essential for the future commercial prospects of this alternative approach to protein stabilisation of wine. To undertake sensory studies, over 1 g of Hpf 2 would be required. Presently, the laboratory-scale process for the production of a 6 -histidine tagged version of the protein, 6 xHisHpf 2, in a laboratory yeast strain of S. cerevisiae, produces only milligram quantities. Consequently, the first challenge of this research was to scale up the existing process to produce sufficient quantities of Hpf 2. The first attempt to increase the production level was by over-expression in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Although several approaches were trialled, 6 xHisHpf 2 was unable to be successfully and consistently expressed in this system. The second method was by improving the original yeast expression system, and the expression level was able to be improved approximately 10 -fold. This improved expression method was scaled up to produce and then purify over 1 g of protein. Several quantification methods were assessed to determine the efficiencies of each purification step, with slot blot analysis proving successful. Sensory trials were conducted to establish the effect of 6 xHisHpf 2 on wines, with duo-trio studies conducted assessing both aroma and palate of the wines. Invertase, another yeast <b>haze</b> protective <b>factor,</b> was also trialled. It was found that the addition of an active level of 6 xHisHpf 2 or invertase did not cause {{a significant difference in the}} aroma or palate of wines. In addition to this main study, the role of the glycosylation was studied. 6 xHisHpf 2, produced in a different yeast, Pichia pastoris, was found to be 83 kDa, with only 50 % mannose. This protein was compared to the S. cerevisiae protein in its ability to reduce protein haze, and it was shown that the P. pastoris protein could reduce haze, but not as effectively as the S. cerevisiae protein. The finding that Hpf 2 does not affect the sensory properties of wine is essential if Hpf 2 is to be used commercially, as winemakers and wine consumers would most likely reject an additive that alters the wine aroma or palate. This work has brought the wine industry a step closer to a new method for protein haze prevention in white wines. Thesis (Ph. D.)

This thesis describes the test equipment, procedure and results of each phase, and sets forth some general conclusions {{in the form of a}} table of image defects with their possible causes. From the many factors which may affect the image in an aerial negative, several of the more common were chosen for study. These included haze, windows, focus, translatory image motion, vibration, obstruction in the image-forming rays, and variations of exposure and development. The tests conducted were generally of a qualitative nature. The test system consisted of an electronic flash unit with opal diffuser, a positive transparency target, a collimator, a 24 -inch f/ 6 lens, and a focusing-back magazine with vacuum. After determining optimum focus and establishing processing techniques, a negative from the system was obtained to be used as a standard throughout the series of tests. The factors mentioned previously were then introduced into the system one at a time and the resulting negatives compared with the standard. The similarity of many of the effects emphasized the importance of careful analyses of aerial negatives. The advantage of a short exposure time was probably the most outstanding observation made. Although this is not a newly observed fact, the 50 microsecond exposure of the electronic flash unit did emphasize that vibration and other forms of image motion would assume roles of lesser importance if equipment and photosensitive material would permit exposures of shorter duration.

The influence of diffuse glass with a <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> of 45, 62 and 71 % and light transmission equal to or greater than that of standard glass, as well as standard glass with a commercial coating with a <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> of 50 % and 6 % less light transmission than that of standard glass was compared to that of standard glass. The crops were planted mid-December 2010 and grown to the middle of November 2011. The influence of diffuse light on light interception, crop morphology, photosynthesis and growth was measured and analysed. Light penetrated deeper into the crop resulting in a higher photosynthetic capacity in the lower canopy, but only in winter. Tomato grown under diffuse glass was more generative, transferring more into fruit production than vegetative growth, in comparison to standard glass or coated glass. The production under the three diffuse glass coverings showed a 7 - 9 % increase in June relative to that under standard glass, and retained this increased production to the end of the year, ending with 8 - 11 % more production. The most important reason for the increased production was an increase in individual fruit weight by 5 - 8 g. Plants grown under diffuse glass or coating were less susceptible to Botrytis spp. during the last months of the crop, possibly due to a higher dry matter content. The coating was applied in the beginning of May and the treatment continued through August when the global radiation diminished and more light was necessary in the crop and the coating was removed. The overall production under the coating was 5 % higher than that under standard glass.

40|$|Abstract—Poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) {{has been}} the {{dominating}} material in the photovoltaic (PV) encapsulant market for decades, owing to its superior cost-performance balance. To achieve its desired material properties, EVA undergoes a curing reaction during the module encapsulation process. The resulting EVA gel content after encapsulation is an important criterion for the module encapsulation quality control. Normally, the determi-nation of gel content is achieved using a tedious solvent extraction method. In this paper, a fast and nondestructive detection method on the EVA gel content based on the optical reflection is explored. First, the homogeneity of the EVA gel content distribution after the standard EVA encapsulation process is studied. Then, the feasibil-ity of the proposed optical approach applied to transparent mod-ules is investigated.

40|$|Light {{confinement}} strategies play {{a crucial}} role in the performance of thin-film (TF) silicon solar cells. One way to reduce the optical losses is the texturing of the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) that acts as the front contact. Other losses arise from the mismatch between the incident light spectrum and the spectral properties of the absorbent material that imply that low energy photons (below the bandgap value) are not absorbed, and therefore can not generate photocurrent. Up-conversion techniques, in which two sub-bandgap photons are combined to give one photon with a better matching with the bandgap, were proposed to overcome this problem. In particular, this work studies two strategies to improve light management in thin film silicon solar cells using laser technology. The first one addresses the problem of TCO surface texturing using fully commercial fast and ultrafast solid state laser sources.

In this sense, average total reflectance values of 71 % in the wavelength range of 400 – 800 nm were obtained for the layer stack of 80 nm-thick ZnO:Al layer on 235 nm-thick Aluminum deposited directly on the flexible substrate. However, this structure showed a poor adherence onto the substrate. This issue was improved using a thin Molybdenum layer between the metal and the substrate, maintaining similar optical properties. On the other hand, textured back reflectors were obtained etching the transparent conductive oxide with NH 4 Cl aqueous solution. After the etching process, the highest enhancement was achieved for the sample that used an Mo/Al bilayer as reflective metal. In this case, a roughness of around 29 nm and a <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> of 25 % at 600 nm were achieved.

40|$|High {{energy use}} in rose {{cultivation}} at higher latitudes {{is caused by}} the need for artificial light to supplement scarce sun radiation. On the other hand, since too high radiation levels are known to reduce flower quality, shading is widely applied during spring and summer, either through movable screens or seasonal whitewash. In both cases damage to the crop is avoided at the cost of reducing potential assimilation by reduction of (PAR) light. Recent research on cucumber has shown that diffusing cover materials have the potential of improving the uniformity of vertical light distribution in a crop, therefore decreasing the energy load on the uppermost crop layer to the advantage of underlying crop layers. Light diffusion, however, usually implies a loss of overall transmission. This drawback can be avoided by antireflection coatings, so that most recently diffusive glass covers have become available with the same transmissivity of standard glass. The application of such a cover on roses could decrease the need for shading so that a desired radiation sum could be achieved with less need for artificial light. Such an experiment is in progress on a crop of roses (cv. Red Naomi) at the research station of Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture in Bleiswijk, NL, in two compartments. One is covered with diffuse glass with anti-reflection coating with a light transmission of 93 % perpendicular and 83 % hemispherical and <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> of 72 %. The reference compartment is covered with standard glass. This paper describes the effect of a diffusing cover on the greenhouse climate (air- and plant-temperature, humidity and ventilation requirement) and water balance compared to a greenhouse covered with standard glass. It’s shown that the effect on greenhouse climate is limited but flower temperature is reduced in the diffuse compartment which has effect on flower quality. It seems therefore that the material has potential for reducing leaf burning and if the use of shade screens or whitewash can be reduced there is a potential increase of yield with the same energy inpu...|$|E
30|$|Since both {{core shell}} nanospheres (NS) and NRs can enhance {{absorption}} {{in the active}} layer of OPV devices, a systematic comparison of the geometric effect of incorporated NPs was made by Xu et al. [56]. In this study, Au NSs with a core diameter of ~ 25  nm and a silica shell thickness of ~ 5  nm were synthesized. Au NRs with a core diameter and length of ~ 31 and ~ 80  nm and a shell thickness of ~ 5  nm were also prepared [56]. The LSPR peak of the NS and the transverse LSPR peak of the NR are almost the same while the longitudinal peak of the NR is at 680  nm [56]. These NPs were both incorporated at 1  wt% into the active layer of two ITO/PEDOT:PSS/p-DTS(FBTTh 2) 2 :PC 71 BM/Ca/Ag devices. For the NS, the PCE of the SM BHJ device increased to 6.86 % compared with 6.5 % for the reference. When NRs were similarly introduced, the PCE increased to 8.18 % because of a very {{significant increase in the}} J sc. To understand the large difference in enhancement of device performance, a dimensionless quality factor Q LSPR defined as the ratio of the enhanced localized field around the NP and the incident field was derived and calculated for the NS and NR [56]. For the NS, the Q LSPR is a weak function of wavelength and is smaller than 25 throughout the spectral range 400 – 1000  nm. By contrast, the Q LSPR for NRs increases significantly with wavelength and can exceed 150 for wavelengths from 700 to 1000  nm. This shows that the NR is much more effective in generating enhanced localized fields, especially at wavelengths near the longitudinal LSPR peak. The NRs also scatter light more strongly and increase the optical path length within the active layer. This was demonstrated by measuring the <b>haze</b> <b>factor</b> for diffusely reflected light (H R) and transmitted light (H T) for p-DTS(FBTTh 2) 2 :PC 71 BM thin film samples with the two types of NPs. For NS, the film haze factors are almost the same as the reference without NPs from 400 to 800  nm. For NR, both H R and H T are significantly higher showing that more light is being scattered by NRs [56].|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} in industrial production and human activities, the concentration of atmospheric particulate matter is increasing substantially, leading to more frequent occurrence of fog and haze. Limited visibility caused by suspended particles in the air, such as fog and haze, {{is a major problem}} for many computer vision applications. The scenes captured by such computer vision systems suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, dimmed brightness, low luminance, and distorted color, which makes detection of objects within a scene more difficult. Therefore, visibility improvement, contrast, and feature enhancement of images and videos captured in inclement weather, which is referred to as dehazing, is inevitable. Haze removal is a difficult problem due to the inherent ambiguity between haze and the underlying scene. Model-based single-image dehazing methods are physically sound and produce qualitatively good results; however, more attention to dehazing quality rather than applicability leads to real-time applications that may not always be sufficiently fast. And in addition, the certain limitations exist, such as color bias and an inability of dealing with the sky area. The objectives of this study are to estimate the degree of haze from a single image automatically, and label the image with a <b>haze</b> <b>factor,</b> to propose a self-adjustment dehazing method using the degree of haze and evaluate the performance of the proposed dehazing method. In this research, based on atmospheric scattering model analysis and statistics of various outdoor images, the following conclusions can be drawn. Clear-day images have higher contrast than images plagued by bad weather. In addition, in most local regions, including the sky, hazed images have larger minimum values for most color channel pixels. Relying on these two observations, an estimate function that is related to a haze removal constant parameter has been developed to label a foggy image with different degrees of haze. By modifying the dark channel in advance, the proposed method reduces computational cost while providing promising dehazed results for real-time applications. The transmission estimation is performed by obtaining the minimum value only from a relevant pixel, or the mean filter of the minimum values of its neighboring pixels. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm compared to others is its processing speed. Its complexity is a linear function of the number of image pixels. Another advantage is similar image processing quality using the Dark Channel Prior method. Furthermore, labeling images with different haze-degree can make batch processing of an image set with hazy and haze-free images possible. Finally, the degree of haze removal can be adjusted adaptively with a built-in function that makes the dehazed images look more natural. The experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed approach achieves good performance for enhanced visibility, processing speed, and stability, which makes the proposed method applicable for real-time requirements. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E

[...] Boston UniversityThe {{employment}} of miniature camera systems in high altitude photography {{has not been}} considered practical until very recently. In the past, the quality of lenses and films has been such that long focal length lenses and consequently large formats were necessary te record the desired ground detail. With recent advances in high speed optics and emulsion making, the potentialities of miniature camera systems have greatly increased. It is now possible to construct systems of this type having resolutian capabilities {{four or five times}} as great as conventional large format systems. The purpose of this work was to simulate certain aspects of high altitude photography, in order to study: 1) the potential of a 35 mm laboratory camera, 2) the photographic quality and amount of information that could be obtained on three different aero emulsions, 3) the effect of atmospheric haze on 2, and 4) to determine whether more information could be extracted by viewing a projected image of a negative or a print of that negative. An appraisal of the factors influencing the picture quality of aerial photographs was made. Such problems as aircraft motions, camera design and installation, atmospheric effects, and the brightness and contrast of scene detail was investigated. It was concluded that with proper installation and design of the camera system that three main factors influence the quality of high altitude photography of a given target scene. These factors are the quality of the camera lens, the ability of the film to record fine detail, and the amount of atmospheric haze. For this study a high acuity 35 mm laboratory camera was constructed. The lens used with this camera system was a 50 mm f/ 2. 8 Schneider "Xenotar". To provide an extremely fine and wide range of focus this lens was adapted to an interferometer table on which a Leica Focaslide assembly bad been mounted. Leiea If and Leica IIIc camera bodies were used with the system to provide a wide range of shutter speeds. The lens aperture was held constant at f/ 5. 6 throughout the experiment, an aperture at which the lens was essentially diffraction limited. Three Kodak films were used in this study; Micro-File, and two aerial emulsions, SO- 1213 and Plus-X Aerecon. MicroFile, a non-aerial film, was included in order to show what could be done with a high resolution film, although in practice its speed is so low as to require extremely fast optical systems. SO- 1213, a new experimental film, is one of the finest grained emulsions yet developed for aerial use. Plus-X Aerecon, just recently put into production, has a speed comparable ta Super-XX, but with much better image quality. Atmospheric haze was simulated by placing a diffusing disc inside the lens just behind the iris diaphragm. A circular hole, whose size corresponded with the diaphragm aperture at f/ 5. 6, was bored out of the center of this disc. By opening the diaphragm aperture beyond f/ 5. 6, the diffusing disc added a uniform "layer" of scattered light to the image, thus effectively simulating atmospheric haze. Three aperture settings were used in this work, f/ 5. 6, f/ 4, and f/ 2. 8. The following haze factors were obtained. at these apertures: 0, 0. 14, and 0. 36. <b>Haze</b> <b>factor</b> is defined here as the ratio of the haze brightness to the scene high-light brightness. The target scene consisted of four high quality positive transparencies of Boston, Mass. at a scale of 1 / 20, 000. A standard Air Force resolution target was inserted in a corner of one transparency. The target was illuminated by a light panel which had been specially constructed to provide a very even source of diffuse daylight illumination. The brightness range of the illuminated aerial scene was approximately 40 : 1. Photos were taken at distances such that the resultant scales on the 35 mm negatives were 1 / 100, 000, 1 / 200, 000, 1 / 400, 000, and 1 / 800, 000. The simulated altitudes were 5, 10, 20, and 40 miles, respectively. Thirty-six negatives were obtained using the above system, one for each film, at each scale, and at each haze setting. Care was taken to insure optimum focus. Using a high quality enlarging system, prints of each negative were made. All prints were enlarged to the same scale. The print enlargements for negatives at the fourscales, 1 / 100, 000, 1 / 200, 000, 1 / 400, 000, and 1 / 800, 000, was 3 X, 6 X, 12 X, and 24 X, respectively. Three methods were used in evaluating the results; 1) a microscopic examination of the negatives for resolution, 2) a microscopic examination of the prints for recognition and detection of certain scene detail, and 3) a qualitative examination of a greatly enlarged projected image of the negatives. The average resolution in lines per mm for the three films tested using haze factors of 0, 0. 14, and 0. 36, respectively, was found to be: For Micro-File: 174, 158, and 148; For SO- 1213 : 107, 93, and 80; and for Plus-X Aerecon: 57, 51, and 45. Microscopic investigation of the prints of the three films at the various scales for detection and recognition of scene detail revealed the following: At a scale of 1 / 100, 000 with Micro-File and SO- 1213 objects the size of automobiles could be detected. Aircraft and railroad cars could be easily recognized. The only difference between the two was that detail in the SO- 1213 prints was less sharp. At this scale with Plus-X Aerecon automobiles were just barely visible, recognition of aircraft was difficult, and the individual cars of trains could not be seen. At 1 / 200, 000 automobiles were barely detectable on the MicroFile prints. Trains and aircraft were still visible, but classification of aircraft type was questionable. Cars were no longer detectable on the SO- 1213 prints and aircraft was barely detectable. With Plus-X Aereeon neither cars nor trains were discernible. Aircraft was just barely detectable. Even small streets could not be seen. At 1 / 400, 000 with Micro-File large aircraft could just be detected and only relatively large buildings could be recognized. Street patterns were still plainly visible. On the SO- 1213 prints aircraft and the patterns of small streets were lest. Ships and large buildings could still be seen. At this scale (enlargement of 12 diameters) the prints of Plus-X Aerecon appeared very grainy. Only relatively large structures such as large streets and buildings could be recognized. At 1 / 800, 000 large buildings, bridges, ships, street patterns, wharfs and docks were still distinguishable on the Micro-File prints. With SO- 1213 only large buildings and the rough outline of harbor facilities could be recognized. Street patterns were only recognizable in high contrast regions of the scene. The Plus-X Aerecon prints at this scale revealed only very large roadways and buildings. Outlines of harbor facilities were very rough. Under the conditions of this study, relatively small loss of picture quality was caused by introduction of haze. On the Micro-File prints virtually no loss in quality was noticed even with a. 36 <b>haze</b> <b>factor.</b> On the SO- 1213 prints a slight loss could be detected at. 36 haze at the smaller scales in the low contrast regions of the scene. The prints most affected by haze were those of Plus-X Aerecon, the film having the lowest contrast of the three tested, and this was only noticeable at 36 % haze. It must be concluded that the majority of detail sizes in the negatives were such that the compression of brightness range by haze did not reduce the detail contrasts below the visual threshold. The high photographic contrasts of these emulsions is therefore valuable. Investigation of projected images of the negatives with a projector of moderate quality revealed that the same amount of information could be obtained as on the prints. However, this method presented the problem of having to view the image from an angle plus the problem of having to interpret a negative image. Results obtained using this method were purely qualitative and its importance is only one of interest. The final results indicate that high acuity miniature camera systems, in conjunction with high resolution emulsiens, offer information gathering capacity comparable to larger, heavier cameras using standard relatively coarse-grained emulsions...|$|E
