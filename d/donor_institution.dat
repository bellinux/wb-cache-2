40|$|Seventy-five {{thousand}} Americans develop organ failure each year. Fifteen {{percent of}} those on the list for transplantation die while waiting. Several possible mechanisms to expand the organ pool are being pursued including the use of extended criteria donors, living donation, and split deceased donor transplants. Cadaveric organ splitting results from improved understanding of the surgical anatomy of the liver derived from Couinaud. Early efforts focused on reduced-liver transplantation (RLT) reported by both Bismuth and Broelsch in the mid- 1980 s. These techniques were soon modified to create both a left lateral segment graft appropriate for a pediatric recipient and a right trisegment for an appropriately sized adult. Techniques of split liver transplantation (SLT) were also modified to create living donor liver transplantation. Pichlmayr and Bismuth reported successful split liver transplantation in 1989 and Emond reported a larger series of nine split procedures in 1990. Broelsch and Busuttil described a technical modification in which the split was performed in situ at the <b>donor</b> <b>institution</b> with surgical division completed in the heart beating cadaveric donor. In situ splitting reduces cold ischemia, simplifies identification of biliary and vascular structures, and reduces reperfusion hemorrhage. However, in situ splits require specialized skills, prolonged operating room time, and increased logistical coordination at the <b>donor</b> <b>institution.</b> At UCLA over 120 in situ splits have been performed and this technique is the default when an optimal donor is available. Split liver transplantation now accounts for 10 % of adult transplantations at UCLA and 40 % of pediatric transplantations...|$|E

Moreover, this research explores how this development discourse constructs social problems, beneficiaries, and appropriate solutions. Japan’s development communication approaches can be seen as resonating with a modernization paradigm, emphasizing the importance of the private sector, along with attention to national development strategies, national identity, and technological innovation. However, there are some important distinctions between Japanese and western approaches: Japanese approaches tend to privilege process over outcomes in development practices, to consider structural and social over individual issues in addressing social problems, and to resist social marketing and other campaign strategies in communication projects.

40|$|For {{the last}} four decades, {{inequality}} has been increasing in both industrialized and emerging market countries. Inequality is a concern in development due to its social-ethical and economic rationale. Inequality can impair social well-being which leads to political unrest. Also it can trigger economic instability and hamper economic growth. Indeed, inequality is not a recent debate in development economics. Previous {{studies have focused on}} many factors such as economic policy, labor, education, health, culture, technology, political economy, etc. This research aims {{to examine the relationship between}} economic growth and inequality, then analyze its influencing factors in the context of emerging market economies. Thus, it proposes to look into the inequality-growth relationship anew and go beyond most of the earlier studies in the case countries (Indonesia and Korea) by two approaches. First, it employs Theil’s T statistics method to assess how the changes in the economic structure have driven inequality and economic growth as presumed by Simon Kuznets. Kuznets supposes the existence of an inverted U-shape curve between inequality and economic level in which inequality first rises along the growing economy then followed by a decline inequality despite the economy keeps growing. This pattern is driven by the structural economic transition. Second, it examines the influencing factors of changing inequality with a special attention to economic policy then puts it into institutional and historical context of Indonesian and Korean economies. A regression model is developed to identify the correlation between these factors and inequality. The motivation of this comparative analysis is based on the fact that Indonesia and Korea experienced rapid economic growth and structural transition. They have managed to leap from low income countries in 1960 s to high income (middle income for Indonesia) countries nowadays, with massive structural transition from agriculture to industry and services. Moreover, they also experienced some profound changes in their institution which have influenced the orientation of their economic policy, especially in the mid- 1990 s when both countries fell into the economic crises and most of the new economic policies were suggested by the <b>donor</b> <b>institution.</b> Theil’s T method shows, despite the declining trend of economic inequality in terms of sectoral and regional GDP, income inequality is increasing since 1990 s in Indonesia and Korea. Theil’s T index calculated from regional and sectoral wage data confirms the official Gini ratio measurement. It indicates service sector (in Indonesia) and financial sector (in Korea) as the main driver of this rising income inequality. Then, the regression model shows this trend is correlated with some economic policies which are, for Indonesia case, fiscal policy in terms of declining tax ratio and progressiveness, and economic openness in terms of declining tariff rate. For Korea, these are monetary policy in terms of higher real interest rate, and investment in real economy in terms of declining gross-fixed capital formation. Moreover, there are also correlation between income inequality and technological progress in terms of capital-to-labor ratio in both countries. Looking back to the 1960 s- 1990 s period; Indonesia and Korea not only experienced rapid economic growth but also steady inequality within moderate levels. They have been successful to manage growth with equity. However, this was influenced by the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime, which has caused a profound change in their economic policies from a coordinated and planned economy to a more liberal economy. Revisiting the debate about Kuznets’ theory, it is concluded that the existence of Kuznets’ curve could be a common phenomenon unless there is a force (more active role of the government) governing income distribution and growth. Therefore, a free-market economy would be more likely to create an unequal economic growth.

40|$|At {{the recent}} UN {{climate change conference}} in Bali, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for a revolutionary change in the world’s energy mix to {{minimize}} the risk of catastrophic global heating. This paper explores the implications for the World Bank and other <b>donor</b> <b>institutions,</b> employing proposed Bank financing of the Mmamabula coal-fired power project in Botswana as an illustrative case. Using the latest estimates of generating costs for coal-fired and low-carbon power options, I compute the CO 2 accounting charges that would promote switching to the low-carbon options. In all cases, I find that that the switching charges are {{at the low end of}} the range that is compatible with safe atmospheric limits on carbon loading. Among the low-carbon options that I have considered for Botswana, solar thermal power seems to dominate carbon capture and storage. My results suggest that the World Bank and other <b>donor</b> <b>institutions</b> will adopt a transformational energy policy if they use appropriate accounting charges for carbon emissions. The Mmamabula example indicates that this approach will select low-carbon options in many cases, and grants from the Bank’s Clean Technology Fund and other sources can finance the market-cost gap between clean and fossil-fired technologies.
