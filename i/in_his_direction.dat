5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him to a potential target, and he took aim, {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E
25|$|On October 21, 2007, James Simpson of Lubbock, Texas, accused Knight {{of firing}} a shotgun <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> after he yelled at Knight {{and another man}} for hunting too close to his home. Knight denied the allegations. An {{argument}} {{between the two men}} was recorded via camera phone and aired later on television.|$|E
25|$|Last aboard was the ship's master, Capt. Lawrence J.

25|$|Investigators said Gelhaus {{feared for}} his safety after Lopez {{turned around and}} {{allegedly}} raised the pellet gun <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> (a replica of an AK-47 that was an air-soft gun that fired plastic pellets). Gelhaus told investigators {{that he could not}} remember if he verbally identified himself as a deputy sheriff, although he was in a deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car before firing at Lopez; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached him from behind.|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{informed}} that Masrur al-Balkhi had departed from Wasit and was heading <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> Sulayman grew concerned that his position {{was exposed to}} attack by land and water. After consulting with his men, he decided to transfer {{to the area of}} Nahr Tathitha, which had dense thickets and an escape route back to the central Zanj camp. This move successfully threw the government forces off of his trail; upon Masrur's arrival he only found Sulayman's deserted camp, and attempts to locate the rebel's new position were unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|At 2 p.m., as {{they waited}} for sounds of Huger's {{expected}} attack, Lee, Longstreet, and visiting Confederate President Jefferson Davis were conferring on horseback when they came under heavy artillery fire, wounding two men and killing three horses. A.P. Hill, commanding in that sector, ordered the president and senior generals to the rear. Longstreet attempted to silence the six batteries of Federal guns firing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> but long-range artillery fire proved to be inadequate. He ordered Col. Micah Jenkins to charge the batteries, which brought on a general fight around 4 p.m.|$|E
25|$|One {{day while}} in the Cardiff {{district}} of Glamorganshire, Cadoc was being chased by an armed swineherd from an enemy tribe. As he ran through the woods {{looking for a place}} to hide, he came upon a wild boar, white with age. Disturbed by his presence, the boar made three fierce bounds <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> but Cadoc's life was spared when the boar miraculously disappeared. Cadoc took this as a heavenly sign, and marked the spot with three tree branches. The valley was owned by his uncle, King Pawl of Penychen, who made a present of the land to his nephew. The location later became the site of the great church college and monastery at Llancarvan.|$|E
25|$|Two Confederate blunders aided Rosecrans. Breckinridge, on {{the east}} side of the river, did not realize that Crittenden's early morning attack had been withdrawn. He refused to send two brigades as {{reinforcements}} across the river to aid the main attack on the left. When Bragg ordered him to attack to his front—so that some use could be made of his corps—Breckinridge moved forward and was embarrassed to find out that there were no Union troops opposing him. At about that time, Bragg received a false report that a strong Union force was moving south along the Lebanon Turnpike <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> He canceled his orders that Breckinridge send reinforcements across the river, which diluted the effectiveness of the main attack.|$|E

50|$|The {{appeal to}} the Supreme Court {{proceeded}} on two grounds. Firstly that Hayes was not in receipt of a pecuniary advantage {{within the meaning of}} the statute. When she reaffirmed her entitlement, no advantage was gained as she was already entitled to the compensation. Secondly that the trial judge had erred <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>directions</b> on the requisite mens rea to make out the offence. The judge had directed the jury that Hayes must have honestly and reasonably believed she was entitled to compensation.|$|R
25|$|With his {{activity}} in academia, Rainer reacted against cronyism, taking a public stand against arbitrary appointments in teaching, and ruining {{his relationship with}} the establishment. At a time when the Romanian school of anthropology was being divided between centrists and supporters of the fascist Iron Guard, he was again confronted by the far-right. Rainer was opposed to the fascist youth, whose members instigated in favor of academic censorship in his university curriculum. At one such incident in early 1938, Rainer stood unmoved at his desk as some of his fascist students, including the son of painter Nicolae Tonitza, lit firecrackers and threw eggs <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> However, he refused to ask for sanctions against them, and eventually received their letter of apology.|$|E
25|$|Likewise {{there are}} {{different}} versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by {{a man with a}} double-barreled shotgun, and studied the movements of birds as they were shot. In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at Prouts Neck while his neighbor Will Googins, fired blank charges <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> from a rowboat offshore. However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted Defiance, a Civil War subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 A Good Shot, Adirondacks, which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of Right and Left.|$|E
25|$|Murphy, then {{faced with}} the {{charging}} gang members, raised the rifle toward them and took aim. Gang member W. H. Jackson pointed his revolver at Tanner, who testified that Jackson was “possibly twenty or thirty feet” away. Tanner was unarmed and could do nothing. Jackson probably noticed Murphy was aiming his now-dead boss' rifle <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> This, coupled with the fast-approaching men from the Citizen's Committee, who prematurely ended their meeting {{with the sound of}} gun fire, perhaps convinced Jackson not fire his pistol at Tanner. Someone yelled out towards the men who were with Smith, “They have killed Soapy, and if you don’t clear out quick they will kill you too.” Not wanting to engage in a gun battle in which they were vastly outnumbered, the gang fled.|$|E

25|$|With 53,000 troops, Blücher's Army of Silesia {{began moving}} {{north on the}} morning of 24 February, {{destroying}} the bridges at Arcis-sur-Aube and Plancy-l'Abbaye behind it. That evening he received an order from Schwarzenberg to withdraw east and form the right flank of the Army of Bohemia. Since this would have exposed his march to a French attack, Blücher ignored his instructions and continued marching northwest toward Sézanne. Marshal Auguste de Marmont was at Sézanne with 6,000 soldiers on the evening of 24 February. Detecting the build up of Allied forces <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> the French marshal withdrew to the Vindey heights to the west of Sézanne. On 26 February Marmont fell back west toward La Ferté-Gaucher, while calling for Marshal Édouard Mortier to join him at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre. Between Marmont and Mortier there were only 10,000 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, at 12:45PM, João Goulart left Rio for the capital, Brasília, in {{an attempt}} to stop the coup. At the same time, General Kruel and the 2nd Army began to march towards the Vale do Paraíba, between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In the southeast, only the 1st Army, {{commanded}} by General Âncora and based in Rio de Janeiro, had not enlisted in the coup. General Artur da Costa e Silva called Âncora and demanded his surrender. Âncora replied he would honor a promise to Jango and first meet to discuss the situation with General Kruel, who was marching <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> The meeting would take place later in the day at the Academia Militar de Agulhas Negras, in Resende, between Rio and São Paulo. At that meeting, Âncora surrendered the 1st Army. Goulart had no military support outside of the south.|$|E
25|$|Hakim and Bet-Zuri {{ran out of}} the yard, {{jumped on}} their rented bicycles, and began {{pedaling}} down the street away from the scene. Major Hughes-Onslow rushed to the sentry box and raised the alarm. Hearing it, Hakim and Bet-Zuri turned onto a side street. They had very nearly gotten away when an Egyptian motorcycle policeman, El-Amin Mahomed Abdullah, caught up to them. Hakim and Bet-Zuri were determined not to injure any Egyptians in their operation, and so did not attempt to shoot him off his motorcycle. Rather, Bet-Zuri fired a volley of warning shots <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction,</b> which he ignored. Abdullah then dismounted and ordered him to drop his weapon. Bet-Zuri attempted to shoot out the motorcycle's tires, but found that his pistol had run out of ammunition, and as he attempted to reload it, Abdullah fired, hitting Bet-Zuri in the chest. Hearing the commotion, Hakim turned back to help Bet-Zuri, and within minutes, another policeman appeared, and the two were placed under arrest.|$|E
5000|$|The area of Cantonment Road was {{the site}} {{assigned}} by Stamford Raffles <b>in</b> 1819 <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>directions</b> to Major William Farquhar for barracks for the East India Company's Sepoy troops. The contingent of Indian sepoys stationed here had accompanied Raffles to Singapore {{and were asked to}} stay. Cantonment refers to a group of lodgings assigned to troops, hence the name of the road. British troops were [...] "cantoned" [...] here between 1824 and 1858. Prior to 1853, Outram Road was also part of Cantonment Road.|$|R
50|$|Not all of Tommaso Francini's {{mechanisms}} for courtly entertainments were garden features. He was the designer of a revolving stage-set for an elaborately produced pageant, Le ballet de la délivrance de Renaud, presented in January 1617 at the Palais du Louvre; several contemporaries remarked on the impressive innovation, which was reinvented {{in the late}} nineteenth century, at the Residenztheater, Munich but no one was more impressed than the poet Giovanni Battista Marino, who was present and recreated the illusion <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>directions</b> for L'Adone with its elaborately staged intermezzi.|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, {{although}} Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was {{taken aback by the}} severity of the condemnation and vitriol that poured <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> His central role in the organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
25|$|On the 14th, Eugene {{received}} {{an order to}} remain at Halle and that the main army was falling back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction.</b> That day he heard the cannonade from the Jena-Auerstedt battles. It {{was not until the}} evening of the 15th that he heard about the military disaster. On the 16th, Eugene had received no further orders. He instructed the detachment at Merseburg, which had been reinforced to two and a half battalions, to pull back to Halle. The Leipzig force was also recalled, while he sent back a detachment to hold Dessau on the Elbe River. He deployed his main force on high ground on Halle's south side, with his battle line facing northwest toward the city and his left bent back. The two and a half battalions from Merseburg were left to defend the bridges {{on the east side of}} Halle, together with a dragoon regiment. The Usedom Hussars were nearby, at the junction of the Saale and the Weisse Elster Rivers, just south of Halle. The Treskow Regiment was at Eisleben, to the west-northwest of Halle.|$|E
25|$|Pratt is {{most famous}} for his run out of Australian captain Ricky Ponting at Trent Bridge in the 2005 Ashes series. Brought on to field as a substitute, Pratt was fielding at cover when Damien Martyn tapped the ball <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>direction</b> and {{attempted}} a quick single. Pratt duly threw down the stumps at the striker's end with Ponting considerably short of his ground. This moment is remembered {{as one of the}} most important turning points during the series, with Ponting looking well set for a big score at the time. The dismissal prompted an angry outburst from the batsman, who was seen shouting up at the England balcony towards Duncan Fletcher, unhappy at England's frequent use of substitute fielders during the series. Ironically, although England may have used substitute fielders to rest bowlers between spells, this appearance by Pratt was not among them: he was replacing Simon Jones, who had been taken to hospital with an ankle injury. The run out earned him a place on the open top bus parade following the series victory.|$|E
