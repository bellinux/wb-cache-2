5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, so it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{how to identify}} the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close that it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the object is an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).|$|E

25|$|Although {{listeners}} perceive {{speech as}} {{a stream of}} discrete units (phonemes, syllables, and words), this linearity <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the physical speech signal (see Figure 2 for an example). Speech sounds do not strictly follow one another, rather, they overlap. A speech sound {{is influenced by the}} ones that precede and the ones that follow.

25|$|They produce large mucus webs to filter-feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{but also}} small zooplankton. They eat the web with the captured prey and then re-reproduce a web net. The web {{is large and}} spherical and it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> during the day because of diffuse reflection. Webs are easier to see at night. Limacina helicina is easily disturbed (like all other Thecosomata); when disturbed, it retracts into its shell and destroys its web. Gilmer & Harbison (1991) have assumed, that Limacina helicina feeds while motionless (without actively swimming). Its web enables them neutral buoyancy or allow them slow sinking only.|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia) is {{a slender}} multi-colored {{subspecies}} {{of the common}} garter snake. Designated as an endangered subspecies since the year 1967, it is endemic to San Mateo County and the extreme northern part of coastal Santa Cruz County in California. Some researchers estimate {{that there are only}} 1,000 to 2,000 adult snakes of the subspecies T. s. tetrataenia remaining. However, {{the full extent of the}} snakes' habitat has not been fully documented, and many snakes may utilize creeks and other waterways that are currently unexplored. This garter snake prefers wet and marshy areas, and because of its elusive nature, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or capture.|$|E

25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
25|$|Apparently part of {{the royal}} agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the {{enhancing}} of royal control over Coimbra and its environs. The sole preserved document of the council was confirmed by a Martim, bishop-elect of Coimbra. Later {{in the same year}} a private document of Coimbra cited him, although still just as bishop-elect. Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the protégé of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic or Hispanic rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why he was never consecrated. This obscure dispute continued for in the following year (1089) one Julian appears as bishop and in 1091 a John. They are probably the same person. In the 1091 document the bishop was given permission to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.|$|E
500|$|In an {{analysis}} of the Wong Kim Ark case written shortly after the decision in 1898, Marshall B. Woodworth laid out the two competing theories of jurisdiction in the Citizenship Clause and observed that [...] "he fact that the decision of the court was not unanimous indicates that the question is at least debatable." [...] Woodworth concluded, however, that the Supreme Court's ruling laid the issue to rest, saying that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what valid objection can be raised thereto". [...] Another analysis of the case, published by the Yale Law Journal (1898), favored the dissenting view.|$|E

500|$|Alastair Hudson {{wrote that}} [...] "doctrinally, it is {{suggested}} that the decision in Hunter v Moss is wrong and should not be relied upon". Firstly, it contradicts an element of property law which requires there be [...] "specific and identifiable property" [...] to be subject to a property right. Secondly, he suggests it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why there should be a dividing line between intangible and tangible property, since there are some principles which apply to both. 500 ball bearings are tangible, but identical; under Hunter, there is no reason these should also not require separation, so the distinction between tangible and intangible is thus [...] "spurious".|$|E
500|$|A 1993 Parliamentarians for Global Action {{survey showed}} that a strong {{majority}} of parliamentary respondents thought that the public would {{support the idea of}} a UN Parliamentary Assembly, but they were less sure the public would be prepared to finance it. The analysis pointed out, [...] "The possibility of a greater financial burden to support an enlarged UN is unlikely to evoke support unless it can be demonstrated that the return on investment is significant. Citizens are often known to express lofty globalist sentiments when questioned on general principles, and to surrender them when costs or trade offs are concerned." [...] A 1995 United Nations University report claimed, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how the Parliamentary Assembly would be able to pay for the salaries and travel of what could be over 1,000 representatives; this proposal could increase the duplication and waste that already exist within multilateral bodies." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} {{towards the}} end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help.

But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. …. Blücher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat". Steele (2014) writes: [...] "Blücher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Blücher. As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank. Wellington was able to shift to the offensive".|$|E
