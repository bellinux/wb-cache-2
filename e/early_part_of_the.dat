5|$|In the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century further {{expansion}} {{took place}} in residential districts increasingly distant from the city centre. Bristol Hippodrome was designed by Frank Matcham, and opened on 16 December 1912.|$|E
5|$|By the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th {{century the}} six towns that {{eventually}} became Stoke-on-Trent—Burslem, Tunstall, Stoke-upon-Trent, Hanley, Fenton and Longton—were all established settlements. Despite occupying {{only a small}} geographic area and all based around the pottery industry, there was little political or social co-operation between them.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, some {{components}} of meditation {{had started to}} be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity. However, the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as Lectio divina aimed at the general public began to appear {{by the middle of}} the century.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth period, he {{continued}} to serve on Parliamentary committees. However, he attracted accusations of corruption. In September 1650, these accusations led to him giving up his post at Tilbury Fort. It was probably around this time that he married his second wife, Joanna van Tromp.|$|E
5|$|European {{immigrants}} {{brought the}} tradition in a non-political {{form to the}} North American continent. In the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, sängerfest celebrations drew devotees {{in the tens of}} thousands, and included some United States presidents among their audiences. Sängerbunds are still active in Europe and in American communities with Germanic heritage.|$|E

5|$|From the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period {{there is}} {{relatively}} little metalwork {{and a larger}} amount of ceramics. The assemblage of early Iron Age ceramics from Atlantic Scotland is large compared {{with the rest of}} Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which resemble those of southern Britain, particularly those with incised geometric ornament.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, {{information}} about the types and distances of stars became more readily available. The spectra of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C. Pickering at Harvard College Observatory developed a method of categorization that {{became known as the}} Harvard Classification Scheme, published in the Harvard Annals in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} time sheets in Saturday's free {{practice}} session, with Sebastian Vettel {{a tenth of}} a second behind, while Rosberg and Räikkönen completed the top four. Few cars took to the track during the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session due to high temperatures and strong winds. A brief red flag period occurred midway through practice when Daniil Kvyat spun out in turn four.|$|E

The couple wrestled in several intergender tag team matches throughout the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year.|$|E
5|$|Most World Tour stage {{races are}} won by strong climbers. The Eneco Tour is unusual because the favourites for overall victory were {{classics}} riders—those who perform {{strongly in the}} Ardennes classics and the cobbled classics that feature in the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycling season.|$|E
5|$|Originally called Holford's Prairie, Lewisville {{dates back}} to the early 1840s. The arrival of the town's first {{railroad}} in 1881 engendered its initial growth, and the expansion of the area's transportation infrastructure spurred further development in the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Lewisville incorporated in 1925, and when construction of Lewisville Lake was completed in the 1950s, the city began to expand rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the game, Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen placed a partial-game {{suspension}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew, including leading rusher, Da'Rel Scott, and senior wide receiver Danny Oquendo. Consequently, {{a much younger}} line-up initially started for Maryland during the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, including, according to Friedgen, some who {{probably would not have}} seen playing time otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Raymond Howard was an English {{practitioner}} {{of the modern}} Pagan new religious movement of Wicca. He promoted his tradition, known as the Coven of Atho, through a correspondence course established in the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Research on Iguanodon {{decreased}} {{during the}} <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century as World Wars and the Great Depression enveloped Europe.

5|$|The 2015 Tirreno–Adriatico was the 50th {{edition of}} the Tirreno–Adriatico stage race. It took place from 11 to 17 March and was the third race of the 2015 UCI World Tour.

5|$|The E3 Harelbeke {{is part of}} {{the spring}} {{classics}} season. It is therefore suited to the riders who ride in the several other similar races through the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, such as the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, the Tour of Flanders and the Dwars door Vlaanderen, which are often raced over the same roads.|$|E
5|$|The <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story {{provides}} an anthropological {{view of the}} culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, {{and the rest of the}} book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E
