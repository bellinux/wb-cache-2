5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{departed}} from {{the idea that the}} provision of budget <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities is a very important thing. Recalling this problem, a good regulation is required. This study raised a problem of the urgency of budgeting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities and the funding strategy as well as the juridical strategy in governing <b>the</b> budget <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities. This study employed a juridical analytical method, a research which is conducted to analyze certain provision of law to be used later in answering the society 2 ̆ 7 problem. From the research, it could be found that the provision of fund to provide <b>the</b> infrastructures <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities is very urgent. Such urgency included the reasons concerning <b>the</b> funding provision <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities and the determination of their needs required the funding provision. <b>The</b> budgeting strategy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities is highly dependent on who is responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> affairs concerning <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities. In the context of the relationship division between Central Government and Local Government, it includes those decentralized to local areas. <b>For</b> that reason, <b>the</b> local areas could provide it from Local Original Income (PAD) deriving from Entertainment Tax with earmarking pattern. When it was not sufficient, recalling that the existing local tax potential was inadequate or null, <b>the</b> funding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> with disabilities could be provided by Central Government and the other legitimate source of funds. The regulation strategy which should be taken is to amend the Law Number 28 of 2009 and Law Numer 40 of 2007 on Corporate Social Responsibility, to establish the Law of <b>the</b> <b>Persons</b> with Disabilities to govern the funding...|$|R

When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce.

5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|The process upon being branded is {{a painful}} {{experience}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> {{as the body}} would either accept the seal or reject it. Once one's body accepts the seal, they can assume its First Level where the seal spreads from its point of application across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When the seal is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing the seal to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E
5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E
