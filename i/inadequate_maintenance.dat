Following the incident, the Danish fleet was grounded as a precaution and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In {{the first six months}} of 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> organisation and staff shortages.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{regional}} seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, {{but the majority of}} records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, T-26s served {{mainly in}} {{separate}} light tank brigades (each brigade had 256–267 T-26s) and in separate tank battalions of rifle divisions (one company of T-26s consisted of 10–15 tanks). These were the type of tank units that participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 and in the Winter War from December 1939 – March 1940. The Winter War proved that the T-26 was obsolete and its design reserve was totally depleted. Finnish 37mm antitank guns and even 20mm antitank rifles easily penetrated the T-26's thin anti-bullet armour and tank units equipped with the T-26 suffered significant losses during the breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line, in which the flame-throwing tanks based on the T-26 chassis played a significant role.By mid-1941, most of the Red Army's vast numbers of tanks were suffering from serious wear and tear. Poor quality roads, the vulnerabilities of track design in the early 1930s and <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance,</b> recovery and repair services all took their toll. In some of the front line armoured units, {{up to half of}} the T-26, T-28 and BT tanks had major drive train components (engine, drive train or suspension) that were broken down or worn out and these disabled tanks were parked and cannibalised for spare parts to keep the rest running. Tanks damaged during the 1939 Winter War with Finland were also cannibalised for parts.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} of the 1920s–1930s were built using primitive technologies (masonry, wet stucco, wooden ceilings and partitions), low-grade materials and a low-grade workforce. Poor initial quality and <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> led to rapid decay. Excluding a few well-maintained, high-class apartment buildings, early stalinka are unsafe. February 10, 1999, a fire in Samara police department, built 1936, killed 57 men and women.

During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the T-34-85s were {{inherited}} by the national armies of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro and continued to see action during the Yugoslav Wars. Some were also acquired from Yugoslav reserve stocks by Serbian separatist armies, namely the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (SVK) and the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). Most of these tanks were in poor condition {{at the beginning of}} the conflict and some were soon rendered unserviceable, likely through <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> and lack of spares.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} sanitation {{technology in}} urban areas is the collection of wastewater in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in wastewater treatment plants for reuse or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with storm drains or separated from them as sanitary sewers. Combined sewers are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy rainfall and <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> can lead to combined sewer overflows or sanitary sewer overflows, i.e., more or less diluted raw sewage being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.|$|E

After 180 days of proceedings, it released its report Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster (short: Cullen Report) in November 1990. It concluded that the initial condensate leak was the result of maintenance work being carried out simultaneously on a pump and related safety valve. The inquiry was critical of Piper Alpha's operator, Occidental, which was found guilty of having <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> and safety procedures, but no criminal charges were ever brought against the company.|$|E

50|$|The Alpine Way had {{originally}} been built as a temporary construction access road by the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority during the 1950s to access the Murray-1 and Murray-2 hydroelectric power stations constructed {{as part of the}} Snowy Mountains Scheme. Once the power stations were completed, the Authority upgraded the road with fill and planted vegetation on the downhill hillside before transferring ownership to the National Parks and Wildlife Service. No individual government authority had responsibility for maintenance while the National Parks and Wildlife Service's own funding was <b>inadequate</b> for <b>maintenance</b> of park roads not designed for the purpose to which they were later put. Following the disaster, responsibility for the Alpine Way and Kosciuszko Road was handed to the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA).|$|R

The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70km southeast of the city. According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations. The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned.|$|E

On 15 April 2007, two RAF Pumas collided during a special forces mission close to Baghdad, Iraq. In November 2007, a Puma crashed during an anti-insurgent operation in Iraq; an inquest found the cause to be pilot error primarily, however the Ministry of Defence (MoD) was criticised for failing to equip RAF Pumas with night vision goggles and <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> checks compromising safety, these shortcomings were addressed following the incident.|$|E
50|$|The Association {{allowed the}} wardmotes to select any {{candidate}} they chose, and while many were active Democrats, other radicals and independent Chartists were sometimes elected {{on to their}} slate.

On one occasion, Ironside found five youths disturbing the peace and a wardmote passed a resolution calling for their parents to bring them before the body. When one youth attended the next meeting, he was reprimanded, while the body pressed for summons for the others. Members of the police force and other relevant bodies were also free to attend the wardmotes to justify their actions, and the Democrats were not universally critical of their actions.|$|R

Nonetheless, its handsome housing stock, the absence of commercial intrusion, reasonable real estate prices and an active neighborhood association have invigorated its renewal and encouraged its residents’ allegiance to these neighborhoods both north and south of Markham. Moreover, features which made these properties attractive to buyers {{in the first quarter of}} the century retain their draw still as the century draws to its close—proximity to the downtown business district, plentiful shade trees and, for those homeowners along the ridge overlooking the river, a panoramic view of the Arkansas River.|$|E

Track maintenance was at one time hard manual labour, requiring teams of labourers, or trackmen (US: gandy dancers; UK: platelayers; Australia: fettlers), who used lining bars to correct irregularities in horizontal alignment (line) of the track, and tamping and jacks to correct vertical irregularities (surface).

2500|$|By the mid-1970s, however, {{managerial}} neglect {{was taking}} a toll on the park's condition. [...] "Years of poor management and <b>inadequate</b> <b>maintenance</b> had turned a masterpiece of landscape architecture into a virtual dustbowl by day and a danger zone by night", {{in the opinion of}} Douglas Blonsky, a president of the Central Park Conservancy. Vandalism, territorial use (e.g. a pick-up game of softball or association football, which commandeered open space and excluded others), and illicit activities were taking place in the park. Several volunteer citizen groups emerged, intent upon reclaiming the park by fundraising and organizing volunteer initiatives. One of these groups, the Central Park Community Fund, commissioned a study of the park's management. The study's conclusion was bi-linear; it called for establishment of a single position within the New York City Parks Department, responsible for overseeing both the planning and management of Central Park, as well as a board of guardians to provide citizen oversight.|$|E
