50|$|The {{best known}} was the Apostles' Ointment (Latin: Apostolorum unguentum), or Ointment of Venus (Latin: unguentum Veneris) {{which was an}} {{ointment}} attributed to Avicenna (d.1037) made of twelve ingredients. The ingredients were turpentine, wax, <b>gum</b> <b>ammoniac,</b> birthwort roots, olibanum, bdellium, myrrh and galbanum, opoponax, verdigris, litharge, plus olive oil, and vinegar.|$|E
50|$|The long stout taproot - 'black {{without and}} white within' and {{sometimes}} 'as {{big as a}} man's thigh', as Gerard has it - yields,when incised in Spring, a considerable quantity of a yellowish-green latex, which dries into a gummy oleoresin and retains the strong, sulphurous scent of the root. This harvesting technique,and the product so obtained, very much recall those of two other medicinal umbellifers: Ferula assa-foetida and Dorema ammoniacum. A decoction of the root of P. officinale is diuretic, sudorific, antiscorbutic and controls menstruation. Gummi Peucedani, the oleoresin derived from the drying of the root latex, has properties {{similar to those of}} <b>Gum</b> <b>Ammoniac</b> (the oleoresin derived from Dorema ammoniacum). Peucedanum officinale has also been used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
5000|$|Ammoniacum, or <b>gum</b> <b>ammoniac,</b> is a {{gum-resin}} exuded {{from the}} stem of the perennial herb Dorema ammoniacum of the umbel family (Apiaceae). The plant grows to the height of 2Â½ or 3 meters (8 or 9 ft.) and its whole stem is pervaded with a milky juice, which oozes out on an incision being made at any part. This juice quickly hardens into round tears, forming the [...] "tear ammoniacum" [...] of commerce. [...] "Lump ammoniacum", the other form of the substance, consists of aggregations of tears, frequently incorporating fragments of the plant itself, {{as well as other}} foreign bodies. Ammoniacum has a faintly fetid, unpleasant odor, which becomes more distinct on heating; externally, it possesses a reddish-yellow appearance, and when the tears or lumps are freshly fractured they exhibit a waxy luster. It is chiefly collected in central Persia, and comes to the European market by way of Bombay.|$|E
