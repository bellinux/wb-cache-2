25|$|Some {{retrograde}} and anterograde amnesics {{are capable}} of non-declarative memory, including <b>implicit</b> <b>learning</b> and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated {{with the formation of}} declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test.|$|E

Ninety 2 six school students participated in these experiments (48 in each). The first experiment concerned with {{the effect of the}} secondary task and the sequence structure on the <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning.</b> The running 2 count was used as a secondary task.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that developmental dyslexia involves various literacy, sensory, motor skill, and processing speed deficits. Some recent studies have shown that individuals with developmental dyslexia exhibit <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> deficits, which may be related to cerebellar functioning. However, previous studies on <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> in developmental dyslexics have produced conflicting results. Findings from cerebellar lesion patients have shown that patients' <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> performance varied when different hands were used to complete tasks. This suggests that dyslexia may have different effects on <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> between the two hands if cerebellar dysfunction is involved. To specify this question, we used a one-handed version of a serial reaction time task to compare the performance of 27 Chinese children with developmental dyslexics with another 27 age-matched children without reading difficulties. All the subjects were students from two primary schools, Grades 4 to 6. The results showed that children with developmental dyslexic responded more slowly than nondyslexic children, and exhibited no <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> in the condition of left-hand response. In contrast, {{there was no significant difference}} in reaction time between two groups of children when they used the right hand to respond. This finding indicates that children with developmental dyslexia exhibited normal motor skill and <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> ability provided the right hand was used. Taken together, these results suggested that Chinese children with developmental dyslexia exhibit unilateral deficits in motor skill and <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> in the left hand. Our findings lend partial support to the cerebellar deficit theory of developmental dyslexia...|$|R
500|$|Vocabulary {{development}} {{during the}} school years builds upon what the child already knows, and the child uses this knowledge to broaden his or her vocabulary. Once children have gained a level of vocabulary knowledge, new words are learned through explanations using familiar, or [...] "old" [...] words. This is done either explicitly, when a new word is defined using old words, or implicitly, when the word {{is set in the}} context of old words so that the meaning of the new word is constrained. When children reach school-age, context and <b>implicit</b> <b>learning</b> are the most common ways in which their vocabularies continue to develop. By this time, children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading. Throughout schooling and adulthood, conversation and reading are the main methods in which vocabulary develops. [...] This growth tends to slow once a person finishes schooling, as they have already acquired the vocabulary used in everyday conversation and reading material and generally are not engaging in activities that require additional vocabulary development.|$|E

50|$|Some psychologists {{argue that}} <b>implicit</b> <b>learning</b> is {{more stable than}} {{explicit}} learning because the unconscious mind developed earlier than the conscious mind on the evolutionary timeline.

40|$|While {{sequence}} learning research models complex phenomena, {{previous studies}} have mostly focused on unimodal sequences. The goal of the current experiment is to put <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning</b> into a multimodal context: to test whether it can operate across different modalities.

Our results show that <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning</b> is very similar regardless of the source modality. However, the presence of correlated task and response sequences was required for learning to take place. The experiment provides new evidence for <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning</b> of abstract conceptual representations.

40|$|Many stroke {{patients}} experience {{difficulty with}} performing dual-tasks. A promising intervention to target {{this issue is}} <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning,</b> as it should enhance patients' automaticity of movement. Yet, although it is often thought that <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> is preserved post-stroke, evidence for this claim has not been systematically analysed yet. Therefore, we systematically reviewed whether <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> is preserved post-stroke, and whether patients benefit more from implicit than from explicit motor learning. We comprehensively searched conventional (MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO) and grey literature databases (BIOSIS, Web of Science, OpenGrey, British Library, trial registries) for relevant reports. Two independent reviewers screened reports, extracted data, and performed a risk of bias assessment. Overall, we included 20 out of the 2177 identified reports that allow for a succinct evaluation of <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning.</b> Of these, only 1 study investigated learning on a relatively complex, whole-body (balance board) task. All 19 other studies concerned variants of the serial-reaction time paradigm, with most of these focusing on learning with the unaffected hand (N = 13) rather than the affected hand or both hands (both: N = 4). Four of the 20 studies compared explicit and <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> post-stroke. Meta-analyses suggest that patients with stroke can learn implicitly with their unaffected side (mean difference (MD) = 69 ms, 95 % CI[45. 1, 92. 9], p <. 00001), but not with their affected side (standardized MD = -. 11, 95 % CI[-. 45,. 25], p =. 56). Finally, <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> seemed equally effective as explicit motor learning post-stroke (SMD = -. 54, 95 % CI[- 1. 37,. 29], p =. 20). However, overall, the high risk of bias, small samples, and limited clinical relevance of most studies {{make it impossible to}} draw reliable conclusions regarding the effect of <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> strategies post-stroke. High quality studies with larger samples are warranted to test <b>implicit</b> motor <b>learning</b> in clinically relevant context...|$|R

40|$|<b>Implicit</b> task {{sequence}} <b>learning</b> (TSL) can {{be considered}} as an extension of <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning</b> which is typically tested with the classical serial reaction time task (SRTT). By design, in the SRTT there is a correlation between the sequence of stimuli to which participants must attend and the sequence of motor movements/key presses with which participants must respond. The TSL paradigm allows to disentangle this correlation and to separately manipulate the presences/absence of a sequence of tasks, a sequence of responses, and even other streams of information such as stimulus locations or stimulus-response mappings. Here I review the state of TSL research which seems to point at the critical role of the presence of correlated streams of information in <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning.</b> On a more general level, I propose that beyond correlated streams of information, a simple statistical learning mechanism may also be involved in <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning,</b> and that the relative contribution of these two explanations differ according to task requirements.

40|$|The present fMRI study {{investigated}} the neural areas involved in <b>implicit</b> perceptual sequence <b>learning.</b> To obtain more insight in the functional contributions of the brain areas, we tracked both the behavioral and neural time course of the learning process, using a perceptual serial color matching task. Next, to investigate whether the neural time course was specific for perceptual informatin, imaging results were compared {{to the results of}} <b>implicit</b> motor sequence <b>learning,</b> previously investigated using an identical serial color matching task (Gheysen et al. 2010). Results indicated that implicit sequences can be acquired by at least two neural systems: the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus, having different operating principles. The caudate nucleus contributed to the <b>implicit</b> sequence <b>learning</b> process for perceptual as well as motor information in a similar and gradual way. The hippocampus, on the other hand, was engaged in a much faster learning process which was more pronounced for the motor compared to the perceptual task. Interestingly, the perceptual and motor learning process occurred on a comparable implicit level, suggesting that consciousness is not the main determinant factor dissociating the hippocampal from the caudate learning system.
