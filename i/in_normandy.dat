5|$|As the German commanders on {{the spot}} had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the {{concentration}} of their armoured reserves at {{the western end of}} the front <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{fighting}} in the Italian Campaign and, with his former brigade commanded by Brigadier Howard Kippenberger, Hargest sought a new role. He was appointed New Zealand's observer of the D-Day landings <b>in</b> <b>Normandy.</b> He {{was attached to the}} British 50th Infantry Division, an infantry unit of the 21st Army Group, with which he landed <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> on 6 June. He was wounded later that month.|$|E

5|$|Many {{casualties}} were suffered {{by both sides}} but unlike General Bernard Montgomery, the Allied commander <b>in</b> <b>Normandy,</b> Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel was unable to withdraw units into reserve after the battle, as they were needed to hold the front line. The British retained the initiative, attacked several more times over the following two weeks and captured Caen in Operation Charnwood in mid-July. Interpretations of the intention and conduct of Operation Epsom differ widely but there is general agreement concerning {{its effect on the}} balance of forces <b>in</b> <b>Normandy.</b> The Germans contained the offensive but only by committing all their strength, including two panzer divisions newly arrived <b>in</b> <b>Normandy,</b> which had been intended for an offensive against British and American positions around Bayeux.|$|E

5|$|After his consecration Warelwast {{continued}} {{to serve the}} king, often appearing on documents or in accounts of the royal court. The bishop served the king as a messenger, once more carrying messages to Anselm in 1108. He {{also served as a}} royal judge, hearing a case at Tamworth in 1114 and another at Westbourne the same year. He was with the king <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> in 1111, 1113, and 1118, and may have been <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> more frequently. During Henry's reign Warelwast was a witness to 20of the king's charters.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{personnel}} {{also took}} part in the invasion of Southern France in August 1944, and RAAF airmen continued to operate against German forces {{until the end of the}} war in May 1945. However, the relatively low casualties suffered by the Allied air forces during the fighting <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> and subsequent campaigns resulted in an over-supply of trained Australian aircrew in the UK, hundreds of whom were never assigned to a combat role. Australia's contribution to the fighting <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> is commemorated in memorials and cemeteries in London and Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{witnessed}} a royal charter in 1135 but was dead by 1144, when his lands were {{granted by the}} Empress Matilda and her son Henry to Richard's son Geoffrey Ridel. His other sons were Ralph Basset, who held lands near Drayton, and William Basset, who held lands near Sapcote. William became a royal justice and sheriff like his father. Richard also had two daughters: Sibil, who married Robert de Cauz, and Matilda, who married John de Stuteville. Ralph inherited the ancestral lands <b>in</b> <b>Normandy.</b> The Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote that Basset built a tower on his ancestral lands of Montreuil <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> purely to demonstrate his status and wealth.|$|E

5|$|Danish {{raids on}} England continued, and Æthelred sought help from Richard, taking refuge <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> in 1013 when King Swein I of Denmark drove Æthelred {{and his family}} from England. Swein's death in 1014 allowed Æthelred to return home, but Swein's son Cnut contested Æthelred's return. Æthelred died {{unexpectedly}} in 1016, and Cnut became king of England. Æthelred and Emma's two sons, Edward and Alfred, went into exile <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> while their mother, Emma, became Cnut's second wife.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|King Henry and King Stephen {{recognised}} Pain as {{the legitimate}} holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties <b>in</b> <b>Normandy.</b> Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands <b>in</b> <b>Normandy,</b> and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.|$|E

5|$|Relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became {{increasingly}} strained during the King's final years. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England. In 1135 they urged Henry {{to hand over}} the royal castles <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> to Matilda whilst he was still alive, and insisted that the Norman nobility swear immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power <b>in</b> <b>Normandy.</b> A fresh rebellion broke out amongst the barons in southern Normandy, led by William, the Count of Ponthieu, whereupon Geoffrey and Matilda intervened in support of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Some towns, such as York, {{suffered}} from Norman sacking during William's northern campaigns. Other towns saw the widespread demolition of houses {{to make room}} for new motte and bailey fortifications, {{as was the case in}} Lincoln. The Norman invasion also brought significant economic changes with the arrival of the first Jews to English cities. WilliamI brought over wealthy Jews from the Rouen community <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> to settle in London, apparently to carry out financial services for the crown. In the years immediately after the invasion, a lot of wealth was drawn out of England in various ways by the Norman rulers and reinvested <b>in</b> <b>Normandy,</b> making William immensely wealthy as an individual ruler.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{story for}} FUSAG {{was that the}} army group, based in {{south-east}} England, would invade the Pas-de-Calais region several weeks after a smaller diversionary landing <b>in</b> <b>Normandy.</b> In reality, the main invasion force would land <b>in</b> <b>Normandy</b> on D-Day. As D-Day approached, the LCS moved on to planning tactical deceptions to help cover {{the progress of the}} real invasion forces. As well as naval operations, the LCS also planned operations involving paratroopers and ground deceptions. The latter would come into effect once landings were made but the former (involving naval, air and special forces units) were used to cover the approach of the true invasion fleet.|$|E

As the unit was establishing itself here, they came under fresh attack from Mustangs, which shot up the airfield, destroying 15 Fw 190s and putting II./JG 1 out of the battle. Around 11 non-operational Fw 190s were also destroyed– resulting in the final losses of II./JG 1 <b>in</b> <b>Normandy.</b> In ten weeks <b>in</b> <b>Normandy,</b> II./JG 1 had lost 27 pilots, 3 captured and 2 wounded. A total of 106 aircraft were lost for various reasons.|$|E
5|$|Urse d'Abetot (c. 1040– 1108) was a Norman {{as well as}} {{a medieval}} Sheriff of Worcestershire and royal {{official}} under Kings William I, William II and Henry I. He was a native of Normandy and moved to England shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, and was appointed sheriff in about 1069. Little is known of his family <b>in</b> <b>Normandy,</b> who were not prominent.
