The design has a circumference of 91 metres. In 1935, the Boy-Scouts and Cubs, in honour of the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of King George V, carved a large-scale {{version of the}} words 'The King' into the hill, each letter some 20 feet long. Encouraged by the success of this, the Scouts, to celebrate the 1941 opening of the town's new Scout-hall, carved the Fleur de Lys emblem into the hill and lit it up at night {{with the aid of a}} series of tins filled with oil-soaked rags which were set alight. Years later, the design was lit by <b>electric</b> <b>strip</b> lighting and is illuminated on most evenings throughout the year.|$|E
50|$|Packaged {{terminal}} {{air conditioner}} (PTAC) systems are {{also known as}} wall-split air conditioning systems. They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an <b>electric</b> <b>strip,</b> gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.|$|E

5000|$|The {{speed of}} the cars, when they were working well, was so high that the {{possibility}} of overtaking another car was very low. The cars were all thrown to the outermost lane in every corner. Because of this, the outermost lane in an oval track would always be the fastest lane to run in. This meant that the cars being raced were using the same lane of the track, often nose-to-tail. The act of changing lanes along a straight to pass your opponent would cause a relative drop in performance as the cars left one set of <b>electric</b> <b>strips</b> in the track and steered across to the other. This effect meant that all but the slowest of opponents could not be passed, even along a significant straight. (The later addition of 45 degree bends made it possible to create overtaking spots by placing all the cars in the innermost lane {{at the start of a}} straight. Since the cars would then naturally steers themselves immediately into the outermost lane, an overtaking manoeuvre could be effected by flicking the lane changer switch to make the car stay in the innermost lane down the straight before then being thrown by centrifugal force to the outside of the next corner in front of your opponent. The manoeuvre would then be finished by switching the lane change controller to return to driving in the favoured then from then on).|$|R

Heat was supplied to the blades using twenty-nine <b>electric</b> heating <b>strips</b> cemented vertically on the outer surface of the blades. Distributions of heat transfer coefficient were obtained at three levels through blade height by measuring surface temperature distribution using thermocouples. To understand heat transfer characteristics, surface static pressure distributions on blade surface were also measured. Numerical investigation was performed as well to extend the investigation to locations other than those measured experimentally. Three-dimensional nonisothermal, turbulent flow was obtained by solving Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations and energy equation. The shear stress transport model was employed to represent turbulent flow. It was found through this study that secondary flow generated by flow deflection increases heat transfer coefficient on the blade suction surface.

The system was designed by IBM to provide 50 to 60 percent of the space heating and domestic hot water preheating load to a 2, 000 square foot floor space single family residence in the Huntsville area. The load design temperature inside the building was to be maintained at 70 degrees fahrenheit with auxiliary energy for heating supplied by an electric heat pump assisted by an <b>electric</b> resistance <b>strip</b> heater.

The system was designed for residential application and used to satisfy the demands of an office environment. The differences were: (1) inside temperature was not maintained at 70 F as expected; and (2) hot water usage was much lower than expected.

40|$|AbstractA strip electric–magnetic {{polarization}} saturation (SEMPS) {{model is}} developed {{to study the}} electric and magnetic yielding effects on a crack in magnetoelectroelastic (MEE) media. In this model, the MEE medium is treated as being mechanically brittle, and electrically and magnetically ductile. Analogously to the classic Dugdale model, the electric and magnetic yielding zones {{in front of the}} crack are represented for simplicity by two <b>strips.</b> In the <b>electric</b> yielding <b>strip</b> the <b>electric</b> displacement equals the electric displacement saturation and meanwhile in the magnetic yielding zone the magnetic induction equals the magnetic induction saturation. The nonlinear analytical solution of this SEMPS model of crack in an infinite MEE medium is obtained using an integral equation approach. The equivalence between the proposed SEMPS model and the existing strip electric–magnetic breakdown (SEMB) model is demonstrated. To analyze the nonlinear fracture problem in the corresponding finite MEE media, the non-linear hybrid extended displacement discontinuity-fundamental solution (NLHEDD-FS) method is modified, and a multiple iteration approach is adapted to determine the electric and magnetic yielding zones. Comparing with the analytical solution, the applicability and effectiveness of the NLHEDD-FS method is verified.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} May 1 to September 4, 1989 at the Eastern Oregon Agricultural Research Center (EOARC) Burns, OR {{to examine the}} effects of strip or continuous grazing management on the diet and performance of steers grazing native flood meadows. The objective was to determine if strip grazing would be a more efficient means of grazing management than continuous grazing. The experiment was designed to test diet quality, botanical composition of the diet, daily dry matter (DM) intake and performance of yearling steers. Eighty yearling steers weighing 253 ± 17 kg were selected from cattle at the Squaw Butte Experiment Station. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, with blocking based on past forage production. Treatments were continuous or strip grazing. A representative meadow of approximately 22. 4 ha was divided into four equal pastures. Continuous grazing steers had access to 5. 6 ha pastures for the duration of the study. Animals on strip grazing were confined to an area that was estimated to provide 5 - 7 days of forage using New Zealand portable <b>electric</b> fencing. <b>Strip</b> sizes were predetermined based on standing forage crop. Steers were not allowed to graze more than 7 days in any one strip. Diet quality was estimated from bi-weekly esophageal samples.

40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} for {{the evaluation}} of AC losses in a superconductor-metal composite strip in a nonuniform AC magnetic field having the form of a standing wave are derived. The considered configuration models superconducting tapes, thin films and coated superconductors. A distinctive feature of the problem is the appearance of a transverse component of the induced current that converts the problem to a two-dimensional one. Bean's critical state model for a superconductor and a low frequency approximation for a metal are used. In the framework of this approximation the influence of eddy currents in the metal on the magnetic field is neglected, and the current distribution in the superconductor is determined by an external field. Two cases were considered: (1) superconducting and metal strips electrically separated; (2) they are in an electric contact. It is shown that for most practical cases enough to take into account only the losses generated by induced longitudinal currents in a composite <b>strip.</b> When an <b>electric</b> contact between <b>strips</b> exists, the maximum loss density in high fields (above 2 T) can be determined by the transverse component of the current.

40|$|AbstractThe largest {{technical}} challenge to full-scale post-combustion carbon capture in power plants is the enormous energy consumption for solvent regeneration. If legislative requirements impose CO 2 capture, chemical absorption/desorption using amine solvent solutions {{is the most}} mature commercial technology available. The use of ejectors to upgrade external waste heat has recently been shown to significantly {{reduce the amount of}} valuable turbine steam required to regenerate the solvent. Using the Aspen Plus chemical process simulator, this study considers three different liquid sources for producing the ejector secondary steam in a waste heat supplied flash tank. In each case the goal is to minimize the sum of the heat duty of the ejector primary steam generator and the stripping tower reboiler. A base case 20 wt% MEA absorption/desorption CO 2 capture process was modeled, with flue gas data from a 400 MW net power coal-fired <b>electric</b> plant. Using <b>stripping</b> column condensate or lean solution to create the ejector secondary steam were found to be viable options for reducing valuable turbine steam consumption, with respective reductions of 14 % and 23 % shown for the completed simulations. With ejectors, lower temperature waste heat can be used to partially replace valuable turbine steam normally required in the reboiler for solvent regeneration in CO 2 capture...|$|R
40|$|Central crack {{specimens}} {{have been}} used to study the effects of an applied electric field on the fracture toughness of poled soft lead zirconate titanate ceramics (PZT- 5). The ultrasonic lapping technique was used to machine the central crack of the specimens used. The present experimental study illustrated that changing the field from negative to positive reduced the fracture toughness of a specimen subjected to an applied electric field. These experimental results were in agreement with the observations made by Park and Sun (J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 78 (1995) 1475) and Heyer et al. (Acta Mater. 46 (1998) 6615). Finite element results were employed to compare with the experimental data. Four fracture criteria, i. e. total energy release rate, mechanical energy release rate, local energy release rate and strain energy release rate, were compared with the experimental results. It was found the local energy release rate, which was defined based on a <b>strip</b> <b>electric</b> saturation model, was in broad agreement with the experimental observations. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} strain energy density criterion was unable to describe the effect of electric field on fracture toughness when a large electric field was applied. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Structural {{reliability}} {{concerns of}} various electromechanical devices {{call for a}} better understanding of the mechanisms of fracture in piezoelectric ceramics subjected to combined mechanical and electrical loading. For these materials, due to unexplained discrepancies between theory and experiments, even the basic criterion of fracture remains a point of controversy. A viewpoint adopted in this paper is to model piezoelectric ceramics as a class of mechanically brittle and electrically ductile solids. As a first step toward understanding the effects of <b>electric</b> yielding, a <b>strip</b> saturation model is developed for a finite crack perpendicular or parallel to the poling axis of an infinite poled piezoelectric ceramics medium with electrical polarization reaching a saturation limit along a line segment in front of the crack. This model may be considered as a generalization of the classical Dugdale model for plastic yielding near cracks in thin metal sheets. The essential features of the strip saturation model are analyzed via a simplified electroelasticity formulation. Two energy release rates emerge from this analysis. An `'apparent'' or global energy release rate appears when evaluating J-integral along a contour surrounding both the electrical yielding strip and the crack tip. Under small scale yielding conditions, this energy release rate is equal to that of a linear piezoelectric crack without electrical yielding. A `'local'' energy release rate is obtained by evaluating J along an infinitesimal contour near the crack tip. The local energy release rate gives predictions which seem to be in broad agreement with experimental observations. It is also interesting that the local energy release rate is independent of the strength and size of electrical yielding. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
