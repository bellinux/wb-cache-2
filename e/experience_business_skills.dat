40|$|Entrepreneurial and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> are {{generally}} considered key to microbusiness success, hence to Microfinance Institution (MFI) clients’ loan repayment as well. However, empirical evidence is largely lacking, and where present, it is inconclusive {{on the importance}} of these skills for microfinance success. The present paper uses objective MFI loan repayment data to empirically test whether loan repayment rates positively correlate with self-evaluations on entrepreneurial and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> of loan clients. A survey was conducted among 235 loan clients of uniCredit — an MFI in Ghana. We establish that MFI clients’ self-evaluation of their entrepreneurial and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> are not related to their loan repayment rates. However, we observe that women repay their loans better than do male microbusiness entrepreneurs, and loan repayment was also better for those entrepreneurs with more than 15 years of <b>business</b> <b>experience...</b>|$|R

40|$|Community pharmacists are {{requiring}} {{a wider range}} of skills in their practice and often undertake additional roles including: finance, management, accounting, marketing, human resources, training, and education. Australian universities have incorporated business units or programs into their curricula. Although <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> have an important role in community pharmacy, research in this area is lacking. This pilot study conducted in northern Australia investigates which <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> community pharmacists consider to be of most value. The survey tool Qualtrics© was used to design the questionnaire, distribute the survey via email and, in the statistical analysis of the data. Results will provide information on business practices in community pharmacy; identify the <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> required and, identify which <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> should be considered for incorporation into pharmacy curricula and/or taught as external to the degree. 46 percent of respondents were employed by pharmacy chains. 100 percent of the respondents rate management skills as very important, with training and education representing the second major non-dispensing activity. Over 50 percent strongly agreed that, “business skills are essential to the practice of community pharmacy”. The majority of respondents rated their proficiency in <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> as „average‟, with the exception of training and education where they rated skills as „above average‟. Over 50 percent of the pharmacists agreed that the <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> should be offered in pharmacy curricula, or externally.

The coding results showed that there are changing emphases among three types of skills, vis-a-viz technical <b>skills,</b> <b>business</b> <b>skills,</b> and systems skills. Technical skills, however, remained the most important for programmers while <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> continued to be the most sought after for IT managers.

40|$|The social {{problems}} that exist within South Africa cannot be ignored. The magnitude of poverty, unemployment and crime that exist are ever increasing while HIV/Aids has left 10 {{percent of the}} children within this country orphaned. Discrepancies in the access to proper healthcare and education between the private sector and the public sector is evident, mainly due to the failure of the public sector (government) to effectively implement and manage the healthcare and education systems in South Africa. In the last decade, there has been {{a significant increase in the}} number of registered non-profit organisations which can be attributed to a greater awareness of the {{social problems}} that exist, as well as the inability of the government and the public sector to address the social problems on their own. Social entrepreneurs are attempting to find innovative solutions to these problems by starting non-profit organisations and then implementing projects and programmes that will help alleviate these social problems. Social entrepreneurship is a fairly new concept, particularly within the realm of academic research. Previous studies on social entrepreneurship have highlighted the need for social entrepreneurs and have also emphasised the many challenges these social entrepreneurs face, one of which is the lack of education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training. Research indicates that a non-profit organisation should be run like a small business in order to be successful, which highlights the importance for social entrepreneurs to be equipped with the appropriate <b>business</b> <b>skills.</b> The impact that a social entrepreneur’s education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training has on the success of a non-profit organisation is however still largely unknown. The purpose of this study was three-fold: firstly, to study the relationship between the education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training of a social entrepreneur and the successful functioning of their non-profit organisations; secondly, to develop recommendations for social entrepreneurs on how to more effectively manage their non-profit organisations and guide them in what business training will benefit them as a social entrepreneur; and lastly, to add to the already existing knowledge on social entrepreneurs, particularly within a South African context. The main research methodology used to conduct the empirical investigation in this study was qualitative in nature. Elements of quantitative data collection were adopted in the instruments in order to ensure standardisation when measuring a social entrepreneur’s education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training, as well as the success of their respective non-profit organisation. In-depth interviews were conducted with fourteen social entrepreneurs who work in a variety of social developmental sectors within South Africa. An interview guide was developed to record the formal levels of education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training received by the respondents and to discuss the impact of other types of education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training on their capabilities as managers of non-profit organisations. A tool was developed to measure the success of the respective non-profit organisations and the results were compared to the social entrepreneur’s levels of education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training. Global analysis was the data analysis technique adopted in this study and was used to identify common themes among the transcripts as well as possible relationships between different variables. There were two main findings with regard to the impact a social entrepreneur’s education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training has on the successful functioning of his/her respective non-profit organisation. Firstly, the formal types of education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training of a social entrepreneur have a direct impact on the success of a nonprofit organisation. Secondly, once a social entrepreneur has completed school level education, informal types of education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training play a bigger role than formal types in the effective management and success of his/her respective non-profit organisation. The findings of the empirical investigation showed that the most valuable three types of informal education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training include workshops and conferences, <b>business</b> <b>experience</b> and networks. The most important recommendation for social entrepreneurs is that their school level education should be completed, in order to access further education and <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> training opportunities. The social entrepreneurs must equip themselves with certain skills and knowledge, namely: financial management, legal knowledge, human resource management, strategic management, monitoring and evaluation skills, technical skills and research skills, in order to ensure the successful functioning of their respective non-profit organisatio...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{our results}} {{have shown that}} women {{business}} owners {{were more likely to}} report an increase in enterprise profits when owners possessed skills that are relevant to their business operations. In other words, although microcredit access in our case does not seem to predict enterprise profitability, business owners who approached business ownership with sufficient stocks of <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>experience</b> seemed to experience increases in enterprise profits. Earlier research has also established that businesses operated by owners with <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>experience</b> are more likely to do better than owners without such skills and experience (Kuzilwa 2005). This implies that microfinance programmes could have a significant impact on economic empowerment and poverty alleviation among women borrowers if they target women business owners who possess some <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> that are requisite for the successful business creation and operation. Alternatively, microfinance programmes could introduce training modules in <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> to help their clientele create and operate profitable businesses. On the other hand, education level of the owner was not a significant predictor of enterprise profitability, possibly because the majority of the respondents (75 %) had attained only primary education level. This could mean that the education level of the business owner did not matter in determining profitability of their enterprises. This could also suggest that women business owners require more specialised <b>business</b> <b>skills</b> rather than just a formal education. Likewise, owners’ age did not seem to translate into increases in business profits.|$|R
