500|$|To meet {{long-term}} requirements, Alberta Transportation also {{proposes to}} construct a high capacity directional ramp carrying traffic from eastbound Anthony Henday Dive to northbound Ray Gibbon Drive after the latter is twinned and upgraded to a freeway. [...] Ray Gibbon Drive is proposed as a major corridor that will carry the Highway2 designation in the future. [...] One kilometre {{further down the road}} at 137Avenue, grading was initially completed for a partial cloverleaf interchange but in 2008 Alberta elected not to spend $7million to complete paving of the ramps because development did not yet require it. St.Albert mayor Nolan Crouse was unhappy with the decision, stating that his city would not pay for it either. [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> until there's another plan, and right now we don't have a plan... we have taken the position that we think it's the province's responsibility, and they say they won't," [...] Crouse said. , there is no timeline for completion of the interchange.|$|E

6000|$|... "If you don’t now," [...] {{said the}} mate, [...] "you will at tea-time. I’m not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down <b>there</b> with them alone again. You needn’t think it If you {{was to ask}} me what I’ve been eating I couldn’t tell you." ...|$|R

6000|$|When he next spoke, there was, however, {{no hint of}} altruistic {{sentiment}} in his curt inquiry: [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> until you freeze?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Skim,--Now look here, Patsy Doyle, if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and giggle you'll spoil everything. Mr. Clark {{wants to}} court, and it's getting late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of all {{the people}} I've ever met," [...] he said, [...] "you're the least adventurous. You might be sitting on green chairs in Hyde Park. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> the whole afternoon? Aren't you going to walk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{he called}} up. [...] "I'm {{perfectly}} safe, {{sitting in a}} pool of water up to my neck. And here's both our packs. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on them. <b>There's</b> room for a half-dozen here. If you slip, stick close and you'll land. In the meantime you hike up and get out. Go to the cabin.

60|$|He did not answer. He was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> to be dragooned and insulted! His {{helplessness}} {{had never}} so weighed on him before.

6000|$|... "Why, I {{just know}} it. He's got a room that's just across from that lamp post.

6000|$|... "Most men do," [...] said Miss Cornelia, sewing furiously. Miss Cornelia was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> with idle hands, even on Christmas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will I?" [...] said Pilkins, delightedly. [...] "Oh yes, I'll {{look after}} him! As {{a citizen of}} New York, and {{therefore}} a part owner of its public parks, I'm going to extend to him the hospitality of Madison Square to-night. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> on a bench till morning. There's no use arguing with him. Isn't he wonderful? I'm glad you'll look after the little lady, Alice. I tell you those Babes in the Wood made my--that is, er--made Wall Street and the Bank of England look like penny arcades." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang it all, man," [...] he said, [...] "you are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> {{and tell}} me that Luke de Mountford--the man whom I myself would have chosen as a {{son-in-law}} had Lou not forestalled me--that Luke would commit a deliberate murder? In the name of common-sense, Tom, why it's unthinkable! Do you mean to say that you actually believe that Luke, after he left that God-forsaken club, joined his cousin again as if nothing had happened; that he got into a taxicab with him, and poked him through the neck whilst the man was looking another way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hey? You {{would think}} they would be falling over each other. Not a bit of it. Frightened to go home. Nice and warm out here to lie about a veranda waiting for a job. I sit and wait in my office. Nobody. What did they suppose? That I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> like a dummy with the Consul-General's cable before me? Not likely. So I looked {{up a list of}} them I keep by me and sent word for Hamilton--the worst loafer of them all--and just made him go. Threatened to {{instruct}} the steward of the Sailors' Home to have him turned out neck and crop. He did not think the berth was good enough--if--you--please. 'I've your little records by me,' said I. 'You came ashore here eighteen months ago, and you haven't done six months' work since. You are in debt for your board now at the Home, and I suppose you reckon the Marine Office will pay in the end. Eh? So it shall; but if you don't take this chance, away you go to England, assisted passage, by the first homeward steamer that comes along. You are no better than a pauper. We don't want any white paupers here.' I scared him. But look at the trouble all this gave me." ...|$|E

5000|$|In August 2007, Brzezinski {{endorsed}} Democratic {{presidential candidate}} Barack Obama.

[...] In September 2007 during a speech on the Iraq war, Obama introduced Brzezinski as [...] "one of our most outstanding thinkers," [...] but some pro-Israel commentators questioned his criticism of the Israel lobby in the United States. In a September 2009 interview with The Daily Beast, Brzezinski replied to a question about how aggressive President Obama should be in insisting Israel not conduct an air strike on Iran, saying: [...] "We are not exactly impotent little babies. They have to fly over our airspace in Iraq. Are we just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and watch?" [...] This was interpreted by some supporters of Israel as supporting the downing of Israeli jets by the United States in order to prevent an attack on Iran. In 2011, Brzezinski supported the NATO intervention against the forces of Muammar Gaddafi in the Libyan Civil War, calling non-intervention [...] "morally dubious" [...] and [...] "politically questionable".|$|E
