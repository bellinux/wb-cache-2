The levels are composed of platforms on which <b>Keen</b> can stand, viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect, and some platforms allow <b>Keen</b> to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that <b>Keen</b> can climb up or down.

The second episode introduces moving platforms as well as switches that extend bridges over gaps in the floor. Once entered, {{the only way to}} exit a level is to reach the end, and the player cannot save and return to the middle of a level. In between levels, <b>Keen</b> travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by moving <b>Keen</b> to the entrance or save their progress in the game.
