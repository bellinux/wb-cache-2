40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{surveyed}} {{adolescent girls}} about their feelings regarding pregnancy. METHODS: A survey {{was administered to}} 117 13 - to 18 -year-olds who obtained pregnancy tests at nine clinics in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1998. The survey included four measures of pregnancy feelings. The authors used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to examine the associations of these measures with engagement with school, future expectations, social and environmental characteristics, and perceived partner desire for pregnancy. RESULTS: The four measures of pregnancy feelings were highly correlated (P = 0. 0001). Participants reported a range of positive, negative, and ambivalent feelings on all measures. Perceived partner desire for pregnancy, limited future expectations, and lack of school engagement {{were significantly associated with}} positive pregnancy feelings for the four measures.

40|$|Prostate cancer {{demonstrates}} particular {{characteristics and}} potential stresses for both patient and partner, yet its {{consequences for the}} couple are often inadequately addressed in the clinical setting. One-to-one interviews have shown areas of partner need but do not address the dynamic of the couple which itself holds implications for clinical practice. The participation of nine {{out of a possible}} 15 women in interviews with men taking part in a study of information needs suggested the extent of involvement by partners in prostate cancer. Secondary analysis of the verbal interaction and thematic content of the interviews authenticated the representation by members of the couple of the struggle against cancer as a shared experience. The women were shown to exercise authority, accepted by men in relation to illness-related issues and assumed responsibility for the management of information, care and the continuation of normal day-to-day life. Findings suggest a model of partner activity in prostate cancer conceptualized as 'maintaining control over illness'.

40|$|Abstract –In 2010, an {{exploratory}} survey on methods, tools and design techniques (MTT) {{has led to}} a better understanding of design practices of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) located in Eastern Quebec. The results of this survey have shown that most companies report having a structured design process, while only some resort to MTT. Following this study, a new research was launched to develop performance indicators for the design process, but also, and more generally, for design projects. To do this, a tool was developed to characterize and evaluate the design practices of companies as a way to establish performance indicators following a longitudinal study. A questionnaire was developed as a tool based on a model of design system consisting of six dimensions (human, management, environment, product, process and techno-scientific). In the questionnaire, each dimension is characterized by different descriptors which are analyzed by four aspects that measure: i) if the descriptors are taken into consideration (the occurrence of the descriptors), ii) the importance of the descriptors according to the project success, iii) the company’s performance level related on the descriptors and iv) the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>partners.</b> For validation purposes, the tool was tested on a pilot basis by eight companies.

40|$|Purpose - The European Commission {{and social}} partner organisations at EU level {{encourage}} the lifelong development of qualifications and competence. This is reflected in many policy reports and reviews. This paper seeks to show the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> social <b>partner</b> organisations {{at the level of}} EU-funded competence development projects. Design/methodology/approach - A survey and four case studies were conducted. The population of 60 Leonardo da Vinci projects for a specific sector (agri-food-environment) which were implemented during the years 2000 - 2003 was selected for the study. For the survey project, documentation was analyzed based on two variables: type of project (to what extent did it require <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> sectoral social <b>partner</b> organisations); and (the percentage <b>of)</b> <b>involvement</b> (<b>of</b> sectoral social <b>partners</b> {{who were involved in the}} partnership). A Spearman correlation test was used to evaluate the relationship between type <b>of</b> project and <b>involvement.</b> For the case studies project documentation was analyzed, and in-depth semi-structured interviews were held with project managers. Findings - The Spearman correlation between the type <b>of</b> project and <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> sectoral social <b>partner</b> organisations was - 0. 031 (p= 0. 812). So there was no relationship. The case studies showed that the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> sectoral organisations clearly contributes to realising results in the projects.

These included focus groups, response sheets, and structured interviews to allow stakeholder groups to identify their communication perceptions, concerns and needs with regards the Initiative. Specific issues and needs were related to information transfer and exchange, communication networks, and involvement in natural resource issues. The Communication Strategy was developed with close involvement of the Initiative partners, and sought to directly reflect stakeholder issues and needs.

The program was planned in a way to contemplate the perceived needs of the hospital teams {{as well as those of}} the target population, pre and post-natal women, within a systemic perspective. Thus the program covered the following aspects: training with the hospital team on communication and helping relationships, a series of speeches on mental health at the hospital, psychological treatment of the patients through counseling sessions, <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>partners</b> and families being assisted, support groups for peri-natal mourning, men's groups with the future fathers, psychoeducation in the mobile clinics, a survey of the social network in the city, psycho-social assistance and the introduction of relaxation strategies at the hospital. We concluded that in the context of a humanitarian crisis, as in the case of Haiti, a mental health program should contemplate different levels of need and take into consideration that health care professionals are also subject to the context of social stress. At the same time, the involvement of hospital teams in the process is fundamental to the success of the program...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{comprehensive}} review of the current discourse on the prevention of mother to child infection in HIV/AIDS. Within this, a special focus is given to South Africa and modifiable challenges to the effective implementation of programs of prevention are offered. The review affirms the lack of agreement within previous research about the range of consistent barriers to implementation and equally importantly, the range of interventions that can be effected to improve engagement in prevention programmes. The paper also presents a literature review, which focuses much more specifically on related literary sources that look at the factors that play an important part in determining patterns of PMTCT service uptake. As acknowledged earlier, research on the uptake of PMTCT confirms that usage remains unexplainably low and more notably, the South African picture is characterised by less success than is acceptable. One of the key issues of concern has been the limited involvement that male partners have had with regard to PMTCT service usage {{even in the face of}} research that shows that spousal involvement and/or the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>partners</b> offers noteworthy potential in motivating affected pregnant women to take up PMTCT services. To foreground this noted knowledge-gap, the current review of literature aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current viewpoints and existing research evidence, to determine prominent viewpoints in the study area.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of psychological disorders is rising and can negatively affect the social participation {{in different areas}} of life, such as partnership, family, work, friends, spare time, and neighbourhood (Hoffmann & Hofmann, 2008). Previous studies on psychological disorders were focused on a reduced participation in work. So far, there is no research that considers the relationship between psychopathological characteristics and all important life areas, as well as supportive and negative factors in these social relationships. This is {{the objective of the}} study which applies the bio-psycho-social model of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Method: The Symptom Checklist (SCL- 90 -R; Derogatis, 1992) was used to measure the 9 primary symptom dimensions and overall psychological distress by the GSI (Global Severity Index). The cut off value of the GSI at > 63 resulted in two natural patient groups, including 225 patients with a high GSI and 132 with a low GSI. Both patient groups at the psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic “Seehof” in Teltow were examined for differences in social participation and environmental factors. The participation and environmental factors in social life areas were assessed by the Multidimensional Social Contact Circle (MuSC; Linden et al., 2007) - an interview with a social network map. Patients and their partners were surveyed about supportive and negative factors in their partnership, assessed by the Quality of Relationship Questionnaire (QRI; Pierce et al., 1991). Results: Concerning general social participation, patients with the higher GSI took part in fewer life areas (F (1 / 153) = 3. 7, p < 0. 05) and had fewer social ties (F (1 / 153) = 6. 9, p < 0. 01). Furthermore, there was a relationship between higher overall psychological distress and less participation in work (Chi-Square = 13. 3, df = 1, p < 0. 001), fewer contacts to parents (Chi-Square = 9. 4, df = 1, p < 0. 01) and for women a higher instance of absent partners (Chi-Square = 4. 0, df = 1, p < 0. 05). Partners of patients with a higher GSI reported more frequent anger (t = - 4. 0, df = 140, p < 0. 001), wished more the patient would change (t = - 4. 0, df = 138, p < 0. 001) and were more upset because of the patient (t = - 2. 0, df = 140, p < 0. 05). Primary symptom dimensions with a reduction in the participation in different life areas were shown in phobic anxiety (r = - 0. 3, p < 0. 001), interpersonal sensitivity (r = - 0. 3, p < 0. 001), and depression (r = - 0. 2, p < 0. 001). In a hierarchical regression analysis, the predictors for overall psychological distress at the end of clinical treatment were gender, social participation in work and spare time, as well as satisfaction with practical and emotional support. Conclusion: The results indicate that in all life areas, except neighbourhood, there are psychopathological impairments. Therefore, every life area has its proper significance for mental health and a higher instance of social ties in another life area cannot compensate. The lacking social participation in work and spare time, also influencing the overall psychological distress at discharge, implicate a specific consideration in treatment. The central significance of partnership in relation to psychopathology was also shown in this study. Especially single mothers without partners suffered from higher psychological distress. Partner of patients with a high GSI experienced a higher conflict potential, implicating the need for early <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> <b>partners</b> in the opportunities of information and treatment. In further studies, it could be useful to investigate the needs of patients’ partners and to evaluate the effects of opportunities for partners’ information and treatment...|$|E

The Clean Development Mechanism {{and the international}} diffusion of technologies: An empirical study, Energy Policy 36, 1273 – 1283], we gave a general description of technology transfers by Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects and we analyzed their drivers. In this paper, we use the same data and similar econometric models to explain inter-country differences. We focus on 4 countries gathering about 75 % of the CDM projects: Brazil, China, India and Mexico. Sixty eight percent of Mexican projects include an international transfer of technology. The rates are, respectively, 12 %, 40 % and 59 % for India, Brazil and China. Our results show that transfers to Mexico and Brazil are mainly related to the strong <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>partners</b> and good technological capabilities. Besides a relative advantage with respect to these factors, the higher rate of international transfers in Mexico seems {{to be due to}} a sector-composition effect. The <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>partners</b> is less frequent in India and China, where investment opportunities generated by fast growing economies seem to play a more important role in facilitating international technology transfers through the CDM.

To our knowledge, no research has studied the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partner</b> {{in the decision-making process}} regarding breast reconstruction (BR) after cancer. This study aimed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the couples' decision-making process for BR in the cancer context and particularly to investigate the partners' involvement in this process. METHOD: Eighteen participants (nine women who underwent a mastectomy following a first breast cancer and their intimate partners) took part in this study. We conducted semidirective interviews, and a general inductive approach was chosen to capture the representations of the couples. RESULTS: The women in the sample were aged between 33 and 66 years (M = 54, SD = 7. 5) and their partner between 40 and 76 years (M = 59, SD = 11. 6). The duration of their intimate relationship was on average 18 years (SD = 10. 4; minimum = 4; maximum = 33). The analysis revealed 11 major themes. The two most salient ones were 'external influence' and 'implication of the partner'. The exploration of the subthemes revealed that the decision-making process is often reported as an interrelated experience by the couples and as a dyadic stressor. The partner's role is depicted as consultative and mostly supportive. CONCLUSION: These results provide new insights on the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partner</b> in decision-making. Thus, it now seems crucial to develop a prospective study, which will help understand the progression of the decision-making process over time. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Most people deal with intrusive life events such as cancer and the care trajectory together with their intimate partners. Shared decision-making between patients and physicians is now the 'gold standard' in Western Europe and the United States. However, in the context of breast reconstruction (BR) after cancer, factors guiding the decision-making process for BR, especially the potential <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partner,</b> are not very well understood. What does this study add? Provides a qualitative insight on the specific nature of heterosexual couples' representations regarding the decision-making process for breast reconstruction after cancer.

Method: Eighteen participants (nine women who underwent a mastectomy following a first breast cancer and their intimate partners) took part [...] We conducted semi-directive interviews and a general inductive approach was chosen to capture the representations of the couples. Results: The women in the sample were aged between 33 and 66 years (M= 54, SD= 7. 5), and their partner between 40 and 76 years (M= 59, SD= 11. 6). The duration of their intimate relationship was on average 18 years (SD= 10. 4; Minimum= 4; Maximum= 33). The analysis revealed 11 major themes. The 2 most salient ones were “external influence” and “implication of the partner”. The exploration of the subthemes revealed that the decision-making process is often reported as an interrelated experience by the couples and as a dyadic stressor. The partner’s role is depicted as consultative and mostly supportive. Conclusion: These results provide new insights on the <b>involvement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partner</b> in decision-making. It is crucial to develop a prospective study, which will facilitate understanding the progression of the decision-making process over time...|$|R
