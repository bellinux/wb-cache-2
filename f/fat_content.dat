40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of cow’s milk with <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of 3. 6 %, Dalia cheese with <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of 44 %, butter with <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of 80 % and margarine with <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of 24 % was determined after a heat treatment performed on cooking plate and microwave treatment, respectively of different durations. The biggest difference was obtained for oleic acid and elaidic acid since, {{with the exception}} of the margarine, in each case proportion of the cis-configurated oleic acid decreased while that of the trans-configurated elaidic acid increased. For all of the other fatty acids in the foodstuffs examined no such differences were obtained regarding change in fatty acid composition whose differences could influence healthy nutrition to considerable extent. Therefore we can take it as a fact that neither heat treatment performed on a traditional cooking plate nor microwave treatment affects considerably the composition of food fats...|$|R

Processed foods, specially fried and baked snacks can be a major contributor of salt in diets. Hence, the present study was undertaken to investigate the salt consumption behavior among selected adults using a structured questionnaire and to determine the salt and <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of common processed snacks. The respondents were 500 adult men and women, who volunteered {{to be a part of}} survey. As a second phase of the study, selected commercial processed foods such as salt biscuits, packaged and non-packaged fried snacks were analyzed for salt and <b>fat</b> <b>contents.</b> Results indicated that majority of subjects had a high salt intake of > 16. 0 g/day. They were aware of high salt products, though were unwilling to cut down salt in their diet.

Like other whales, {{the sperm}} whale's milk {{has a higher}} <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> than that of terrestrial mammals: about 36%, compared to 4% in cow milk. This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese, which prevents it from dissolving in the water before the calf can eat it. It has an energy content of roughly 3,840 kcal/kg, compared to just 640 kcal/kg in cow milk. Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of visible/near-infrared hyper-spectral analysis {{to monitor the}} quality of frying oil and fried breaded chicken nuggets was investigated. Partial least squares (PLS) calibration models were developed to predict the acid value, total polar components and viscosity of heated oils with different ratios of hydrogenation. Coefficient of determination (R 2) and {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) were calculated to assess the performance of each model. Results of the study demonstrated good prediction ability of the calibration models for the quality parameters with R 2 values of over 0. 92. The second study was based on developing calibration models for prediction of moisture and <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of fried breaded chicken nuggets with different levels of moisture and <b>fat</b> <b>contents.</b> Performing the same procedure for evaluation of the PLS calibration models, results of the study demonstrated that moisture and <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of fried breaded chicken nuggets could be predicted with R 2 values of 0. 92...|$|R

5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fat</b> <b>contents</b> in yeast {{cells were}} {{determined}} by infrared spectrophotometric methods, in stead of the ordinary extraction method. The yeasts were cultivated in modified Burkholder medium and starved for 24 hrs in the nitrogen-free medium. The sample was sufficient for the estimation {{in the level of}} about 1 mg of cells. It was found that a few strains and so-called the fat-storing yeasts contained from 25 to 43 per cent of fat, but almost of the yeasts produced from 5 to 10 per cent of it. This new procedure has the advantages of simplicity and applicability to small quantities for estimations of <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> in yeast cells. 油脂生産の目的で酵母の培養が試みられたのは第一次大戦中ドイツ，スエーデン等で研究されたのを始めとし，我国でも辰巳らにより原料として亜硫酸パルプ廃液，糖蜜のほか，石けん廃液等も検討された。油脂酵母の培養方法の特徴は炭素源と窒素源の比の大なることであり，先ず相当量の菌体が生成されると同時に窒素源が消尽され，始めて油脂の生成が行われると一般に考えられている。こゝでは酵母を増殖用培地で速かに増殖させ，之を無窒素培地に移して飢餓培養することにより，短期間に油脂の生産性を検することを目的に実験を行った...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate and compare the quality of probiotic and natural yogurt. Several samples of probiotic and natural yogurt were bought from supermarkets in Middlesborough (UK) and analyzed for physico-chemical, microbiological and organoleptic properties. Physico-chemical analysis showed that probiotic yogurts have more pH, fat and solid not <b>fat</b> (SNF) <b>contents</b> compared to natural yogurt. While natural yogurts have higher Total Titrable Acidities (TTA) and total solids contents, compared to probiotic yogurts. Organoleptically, probiotic yogurt was found more acceptable compared to natural yogurt. However, the <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> of natural yogurt are lower and that might affect the overall acceptability of the yogurt. Similarly, an increase in the TA of the natural yogurt might affect the quality of the product. Microbiological analysis found no significant variation in total viable count between probiotic and natural yogurt.

5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{has a high}} {{sodium and}} <b>fat</b> <b>content,</b> and has been specifically targeted by UK café chains {{in an effort to}} reduce salt and fat. Due to this, low-fat mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon. In 2009, seven large cafe chains in the UK made a commitment to reducing salt and fat through similar substitutions. A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon. One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich, a two-layered sandwich in which one layer is a BLT. The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat, normally chicken or turkey.|$|E
5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high <b>fat</b> <b>content.</b> Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high <b>fat</b> <b>content,</b> or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the processing effects (roasting and boiling) on primary and secondary metabolite composition of fruits from the following chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) cultivars (cvs.) of three Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) areas in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region (Portugal) : PDO Terra Fria (cvs. Aveleira, Boaventura, Côta, Lamela and Trigueira), PDO Padrela (cvs. Judia, Lada, Longal and Negra) and PDO Soutos da Lapa (cvs. Longal and Martaínha). The cooking processes significantly (p < 0. 0001) affected primary and secondary metabolite composition of the chestnuts. Roasted chestnuts had higher protein contents, insoluble and total dietary fibre and lower <b>fat</b> <b>contents</b> whilst boiled chestnuts had lower protein, but higher <b>fat</b> <b>contents.</b> Cooking increased citric acid contents, especially in roasted chestnuts. On the other hand, raw chestnuts had higher malic acid contents than cooked chestnuts. Moreover, roasted chestnuts had significantly higher gallic acid and total phenolics contents, and boiled chestnuts had higher gallic and ellagic acids contents, when compared to raw chestnuts. The present data confirms that cooked chestnuts are a good source of organic acids and phenolics and have low <b>fat</b> <b>contents,</b> properties that are associated with positive health benefits...|$|R
