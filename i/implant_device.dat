25|$|The {{technical}} goal of saline-implant {{technology was}} a physically less invasive surgical technique for emplacing an empty breast <b>implant</b> <b>device</b> through a smaller surgical incision. In surgical praxis, after having emplaced the empty breast implants to the implant pockets, the plastic surgeon then filled each device with saline solution, and, because the required insertion-incisions are short and small, the resultant incision-scars will be smaller and {{shorter than the}} surgical scars usual to the long incisions required for inserting pre-filled, silicone-gel implants.|$|E
25|$|Because {{a breast}} implant is a Class III medical device of limited product-life, the {{principal}} rupture-rate factors are its age and design; Nonetheless, a breast <b>implant</b> <b>device</b> can retain its mechanical integrity for decades in a woman's body. When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, {{and thus can}} be readily explanted (surgically removed). The follow-up report, Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5 per cent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10 per cent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation.|$|E

Moreover, proponent physicians have said there “should be no absolute contraindication to breast-feeding by women with silicone breast implants.” In the early 1990s, {{at the beginning of}} the silicone breast implant sickness occurrences, small-scale, non-random studies (i.e. “patients came with complaints, which might have many sources”, not “doctors performed random tests”) indicated possible breast-feeding complications from silicone implants; yet no study reported device–disease causality.|$|E

Because each breast <b>implant</b> <b>device</b> entails different medical risks, the minimum age of the patient for saline breast implants is different from the minimum age of the patient for silicone breast implants—because of the filler leakage and silent shell-rupture risks; thus, periodic MRI screening examinations are the recommended post-operative, follow-up therapy for the patient. In other countries, in Europe and Oceania, the national health ministries' breast implant policies do not endorse periodic MRI screening of asymptomatic patients, but suggest palpation proper—with or without an ultrasonic screening—to be sufficient post-operative therapy for most patients.|$|E

Issues such as design of suitable modulation methods, use of power and monitoring devices, transfer energy from external to internal parts with high efficiency and high data rates and low power consumption all {{play an important role in}} the development of implantable devices. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on various modulation and demodulation techniques such as amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK) and phase shift keying (PSK) of the existing wireless <b>implanted</b> <b>devices.</b> The details of specifications, including carrier frequency, CMOS size, data rate, power consumption and supply, chip area and application of the various modulation schemes of the <b>implanted</b> <b>devices</b> are investigated and summarized in the tables along with the corresponding key references.

In arrhythmia studies and treatment, long-term observation is critical to determine the nature of the abnormality and its severity.

40|$|Special-purpose {{hand-held}} radiotransceiver {{units have}} been proposed as means of short-range radio powering and interrogation of surgically implanted microelectromechanical sensors and actuators. These units are based partly on the same principles {{as those of the}} units described in "Printed Multi- Turn Loop Antennas for RF Biotelemetry" (LEW- 17879 - 1), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 6 (June 2007), page 48. Like the previously reported units, these units would make it unnecessary to have wire connections between the <b>implanted</b> <b>devices</b> and the external equipment used to activate and interrogate them. Like a unit of the previously reported type, a unit of the type now proposed would include a printed-circuit antenna on a dielectric substrate. The antenna circuitry would include integrated surface-mount inductors for impedance tuning. Circuits for processing the signals transmitted and received by the antenna would be included on the substrate. During operation, the unit would be positioned near (but not in electrical contact with) a human subject, in proximity to a microelectromechanical sensor or actuator that has been surgically implanted in the subject. It has been demonstrated that significant electromagnetic coupling with an <b>implanted</b> <b>device</b> could be established at a distance of as much as 4 in. (. 10 cm). During operation in the interrogation mode, the antenna of the unit would receive a radio telemetry signal transmitted by the surgically <b>implanted</b> <b>device.</b> The antenna substrate would have dimensions of approximately 3. 25 by 3. 75 inches (approximately 8. 3 by 9. 5 cm). The substrate would have a thickness of the order of 30 mils (of the order of a somewhat less than a millimeter). The substrate would be made of low-radiofrequency- loss dielectric material that could be, for example, fused quartz, alumina, or any of a number of commercially available radio-frequency dielectric composite materials. The antenna conductors would typically be made of copper or a combination of chromium and gold. The choice of metal and the thickness of the metal layer(s) would depend on the choice of substrate material. For example, on a quartz or alumina substrate, one would typically use a layer of chromium 150 A thick and a layer of gold 2 m thick. The proposed units and the <b>implanted</b> <b>devices</b> that they would interrogate or activate would be inherently safe to use. They would operate at low radiated-power levels for short interrogation times (typically, milliseconds). Hence, there would be little local heating of tissues surrounding the <b>implanted</b> <b>devices</b> and little absorption of radio energy by such sensitive body parts as the eyes and the brain. Because the <b>implanted</b> <b>devices</b> would not depend on battery power and would be activated only during short interrogation intervals and would otherwise be in the goff h state most of the time, the useful lifetimes of the <b>implanted</b> <b>devices</b> would be greater than those of comparable battery-powered <b>implanted</b> <b>devices.</b> The compactness of the hand-held transceiver units would facilitate transport and storage and would facilitate self-diagnosis by patients able to handle the units while away from medical facilities...|$|R
