She reached that port 10 days later and remained there for a little over a week. After putting to sea again on 27 January bound for New York, the warship encountered heavy seas a day out of port and began shipping a lot of water. Some of the water found its way into her number two engine room through an <b>exhaust</b> <b>blower</b> duct, which shorted out a circuit and caused a fire. Fortunately, her crewmen put out the blaze before it caused serious damage. While the destroyer escort battled her way through a hurricane on 3 February, ammunition tumbled from storage racks that had been torn loose by the storm and caused a few anxious moments before it was battened down. High winds and heavy seas also loosened the grips holding the ship's motor whaleboat in place and jostled the foremast so much so that it required a strengthening jury rig. Finally the storm-battered warship reached New York on 9 February.|$|E

5000|$|The condensed, pressurized, {{and still}} usually {{somewhat}} hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an expansion valve (often {{nothing more than}} a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. Aircraft air conditioners use turbines for cooling, more efficient but more complex. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator. A fan blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an <b>exhaust</b> fan/ <b>blower</b> into the room. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own [...] "kind" [...] of air (either the hot air or the cool air).|$|R

Measurements were taken for four different cases with different boundary conditions. Two cases operated with heated air flow in all four risers, whereas the other two were performed with flow in a single riser only. The obtained temperature profiles were asymmetric and suggested the presence of reverse flow from one of the chimneys in both single riser cases and in one of the four riser cases.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Over 13, 000 {{shipyard}} welders in the United States {{are subjected}} to hazardous welding fume in enclosed and confined spaces with inadequate or no ventilation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to validate a training provided to shipyard workers on the effectiveness of ventilation, particularly in the dynamic shipyard environment. Training was developed using general ventilation concepts and adapting them to the shipyard. Training concepts included moving the exhaust ventilation close to the weld's plume, creating crossdrafts, and providing mixing in the space by dilution ventilation. Testing of ventilation in dynamic work environments is difficult and rarely conducted. This study tested the training concepts in the field by monitoring for welding fume concentration before and after ventilation was introduced into the space. The worker was observed while the ventilation training parameters were added or modified in the space. A personal and area DataRAM with an SKC pump measured total particulate concentrations in the worker's breathing zone and in the work space. It was found that adding an <b>exhaust</b> or supply <b>blower</b> resulted in an average of 58 % decrease (range: 21 - 77 %) in particulate concentration in the breathing zone and a 67 % decrease (range: 39 - 86 %) of particulate concentration in the space. Providing a crossdraft at the welder's breathing zone did not consistently produce a decrease in particulate concentration and instead caused a 50 % increase in particulate concentration in the breathing zone and 5 % increase in the space. Reductions in the variability of the exposures were also seen in all adjustments except exhaust ventilation, located on the ground. Additionally, reductions in the 90 th percentiles (upwards to 90 % decrease in total particulate concentrations) were observed for all ventilation adjustments. Overall, the training concepts developed for shipyard welders do provide control and protection from welding fume in the shipyard confined spaces...|$|R

(A) The {{first class}} {{includes}} factory and workshop acts, laws relating to hours of labour, work on Sundays and holidays, {{the payment of}} wages, the liability of employers for injuries to their employees, &c. Factory acts have been passed by Factory [...] nearly all {{the states of the}} Union. These may be and work- [...] considered in two groups - first, laws which relate to conditions of employment and affect only children, young persons and women; and second, laws which relate to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and to the safety of employees generally. The states adopting such laws have usually made provision for factory inspectors, whose duties are to enforce these laws and who have power to enter and inspect factories and workshops. The most common provisions of the factory acts in the various states are those which fix an age limit below which employment is unlawful. All but five states have enacted such provisions, and these five states have practically no manufacturing industries. In some states the laws fixing an age limit are restricted in their application to factories, while in others they extend also to workshops, bakeries, mercantile establishments and other work places where children are employed. The prescribed age limit varies from ten to fourteen years. Provisions concerning the education of children in factories and workshops may be considered in two groups, those relating to apprenticeship and those requiring a certain educational qualification as a prerequisite to employment. Apprenticeship laws are numerous, but they do not now have great force, because of the practical abrogation of the apprenticeship system through the operation of modern methods of production. Most states have provisions prohibiting illiterates under a specified age, usually sixteen, from being employed in factories and workshops. The provisions of the factory acts relating to hours of labour and night work generally affect only the employment of women and young persons. Most of the states have enacted such provisions, those limiting the hours of children occurring more frequently than those limiting the hours of women. The hour limit for work in such cases ranges from six per day to sixty-six per week. Where the working time of children is restricted, the minimum age prescribed for such children ranges from twelve to twenty-one years. In some cases the restriction of the hours of labour of women and children is general, while in others it applies only to employment in one or more classes of industries. Other provisions of law for the protection of women and children, but not usually confined in their operation to factories and workshops, are such as require seats for females and separate toilet facilities for the sexes, and prohibit employment in certain occupations as in mines, places where intoxicants are manufactured or sold, in cleaning or operating dangerous machinery, &c. Provisions of factory acts relating to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and the safety of employees have been enacted in nearly all the manufacturing states of the Union. They prohibit overcrowding, and require proper ventilation, sufficient light and heat, the lime-washing or painting of walls and ceilings, the provision of <b>exhaust</b> fans and <b>blowers</b> in places where dust or dangerous fumes are generated, guards on machinery, mechanical belts and gearing shifters, guards on elevators and hoistways, hand-rails on stairs, fire-escapes, &c.|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} OPEFB biomass as an {{alternative}} source for renewable energy such as biochar has a great potential to overcome the shortage of fossil fuel. Moreover, the utilization of biomass {{as a source of}} biofuel can reduce the problem of environmental pollution particularly on the issues related to greenhouse gases. Being the second largest oil palm producer in the world, Malaysia has a great potential to produce clean renewable energy from biomass. The selfsustained carbonization was proposed and tested in this study, whereby oil palm biomass itself was combusted to provide heat for self-carbonization in inadequate oxygen without electrical heating element. In the first chapter, the reviews on the literature pertaining Malaysia palm oil industry, current carbonization technologies, proposed self-sustained carbonization to produce biochar and the objectives of this study have been discussed. In the second chapter, the temperature profiles and gaseous emission concentration during self-sustained carbonization of empty fruit bunch biomass in a pilot scale reactor (30 kg capacity) at different particles sizes (100 - 150, 30 - 99 and less than 29 mm) was evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate, the maximum temperatures ranging 417 - 580 oC at all particle sizes were tested and found to be suitable for biochar production. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 2. 8 - 4. 1, 0. 38 - 0. 51 and 0. 17 - 0. 26 %, respectively. For self-sustained carbonization with fixed exhausted gas flow rate, the maximum temperatures were slightly similar when compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate which was between 493 - 564 oC at all particle size tested. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 3. 65 - 5. 59, 0. 56 - 0. 72 and 0. 29 - 0. 39 %, respectively. SO 2 and HCl were not detected while NOx and particulate matter, (PM 10) were well below permitted level set by the Department of Environment, Malaysia for both natural and fixed exhausted gas flow rate. Gaseous pollutant in this study can be considered low and the self-sustained carbonization process was environmental friendly when compared to other studies using same palm oil biomass carbonization. In the third chapter, the effect of exhausted gas flow rate and OPEFB biomass particle sizes on biochar yield and quality in a pilot scale (30 kg capacity) reactor under self-sustained carbonization were evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate, harvesting carbonization temperature of < 500 oC of OPEFB biomass at the particle size ranging from 100 - 150 mm produced the highest biochar yield and CV between 23 - 25 % and 22. 6 - 24. 7 MJ/kg, respectively. The carbonization retention time was between 790 - 893 min and less compared to other particle sizes tested. This particle size, without further size reduction, is needed to reduce the energy requirement at production line. For self-sustained carbonization temperature with fixed exhausted gas flow rate, the OPEFB biochar yield at particle size 100 - 150 mm produced the highest yield (25 - 27 %), harvested at carbonization temperature of < 500 oC compared to other particle sizes in the same condition. Moreover, this yield was also high as compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate. The CV were found between 23. 0 - 24. 4 MJ/kg which were also comparable with other studies. The carbonization retention time between 280 - 462 min were found less when compared to natural exhausted gas flow rate which contributed to high yield. More consistent result can be achieved under self-sustained carbonization temperature with fixed exhausted gas flow rate but energy required from the usage of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>blower.</b> In this study, as the carbonization harvesting temperature decreased, the biochar yield decreases, the carbonization retention time increased. In the fourth chapter, self-sustained carbonization of pressed-shredded and whole bunchOPEFB in large scale pool type reactor (3000 kg) from the development of YAMASEN oven (Shimane) were successfully adopted and tested. The pressed-shredded OPEFB was found suitable to be carried out under an open carbonization system while closed carbonization system was preferable for whole bunch OPEFB. The maximum self-sustained carbonization temperature were ranged 583 - 695 oC for pressed-shredded and bunch OPEFB biomass. In terms of CV, large scale biochar production for open and closed system under self-sustained carbonization produced in between 21. 9 - 24. 3 and 19. 6 - 22. 9 MJ/kg, respectively which is comparable to small scale biochar production. In the fifth chapter, the energy balance and potential energy saving of raw and biocharOPEFB (pressed-shredded and whole bunch) in a scaled-up pool type self-sustained carbonization reactor (3 tones capacity) was evaluated. The ratio energy output/input for pressedshredded biochar, whole bunch biochar and raw pressed-shredded OPEFB briquette were positive which were 12, 15 and 8 respectively. Whole bunch biochar is still the highest ratio energy output/input biochar production although without pressed-shredder machine process step resulting in more energy produced than energy consumed. Briquetting raw pressed-shredded without carbonization process step also showed viable energy produced, however drying step with moisture below than 10 % is required. In conclusion and remarks, the self-sustained carbonization was successfully materialized, producing high yield and comparable CV in a small scale followed by scaling-up production of OPEFB biochar. This proposed system is preferable to the industry due to its simplicity, ease of operation and low energy requirement. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 236 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 25 日 1.
