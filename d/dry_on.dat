5|$|Mercedes-Benz officially {{withdrew from}} motor racing in 1931—citing the global {{economic}} downturn {{as a reason for}} their decision—although they continued to support Caracciola and a few other drivers covertly, retaining manager Alfred Neubauer to run the 'independent' operation. In part because of the financial situation, Caracciola was the only Mercedes driver to appear at the 1931 Monaco Grand Prix, driving an SSKL (a shorter version of the SSK). Caracciola and Maserati driver Luigi Fagioli challenged the Bugattis of Louis Chiron and Achille Varzi for the lead early in the race, but when the SSKL's clutch failed Caracciola withdrew from the race. A crowd of 100,000 turned out for the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. Rain began to fall before the race, and continued as Caracciola chased Fagioli for the lead in the early laps. The spray from Fagioli's Maserati severely impaired Caracciola's vision, but he was able to pass to take the lead at the Schwalbenschwanz corner. The track began to <b>dry</b> <b>on</b> lap six, and Chiron's Bugatti, which was by then running second, began to catch the heavier Mercedes. Caracciola's pit stop, completed in record time, kept him ahead of Chiron, and despite the Bugatti lapping 15seconds faster than the Mercedes late in the race, Caracciola won by more than one minute.|$|E

Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a wire hay rack. Results: <b>Drying</b> <b>on</b> a hay rack produced very good hay. The upper portion of the hay <b>dried</b> <b>on</b> the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that <b>dried</b> <b>on</b> a wire hay rack.

All Corsicans who had joined the French were granted an amnesty and their property was to be respected. Paoli and his Corsicans were furious; Paoli's deputy Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo attempted to intervene and was rebuffed by Hood, and Moore suggested that Hood had granted these terms to embarrass the army, whom the admiral publicly blamed for the length and failures of the siege. Historian Desmond Gregory has suggested instead however that Hood needed the siege concluded primarily so that his fleet to return to urgent operations elsewhere in the Mediterranean.|$|E

Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr., constructed a new $18 million, 52,007-60,606 seat multi-purpose stadium in less than one year, Atlanta Stadium, (later on known as Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium from 1976 until 1996 with its demolition in 1997) which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing Major League Baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the Kansas City A's to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.|$|E

500|$|Amy Winehouse was an English {{singer and}} songwriter. She {{was best known}} for her eclectic mix of various musical genres, {{including}} soul, jazz, rock and roll and R Winehouse released two albums of original music: Frank (2003) and Back to Black (2006). Frank was originally released by Island Records in October 2003 in the United Kingdom and in November 2007 in the United States. Because of the success of her second album, Frank was later re-issued in the UK in May 2008 and in the US in June 2008. Black to Black was issued under Island Records in Europe, Asia, South America and Australia, and under Universal Republic in the US. Several of Winehouse' singles have charted worldwide, including [...] "Rehab", [...] "You Know I'm No Good", [...] "Back to Black", [...] "Tears <b>Dry</b> <b>on</b> Their Own", and [...] "Valerie".|$|E

Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH enjoyed the fun nature of the album and said that [...] "if you want something to drive to, dance to, play at a house party or cheer your workmates up with, Fever is for you".

500|$|Winehouse {{joined a}} {{campaign}} to stop a block of flats being built beside the George Tavern, a famous London East End music venue. Campaign supporters feared the residential development would end the spot's lucrative sideline as a film and photo location, on which it relies to survive. As part of a breast cancer awareness campaign, Winehouse appeared in a revealing photograph for the April 2008 issue of Easy Living magazine. Winehouse had an estimated £10m fortune, tying her for tenth place in the 2008 The Sunday Times listing of the wealth of musicians under age 30. The following year her fortune had dropped to an estimated £5m. Her finances are run by Mitch and Janis Winehouse. It was reported she earned about £1m singing at two private parties during Paris Fashion Week. {{as well as a}}nother £1m to perform at a Moscow Art Gallery for Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. Winehouse loaned a vintage dress used in her video for [...] "Tears <b>Dry</b> <b>on</b> Their Own" [...] as well as a DVD to the British Music Experience, a new museum dedicated to the history of British pop music. The museum, located in The O2, opened on 9 March 2009.|$|E

They immediately turned back west, gradually using the six remaining dogs to supplement their food supply; they ate all parts of the animals, including their livers. They initially made good progress, but as they cleared the largest glacier Mertz began to feel ill; he had lost his waterproof overpants on Ninnis' sledge, and in the cold his wet clothes were unable to <b>dry.</b> <b>On</b> 30 December, a day Mawson recorded that the companion was [...] "off colour", Mertz wrote that he was [...] "really tired [...] shall write no more."

Writer Josh Tyrangiel praised Winehouse for her confidence, saying, [...] "What she is mouthy, funny, sultry, and quite possibly crazy" [...] and [...] "It's impossible not to be seduced by her originality.

500|$|The {{band was}} not {{satisfied}} with the acoustics of the American studios they considered, and decided to record in Ulrich's native Denmark. Ulrich took drum lessons, and Hammett worked with Joe Satriani to learn how to record more efficiently. Ulrich was in talks with Rush's bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee to produce the album, but the collaboration never materialized because of uncoordinated schedules. Metallica recorded the album with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 1 to December 27, 1985. The writing of all the songs except [...] "Orion" [...] and [...] "The Thing That Should Not Be" [...] was completed before the band's arrival in Copenhagen. Rasmussen stated that the band brought well-prepared demos of the songs, and only slight changes were made to the compositions in the studio. The recording took longer than the previous album because Metallica had developed a sense of perfectionism and had higher ambitions for this one. Metallica eschewed the slick production and synthesizers of contemporary hard rock and heavy metal albums by Bon Jovi, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest. Despite a reputation for drinking, the band stayed <b>dry</b> <b>on</b> recording days. Hammett recalled that the group was [...] "just making another album" [...] at the time and [...] "had no idea that the record would have such a range of influence that it went on to have". He also said that the group was [...] "definitely peaking" [...] at the time and that the album had [...] "the sound of a band really gelling, really learning how to work well together".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics, with several reviewers dubbing {{it one of}} the worst episodes of the series. Francis Dass of the New Straits Times Press referred to it as [...] "one of the weaker episodes" [...] of the fifth season. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Schizogeny" [...] a D–, and wrote that [...] "'Schizogeny' just might be the very worst episode of The X-Files", noting that [...] "the tone [...] is off." [...] Furthermore, VanDerWerff felt that [...] "the more Scott and Wollaeger try to continue explaining this and tie it into the idea of child abuse, the less it attains any of the power or tragedy they want it to have." [...] Starpulse, in a run-down of the best and worst episodes and villains of the series, named the killer trees the worst monster-of-the-week and wrote, [...] " [...] proved that even the X-Files writers can come up completely <b>dry</b> <b>on</b> their scary creeps sometimes." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 4/10, and, while praising the [...] "interesting concept" [...] of the episode, concluded that it was filled with [...] "odd inconsistencies, [...] is definitely not one of the better episodes of the season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of {{the first part of the}} episode noting that [...] "director Ralph Hemecker [...] the eeriness to the fore, and [...] this a more honest-to-truth scary slice of X-File than has been offered in ages." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, argued that the episode's references to Psycho and its [...] "lack of explanation" [...] result in the episode approaching [...] "nonsense." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She wrote that, [...] "the plot of 'Schizogeny' is more tangled than the episode's paranormal root system, but underneath lies some powerful themes." ...|$|E
