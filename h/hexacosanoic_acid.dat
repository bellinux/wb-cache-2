40|$|X-linked {{adrenoleukodystrophy}} (X-ALD) is a fatal, axonal demyelinating, neurometabolic disease. It {{results from}} the functional loss {{of a member of}} the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily D (ABCD 1), which is involved in the metabolism of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Oxidative damage of proteins caused by excess of the <b>hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> the most prevalent VLCFA accumulating in X-ALD, is an early event in the neurodegenerative cascade. We demonstrate here that valproic acid (VPA), a widely used anti-epileptic drug with histone deacetylase inhibitor properties, induced the expression of the functionally overlapping ABCD 2 peroxisomal transporter. VPA corrected the oxidative damage and decreased the levels of monounsaturated VLCFA (C 26 : 1 n- 9), but not saturated VLCFA. Overexpression of ABCD 2 alone prevented oxidative lesions to proteins in a mouse model of X-ALD. A 6 -month pilot trial of VPA in X-ALD patients resulted in reversion of the oxidative damage of proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, we propose VPA as a promising novel therapeutic approach that warrants further clinical investigation in X-AL...|$|E

VLCFAs accumulate in X-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a disease caused by deficiency of the Abcd 1 peroxisomal transporter. Its closest homologue, Abcd 2, exhibits {{a high degree of}} functional redundancy on the catabolism of VLCFA, being able to prevent X-ALD-related neurodegeneration in the mouse. In the search for specific roles of Abcd 2, we screened fatty acid profiles in organs and primary neurons of mutant knockout mice lacking Abcd 2 in basal conditions and under dietary challenges. Our results indicate that ABCD 2 plays a role in the degradation of long-chain saturated and omega 9 -monounsaturated fatty acids and in the synthesis of docosahexanoic acid (DHA). Also, we demonstrated a defective VLCFA beta-oxidation ex vivo in brain slices of Abcd 1 and Abcd 2 knockouts, using radiolabeled <b>hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and the precursor of DHA as substrates.

We have studied interactions of 13 C-enriched HA with model membranes (phospholipid bilayer vesicles) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by 13 C NMR spectroscopy to compare properties of HA with those of typical dietary fatty acids. In phospholipid bilayers the carboxyl group of HA is localized in the aqueous interface, with an apparent pKa (7. 4) similar to other fatty acids; the acyl chain must then penetrate very deeply into the membrane. Desorption of HA from vesicles (t 1 + 2 = 3 h) is orders of magnitude slower than shorter chain fatty acids. In mixtures of vesicles and BSA, HA partitions much more favorably to phospholipid bilayers than typical fatty acids. BSA binds a maximum of only 1 mole of HA at one binding site. Calorimetric experiments show strong perturbations of acyl chains of phospholipids by HA. We predict that disruptive effects of VLCFA on cell membrane structure and function may explain the neurological manifestations of ALD patients. These effects will be further amplified by slow desorption of VLCFA from membranes and by the ineffective binding to serum albumin...|$|E

Four kinds of MWCNTs (Aldrich 636843, 636495, 636509, and 636819) of different lengths and diameters were tested using the developed technique.

Thermal inactivation of InhA in M. smegmatis resulted in the inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis, a decrease in hexadecanoic acid (C 16 : 0) and a concomitant increase of tetracosanoic acid (C 24 : 0) in a manner equivalent to that seen in INH-treated cells. Similarly, INH treatment of Mycobacterium bovis BCG caused an inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis, a decrease in C 16 : 0, and a concomitant accumulation of C 26 : 0. Moreover, the InhA-inactivated cells, like INH-treated cells, underwent a drastic morphological change, leading to cell lysis. These data show that InhA inactivation, alone, is sufficient to induce the accumulation of saturated fatty acids, cell wall alterations, and cell lysis and are consistent with InhA being a primary target of INH...|$|E
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the ability to}} detect changes in both quantity and spatial distribution of human stratum corneum (SC) lipids from samples collected in vivo. The SC functions as the predominant barrier to the body, protecting against the penetration of xenobiotic substances. Changes to the SC lipid composition {{have been associated with}} barrier impairment and consequent skin disorders and it is therefore important to monitor and quantify changes to this structure. This work {{demonstrates the}} first reported use of time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to assess physiological changes to human SC as a function of depth. This technique provides exceptional sensitivity and chemical specificity, al-lowing analysis of single tape stripped samples taken from volunteers. Using this methodology we were able to successfully identify chemical differences in human SC resulting from both intrinsic and extrinsic (photo) aging. Samples were collected from women of two age groups (under 27 and post-menopausal) and from two body sites with varying UV exposure (inner forearm and dorsal hand) and differences were identified using multivariate data analysis. The key finding was the signifi-cant aged-related increase and change in spatial distribution of the sterol cholesterol sulfate, a membrane stabilizing lipid. Significant changes in the prevalence of both lignoceric acid (C 24 : 0) and <b>hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 26 : 0) were also observed. This work describes previously unreported age-related chemical changes to human SC, providing an insight into aging mechanisms which may improve the design of both pharmaceutical and cosmetic topical products...|$|E
40|$|X−linked {{adrenoleukodystrophy}} {{is a rare}} inherited demyelinating disorder {{characterized by}} an abnormal accumulation of very long chain fatty acids, mainly <b>hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (26 : 0), due to a mutation of the gene encoding for a peroxisomal membrane protein. The only available, and partially effective, therapeutic treatment consists of dietary intake of a 4 : 1 mixture of triolein and trierucin, called Lorenzo’s oil (LO), targeted to inhibit the elongation of docosanoic acid (22 : 0) to 26 : 0. In this study we tested whether, besides inhibiting elongation, an enhancement of peroxisomal beta oxidation induced by conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), will improve somatosensory evoked potentials and modify inflammatory markers in adrenoleukodystrophy females carriers. We enrolled five heterozygous women. They received a mixture of LO (40 g/day) with CLA (5 g/day) for 2 months. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by the means of plasma levels of 26 : 0, 26 : 0 / 22 : 0 ratio, modification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers and somatosensory evoked potentials. Changes of fatty acid profile, and in particular CLA incorporation, were also evaluated in CSF and plasma. The results showed that CLA promptly passes the blood brain barrier and the mixture was able to lower both 26 : 0 and 26 : 0 / 22 : 0 ratio in plasma. The mixture improved somatosensory evoked potentials, which were previously found unchanged or worsened with dietary LO alone, and reduced IL- 6 levels in CSF in three out of five patients. Our {{data suggest that the}} synergic activity of CLA and LO, by enhancing peroxisomal beta-oxidation and preventing 26 : 0 formation, improves the somatosensory evoked potentials and reduces neuroinflammation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The triatomine bugs are vectors of the {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative {{agent of}} Chagas disease. Aggregation behavior {{plays an important}} role in their survival by facilitating the location of refuges and cohesion of aggregates, helping to keep them safely assembled into shelters during daylight time, when they are vulnerable to predators. There are evidences that aggregation is mediated by thigmotaxis, by volatile cues from their faeces, and by hexane-extractable contact chemoreceptive signals from their cuticle surface. The epicuticular lipids of Triatoma infestans include a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, free and esterified fatty acids, alcohols, and sterols. Results We analyzed the response of T. infestans fifth instar nymphs after exposure to different amounts either of total epicuticular lipid extracts or individual lipid fractions. Assays were performed in a circular arena, employing a binary choice test with filter papers acting as aggregation attractive sites; papers were either impregnated with a hexane-extract of the total lipids, or lipid fraction; or with the solvent. Insects were significantly aggregated around papers impregnated with the epicuticular lipid extracts. Among the lipid fractions separately tested, only the free fatty acid fraction promoted significant bug aggregation. We also investigated the response to different amounts of selected fatty acid components of this fraction; receptiveness varied with the fatty acid chain length. No response was elicited by hexadecanoic acid (C 16 : 0), the major fatty acid component. Octadecanoic acid (C 18 : 0) showed a significant assembling effect in the concentration range tested (0. 1 to 2 insect equivalents). The very long chain <b>hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 26 : 0) was significantly attractant at low doses (≤ 1 equivalent), although a repellent effect was observed at higher doses. Conclusion The detection of contact aggregation pheromones has practical application in Chagas disease vector control. These data may be used to help design new tools against triatomine bugs. </p...|$|E
40|$|The WHO {{declared}} tuberculosis (TB) {{a global}} emergency. An estimated 8 - 9 million new cases occur each year with 2 - 3 million deaths. Currently, TB is diagnosed mostly by chest-X ray and staining of the mycobacteria in sputum with a detection limit of 1 x 104 bacteria /ml. There is {{an urgent need}} for better diagnostic tools for TB especially for developing countries. We have validated the electronic nose from TD Technology {{for the detection of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis by headspace analysis of 284 sputum samples from TB patients. We used linear discriminant function analysis resulting in a sensitivity of 75 % a specificity of 67 % and an accuracy of 69 %. Further research is still required to improve the results by choosing more selective sensors and sampling techniques. We used a fast gas chromatography- mass spectrometry method (GC-MS). The automated procedure is based on the injection of sputum samples which are methylated inside the GC injector using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM-GC-MS). <b>Hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> in combination with tuberculostearic acid was found to be specific for the presence of M. tuberculosis. The detection limit was similar to microscopy. We found no false positives, all microscopy and culture positive samples were also found positive with the THM-GC-MS method. The detection of ribosomal RNA from the infecting organism offers great potential since rRNA molecules outnumber chromosomal DNA by a factor 1000. It thus may possible to detect the organism without amplification of the nucleic acids (NA). We used a capture and a tagged detector probe for the direct detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum. So far the detection limit is 1 x 106 bacteria / ml. Currently we are testing a Lab-On-A-Chip Interferometer detection system. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). Conference Pape...|$|E
40|$|Profiles of {{saturated}} very-long-chain (> C 22) fatty acids were studied in plasma, fibroblasts, erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes of patients affected by peroxisomal {{disorders such as}} Zellweger syndrome, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), and classic rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) and in controls. In Zellweger patients, the concentration of <b>hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 26 : 0) and the C 26 : 0 /C 22 : 0 ratio are greatly increased in plasma and fibroblasts. However, the plasma concentration of docosanoic acid (C 22 : 0) is greatly decreased. Also in platelets, leukocytes, {{and to a lesser}} extent erythrocytes, the C 26 : 0 concentrations and both the C 26 : 0 /C 22 : 0 and C 24 : 0 /C 22 : 0 ratios are greatly increased. The C 24 : 0 /C 22 : 0 ratio is significantly increased in plasma, platelets, and leukocytes, but not in erythrocytes. In X-ALD, the C 26 : 0 concentration and the C 26 : 0 /C 22 : 0 and C 24 : 0 /C 22 : 0 ratios are significantly increased in plasma, fibroblasts, platelets, and leukocytes, but the erythrocytes show substantial overlap in the 5 - 90 % ranges between controls and patients. In RCDP, slightly increased C 26 : 0 and C 26 : 0 /C 22 : 0 ratios are found in erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes, but not in plasma and fibroblasts. We conclude that plasma and fibroblasts are the specimens of choice for biochemical diagnosis of Zellweger syndrome and X-ALD, respectively. The slight increase in C 26 : 0 in blood cells of RCDP patients suggests a decreased flux of very-long-chain fatty acids through the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway in liver in this genetic disorde...|$|E
40|$|Mutation of the ECERIFERUM 9 (CER 9) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) causes {{elevated}} {{amounts of}} 18 -carbon-length cutin monomers and a dramatic {{shift in the}} cuticular wax profile (especially on leaves) toward the very-long-chain free fatty acids tetracosanoic acid (C 24) and <b>hexacosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 26). Relative to the wild type, cer 9 mutants exhibit elevated cuticle membrane thickness over epidermal cells and cuticular ledges with increased occlusion of the stomatal pore. The cuticular phenotypes of cer 9 are associated with delayed onset of wilting in plants experiencing water deficit, lower transpiration rates, and improved water use efficiency measured as carbon isotope discrimination. The CER 9 protein thus encodes a novel determinant of plant drought tolerance-associated traits, one whose deficiency elevates cutin synthesis, redistributes wax composition, and suppresses transpiration. Map-based cloning identified CER 9, and sequence analysis predicted that it encodes an E 3 ubiquitin ligase homologous to yeast Doa 10 (previously shown to target endoplasmic reticulum proteins for proteasomal degradation). To further elucidate CER 9 function, the impact of CER 9 deficiency on interactions with other genes was examined using double mutant and transcriptome analyses. For both wax and cutin, cer 9 showed mostly additive effects with cer 6, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (lacs 1), and lacs 2 and revealed its role in early steps of both wax and cutin synthetic pathways. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the cer 9 mutation affected diverse cellular processes, with primary impact on genes associated with diverse stress responses. The discovery of CER 9 lays new groundwork for developing novel cuticle-based strategies for improving the drought tolerance and water use efficiency of crop plants. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.
