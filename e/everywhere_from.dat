500|$|Rupert was {{accordingly}} {{a prominent}} figure in Parliamentary propaganda. He faced numerous accusations of witchcraft, either personally or by proxy through his pet dog. Boy, sometimes called Pudel; {{a large white}} hunting poodle, accompanied Rupert <b>everywhere</b> <b>from</b> 1642 up until the dog's death at Marston Moor and was widely suspected of being a witch's familiar. There were numerous accounts of Boy's abilities; some suggested {{that he was the}} Devil in disguise, come to help Rupert. Pro-Royalist publications ultimately produced parodies of these, including one which listed Rupert's dog as being a [...] "Lapland Lady" [...] transformed into a white dog; Boy was able, apparently, to find hidden treasure, possessed invulnerability to attack, could catch bullets fired at Rupert in his mouth, and could prophesy as well as the 16th century soothsayer, Mother Shipton. Similar stories from the period relate to Rupert's pet monkey. [...] Like his dog, the monkey was featured in newsprint of the day and was also reputed to have shape shifting powers, being able to disguise itself behind enemy lines.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons {{was a hit}} for Fox Broadcasting Company {{from the}} start and the network {{instantly}} received hundreds of requests from sellers wanting to create merchandise based on the show, such as clothing, alarm clocks, bubble gum, notebooks, posters, and air fresheners. The merchandise was highly successful, generating an estimated US$750 million in revenue {{during the first year}} of sales. As commented by AllMusic reviewer Jason Ankeny, [...] "an LP proved inevitable" [...] when, after the series premiere, [...] "the characters' licensed images were <b>everywhere</b> <b>from</b> T-shirts to action figures". In 1990, David Geffen, founder of the record label Geffen Records, decided to record an album featuring characters from The Simpsons. His idea was approved by Fox and The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, and the show's writers were assigned to write original, humorous lyrics for the cast members to perform. The finished result became the hip-hop blues album The Simpsons Sing the Blues, released in December 1990. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in February 1991.|$|E

500|$|To win the election, Whig leaders {{decided they}} had to {{mobilize}} people across the country, including women, who could not then vote. [...] This {{was the first time}} that an American political party included women in campaign activities on a widespread scale, and women in Tyler's Virginia were active on his behalf. The party hoped to avoid issues and win through public enthusiasm, with torchlight processions and alcohol-fueled political rallies. The interest in the campaign was unprecedented, with many public events. When the Democratic press depicted Harrison as an old soldier, who would turn aside from his campaign if given a barrel of hard cider to drink in his log cabin, the Whigs eagerly seized on the image, and the log cabin campaign was launched. The fact that Harrison lived on a palatial estate along the Ohio River and that Tyler was well-to-do were ignored, while log cabin images appeared <b>everywhere,</b> <b>from</b> banners to whiskey bottles. Cider was the favored beverage of many farmers and tradesmen, and Whigs claimed that Harrison preferred that drink of the common man. Democrats complained that the Harrison/Tyler campaign's liberal provision of hard cider at rallies was encouraging drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|After {{these two}} {{relatively}} underdistributed albums, Bleeding Through signed {{to a larger}} label, Trustkill Records in 2003, releasing their third full-length album in September of the same year. Promoting the Ulrich Wild produced This is Love, This is Murderous they embarked upon US nationwide touring, opening for AFI. These dates had propelled the band to national attention albeit for all the wrong reasons. Traveling from Utah to a show in Colorado the group's vehicle hit black ice on the highway, {{spinning out of control}} and slamming into a truck that was already flipped over. A mobile TV unit, there to report on another crash, caught the entire incident on film as their equipment trailer rolled and exploded, showering their instruments and gear across the road. Fortunately the band escaped with only minor injuries (Johnson had a minor cut on his head), but due to this accident they had to drop off the [...] "Pure Hatred" [...] tour with Chimaira, Soilwork and As I Lay Dying.

500|$|His {{position}} persuaded MTV {{to begin}} airing [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and later [...] "Beat It", (along with Prince's [...] "Little Red Corvette") {{which led to}} a long partnership and later helped other black music artists to gain mainstream recognition. MTV denies claims of racism in their broadcasting. The popularity of his videos, such as [...] "Beat It" [...] and [...] "Billie Jean", helped to place the young channel [...] "on the map" [...] and MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R Jackson transformed the medium of music video into an art form and promotional tool through the use of complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and cameo appearances by well known personalities. When the 14-minute-long Thriller video aired, MTV ran it twice an hour to meet demand. The short film marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been routinely named the best music video ever. The popularity of the video sent the album back to number one in the album chart, but Jackson's label did not support the release of the third music video from the album. They were already pleased with its success, so Jackson convinced MTV to fund the project. Author, music critic and journalist Nelson George wrote in 2004, [...] "It's difficult to hear the songs from Thriller and disengage them from the videos. For most of us the images define the songs. In fact {{it could be argued that}} Michael is the first artist of the MTV age to have an entire album so intimately connected in the public imagination with its imagery". Short films like Thriller largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in [...] "Beat It" [...] has been frequently imitated.
