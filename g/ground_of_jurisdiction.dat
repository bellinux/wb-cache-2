Prior Work This work extends previous works {{on the nature of}} legal pluralism in Nigeria and how Nigerian courts interpret and develop this area of the law. Approach: Available literature as well as primary documents was used to the objectives of the study. Implications: This work is of value to academics and judges interested in the growth and development of customary law in particular and legal pluralism in Nigeria in general. Value: This paper suggests that a general omnibus jurisdictional clause should be expansively interpreted by Nigerian courts to recognise all issues concerning customary law as proper for appellate courts because this will tremendously assist the growth and development of customary law in Nigeria...|$|E

Moreover, this paper sustains that a careful and holistic interpretation of the text of the Regulation and a proper analysis of the function of this ground of international jurisdiction leads to a surprising conclusion, i. e., the concept of the “habitual residence” is not as complex and difficult to specify as, at first glance, it might appear...|$|E

(International Commercial Law) Legal judgements against {{unsuccessful}} {{defendants are}} handed down {{around the world}} on a daily basis, but their enforcement can become a complicated matter when the enforcement of the judgement must occur outside the territorial boundaries of the state from which it emanates. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine the enforceability of judgements of the European courts whereby the jurisdiction of the court was determined in terms of Brussels I. This paper begins with an in-depth discussion of the principles of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements and the purpose it serves within the context of private international law. The second chapter discusses recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements in South Africa. The requirements and the criteria necessary to fulfil such requirements will be discussed under this heading. The third chapter considers the various grounds of jurisdiction available to the plaintiff in approaching a court of a European Union State. Each ground will be followed by a discussion on the enforceability of a judgement, founded on such a <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> in terms of the South African principles of recognition and enforcements of foreign judgements and whether the requirements discussed in the preceding chapter have been met.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{approach}} of the European Union Private International Law (EU PIL) to the allocation of jurisdiction among Member States in relation to cross-border online copyright infringements. The advent of the Internet has given rise to new challenges for PIL. The cyberspace calls for clear rules aimed to determine which national court may exercise jurisdiction over a cross-border online copyright infringement. Taking the EU law response to such challenges as a case-study, the essay describes the relevant jurisdictional rules laid down in Regulation EU No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis). Secondly, the paper examines the Pinckney and Hejduk cases where the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) attempted to adapt the special forum of former Article 5 (3) of Regulation EC No 44 / 2001 (Brussels I), now Article 7 (2) of Brussels I-bis Regulation, to the peculiarities of online copyright infringements. The Author criticizes the solutions achieved by the CJEU, stressing, in particular, the risks of adopting the accessibility criterion as a general <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> for violations committed through the Internet. The study shows that the special jurisdictional rule of locus commissi delicti is not suitable for online infringements. For the purposes of foreseeability and legal certainty, it would be desirable to shift from a CJEU's case-by-case approach to a comprehensive and coherent legislative framework. The Author concludes that {{it is time for the}} EU legislator to include in Brussels I-bis Regulation a special jurisdictional rule for all types of online torts. The new provision should be inspired by the proximity principle, in order to overcome the difficulties arising from the localization of the locus delicti within the cyberspace...|$|E

In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, [...] "forced disappearances" [...] or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial.

Article 7 (4), inter alia, enables “(A) person domiciled in a Member State to be sued {{in the courts}} of another Member State [*][…][*]as regards a civil claim for the recovery, based on ownership, of a cultural object as defined in point 1 of Article 1 of Directive [93 / 7 /EEC] initiated by the person claiming the right to recover such an object, in the courts for {{the place where the}} cultural object is situated at the time when the court is seised”.

40|$|It {{has become}} a trend today that states adopt {{universal}} jurisdiction in their domestic law. At the same time, the actual exercise <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> has often led to a dispute among states. While there are many ‘international’ aspects relating to this phenomenon, {{there is still no}} consensus among international scholars even over the scope of crimes that are subject to universal jurisdiction, let alone the modalities of its exercise. This confusion is caused by the way in which jurisdiction is conceptualized: while prevailing view sees jurisdiction as a right or entitlement attributed by international law, this view is premised on a particular understanding of the legal system <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> that sees it as a set of permissive rules of international law. However, it may not capture the reality <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> where international law does not always regulate the assertion <b>of</b> prescriptive <b>jurisdiction,</b> while the actual exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is still subject to several restraint either in relation to other states or with regard to the rights of accused individuals. Against this background, Part I of the dissertation re-examines the legal system <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and applies it to the specific framework <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction.</b> First, this study seeks to find the elements that actually restraint the exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in general. It concludes that the exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> should be examined from the perspective of whether and to what extent it may secure effectiveness of enforcement, legitimacy (necessity) of claim, and foreseeability of law and forum. Building on this analysis, this study further seeks for a justifying <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> by applying the general framework <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> It is suggested that at least the legitimacy (necessity) of claim is provided by the fact that states have been less interested in tolerating impunity for certain types of international crimes and also been more aware of the necessity for the exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in order to compensate for the failure of territorial or national states of the offender in the suppression of these crimes With those insights, Part II further explores a framework in which the conflict resulting from the concurrent claims <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> The focus is on the idea of subsidiarity, which designates universal jurisdiction as a default mechanism. While this idea has been gaining support, it is pointed out that the feasibility of subsidiarity depends on how situations of inability and unwillingness are identified in a decentralized discourse. Regarding this, this study argues that the notion of obligation to prosecute can play a key role: a state of non-performance of obligation to prosecute can be conceived as an abusive use of power on the part of territorial or national states, thereby vesting the assessment of inability and unwillingness with certain objectivity. This provides a ground for legal discourse between territorial or national states and states exercising universal jurisdiction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{contemporary}} economy the {{more and more}} greater role is played by {{state and local government}} institutions.

40|$|Despite all the {{attention}} it receives from both its supporters and critics, universal <b>jurisdiction</b> remains one <b>of</b> the more confused doctrines of international law. Indeed, while commentary has focused largely and unevenly on policy and normative arguments either favoring or undercutting the desirability of its exercise, a straightforward legal analysis breaking down critical aspects of this extraordinary form <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> remains conspicuously missing. Yet universal jurisdiction’s increased practice by states calls out for such a clear descriptive understanding. This Essay engages this under-treated area. It offers to explicate a basic, but overlooked, feature {{of the law of}} universal jurisdiction: If national courts prosecute on <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction,</b> they must use the international legal definitions—contained in customary international law—of the universal crimes they adjudicate; otherwise their exercise <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> contradicts the very international law upon which it purports to rely. The Essay argues that this legal feature derives from the distinctively symbiotic nature <b>of</b> universal prescriptive <b>jurisdiction</b> (the power to apply law to certain persons or things) and universal adjudicative jurisdiction (the power to subject certain persons or things to judicial process). Unlike other bases <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in international law, the prescriptive substance <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> authorizes and circumscribes universal adjudicative jurisdiction; it defines not only the universal crimes themselves, but also the judicial competence for all courts wishing to exercise universal jurisdiction. The Essay looks to chart out some important implications of this thesis for the real-world practice of universal jurisdiction; it evaluates how most easily to determine the customary definitions of universal crimes, to detect breaches of international law by courts that manipulate subjectively those definitions, and to enforce against such illicit manipulation. The Essay contends that while some definitional aspects invariably remain to be ironed out by state practice, the provisions of widely-ratified and longstanding international treaties provide generally the best record of the core customary definitions of universal crimes, and accordingly supply not only a harmonized point of departure for courts wishing properly to exercise universal jurisdiction, but also a useful means for detecting breaches of international law by overzealous courts seeking only to exploit universal jurisdiction for purely political or sensationalist ends. The framework presented thus addresses concerns that universal jurisdiction hazards unbridled abuse. As the Essay argues, the law <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> does not; rather, it prescribes legal limits. And the Essay concludes that in the end these limits are enforced not by those states exercising universal jurisdiction, but rather by other jurisdictionally-interested states—that is, most often by those states whose national citizens are the subject <b>of</b> foreign universal <b>jurisdiction</b> proceedings...|$|R

With the help of Worcester and his sponsor, the American Board, they made a plan to fight the encroachment by using the courts. They {{wanted to take a}} case to the US Supreme Court to define the relationship between the federal and state governments, and establish the sovereignty of the Cherokee nation. No other civil authority would support Cherokee sovereignty to their land and self-government in their territory. Hiring William Wirt, a former U.S. Attorney General, the Cherokee tried to argue their position before the US Supreme Court in Georgia v. Tassel (the court granted a writ of error for a Cherokee convicted in a Georgia court for a murder occurring in Cherokee territory, though the state refused to accept the writ) and Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) (the court dismissed this on technical <b>grounds</b> for lack <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction).</b> [...] In writing the majority opinion, Chief Justice Marshall described the Cherokee Nation as a [...] "domestic dependent nation" [...] with no rights binding on a state.|$|R

Economic interdependence has prompted states to regulate transactions occurring outside their borders, but states with concurrent jurisdiction over the same matters have often resisted these assertions <b>of</b> extraterritorial <b>jurisdiction</b> on the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> territorial sovereignty. European states, for example, have vociferously protested the extraterritorial provisions of the Reagan administration 2 ̆ 7 s pipeline regulations and the recent Cuban embargo legislation, known as the Helms-Burton Act.

40|$|Both the US and the EU are {{systems in}} which the law on {{international}} {{jurisdiction in civil matters}} shows a certain degree of uniformity against a background of different state legislations in that field. There are substantial differences between the EU and the US concerning the means used to create uniform standards or rules on jurisdiction and the scope of uniform law. Personal jurisdiction in the US is considered a constitutional issue and the key factor of uniformity is the case-law of the US Supreme Court concerning the limits imposed by the constitutional due process clause on state legislation. Those standards are mandatory to federal and state courts and they apply both to purely international cases and to US interstate cases. Moreover, they apply regardless of the nationality and domicile of the parties, even if those factors are not located in the US. However, the standards developed by the Supreme Court on personal jurisdiction are vague and the application of those standards by state courts has proven a source of uncertainty and complex litigation in many cases. There are almost no federal rules on personal jurisdiction and the long-arm statues enacted by most States are intended to reach the limits of due process and therefore they do not provide further legal certainty. In contrast with that approach, the EU has focused on uniformization by means of the enactment of common rules on jurisdiction which contribute to the mutual recognition of judgments between Member States and become a key factor to guarantee the proper functioning of the internal market and to achieve further integration in the EU. This approach is based on rules which set out common <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> that must be applied in a uniform way in all Member States in order to provide a high level of legal certainty. To achieve that goal the ECJ case-law interpreting the unified rules plays an essential role. Legal certainty is a key objective of the unified rules on jurisdiction {{as a consequence of the}} role assigned to those rules in the integration process. The EU approach to international jurisdiction based on comprehensive legislative rules has advantages when compared with the US situation especially in the context of legal integration, as American scholars have acknowledged. However, the further development of the EU model should improve some of its features which are neither positive nor necessary to achieve the goals assigned to the uniform jurisdictional rules in the integration process. The development of common standards on procedural fairness in the EU should require the revision of some discriminatory aspects. Especially the application of the exorbitant fora established in the legislations of some Member States (Annex I Regulation 44 / 2001) to persons not domiciled in the EU and the prohibition <b>of</b> review <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the court of origin in the recognition of judgments should be reviewed. Moreover, the coexistence in the EU model of uniform rules of universal scope (such as Regulation 44 / 2001 and 2201 / 2003) with national rules which only are applied by reference of the uniform rules (art. 4 Regulation 44 / 2001 and art. 14 Regulation 2201 / 2003 concerning residual jurisdiction) is a factor of additional complexity, which could be overcome if the uniform rules were to be applied to all situations, removing totally national rules in the unified areas. That development would be in accordance with the nature of the EU Regulations in this field –especially Regulation 44 / 2001 - as a unified and coherent system <b>of</b> rules on <b>jurisdiction,</b> as acknowledged by the ECJ in his Opinion 1 / 03 of February 7 2006 in order to establish that the conclusion of international agreements on jurisdiction in the areas covered by the regulations falls entirely within the exclusive competence of the EC.

To this effect, it analyses the regime determined under treaty law, customary law and {{general principles of law}} for the prosecution of core crimes. It examines whether the prohibition to commit core crimes embodies jus cogens and, if so, what consequences derive therefrom for the duty to prosecute perpetrators. Further, considering that the ICC was established in order to fill in lacunae of accountability derived from States’ unwillingness or inability to prosecute, the thesis scrutinizes the jurisdictional framework established by the Statute, in particular the principle of complementarity. On the basis of the study undertaken, it is argued that complementarity as determined in the Rome Statute is a specific materialization of a broader concept of complementarity. The thesis concludes that core crimes law has been motioned forth by the principle of substantive complementarity, which binds the custodial State to prosecute, where extradition is not feasible and international jurisdiction cannot step in, if necessary on <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction.</b> Finally, taking into account that the Statute of Rome articulates the mandate of the Court with the authority of the SC to maintain international peace and security, the thesis proposes a model of coordination of the competences of States, the ICC and the UN political organ, in accordance with the law of the Charter, the Rome Statute and peremptory norms of the international community. Against this backdrop, a systematic framework of the duty to prosecute core crimes is submitted, such that sovereignty and the principle mandating the fight against impunity are operatively reconciled...|$|R
