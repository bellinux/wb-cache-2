50|$|Care must {{be taken}} when {{controlling}} most double acting telescopic design cylinders. The effective retraction area is often {{much less than the}} extension area. Thus if the <b>hydraulic</b> fluid <b>return</b> line is blocked during extension apressure intensifying effect can occur causing seal failure or even causing the metal sleeve to balloon outward. The cylinder could thus be rendered unable to retract because of failed seals or jam in position due to binding.|$|R
50|$|Top-{{carriage}} recoil {{is where}} the gun is mounted in an upper carriage that moves on wheels on fixed rails. The gun and upper carriage recoil together, restrained by the usual <b>hydraulic</b> buffers. <b>Return</b> to battery is effected either by gravity, {{through the use of}} inclined rails, which the gun and carriage have run up, by springs, or even by rubber bands, on some improvised mounts. It is not well-suited to firing at high elevations because it cannot absorb much of the vertical component of the recoil force.|$|R

During this time he learned that there was a dearth of practical understanding of <b>hydraulic</b> engineering. He <b>returned</b> home and took up practice with his father, learning about hydraulic engineering by apprenticeship. By 1910 he had founded his own firm and become an associate member of the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|R
50|$|Many {{forms of}} energy {{production}} through fossil fuels are highly polluting {{in addition to being}} water intensive, especially extraction from tar sands and shale and extraction through <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing. Further, <b>return</b> flows from power plants to rivers are warmer than the water that was taken in and/or are highly polluted and can consequently compromise other downstream usage, including ecosystems. Conversely, energy is needed for extracting, transporting, distributing and treating water. Energy intensity for accessing a cubic meter of water varies: logically, accessing local surface water requires far less energy than pumping groundwater, reclaiming wastewater or desalinating seawater. Irrigation is more energy intensive than rain-fed agriculture, and drip irrigation is more intensive yet since the water must be pressurized.|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{design of}} a tilting weir is presented, which allows for periodic exchange of potadromous fish between freshwater ecosystems. The application domain includes inland waters {{that need to be}} isolated hydraulically, preserving the existing ecological connection with the surrounding areas as much as possible. In the absence of a hydraulic gradient, the weir is opened in its neutral position and fish can bypass through passages sideways of the weir. When a hydraulic gradient develops in either of two directions, the weir rotates until a new balance of moments of force is reached, while fish can still bypass. Above a threshold value of the hydraulic gradient, the weir falls shut. When the <b>hydraulic</b> gradient <b>returns</b> to zero, the weir reopens, restoring the ecological connection. Four variants of the weir were investigated in the Hydraulics Laboratory at Wageningen University. The versatility of the design is demonstrated by showing that the hydraulic gradients required for closure and reopening can be manipulated largely independently. Patterns of flow velocity and turbulence kinetic energy were analyzed, which suggest that relevant fish species can bypass the weir unimpeded. The effectiveness of the weir will mainly depend on hydrostatic aspects, which determine when the weir is opened and closed, and on the absence of large hydraulic gradients in the migration season...|$|R
40|$|Trickling-filter se'wage {{purification}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} methods of artifi-cial biological 'waste-'water treatment. Its specific advantages still justify its use, in spite of the rapid development and extension of the activated sludge process. The biological trickling filter as a biochemical reactor is not yet utilized at full capacity. Its construction and operation are expected to undergo further development [I]. The trickling filter operation. of common knowledge, has been treated in several Hungarian and foreign puhlications. Essentials of the processes a~. for example, making allo'wance for the actual influence of temperature. hydraulic and organic loads and intensity variation, character of hiochemical processes inside the trickling filter. the mass of microorganisms, transport and adsorption of oxygen and nutrients as well as the time of contact bet'ween organic matters in solution and in suspension and the biological film have not yet heen cleared [2]. Factors affecting the trickling-filter sewage treatment processes similarly to the activated sludge process, are: nature of sewage to be degraded (quantity, quality), rate and evenness of <b>hydraulic</b> load (<b>return</b> sludge percentage, sewage distrihution). degradation oxygen supply (availahle and consumed). quantity and quality of microorganisms (biological film) performing degradation, temperature conditions (of sewage and atmosphere), operational conditions (filter change, elastic change of load, function in the treatment process) [3, 4]. As seen from the high number of factors, simulation of the process of trickling-filter sewage treatment by exact mathematical models would he rathe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{first attempt to}} estimate future groundwater levels by applying extreme value statistics on predictions from a hydrological model. Climate for the future period, 2081 – 2100, are represented by projections from nine combinations of three global climate models and six regional climate models, and downscaled with two different methods. An integrated surface water/groundwater model is forced with precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration from the 18 model – and downscaling combinations. Extreme value analyses are performed on the hydraulic head changes from a control period (1991 – 2010) to the future period for the 18 combinations. <b>Hydraulic</b> heads for <b>return</b> periods of 21, 50 and 100 yr (T 21 &ndash; 100 ) are estimated. Three uncertainty sources are evaluated; climate models, downscaling and extreme value statistics. Of these sources, downscaling dominates for the higher return periods of 50 and 100 yr, whereas uncertainty from climate models and downscaling are similar for lower return periods. Uncertainty from the extreme value statistics only contribute up to around 10 % of the uncertainty from the three sources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{conception}} {{and the model}} of hydraulic single-acting valve drive for internal combustion engines. This drive should give free control for valve lift, valve opening and valve closing time. It consists of parts: electric control valve and hydraulic actuator, whose piston is connected with engine valve and return spring. One of the basic components of high pressure HEUI injector for the Diesel engine – electric valve with solenoid was chosen as electric control valve. Principle of operation, physical and mathematical model of this drive is to be presented in this paper. Presented model consists of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic subsystems: slide of control valve with solenoid coil, power piston of <b>hydraulic</b> actuator with <b>return</b> spring and <b>hydraulic</b> components. Describe the dynamic behaviour of the solenoid was based on non-linear magnetic circuit model. Movement of valve slide and power piston of actuator {{was based on the}} motion equation. Description of hydraulic subsystems was based of one-dimensional, compressible flow model. After full system identification basic parameters of this drive (like supply oil pressure or valve lift) will be calculated and analyzed for better load exchange in internal combustion engines...|$|R
40|$|New Profile for the Amsterdam-Rhinecanal The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a new profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The new profile needs to be well navigable and {{requires}} to have stable bank constructions. Simultaneously several social aspects {{have to be taken}} into consideration. The assignment is summarized as follows: Design a new profile of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal with a stable bank protection that takes future developments, durability and recreation into consideration. The history of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal shows that the draft of the vessels that use this canal has increased from 3. 30 to 4. 00 meters. This four-metre draft has been permitted since 1988 and was based on the dimensions of the push tow units. In the late 90 s of the past century, a new generation of inland vessels made its appearance. Around 2002 problems to the bank constructions due to erosion were detected for the first time, possibly caused by the new generation inland vessels. The number of bigger inland vessels, particularly those in the VIa category has strongly increased over the past years together with the engine power and cargo capacity of many vessels (increase in scale). A representative canal section of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal, just north of Breukelen, has been chosen as research site. At this location erosion ranges from 0. 20 to 1. 70 meters within 15 meters distance of the sheet piles. The possible cause of this erosion has been further investigated in this report. Also research has been done to determine the governing hydraulic load, which is generated by governing vessels overtaking another vessel. The governing situation is defined as follows: a Rijnmaxship (135 x 17 x 4. 00 m) overtaking a four barge push-towing vessel (198 x 22. 8 x 4. 00 m). In this situation, the return current is governing compared to a situation when loads from the main and bow thrusters are considered. The return current has been calculated with the 1 D model DIPRO. DIPRO has also been used to validate the 2 D model in Delft 3 D, to further elaborate the return current in the 2 D model. The 2 D model in Delft 3 D has been used to determine the maximum return currents around the two governing vessels. These values have been translated {{to the bottom of the}} canal by calculating the erosion. From these results can be concluded that canal profile (2) has twice the amount of erosion compared to canal profile (3). In this report canal profile (3) is recommended as the new normative canal profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. Canal profile (3) is a combination of a box profile with a sloped upper bank and bottom, with in the middle a waterdepth of 7. 60 meter. The depth in front of the sheet pile is 6. 00 meter. The wet cross section is 751 m 2. The bank construction consists of a sheet pile with a slope. The outcome of this thesis is a design for a new representative canal profile in the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The normative <b>hydraulic</b> load (<b>return</b> current) causes minimum erosion to the canal bottom, which keeps the bank construction stable. Next to this the design proves that environmental and recreational purposes can be well combined in coherence with social developments.
