40|$|In {{this paper}} I review {{aggregate}} spatial <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> health care. This is a neglected {{area in the}} study of employment change. Although much attention has been given recently to the producer services sector, in numerical terms the health-care sector is a major employer and, locally, can provide a substantial proportion of jobs within individual labour markets. I first consider regional <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> health-care <b>employment</b> over time, and then disaggregate these, where possible, by grade of staff. The contribution of health care to total employment is then examined for standard regions and also for travel-to-work-areas (TTWAs). Possible interpretations of these changes are then discussed. Four interrelated factors are implicated: the impact of the public expenditure policies of successive governments; the effect of policies designed to redistribute resources in the NHS; local decisions on the siting and closing of NHS hospitals; and the impact of private sector growth in health care. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} debate internationally and in South Africa {{about the extent}} to which a {{relative}} decline <b>in</b> manufacturing <b>employment</b> and rise <b>in</b> services <b>employment</b> can be accounted for by intersectoral outsourcing of jobs in the domestic economy.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} most {{important}} labour market trends {{of the past three}} years in Hungary. It relies on aggregate data and research studies. Its goal is to highlight {{the most important}} problems of the Hungarian labour market. It focuses on three major points. First, looking at <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment,</b> unemployment and non-participation, we discuss what may be the causes of the slowly increasing but still very low level of employment. We find that the most important problem of the Hungarian labour market is long-term discouraged unemployment, which has structural causes. We analyse the regional and sectoral <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment.</b> We document the deep regional divide within Hungary, which further increased in the recent three years. Second, we look at what might have caused earnings growth outpacing economic growth in the past few years. We discuss the effects of two significant policy meas-ures: the increase of the minimum wage in 2001 - 2002, and the increase of public sector wages at the end of 2002. Third, focusing on the returns to education, we find that the Hungarian labour force, on average, is still unskilled rather than overquali...|$|R

30|$|The {{question}} is now, {{how far the}} described changes {{in the composition of}} employment may have influenced the growth of nonstandard work arrangements. To deal with this, shift-share analyses are carried out providing the opportunity to decompose <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>employment</b> (Perloff et al. 1960; Hoffmann and Walwei 2003). They can be used in order to explore how far changes in the composition of employment or behavioural aspects have driven the development of work arrangements. Such an approach is promising because also multivariate analyses dealing with a decomposition of <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> work arrangements confirm previous findings of descriptive shift-share analyses (Klinger and Wolf 2011).|$|R
