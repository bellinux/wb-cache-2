On board were 15 {{passengers}} and five crew members. 90 minutes after departure flight 411 was cleared for approach into Manchester Airport. In low cloud and following a ground controlled approach the flight crew lowered the landing gear and turned into their final approach under visual control.

Yankee Clipper was carrying Froman and 38 others, and as the plane was banking into a <b>descending</b> <b>turn</b> for approach, the port wingtip caught a wave, whereupon it crashed into the Tagus River in Lisbon, Portugal. One of fifteen survivors, Froman sustained severe injuries: a cut below the left knee nearly severing her leg, multiple fractures of her right arm, and a compound fracture of her right leg that doctors threatened to amputate. Before flight, Froman had given her seat to another singer, Tamara Drasin, who was killed in the crash, an action which her biographer Ilene Stone said [...] "bothered her her whole life." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{test program}} at Goodyear's {{facilities}} near Wingfoot Lake, Akron, Ohio {{showed that the}} inflation could be accomplished with as little as 8 psi (544 mbar), less than a car tire. The flight test program had a fatal crash when Army aviator Lt. [...] "Pug" [...] Wallace was killed. The aircraft was in a <b>descending</b> <b>turn</b> {{when one of the}} control cables under the wing came off the pulley and was wedged in the pulley bracket, locking the stick. The turn tightened until one of the wings folded up over the propellor and was chopped up. With the wings flapping because of loss of air, one of the aluminum wing tip skids hit the pilot alongside the head, as was clear from marks on his helmet. Wallace was pitched out over the nose of the aircraft and fell into the shallow lake. His chute never opened. He may have been knocked unconscious and rendered unable to open it. Only 12 Goodyear Inflatoplanes were built, but development continued until the project was cancelled in 1973.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a physics-based method for synthesis of bird flight animations. Our method computes a realistic set of wingbeats that enables a bird {{to follow the}} specified trajectory. We model the bird as an articulated skeleton with elastically deformable feathers.

We solve for each wingbeat motion separately by optimizing for wingbeat parameters that create the most natural motion. The final animation is constructed by concatenating a series of optimal wingbeats. This detailed bird flight model enables us to produce flight motions of different birds performing a variety of maneuvers including taking off, cruising, rapidly <b>descending,</b> <b>turning,</b> and landing...|$|R
5000|$|Riders {{leave the}} station when the ride {{operator}} releases the pneumatic station brakes. The slight {{decline of the}} station allows the car to roll out down a small drop and around a declining 180 degree curve until the train reaches the chain lift. The lift operates at or near a speed of 5 mi/h km/h and ascends, at a 30-degree angle, an 85-foot (26 m) lift hill; then riders are dropped 65 ft at a 45-degree angle, gaining speed up to 48 m.p.h (77 km/h). The next element is a bunny hop, so named for the quick rise and fall. The end of this hill {{is lower than the}} beginning. It then goes through a vertical loop (Corkscrew opened only 7 days after the first modern coaster to feature a vertical loop, The New Revolution at Six Flags Magic Mountain). It then coasts up an incline. After a piece of flat track, the train curves around a 180-degree <b>descending</b> <b>turn,</b> heading into the twin corkscrews over the midway of the park. In the [...] "eye" [...] of the corkscrews, it is traveling at 38 mi/h km/h. It completes these two corkscrew loops, comes through trim and block brakes, and coasts back into the station.|$|E
40|$|When animals {{move around}} {{interacting}} with the environment, the nervous system has to solve several tasks simultaneously {{in order to produce}} and control the movements - notably propulsion, posture, balance, and associated movements. Basic motor tasks are controlled by neuronal networks organized into central pattern generators (CPGs) and reflexes, located in the spinal cord and brainstem. The overall aim of this work has been to study how supraspinal descending control systems for locomotion, including control of movement direction, and postural control interact with each other, and with the spinal locomotor CPG in order to produce purposeful and economic movements. Locomotion and postural corrections were studied in the lamprey, a lower vertebrate, in which the reticulospinal (RS) system is responsible for sensori-motor integration and descending control. Different aspects of locomotor activity - initiation, termination, and regulation of the intensity of locomotion, as well as steering and maintenance of a proper posture - were reflected in the activity of RS neurons in intact, freely swimming lampreys. In vitro studies have shown that groups of RS neurons in the middle and posterior rhombencephalic reticular nuclei are activated by vestibular and visual stimuli. Here, the activity of these neurons was correlated to the direction of fictive turns in a novel in vitro preparation. Commands for lateral turns can be initiated in rhombencephalon and are mediated by ipsilateral descending spinal pathways. Asymmetric descending command signals, such as the commands for turning and postural corrections, are amplified by a system of crossed reciprocal inhibition in the spinal cord and phasically modulated by the locomotor activity. The alternating locomotor pattern is also dependent on crossed reciprocal inhibition between {{the two sides of the}} spinal cord. Crossing inhibitory neurons are subject to inhibition from a class of propriospinal neurons, the lateral interneurons (LINs), which have been considered as a possible burst terminating factor in the locomotor CPG. The LIN activity, however, is only weakly correlated to the output of the locomotor network. LINs receive input from RS neurons and may mediate descending commands related to motor function instead. Inhibitory mechanisms were also investigated in a light and electron microscopic study. A proportion of synaptic terminals in the lamprey spinal cord display immunoreactivity against two co-localized inhibitory neurotransmitters: glycine and GABA. Computer modeling of the neural mechanisms of lateral turns showed that locomotor models depending on LINs for burst termination did not generate turn-like patterns when LINs were activated. A strong activation of crossing inhibitory neurons by the <b>descending</b> <b>turn</b> command was necessary to generate turns in models of the locomotor network in which bursts are terminated by intrinsic properties of the crossing inhibitory neurons. In many species of fish, the paired pectoral and pelvic fins are the main effector organs for stabilizing and changing the body orientation in the roll and pitch planes. Lampreys lack paired fins but the dorsal fin may provide better stability in the roll plane. Primary afferents from the fin appear to take part in a local monosynaptic resistance reflex that activates fin motoneurons...|$|E
