50|$|In May 1942, the airmen {{moved to}} Idku and {{reformed}} as a night fighter squadron with Beaufighters for {{action in the}} eastern Mediterranean. They became operational {{at the end of}} the month, and their main tasks were the interception of enemy reconnaissance and bombing aircraft, principally over Alexandria, and the escort <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>convoys</b> laden with supplies for Malta. At the end of October, after the 8th Army's advance from El Alamein, 46 Squadron carried out attacks on the retreating enemy columns in the Mersa Matruh area.|$|R

In {{the three months}} following their introduction, on the Atlantic, North Sea, and Scandinavian routes, <b>of</b> 8,894 <b>ships</b> <b>convoyed</b> just 27 were lost to U-boats. By comparison 356 were lost sailing independently.|$|R

50|$|On 5 November 1940 in the Atlantic, Captain Fegen, {{commanding}} the armed merchantman HMS Jervis Bay, was escorting 38 <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> <b>Convoy</b> HX-84, {{when they were}} attacked by the German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer. Captain Fegen immediately engaged the enemy head-on, thus giving the <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the <b>convoy</b> time to scatter. Out-gunned and on fire Jervis Bay maintained the unequal fight for 22 minutes, although the captain's right arm was shattered, and even after he died when the bridge was shot from under him. He went down with his ship but {{it was due to}} him that 31 <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the <b>convoy</b> escaped including the SS San Demetrio.|$|R

5000|$|When Convoy PQ16 was {{assembled}} off Iceland Churchill {{declared it}} would be worthwhile if even 50% got through; despite the losses the majority <b>of</b> the <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> <b>Convoy</b> PQ16 did arrive, most ships to Murmansk (30 May 1942) and eight ships to Archangelsk (1 June 1942). The convoy was such a success {{in terms of the}} War Stores delivered that the Germans made greater efforts to disrupt the following convoys. The Heavy Lift <b>Ships</b> from <b>Convoy</b> PQ16 including [...] stayed at Archangelsk and Molotovsk unloading convoys for over 14 months.|$|R

Magnet was refloated but ran into further difficulties in the ice before her crew finally ran her ashore west of Malmo. Morris managed to get his entire crew of 120 safely ashore and they eventually arrived in Gothenburg; Magnet was a complete loss.|$|R
5000|$|In 1677, Dummer and Tippetts {{assisted}} Sir Anthony Deane, who {{had been}} appointed Controller of the Victualling Accounts on the Navy Board, and given the responsibility for establishing {{for the first time}} standardised sets <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the line to be applied to the [...] "thirty new ships", the largest single shipbuilding programme hitherto undertaken.

The <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> are no coincidence. The number [...] "4" [...] has numerological significance {{as a symbol of}} the 4 cardinal directions, 4 seasons, and 4 virtues.

40|$|Movement <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> or pushed <b>convoy</b> is {{realized}} {{under the influence}} of the propelling force, which is created by propeller or other types of propelling devices. After the change of work regime of the propelling engine the speed <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> (or pushed <b>convoy)</b> changes according to certain rules, while at the same time <b>ship</b> (pushed <b>convoy)</b> obtains irregular movement. Traveled distance and time lapsed of a certain maneuver, which take time during this irregular movement are called inertial characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> (or pushed <b>convoy).</b> These characteristics mostly depend on the type of maneuver, influence of external conditions, depth of waterway, as well as the amount of loaded cargo. In this paper the method for calculation of stopping distance and time will be presented for pushed convoys while navigating on a waterway both wide and deep enough. This paper is based on research done on the following projects: • Models of integration of transport system, number 36024 for the period 2011 ÷ 2014 year, by the Ministry of education, sciences and technical development of the Republic of Serbia; • Models of sustainable development of traffic in Vojvodina, for the period 2011 ÷ 2014 year, by the Secretariat of sciences and technical development of the Government of Vojvodina...|$|R

25|$|The 1719 Establishment was {{the first}} formal 'Establishment' (mandatory {{requirements}} to govern the construction of warships for the Royal Navy) laid down to govern the construction <b>of</b> all <b>ships</b> built or rebuilt down to those of 20 carriage guns, whether in the Royal Dockyards or by commercial contractors. It {{did not apply to}} ships and other vessels with fewer than 20 carriage guns (which were unrated vessels).

Jervis Bay attacked Admiral Scheer to give the convoy the chance to scatter and escape but was quickly sunk. When Admiral Scheer {{caught up with the}} convoy, the lightly armed (one 4-inch gun) Beaverford turned to attack the cruiser, engaging it for five hours until Beaverford exploded and sank with all 76 crew. Delayed by Beaverford, thirty-two <b>of</b> the <b>convoy</b> <b>ships</b> were able to escape in the darkness with Admiral Scheer destroying only six <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the <b>convoy.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An Escort Group {{consisted}} of several small warships organized and trained to operate together providing protection for trade convoys. Escort groups were a World War II tactical innovation in anti-submarine warfare by the Royal Navy {{to combat the}} threat of the Kriegsmarines [...] "wolfpack" [...] tactics. Early escort groups often contained destroyers, sloops, naval trawlers and, later, corvettes of differing specifications lacking the ability to maneuver together as a flotilla of similar warships, but rigorously trained in anti-submarine tactics to use teamwork emphasizing the unique sensors, weapons, speed and turning radius <b>of</b> each <b>ship.</b> The development <b>of</b> these 'escort groups' proved an effective means <b>of</b> defending <b>shipping</b> <b>convoys</b> through the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|R
