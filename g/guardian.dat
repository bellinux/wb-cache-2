5|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona {{asked the}} <b>guardian</b> of Matsatso, {{one of the}} three most {{prominent}} royal idols, to ask the idol which of his sons should rule after him. The <b>guardian</b> hesitated to declare the idol's choice, but after the king promised no ill reaction to the decision, the man declared the successor to be Andrianavalonimerina. However, the king had hoped that the successor would be another son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He decided to test the prophecy by sending one of his wives to the guardian's house, where the population showed her respect by offering zebu for her to eat. The zebu cooked inconsistently, and the king interpreted this as a sign that the <b>guardian</b> was dishonest and intended to seize power himself, so Andriamasinavalona ordered him put to death and had the idol Matsatso discarded in a lake. He then asked the guardians of the two other idols (Kelimalaza and Soratra) to declare a successor; the <b>guardian</b> of Soratra fled, while the <b>guardian</b> of Kelimalaza stated that only the king could choose his successor.|$|E
