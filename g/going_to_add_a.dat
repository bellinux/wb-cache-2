40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of insulating materials, the design and choice of the electrode {{system in which the}} insulating material is to be measured would play a crucial role. There are various electrode systems provided by the current IEC and ASTM standard. In this paper, influence from the shape of a circular metallic electrode with guard ring, which is very common in DC conductivity measurement for its simple structure, is investigated. Mineral oil with different aging times are tested using this electrode system. According to IEC and ASTM standard, there are four parameters of this electrode system that can affect the DC conductivity measurement, distance between two electrodes, distance between guard and guarded electrode, outer radius of the guard ring and the outer radius of the guarded electrode. Here, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>a</b> new parameter, the edge radius to the system, which is not mentioned in current standards but is quite important in liquid dielectrics measurement. The experimental result shows that increase the edge radius can lead to a higher applied voltage in DC conductivity measurement. The distribution of electric strength of this electrode system is simulated by Comsol Multiphysics. As seen from the simulating result, there would be a point that has much higher electric strength {{near the edge of the}} guard and guarded electrode. If the edges of these two electrodes are very sharp, the maximum electric strength in the test cell will increase. A recommendation has been made to current standard in liquid measurement. Besides, since there is a new parameter in this system, the conductivity calculated from the electric strength in the gap is compared with the value obtained from the equation of international standards...|$|E

40|$|The Chinese {{government}} has been expanding college student enrollment since 1990. Although the employment of college graduates has not become a serious social problem as had been originally anticipated, {{the number of students}} undergoing entrance examinations for graduate school are increasing. Studying abroad is also becoming an option for some graduates. Because <b>going</b> <b>to</b> graduate school <b>adds</b> <b>an</b> economical load upon parents, there is concern that family background will influence undergraduates' options. This paper analyzes the effect of family background on the intent to continue education and on early occupational attainment among undergraduates. The information used in this analysis has been collected from 1, 341 undergraduates in four elite universities located in Beijing and Shandong, from February to March 2003. The main results are as follows: (1) In the elite universities, the desire to go on to domestic graduate schools or study abroad among undergraduates is very high. Undergraduates there are likely to seek employment in foreign-invested enterprises, to seek employment as managers or professionals, and t o seek work in big cities. (2) The desire to continue education or study abroad among undergraduates is greatly influenced by family background. Educational continuation is influenced by parents' education and studying abroad is influenced by family income. However, educational continuation among graduates in their fourth year is influenced by not only parents' education but also family income. However, the impact of family background on early occupational attainments is significantly weakening...|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{evaluation}} {{was performed}} to investigate how size and concentration of small rye bran particles in a continuous phase with varying viscosity influence the sensory perception of grittiness. The threshold for the sensation of grittiness of rye bran particles in a starch gel, evaluated by triangular sensory tests, was very low. The particles were discerned at a concentration of 0. 1 - 0. 3 %, {{despite the fact that}} they were very small (20 - 180 m). The sensory panel was able to detect the increase in particle concentration in a ranking test, but the ability to detect the increase in concentration was not influenced by particle size. The rheological properties of the medium did not influence the detection threshold. Practical ApplicationsDue to health benefits, addition of dietary fiber in food products is popular. Rye bran is a by-product, which is very high in dietary fiber, and for which new applications are requested. Rye bran consists mainly of insoluble dietary fiber and the rye bran particles are hard and irregular in shape. To understand the oral sensitivity of these kinds of particles is important to avoid the negative sensation of grittiness of dietary fiber fortified products. Since it was shown that even the size fraction of 20 m was perceived as gritty at very low concentrations (0. 2 - 0. 3 %), the milling technique is probably not the solution to reduce the grittiness. Preferably a way of making the particles softer, with less sharp edges should be sought, at least if the rye bran is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> smooth food matrix of a starch gel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:The {{exploitation}} of wind energy {{as a resource}} for generating electricity is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a leap forward. Large-scale wind farms (WFs) will be engaged with power systems in the near future and this will cause changes in the supply pattern. Wind speed has an intermittent behavior and the output power of a WF is highly variable, consistent with this fact. The Markov process could consider this characteristic of wind speed using the state transition rate probability matrix, an issue that is neglected when a probability distribution function is established to model the wind speed data. The adequacy indices of a power system describe the ability of the generation units to meet the load demand. When a WF is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> generation system or an existing WF is subjected to expansion study, in addition to the probability of occurrence for the wind speed states, which is considered in the probability distribution function of the wind speed, temporal relations between the wind speed states may aect the adequacy indices. In this paper, the eect of considering transition rates on adequacy indices is studied using a Markovian approach. A WF is modeled with real wind speed data, and then it is <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the generation system of Roy Billinton test system. The transition rate matrix of the WF is modied by denition of the scenarios and the eect of this modication on the loss of load expectation (LOLE) and loss of load frequency (LOLF) is studied. Next, the LOLF index, in comparison with the LOLE, is assessed in expansion strategies and the results enhance the importance of using a Markovian approach and considering the temporal relation of wind speed states in adequacy studies...|$|R
40|$|Overall, we now cure 70 % of the {{children}} who are di-agnosed with cancer, and in the 30 % of cases that are still not curable, we can almost always <b>add</b> time <b>to</b> the child’s life. As our ability to cure cancer has improved, we are now paying increased attention to the goal of avoiding or allevi-ating the suffering associated with cancer and its therapy. Risk stratification aims to avoid undertreatment of children with high-risk cancers and to avoid overtreatment (with all of the associated side effects of therapy) of children with lower-risk cancers. This goal has become an important part of designing treatment protocols over the past 15 years. Whether or not a child will be cured, we know that all children with cancer suffer, as do their families. Pediatric oncology is committed to curing cancer, but palliative care is committed to improving a child’s quality of life, irrespec-tive of the potential for cure. Oncology and palliative care are thus twin endeavors, both of which seek what is best for a child and his or her family [1]. Within the 2 broad cat-egories of curing disease and alleviating suffering, there are many specific goals unique to each patient. Palliative care seeks to relieve the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual distress produced by complex, chronic, or life-lim-iting conditions; to assist in making difficult decisions and setting goals; and to enhance children’s quality of life [2]. More than a decade has passed since the American Academy of Pediatrics [3] and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies [4] called for the integration of palliative care into ongoing medical management of life-threatening illnesses (such as cancer) in children, from diagnosis to the end of life. Since these calls were issued, models of integrated pediatric palliative care have been de-veloped in which curative therapy and palliative care coex-ist. For children whose lives are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be short, <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> few months of good-quality life can be transformative. Adding 6 months to the life of a child who would otherwise have died at 3. 5 years of age is extending his or her life by nearly 15 %.
