40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is {{constructing}} a performance evaluation model for service-oriented <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Design/methodology/approach: With the research on the current situation of catering industry, this paper summarized the characters of the <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain, and then presents the service-oriented <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain model based on the platform of logistics and information. At last, the fuzzy AHP method is used to evaluate the performance of service-oriented <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Findings: With the analysis of the characteristics of <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain, we construct the performance evaluation model in order to guarantee the food safety, logistics efficiency, price stability and so on. Practical implications: In order to evolve an efficient and effective service supply chain, it can not only used to own enterprise improvement, but also can be used for selecting different customers, to choose a different model of development. Originality/value: This paper has a new definition of service-oriented <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain. And it offers a model to evaluate the performance of this <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{distribution system}} of high performance {{is needed to}} anticipate market developments in the <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain (CSC) in the Netherlands. A simulation model was developed to analyse a multi-compartment distribution system which should satisfy customer demands for shorter lead times, increased delivery frequency and improved quality of process and product. The simulation model quantifies logistic and financial performances in various alternative logistic scenarios for multi-compartment distribution in the <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain. This stochastic simulation model was constructed {{on the basis of}} a value chain analysis yielding activities and performance indicators (PIs). The model proved to be accurate in its predictions when applied to a case situation taken from the Dutch CSC. It is concluded that discrete event simulation is an effective tool to evaluate promising logistic scenarios. The new, multi-compartment method of distribution allowed for a 14 CSC while satisfying customer demand...|$|R
40|$|Relating to {{the current}} changes towards {{sustainability}} in our global food system, many projects of local and/or organic <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> emerged and are implemented all around Europe. Besides this rising development, these projects {{are not easy to}} implement and these initiatives often have to face obstacles. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the constraints of local school <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> observed in rural territories and investigate if it is easier to implement these types of projects in rural areas rather than urban ones. In a second phase, this document presents success factors and actions-levers to overcome these difficulties. The survey was located in the Pays du Bocage in Normandy (France); we interviewed 30 caterers and 27 producers and processors. We found that many constraints are based on economical and logistical issues (canteens budget, deliveries, etc.) but there is also a great influence of human based challenges in regards to knowledge, change of habits, etc. Finally, rural territories share most of the constraints of urban areas; and in spite of a higher geographical proximity between producers and caterers, the gap between these two “worlds” is as present as in urban areas. Nonetheless, there are many solutions to overcome these difficulties. These actions and success factors relate to various aspects: cooking practices, education, stakeholder roles, etc. but most of them are based on people involvement, people learning, etc. Consequently, successful local <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> is mainly based on stakeholders’ willingness and motivation to implement the project.

40|$|Purpose: To empirically {{investigate}} the impact of: institutional pressures; institutional logics; and institutional complexity; on Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) practices across mixed {{public and private}} sector supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Multi-case study data was collected from three tiers of food and <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chains: the customer/consumer tier; focal public sector UK Universities; and private sector suppliers / contractors. Findings: The findings indicate that: normative and mimetic pressures are more prevalent in focal Universities, compared to suppliers; there is typically no single dominant logic across these supply chains; and the multiplicity of institutional logics (e. g., sustainability logic versus financial logic) increases institutional complexity. Therefore, in the atypical case of homogeneity in terms of institutional pressures and logics, e. g. with a dominant sustainability logic throughout the supply chain, radical change in SSCM practices is facilitated. In contrast, in the more typical case when there is heterogeneity, with competing logics at different supply chain tiers, this limits SSCM to more incremental changes in practices. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to three tiers {{of the food and}} <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chains of UK Universities. Practical implications: To aid in the successful implementation of SSCM, this study suggests a need for managers to develop an initial understanding of the prevailing institutional logics and pressures at different tiers of the supply chain. Social implications: A number of the SSCM practices studied address social sustainability. Originality/value: No previous studies have empirically investigated the impact of institutional complexity in the context of SSCM practices across supply chains, involving both mixed public and private sector organisations...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} an audit toolkit that enables {{companies}} in the food sector to benchmark their suppliers in terms of environmental management. The paper reviews environmental practices and performance metrics in the food value chain by developing a custom designed survey to gather results, allow auditing and enable benchmarking of the best practice, common practice and areas for improvement among the suppliers. Some of the key areas in which the suppliers represented best practice include the separation and recycling of their waste streams and efforts to reduce the use of raw materials, energy, water, pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers. Some suppliers were actively engaging with stakeholders in their value chain to collaborate on products and processes that reduced environmental impacts. Notably the supplier with the best environmental performance had both developed an Environmental Management Policy and also implemented it systematically. The areas that the study showed needed improvement included the need for all suppliers to implement an Environmental Management System, {{the need for more}} renewable sourcing for materials and energy, the need for systematic measurement of the food miles of products, and the carbon and water footprints of their business processes. Both the approach taken and {{the results of this study}} have already proved beneficial for the collaborating partner, Reynolds <b>Catering</b> <b>Supplies</b> Ltd. as they anticipate its use for promoting improved environmental management among their suppliers...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates how to {{increase}} and improve school <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chains, to understand hindering factors and their perception {{in order to}} reveal drivers and constraints for POP. These include policy implementation instruments, changed values and attitudes, healthy nutrition policies, supply chain bottle necks, premium prices (to producers), successful procurement strategies and certification procedures. This work {{is based on a}} two-step survey concerning the Italian school food service system. Initially questionnaires were submitted to a qualified group of 50 producers and 50 caterers (managers of national and international companies of food service for school, local administrators who manage food services for the schools). The results of the questionnaires have subsequently been the basis to plan in-depth interviews with few decision makers who could represent both caterers and producers. The aim of this second step being to view how identified problems could be solved. The results show how the understanding and the acceptance of the organic food concept among the catering staff is crucial for the degree of success in each step of public organic procurement. The introduction of organic food in serving outlets needs appropriate support (such as qualification of key actors and a specific financial support). Other key aspects in this regard are laws and regulations promoting the procurement of quality food, policy interventions tackling more than one aspect of the problem, education programs, calls for tenders, negotiated procurement contracts and quality standards...|$|R

40|$|Social and {{environmental}} standards can function as tools {{for companies that}} want to improve their conduct in social {{and environmental}} areas in the supply chain. However, relatively {{little attention has been}} given to how the adoption of social and environmental standards may influence the actual business practices in the supply chain. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the institutional context surrounding the adoption of social and environmental standards and how these standards influence the business practices in the supply chain. The thesis consists of two papers that explore two different standards in two different supply chain contexts. The empirical material is based on case studies where interviews with key persons provide the main source of evidence. The case studies are backed up by previous studies in the field. In this thesis, the two papers are framed and analyzed with the aid of literature around the phenomenon of standards. Paper I explores factory managers' perceptions of the labour standard SA 8000 in the Indian clothing supply chain. Buyer requirements and hopes for competitive advantage provide incentives for the factory managers to implement SA 8000. Obstacles associated with SA 8000 are costs for certification, increased labour costs and infrastructure investments. Although buyers require the standard, they do not offer any support so that the standard represents a safe investment. Nevertheless, the standard may lead to business opportunities in terms of better reputation, which may lead to increased orders and lower labour turnover. Paper II explores professional purchasers' perceptions of the organic food standard KRAV in the Swedish <b>catering</b> <b>supply</b> chain. The study identifies procurement conditions for beef and the associated obstacles and opportunities with purchasing organic beef. Obstacles with organic beef are high costs, low volumes, inefficient distribution and low consumer demand. In the public sector, political goals and altered procurement practices provide opportunities for purchasing organic beef. In the commercial sector, organic beef can provide grounds for differentiation...|$|R
