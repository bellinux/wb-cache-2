To improve these inadequacies, converging-diverging (C-D) tubes were manufactured, consisting of symmetrical converging and diverging cones, where the throat is the annular section between the two cones, with various angles and diameter ratios to improve the permanent pressure loss and flow measurement range. The objective {{of this study was}} firstly to evaluate the permanent pressure loss, secondly to determine the discharge coefficient values for various C-D tubes and compare them with the existing <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> using Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and finally to assess the performance of these differential pressure flow meters. The tests were conducted on the multipurpose test rig in the slurry laboratory at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids were used to conduct experiments in five different C-D tube flow meters with diameter ratios (β) of 0. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 7, and with angles of the wall to the axis of the tube (θ) of 15 °, 30 ° and 45 °. The results for each test are presented firstly in the form of static pressure at different flow rates. It was observed that the permanent pressure loss decreases with the flow rate and the length of the C-D tube. Secondly, the results are presented in terms of discharge coefficient versus Reynolds number. It was found that the Cd values at 15 ° drop earlier than at 30 ° and 45 °; when viscous forces become predominant, the Cd increases with increasing beta ratio. The Cd was found to be independent of the Reynolds number for Re> 2000 and also a function of angle and beta ratio. Preamble Performance of a symmetrical converging-diverging tube <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> Finally, the error analyses of discharge coefficients were assessed to determine the performance criteria. The standard variation was found to increase when the Reynolds number decreases. The average discharge coefficient values and their uncertainties were determined to select the most promising C-D tube geometry. An average Cd of 0. 96, with an uncertainty of ± 0. 5 % for a range of Reynolds numbers greater than 2, 000 was found. The comparison between C-D tubes 0. 6 (15 - 15) and classical Venturi flow meters reveals that C-D 0. 6 (15 - 15) performs well in turbulent range and shows only a slight inaccuracy in laminar. This thesis provides a simple geometrical <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> with a constant Cd value over a Reynolds number range of 2000 to 150 000...|$|E
40|$|The {{orifice plate}} flow meter {{is the most}} common form of <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> used in industry. The {{standard}} discharge coefficient, which is defined by both British Standard and [SO 5167, is only valid if the flow approaching the meter is perfectly settled and fully developed. However, in practical applications the flow approaching the orifice meter is often disturbed by pipe-fittings and consequently the measurements become inaccurate. Basically, the design of the orifice plate meters that are independent of the upstream disturbances is a main goal for orifice plate metering. Either using a long straight pipe, or a flow conditioner upstream of an orifice plate, usually achieves this goal. In this project the effect of the fractal flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been investigated in an experimental rig and simulation work. The results of using a combination of the fratal flow conditioner and orifice plate for non-standard flow conditions including swirling flow and asymmetric flow show that this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the Standards. The simulation results also show that the device can be used as a part of a flow metering package that will considerably reduce installation lengths. According to the main idea to introduce a predetermined turbulence flow caused by a flow conditioner for orifice plate flow metering, author was introduced another type of flow conditioner known as a metal foam flow conditioner. Open-cell metal foams with a porosity of 78. 8 % was formed and fashioned as a flow conditioner. Again the experimental results using the metal foam flow conditioner showed this metal foam flow conditioner demonstrated a good performance in terms of removing swirl and producing a repeatedly same flow profile within a short distance downstream of the flow conditioner. Furthermore, the low pressure drop across the metal foam is another advantage of this flow conditioner where the pressure loss coefficient for this flow conditioner is approximately 2. 5.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the Reynolds number (Re) and discharge coefficients (C) was investigated through <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> The focus {{of the study was}} directed toward very small Reynolds numbers commonly associated with pipeline transportation of viscous fluids. There is currently a relatively small amount of research that has been performed in this area for the Venturi, standard orifice plate, V-cone, and wedge <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT© was used to perform the research, while GAMBIT© was used as the preprocessing tool for the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> models created. Heavy oil and water were used separately as the two flowing fluids to obtain a wide range of Reynolds numbers with high precision. Multiple models were used with varying characteristics, such as pipe size and meter geometry, to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} C vs. Re relationship. All of the simulated numerical models were compared to physical data to determine the accuracy of the models. The study indicates that the various discharge coefficients decrease rapidly as the Reynolds number approaches 1 for each of the flow meters; however, the Reynolds number range in which the discharge coefficients were constant varied with meter design. The standard orifice plate does not follow the general trend in the discharge coefficient curve that the other <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> do; instead as the Re decreases, the C value increases to a maximum before sharply dropping off. Several graphs demonstrating the varying relationships and outcomes are presented. The primary focus of this research was to obtain further understanding of discharge coefficient performance versus Reynolds number for differential producing <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at very small Reynolds numbers...|$|R

40|$|Most {{two-phase}} {{applications for}} Coriolis mass <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> are for low Gas Void Fraction (GVF) conditions, i. e. where the process fluid is essentially liquid with relatively {{low levels of}} entrained air or gas. There are particular challenges associated with metering wet gas, where the GVF exceeds 95 %. Established wet gas metering techniques are typically based on a differential pressure-type device (for example an orifice plate or V-cone). It is well-known that such devices over-read compared to a dry gas calibration; equations to correct the reading are available if the degree of gas "wetness" is known. For Coriolis mass <b>flow</b> <b>metering</b> of wet gas, two approaches are described. The natural extension of the low GVF techniques is to map the observed mass flow and density readings onto estimates of the flow rates of the gas and liquid components. The alternative {{is to use the}} Coriolis meter to estimate the degree of gas "wetness" (e. g. the Lockhart-Martinelli number) and to apply a conventional correlation (e. g. Murdock or Chisholm) to a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>flow</b> reading. A prototype Coriolis-based wet gas meter is described, together with results from laboratory trials at CEESI in Colorado, and from extended field trials at BP's Wamsutter gas field in Wyoming...|$|R

The g root and g shoot increased considerably with temperature from 0 - 50 °C. Between 15 °C and 35 °C, g shoot and g root varied with water viscosity. In a second experiment, the impact of temperature-induced changes in g root on sapling transpiration (E) and leaf water potential (leaf) was assessed. Intact plants were placed in a growth cabinet with constant air and variable soil temperatures. E increased linearly with soil temperature but leaf remained constant.

40|$|Problem {{statement}} The goal is {{to determine}} the parameters which produce the optimal filters. Rationale Melt-blowing is a process by which Delta Pure uses to manufacture water filters. Several production parameters affect the characteristics of these filters and the {{goal is to}} determine which variables impact these characteristics the most. Approach Three different production parameters were chosen; air pressure, polymer temperature, and extruder speed. Eight filters were produced with each parameter set to high and low points, as well as one filter which served as a midpoint for the data. These filters were run in the testing rig (pictured above) to find the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> and the <b>flow</b> rate through the filter. The filters were then subjected to a compression test to find the load that the filters could take.
