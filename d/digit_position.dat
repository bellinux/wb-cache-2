500|$|The {{idea for}} the clock came from New York real estate {{developer}} Seymour Durst, who wanted to highlight the rising national debt. In 1989, he sponsored {{the installation of the}} first clock, which was originally placed on Sixth Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets, one block away from Times Square. In 2004, the original clock was dismantled and replaced by the current clock at the new location one block away. In 2008, as the U.S. national debt exceeded $10 trillion for the first time, it was reported that the value of the debt may have exceeded the number of digits in the clock. The lit dollar-sign in the clock's leftmost <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> was later changed to the [...] "1" [...] digit to represent the ten-trillionth place.|$|E

5000|$|A {{ripple-carry}} adder {{works in}} the same way as pencil-and-paper methods of addition. Starting at the rightmost (least significant) <b>digit</b> <b>position,</b> the two corresponding digits are added and a result obtained. It is also possible that there may be a carry out of this <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> (for example, in pencil-and-paper methods, [...] "9+5=4, carry 1").

50|$|Each <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> {{represents}} {{a power of}} twenty-six, so for example, the numeral ABC represents the value 1 × 262 + 2 × 261 + 3 × 260 = 731 in base 10.|$|E
5000|$|This {{means that}} no <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> {{can have an}} {{absolutely}} final value until it has been established {{whether or not a}} carry is coming in from the right. Moreover, if the sum without a carry is 9 (in pencil-and-paper methods) or 1 (in binary arithmetic), it is not even possible to tell whether or not a given <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> is going to pass on a carry to the position on its left. At worst, when a whole sequence of sums comes to ...99999999... (in decimal) or ...11111111... (in binary), nothing can be deduced at all until the value of the carry coming in from the right is known, and that carry is then propagated to the left, one step at a time, as each <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> evaluated [...] "9+1=0, carry 1" [...] or [...] "1+1=0, carry 1". It is the [...] "rippling" [...] of the carry from right to left that gives a ripple-carry adder its name, and its slowness.

A burst refers to a group of possibly contiguous errors which is characteristic of unforeseeable effects of errors in data computation. Only systematic forms of convolution codes are considered here because the normal operation of Process block has not changed and {{there is no need for}} decoding to obtain true outputs.

5000|$|Supposing that we {{have two}} bits of storage per digit, we can use a {{redundant}} binary representation, storing the values 0, 1, 2, or 3 in each <b>digit</b> <b>position.</b> It is therefore obvious that one more binary number {{can be added to}} our carry-save result without overflowing our storage capacity: but then what? ...|$|E
50|$|Non-modular {{multiplication}} {{can make}} use of carry-save adders, which save time by storing the carries from each <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> and using them later: for example, by computing 111111111111+000000000010 as 111111111121 instead waiting for the carry to propagate through the whole number to yield the true binary value 1000000000001.

Ruzsa found the seven-element set [...] modulo , giving the stated bound.Subsequently Ruzsa's construction has been improved by using a different base, , to give square-difference-free sets with sizeWhen applied to the base , the same construction generates the Moser-de Bruijn sequence multiplied by two, a square-difference-free set that is too sparse to provide nontrivial lower bounds on the Furstenberg-Sárközy theorem but one that has other notable mathematical properties.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, a self-descriptive {{number is}} an integer m {{that in a}} given base b is b digits long in which each <b>digit</b> d at <b>position</b> n (the most {{significant}} <b>digit</b> being at <b>position</b> 0 and the least significant at position b - 1) counts how many instances of digit n are in m.|$|R
5000|$|As with {{conventional}} decimal, each <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> represents {{a power of}} ten, so for example 123 is [...] "one hundred, plus two tens, plus three units." [...] All positive integers that are represented solely with non-zero digits in conventional decimal (such as 123) have the same representation in decimal without a zero. Those that use a zero must be rewritten, so for example 10 becomes A, conventional 20 becomes 1A, conventional 100 becomes 9A, conventional 101 becomes A1, conventional 302 becomes 2A2, conventional 1000 becomes 99A, conventional 1110 becomes AAA, conventional 2010 becomes 19AA, and so on.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to make the conversion by assigning each place in the source base the hexadecimal representation of its place value and then performing multiplication and addition to get the final representation.That is, to convert the number B3AD to decimal one can split the hexadecimal number into its digits: B (1110), 3 (310), A (1010) and D (1310), and then get the final result by multiplying each decimal representation by 16p, where p is the corresponding hex <b>digit</b> <b>position,</b> counting from right to left, beginning with 0.

The model 97 had more (and larger) keys, therefore only two functions were assigned to each key.

5000|$|A {{bijective}} base-k numeration is a bijective positional notation.

[...] calls this notation k-adic, but {{it should not be}} confused with the p-adic numbers: bijective numerals are a system for representing ordinary integers by finite strings of nonzero digits, whereas the p-adic numbers are a system of mathematical values that contain the integers as a subset and may need infinite sequences of digits in any numerical representation.|$|R

5000|$|A non-zero numeral {{with more}} than one <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> will mean a {{different}} number in a different number base, but in general, the digits will mean the same.

5000|$|Each {{identifier}} {{is mapped}} to a live node called the root. If a node's nodeID is G {{then it is}} the root else use the routing table's nodeIDs and IP addresses to find the nodes neighbors.

5000|$|In {{a simple}} LED package, {{typically}} {{all of the}} cathodes (negative terminals) {{or all of the}} anodes (positive terminals) of the segment LEDs are connected and brought out to a common pin; this is referred to as a [...] "common cathode" [...] or [...] "common anode" [...] device. Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard IC sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays {{to reduce the number of}} I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each <b>digit</b> <b>position</b> would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.|$|E

Here we address this question by testing {{the extent to which}} learned manipulation can be transferred when the contralateral hand is used and/or object orientation is reversed. We asked subjects to use a precision grip to lift a grip device with an asymmetrical mass distribution while minimizing object roll during lifting by generating a compensatory torque. Subjects were allowed to grasp anywhere on the object’s vertical surfaces, and were therefore able to modulate both <b>digit</b> <b>positions</b> and forces. After every block of eight trials performed in one manipulation context (i. e., using the right hand and at a given object orientation), subjects had to lift the same object in the second context for one trial (transfer trial). Context changes were made by asking subjects to switch the hand used to lift the object and/or rotate the object 180 u about a vertical axis. Therefore, three transfer conditions, hand switch (HS), object rotation (OR), and both hand switch and object rotation (HS+OR), were tested and compared with hand matched control groups who did not experience context changes. We found that subjects in all transfer conditions adapted <b>digit</b> <b>positions</b> across multiple transfer trials similar to the learning of control groups, regardless of different changes of contexts. Moreover, subjects in both HS and HS+OR group also adapted digit forces similar to the control group, suggesting independent learning of the left hand.
