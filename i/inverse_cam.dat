Curved slots with designed motion law were applied as in the standard cam mechanisms. In this approach, the Geneva mechanism with curved slots is basically thought of as an <b>inverse</b> <b>cam</b> mechanism. However, basic equations for the surface geometry of the slots were not discussed in their work, resulting in unknown conditions for manufacturing, such as undercutting, double point in the curve, etc. Figliolini and Angeles [7] studied the force transmission of the Geneva mechanism with curved slots...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} further explore the {{relationship}} between CAM treatment satisfaction and negative life impact, the present study examined migraine outcomes (e.g., migraine frequency and number of migraine symptoms) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD etc.) and how those factors are associated with CAM treatment satisfaction and negative life impact. The {{results of the present}} study showed that the <b>inverse</b> relationship between <b>CAM</b> treatment satisfaction and psychiatric comorbidities was weaker than the <b>inverse</b> relationship between <b>CAM</b> treatment satisfaction and migraine outcomes although psychiatric comorbidities and migraine outcomes were all strongly associated with greater levels of negative life impact. These results may indicate that CAM treatment may affect mental well-being of chronic migraineurs positively but in a lesser degree compared to the degree that the effectiveness of CAM treatments affects migraine outcomes. One partial explanation for this is that relatively few numbers of CAM treatments identified in the present study were devoted to improving mental health well-being. In the present study, psychiatric and psychological factors may play the important roles as a contributing factor (i.e., stress as one of the most frequently identified triggers to migraine) as well as a precipitating factor (i.e., psychiatric comorbidities were the most common comorbid disorders among chronic migraineurs) to migraine headache. Psychiatric comorbidities may also be a risk factor to negative life experiences. For instance, chronic migraineurs may blame migraine headache for their disabilities when their disabilities are actually due to their psychiatric comorbidities (Wachholtz et al. 2015) or their pain experience caused by migraine may have been amplified due to psychiatric comorbidities. These results are significant because they emphasized the importance of treating psychiatric comorbidities in chronic migraineurs since appropriate care of the psychiatric comorbidities can directly affect quality of life and/or indirectly to increase quality of life by reducing migraine symptoms. Previous study (Pistoia et al. 2013) indicated that combined treatments to target both migraine symptoms and psychological co-morbidities in order to enhance the quality of life for chronic migraineurs are important, however, only few studies (Kleiboer et al. 2014) investigated the effectiveness of psychological treatments on chronic migraineurs.|$|R
40|$|Calmodulin (CaM) is a {{ubiquitous}} Ca 2 + sensor {{protein that}} plays {{a pivotal role}} in regulating innumerable neuronal functions, including synaptic transmission. In cortical neurons, most neurotransmitter release is triggered by Ca 2 + binding to synaptotagmin- 1; however, a second delayed phase of release, referred to as asynchronous release, is triggered by Ca 2 + binding to an unidentified secondary Ca 2 + sensor. To test whether CaM could be the enigmatic Ca 2 + sensor for asynchronous release, we now use in cultured neurons short hairpin RNAs that suppress expression of âˆ¼ 70 % of all neuronal CaM isoforms. Surprisingly, we found that in synaptotagmin- 1 knock-out neurons, the CaM knockdown caused a paradoxical rescue of synchronous release, instead of a block of asynchronous release. Gene and protein expression studies revealed that both in wild-type and in synaptotagmin- 1 knock-out neurons, the CaM knockdown altered expression of > 200 genes, including that encoding synaptotagmin- 2. Synaptotagmin- 2 expression was increased several-fold by the CaM knockdown, which accounted for the paradoxical rescue of synchronous release in synaptotagmin- 1 knock-out neurons by the CaM knockdown. Interestingly, the CaM knockdown primarily activated genes that are preferentially expressed in caudal brain regions, whereas it repressed genes in rostral brain regions. Consistent with this correlation, quantifications of protein levels in adult mice uncovered an <b>inverse</b> relationship of <b>CaM</b> and synaptotagmin- 2 levels in mouse forebrain, brain stem, and spinal cord. Finally, we employed molecular replacement experiments using a knockdown rescue approach to show that Ca 2 + binding to the C-lobe but not the N-lobe of CaM is required for suppression of synaptotagmin- 2 expression in cortical neurons. Our data describe a previously unknown, Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent regulatory pathway that controls the expression of synaptic proteins in the rostral-caudal neuraxis...|$|R
