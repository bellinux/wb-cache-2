5000|$|In the Roman {{conflict}} of laws, an <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> {{is a legal}} issue that arises {{in connection with the}} major cause of action in a lawsuit. The forum court will have already decided that it has jurisdiction to hear the case (resolving any issue relating to forum shopping) and will be working through the next two stages of the conflict process, namely: characterisation and choice of law. For example, the court may classify the cause as [...] "succession", but it notes that the plaintiff brings the claim for relief as the deceased's widow. Before the court can adjudicate on the main issue, it must first decide whether the plaintiff actually has the status claimed, i.e. the <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> would be the validity of the claimed marriage. The inconvenient reality is that many lawsuits involve a number of interdependent legal issues. In purely domestic cases, this poses no difficulty because a judge will freely move from one domestic law to another to resolve the dispute. But in a conflict case, {{the question is whether the}} <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> is resolved by reference either to its own choice of law rules, or to the same law that governs the main issue (the lex causae). States have not formulated a consistent answer to this question.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Social and {{personal}} identities were examined for samples of college {{graduate students in}} three culturally different groups: Anglo-American, Mexican-American, and Mexican National. Four identities were explored in terms of salience, frequency, and valence: religious, family, gender, and peer. No {{differences were found between}} the groups on religious and gender identities. As predicted, both the Mexican National and Mexican-American groups scored family higher than did members of the Anglo- American group. Peer responses were not analyzed because there was insufficient data. Three <b>incidental</b> <b>questions</b> were also explored; the salience of consensual versus subconsensual identities; sex difference regarding family and gender identities; and declared religious faith and family and gender identities. For all three cultural groups, and for both sexes, family emerged as the most prominent identity. Gender is the second most important identity, followed by religious and peer identities respectively. Of the <b>incidental</b> <b>questions,</b> the most important finding was that whereas most of the previous research using the same instrument found consensual identities predominant, subconsensual responses were predominant in this study. There were no male-female differences either within or across groups. Such findings raised a question about whether previous cross-cultural studies of sex role could, in fact, comment meaningfully on cultural differences. This was an exploratory study using a small number of subjects (seven men and women in each group) which were not randomly selected. Therefore, the findings were severly qualified...|$|R

50|$|In {{conflict}} of laws, characterisation {{is the second}} stage in the procedure to resolve a lawsuit involving a foreign law element. This process is described in English law as classification and as qualification in French law. In those cases where a different result would be achieved depending on which of several possibly relevant laws is applied, {{this stage of the}} process reveals the relevant rule for the choice of law but it is not necessarily a simple process (see the <b>incidental</b> <b>question).</b> The first stage is for the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction, where appropriate confronting the problem of forum shopping.|$|E
5000|$|The court then {{applies the}} {{relevant}} {{choice of law}} rules. In a few cases, usually involving family law, an <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> can arise which will complicate this process. The United States has adopted a law that almost universally eliminates incidental questions involving family law. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) requires states to apply {{the law of the}} [...] "home state;" [...] that is, the forum which originally determined custody and maintenance. A state court will only apply its own law when no parent retains a connection with the original jurisdiction and when substantial evidence is available in its forum to make a custody or maintenance determination.|$|E
50|$|Article 3 {{provides}} that the Convention only applies to express trusts created voluntarily and evidenced in writing. It will therefore not cover oral trusts, resulting trusts, constructive trusts, statutory trusts or trusts created by judicial order. But signatory states {{are free to}} apply the Convention to any form of trust and the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 has applied the provisions to all trusts arising under English law, no matter when or how they were created, albeit only applying the provisions to transactions affecting those trusts made after 1 August 1987. There are <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> problems if the trust is testamentary and, under Article 4, if it is alleged that the testator lacked capacity, or that the will is formally or substantively invalid, or {{that it had been}} revoked, these issues must be determined first under the lex fori Conflict rules on characterisation and choice of law before the Convention rules can apply. This will include, for example, a detailed consideration of any marriage settlement or applicable law containing community property provisions which might prevent the testator alienating property from a spouse or child of the family (see succession (conflict)). Obviously, if the will purporting to create the trust is held invalid, there are no trusts to adjudicate upon.|$|E
40|$|The Uniform Transfer of Litigation Act (UTLA) was {{undertaken}} for purposes simpler than the mass consolidation of multiparty, multiforum litigation. It seeks {{to create an}} effective tool {{that can be used}} to reduce some of the artificial barriers that tradition has erected around the sovereign separateness of the many different court systems in this country. The fact of separate sovereignty must be recognized, however, and to this end consent of both transferring and receiving courts is required. Within the consent requirement, transfer from the court system of one sovereign to the court system of another can improve on present practices in many settings. A court that lacks subject matter or personal jurisdiction can transfer rather than dismiss. An inconvenient court can transfer to a convenient court rather than invoke forum non conveniens or perhaps struggle on with the litigation. Should complementing federal legislation be enacted, transfer can work better than dismissal when supplemental jurisdiction is declined, or when a state court concludes that a dispute lies in exclusive federal jurisdiction. Of course an effective structure must address the <b>incidental</b> <b>questions</b> that arise when one sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s court system transfers jurisdiction, in whole or in part, to another sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s court system.

60|$|As to the {{question}} whether Mary or Elizabeth had the rightful title to the English crown, it has not only never been settled, but from its very nature {{it can not be}} settled. It is one of those cases in which a peculiar contingency occurs which runs beyond the scope and reach of all the ordinary principles by which analogous cases are tried, and leads to questions which can not be decided. As long as a hereditary succession goes smoothly on, like a river keeping within its banks, we can decide subordinate and <b>incidental</b> <b>questions</b> which may arise; but when a case occurs in which we have the omnipotence of Parliament to set off against the infallibility of the pope--the sacred obligations of a will against the equally sacred principles of hereditary succession--and when we have, at last, two contradictory actions of the same ultimate umpire, we find all technical grounds of coming to a conclusion gone. We then, abandoning these, seek for some higher and more universal principles--essential in the nature of things, and thus independent of the will and action of man--to see if they will throw any light on the subject. But we soon find ourselves as much perplexed and confounded in this inquiry as we were before. We ask, in beginning the investigation, What is the ground and nature of the right by which any king or queen succeeds to the power possessed by his ancestors? And we give up in despair, not being able to answer even this first preliminary inquiry.|$|R

While they were emigrating to Israel, they found themselves in Italy and the husband divorced his wife by get. Under the laws of Hungary (their lex domicilii) and Italy, the religious form of divorce was invalid, but it was recognised as effective by the law of Israel where they acquired a domicile of choice. Subsequently, the wife moved to Canada and, without abandoning her Israeli domicile, went through a second ceremony of marriage. The second husband petitioned for nullity alleging that the marriage was bigamous. The Supreme Court held the marriage to be valid. The main question was the wife's capacity to marry which, under Canadian law, is determined by her lex domicilii, i.e. the law of Israel {{at the time of the}} second ceremony. The <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> was the validity of the divorce which was to be determined either by their lex domicilii at the relevant time or by Italian law as the lex loci actus. The judgment seems to suggest that the court decided both questions by reference to the law of Israel as the law governing the main question.|$|E

We argue that the monetary policy imposed by the CO aims at balancing external accounts, in a manner inspired by the monetary approach of the balance of payments. This feature and the fixed nominal exchange rate identify the zone with a convertibility regime. Using a co-integration model adapted for panel data, we test {{the sensitivity of the}} money supply to external accounts in order to infer the CO efficiency for implementing external monetary adjustment. An <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> also appears: what are the consequences of the 1994 devaluation for the nature of the regime?

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to {{part of the problem}} of the <b>Incidental</b> <b>Question</b> in the Conflict of Laws. Only cases where the answer to what has been called the main question depends on recognition of a foreign judgment (the so called incidental or preliminary question) are included. The problem is analysed as involving a conflict between two different types of conflicts rules i. e. choice of law rules and recognition rules. The thesis examines whether this conflict can be satisfactorily solved by a global preference for either of these rules. Whilst many writers have considered the theoretical base for the conflict of laws, none has yet specifically compared the rationales for choice of law rules and recognition rules in order to determine whether as a matter of principle one type of rule should be preferred to the other rule. This requires a fresh perspective. After rejecting the global solution, the thesis proceeds to examine how a result selecting approach might be applied to the present conflict of rules. After a brief survey of different result selecting approaches, it is concluded that the most appropriate approach in the present conflict of rules context is the construction of specific result orientated rules for each particular category of case. The desired result should be dictated by the policy of the forum, since in fact the conflict is between two conflict rules of the forum. A number of specific topics (including validity of remarriage and matrimonial property rights) concerning recognition of status judgments are considered in depth. The methodology adopted is as follows;- a). The particular circumstances in which the 'conflict of rules' problem is likely to arise in relation to the particular issue is explained. b). The various possible 'choice of rule' rules which might be adopted for the particular issue are considered. c). The policy of English law in relation to the particular issue is ascertained and the 'choice of rule' rule which most closely gives effect to that policy recommended. The thesis contributes to jurisprudence of Private International Law in three main ways:- 1. The understanding of conflicts between different types of conflict rules is of fundamental importance to the whole structure of Private International Law. This thesis shows that this problem is of more significance than previously thought. 2. Whilst writers have adopted a functional approach to the <b>incidental</b> <b>question,</b> none have attempted to construct a series of rules based on forum policy. 3. There has been no previous attempt to identify forum (here English) policy in relation to the particular issues chosen...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{assessed}} the criterion validity and responsiveness of the Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire (IPEQ) specifically developed for aging research. METHODS: The sample comprised 315 community-dwelling inactive older adults (mean age = 73. 2 yr) {{who participated in}} a trial investigating {{the effect of a}} walking program on falls. At baseline, a subsample (n = 177) also wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT 1 M) for 7 d, and 126 of those had four valid days or more of accelerometer data. Validity coefficients (Spearman ρ) were calculated between accelerometer counts per minute, average steps per day, average moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) using two cut points (760 and 1041 counts per minute), and IPEQ-MVPA (the sum of physical activity hours per week derived from nine IPEQ items excluding the indoor chores question). Responsiveness was the mean IPEQ change in the intervention group divided by the SD of the mean change in control group. RESULTS: The correlation coefficients between IPEQ-MVPA and counts per minute per day and steps per day were 0. 33 and 0. 31, respectively. The coefficients with accelerometer MVPA at low and medium cut points were 0. 29 and 0. 33, respectively, and 0. 26 and 0. 35 for walking. The Bland-Altman plot showed increased errors with higher values of IPEQ-MVPA. IPEQ <b>incidental</b> physical activity <b>questions</b> and IPEQ as a whole were significantly correlated with accelerometer light intensity (100 - 760 counts per minute, ρ = 0. 29 and 0. 23). The 12 -month responsiveness of total IPEQ was 0. 30 and 0. 44 for the "planned walking" item. CONCLUSIONS: IPEQ provides a practical and valid measure of MVPA in surveillance and intervention studies. Incidental activities are mostly of a light-intensity nature, and their low ambulatory component may explain the lower correlation between IPEQ as a whole and accelerometer measures. © 2014 by the American college of Sports Medicine...|$|R

40|$|The Brussels regime, which {{regulates the}} matters of {{transnational}} litigation excludes arbitration from its scope. Upon {{formation of the}} Brussels regime the existing instruments concerning arbitration - the United Nations Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and the 1961 European Convention on International Commercial Arbitration - {{were believed to be}} sufficient. The original Brussels Convention 1968 on recognition and enforcement of judgments delivered in the courts of the EU Member States expressly provided for the exclusion of arbitration. The following Brussels I Regulation followed the trend and reinforced the exclusion of arbitration from their material scopes. The rationale for doing so was primarily the prevention of parallel proceedings and irreconcilable judgments. The arbitration exclusion from the Brussels regime has caused a fair amount of confusion, especially regarding the extent and limits of the exclusion. That is, whether the arbitration agreement, the arbitral award and its consequences are covered by the exclusion or they may fall under the scope of the Brussels regulation if they constitute only an <b>incidental</b> <b>question</b> to the main cause of action? The confusion was illustrated in the ECJ judgment West Tankers, which generated negative feedback from the arbitration community and indicated the need for reform. The recently adopted Recast Regulation took it upon itself to clarify the relationship between arbitration and the EU regime of transnational litigation. The exclusion is reinforced ye again and its boundaries are specified in the Preamble. However, whether or not the concerns about the extent and objectives of arbitration exclusion have been at present eliminated, remains to be seen...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{study of}} the use of common qualifiers in SNOMED CT {{definitions}} and the resulting classification was undertaken using combined lexical and semantic techniques. The accuracy of SNOMED authors in formulating definitions for pre-coordinated concepts was taken as a proxy for the expected accuracy of users formulating post-coordinated expressions. The study focused on “acute” and “chronic” as used within a module based on the UMLS CORE Problem List and using the pattern of SNOMED CT’s definition Acute disease and Chronic disease. Scripts were used to identify potential candidate concepts whose names suggested that they should be classified as acute or chronic findings. The potential candidates were filtered by local clinical experts to eliminate spurious lexical matches. Scripts were then use to determine which of the filtered candidates were not classified under acute or chronic findings as expected. The results were that 28 % and 20 % of candidate chronic and acute concepts, respectively, were not so classified. Of these candidate misclassifications, the large majority occurred because “acute” and “chronic” are sometimes specified by qualifiers for clinical course and sometimes for morphology, a fact mentioned but not fully detailed in the User Guide distributed with the SNOMED releases. This heterogeneous representation reflects a potential conflict between common usage in patient care and SNOMED’s origins in pathology. Other <b>incidental</b> findings included <b>questions</b> about the qualifier hierarchies themselves and issues with the underlying model for anatomy. The effort required for the study was kept modest by using module extraction and scripts, showing that such quality assurance of SNOMED is practical. The results of a preliminary study using proxy measures must be taken with caution. However, the high rate of misclassification indicates that, until the specifications for qualifiers are better documented and/or brought more in line with common clinical usage, anyone attempting to use post-coordination in SNOMED CT must be aware that there are significant pitfalls...|$|R
