50|$|Agar {{dilution}} {{is considered}} to be the gold standard of susceptibility testing, or the most accurate way to measure the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. The results of agar dilution are easily reproduced and they can be monitored at a much cheaper cost than what is required of other <b>dilution</b> <b>methods.</b> Additionally, up to thirty pathogen samples (plus two controls) can be tested at once, so agar dilution is useful for batch tests.|$|E
5000|$|Antibiotic {{sensitivity}} or antibiotic susceptibility is the [...] {{of bacteria}} to antibiotics. Because susceptibility can vary even within a species (with some strains being more resistant than others), antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is usually {{carried out to}} determine which antibiotic will be most successful in treating a bacterial infection in vivo. Testing for antibiotic sensitivity is often done by the Kirby-Bauer method. Small wafers containing antibiotics are placed onto a plate upon which bacteria are growing. If the bacteria {{are sensitive to the}} antibiotic, a clear ring, or zone of inhibition, is seen around the wafer indicating poor growth. Other methods to test antimicrobial susceptibility include the Stokes method, Etest (also based on antibiotic diffusion), Agar and Broth <b>dilution</b> <b>methods</b> for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. The results of the test are reported on the antibiogram.|$|E
50|$|Pulmonary {{function}} {{testing in}} patients with LAM may be normal or may reveal obstructive, restrictive or mixed patterns. Obstructive physiology {{is the most common}} abnormality. Quality-controlled lung function data were collected prospectively by the NHLBI Registry, a 5-year study of patients with LAM in centers around the United States. Spirometry revealed obstructive changes in about 57% of patients and normal results in 34%. Restriction, defined as a total lung capacity less than the lower limit of normal, was seen in 11%. Hyperinflation was present in about 6%. The average residual volume was 125% of predicted when measured by plethysmography, but was only 103% of predicted determined with gas <b>dilution</b> <b>methods,</b> suggesting significant air trapping in noncommunicating airspaces. Approximately 25% of patients with obstructive physiology may demonstrate bronchodilator responsiveness but may be less in more severe obstruction. The obstructive physiologic defect in LAM is primarily attributable to airflow obstruction. The earliest change in initial pulmonary function testing in various case series was abnormal gas transfer, as assessed by the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), described in 82% to 97% of patients. It is not unusual for DLCO to be reduced out of proportion to forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Reduction in DLCO and increase in residual volume are generally considered to be LAM's earliest physiologic manifestations.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimating}} total body water (TBW) using breath analyses of blood ethanol content is described. Regression analysis of ethanol concentration curves permits determination of a theoretical concentration {{that would have}} existed if complete equilibration had taken place immediately upon ingestion of the ethanol; the water fraction of normal blood may then be used to calculate TBW. The ethanol <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> is applied to 35 subjects, and comparison with a tritium <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> of determining TBW indicates that {{the correlation between the}} two procedures is highly significant. Lean body mass and fat fraction were determined by hydrostatic weighing, and these data also prove compatible with results obtained from the ethanol <b>dilution</b> <b>method.</b> In contrast to the radioactive tritium <b>dilution</b> <b>method,</b> the ethanol <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> can be repeated daily with its applicability ranging from diseased individuals to individuals subjected to thermal stress, strenuous exercise, water immersion, or the weightless conditions of space flights...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Two of the {{different}} types of antibiotic susceptibility tests available are the solid media based Kirby Bauer method and the liquid media based microbroth <b>dilution</b> <b>method.</b> The microbroth <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> has become more widely used due to its ability to become automated, however, the Kirby Bauer method may be able to detect subpopulations of resistant bacteria that would be visualized as inner colonies in the zone of diffusion. Using Gram negative rod isolated collected from the UWMC clinical microbiology laboratory, the presence of inner colonies was screened and both methods were compared to determine if the microbroth <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> was able to detect the additional resistance of the subpopulations. The data went to show that the microbroth <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> was not detecting the additional resistance in about 68 % of the isolates tested. It was unable to be determined if the results were due a limitation of the microbroth <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> or whether it is an artifact of the testing methods, but it does open up the possibilities of further testing to determine the cause of the disparity in results...|$|R

5000|$|After {{his work}} on the G-Suit, Wood worked on {{techniques}} for measuring cardiac blood flow. He was granted a patent for the ear oximeter, an optical instrument that measures blood oxygen levels without taking blood by examining the variation of light absorption as a function of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. Integral to the work leading {{to the development of the}} G suit was the perfection of vascular catheterization methods needed to understand the distribution of blood pressure and flow. Shortly after the end of World War II, open-heart surgery emerged with the Mayo contribution to the development of the heart-lung bypass machine initially developed by Gibbons and perfected by Wood and colleagues. Wood's work at the Mayo Clinic lead to the development of many technologies allowing for the assessment of the heart and lungs including dye <b>dilution</b> <b>methods</b> serving to characterize cardiac output, methods for the assessment of central blood volume, the calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance (known as the [...] "Wood Unit" [...] and calculated by subtracting pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and dividing by the cardiac output), analog subtraction angiography, and eventually the Dynamic Spatial Reconstructor (DSR), a predecessor to modern high speed volumetric computed tomography (CT) allowing for the evaluation of the beating heart and breathing lungs. The DSR comprised 14 X-ray tubes and a hemicylindrical fluorescent screen imaged by 14 associated television cameras.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the validity of a new gas <b>dilution</b> <b>method</b> (GD) for measuring human body volume and to compare its accuracy with the results obtained by the underwater weighing method (UW). We measured the volume of plastic bottles and 16 subjects (including two females), aged 18 - 42 years with each method. For the bottles, the volume measured by hydrostatic weighing was correlated highly (r = 1. 000) with that measured by the new gas <b>dilution</b> <b>method.</b> For the subjects, the body volume determined by the two methods was significantly correlated (r = 0. 998).
