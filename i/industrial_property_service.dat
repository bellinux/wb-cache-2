40|$|In view of {{the factors}} {{influencing}} and the steps {{in the design of}} a Website, building a successful Website will vary from business to business. This study investigates what is required from a small commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> and <b>services</b> business to take their business online and create an effective Website. The environment of the property market reflected the role that government plays in the property industry and also the role of the private sector. Marketing in the real estate context indicated that if real estate agents have access to the right type of information, not only can they add value to their own organizations, but they can also capitalize on the same information to create added value for their clients. The elements of the marketing management process include four steps, namely to gather information, to set marketing goals and plan strategy, to organize and implement marketing strategy and to control the marketing activities. Marketing in the online environment showed that the Marketing Mix includes personalisation, privacy, customer services, community, site, security and sales promotion. The principles of online marketing revealed the important role of the customer and customer relationships. An investigation into the difference between e-commerce and online marketing made it clear that online marketing is one component of e-commerce. This study critically analysed the available literature in order to suggest a proposed framework of what {{should be included in the}} Website of a small commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> and <b>services</b> business. In order to successfully research online marketing of commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>properties</b> and <b>services</b> in a small business, a basic but thorough understanding of online marketing principles and Website content are important. In this study a qualitative research approach was followed where secondary sources were critically evaluated to design the required framework. Thereafter three Websites of marketing of commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>properties</b> and <b>services</b> were content analysed to see whether anything else should be added to the framework. This would assist in taking a small business in commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>properties</b> and <b>services</b> online. The framework suggests that the Website homepage content should include:  Business overview/information Products/services What’s new Search Employment opportunities Interactive feedback Customer service/ assistance Index/directory  Financial facts Links to other sites Online business services/utilities  Guest book Frequently Asked Questions Messages from CEO A purposeful sample of three Websites was then content analysed so as to provide the information necessary to reach the objectives of the study. The following Websites were included in the content analysis: Broll, which operates as a national agency with international associations. The firm renders services (Estate Agency) and does not own property. Bruce McWilliams Industries Pty Ltd is operative in Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage and surrounds. It is a family business that owns property, which it develops and markets itself. Seeff is a national agency. It renders services (estate agency) and does not own property. Lastly, a narrative of a small commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> and <b>services</b> business was created by means of document analysis of a specific business. The researcher was allowed to study the documents and diaries of the business in order to provide a narrative for this business. This narrative can be used as part of the envisaged Website for the business...|$|R

As follows from the introductory chapters, although <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> rights is an integral and important part of the economic life of almost every business, there is no consensus among experts in public opinion, which issues are part of an <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> and which are not. To a large extent, these discrepancies are caused by lack of legal definition of <b>industrial</b> <b>property.</b> Although this concept is logical {{in the sense that it}} does not intend to circumscribe the de lege lata <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> in order to prevent accidental closure of the legal concept for the future. But on the other hand, in some cases complicates the interpretation of legal provisions in force, which leaves the blurred boundaries of <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> and the dual perceptions of the concept. It thus contributes to legal uncertainty, for example, the enforcement of intellectual property when it is not clear how the broad range of subjects of <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> is Act No. 221 / 2006 Sb.
