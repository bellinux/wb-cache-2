The quality requirements are stringent, {{especially in the}} cockpit where air safety is involved. Based on these considerations, {{a decision was made}} to test an intermediate data rate such as 8. 0 and 9. 6 kb/s as proven technologies. A number of vocoders and codec technologies were investigated at rates ranging from 2. 4 kb/s up to and including 9. 6 kb/s. The proven vocoders operating at 2. 4 and 4. 8 kb/s lacked the noise immunity or the robustness to operate reliably in a cabin noise environment. One very attractive alternative approach was Spectrally Encoded Residual Excited LPC (SE-RELP) which is used in a multi-rate voice processor (MRP) developed at the Naval Research Lab (NRL). The MRP uses SE-RELP at rates of 9. 6 and 16 kb/s. The 9. 6 kb/s rate can be lowered to 8. 0 kb/s without loss of information by modifying the frame.

The functions of measuring instruments and measured equipments are always affected by technical parameters of the electrical energy, which supplies apparatus and arrangements. Disturbing signals, which are propagate by power line along the supply system or by the form of radiated electromagnetic waves, get through measuring circuits. The relevance of all effects grows up with the increasing of the accuracy and sensitivity of taken measurements.

Disturbances made by power supply in measuring systems Measuring systems in laboratory are usually constructed for power supply from the distribution supply network of low voltage.

Most of those activities have been related to emission and immunity regarding low voltage equipment for domestic or industrial use. Some work has also been done regarding <b>immunity</b> <b>requirements</b> for equipment in high voltage power stations and substations. Very little has been done regarding how to specify and verify emission requirements from high voltage substations, especially when power electronic equipment is involved. The characteristics of radio interference (RI) from high voltage lines due to corona are well known and documented in the CISPR 18 series. The less well-known characteristics of RI due to sparks are also indicated in the CISPR 18 series. During the past decades a third source of RI has become more and more important, i. e. power electronic equipment. The characteristics of RI from large power electronic equipment can be very different depending on system design and type of semiconductor elements used. For controlling the RI emission, both the formulation of the requirements and the methodology for verification measurements have to be reconsidered. Regarding RI from power electronics it is not sufficient to measure the emission at 0. 5 MHz, as is sometimes done for controlling RI due to corona.

Experimental findings support the concept that the balance between T cell–induced inflammation and T cell suppressor responses is critical for the regulation of blood pressure levels. Expression of neoantigens in response to inflammation, as well as surfacing of intracellular immunogenic proteins, such as heat shock pro-teins, could be responsible for autoimmune reactivity in the kidney, arter-ies, and central nervous system.

We {{hypothesized that the}} characteristics of DC interaction with SVLP would elaborate on the roles of cell membrane and intracellular compartments in the handling of a virus-like entity known for its efficacy as a vaccine. DC rapidly bind SVLP within min, co-localised with CTB and CD 9, but not caveolin- 1. In contrast, internalisation is a relatively slow process, delivering SVLP into the cell periphery where they are maintained {{for a number of}} hrs in association with microtubules. Although there is early association with clathrin, this is no longer seen after 10 min. Association with EEA- 1 (+) early endosomes is also early, but proteolytic processing appears slow, the SVLP-vesicles remaining peripheral. Association with transferrin occurs rarely, and only in the periphery, possibly signifying translocation of some SVLP for delivery to B-lymphocytes. Most SVLP co-localise with high molecular weight dextran. Uptake of both is impaired with mature DC, but there remains a residual uptake of SVLP. These results imply that DC use multiple endocytic routes for SVLP uptake, dominated by caveolin-independent, lipid raft-mediated macropinocytosis. With most SVLP-containing vesicles being retained in the periphery, not always interacting with early endosomes, this relates to slow proteolytic degradation and antigen retention by DC. The present characterization allows for a definition of how DC handle virus-like particles showing efficacious immunogenicity, elements valuable for novel vaccine design in the future...|$|R

Murine and human DC are composed of a number of phenotypically, and probably developmentally, distinct subsets, which may play unique roles in the initiation and regulation of T cell responses. The skin is populated by at least two subsets of DC: Langerhans cells (LC), which form a contiguous network throughout the epidermis, and dermal DC. LC have classically been thought vital to initiate T cell responses to cutaneous Ags. However, recent data have highlighted the importance of dermal DC in cutaneous <b>immunity,</b> and the <b>requirement</b> for LC has become unclear. To define the relative roles of LC and dermal DC, we and others generated mouse models in which LC were specifically depleted in vivo. Unexpectedly, these studies yielded conflicting data as to the role of LC in cutaneous contact hypersensitivity (CHS).

The amino acid sequence and structure of SeM has been determined and compared to that of a second, 40 -kDa M-like protein (SzPSe) of S. equi and to those of other streptococcal proteins. Both SeM and SzPSe are mainly alpha-helical fibrillar molecules with no homology other than that between their signal and membrane anchor sequences and are only distantly related to other streptococcal M and M-like proteins. The sequence of SzPSe indicates that it is an allele of SzP that encodes the variable protective M-like and typing antigens of S. zooepidemicus (S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus). SeM is opsonogenic for S. equi but not for the closely related S. zooepidemicus, whereas SzPSe is strongly opsonogenic for S. zooepidemicus but not for S. equi. Both proteins bind equine fibrinogen. SeM and SzPSe proteins from temporally and geographically separated isolates of S. equi are identical in size. The results taken together support previous evidence that S. equi is a clonal pathogen originating from an ancestral strain of S. zooepidemicus.

40|$|National {{courts have}} long {{understood}} the UN to have absolute immunity from their jurisdiction, based upon {{provisions in the}} UN Charter and the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the UN. While state immunity has evolved over recent decades, allowing restrictive immunity that distinguishes between acts jure imperii and those jure gestionis, questions have arisen as to whether that doctrine applies to international organizations and, specifically, the UN. The counterbalance to the UN’s absolute <b>immunity</b> is the <b>requirement</b> that it provide alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes. This raises concerns about accountability and internal review. Case law from various courts demonstrates an increasing willingness to attempt to challenge absolute immunity {{on the basis that}} the bar to jurisdiction violates claimants’ rights to access a court and to a remedy. In all of those cases, individuals’ ability to access alternative mechanisms for dispute resolution has been used to show that their rights have been realized. Recent events concerning the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti may lead to a challenge to the UN’s absolute immunity. The UN has deemed those claims to be ‘not receivable’, which denies the claimants their rights to access a court and to a remedy. In October 2013, lawyers for the Haiti cholera victims filed a class action in the Southern District of New York, seeking to challenge the UN’s immunity by bringing the Organization before a national court. This article explores whether the events in Haiti may provide the first successful, human rights-based challenge to the UN’s absolute immunity...|$|R

Complications can arise when attempts to address {{each of these}} factors result in conflicting design features. This exemplifies the difficulties often faced by engineers in attempting to produce a truly sustainable design, let alone one that is compliant with all statutory guidelines. The trapezoidal, concrete-lined drain at Charles Darwin University (CDU), typifies these challenges. Various desktop, on-site studies and simulations were undertaken to model the catchment hydrology, and hydraulic characteristics of the existing stormwater drain at CDU. Results indicate that the existing drainage structure has adequate capacity to convey the 63. 2 % and 1 % AEP storm event without overtopping. However, moderate overbank flooding is expected when these storm events occur in conjunction with peak tidal influence from Rapid Creek. For all combinations of storm and tidal events, the stormwater flows are contained within the drainage reserve at CDU. Alternative, sustainable drainage designs, and their associated physical economic, social and ecological considerations, were also investigated. The United States Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS model {{was used to assess}} these alternatives, and provided an indication of their likely hydraulic performance. The viability of these alternatives was also assessed against a number of factors including; public health and safety, amenity, functional use, ecological impacts, flooding <b>immunity,</b> future community <b>requirements</b> and overall cost of implementation. Results of the analysis indicate that works directed towards reducing stormwater runoff, nutrients, and gross pollutants from the upstream catchment, would provide the most cost-effective and overall, sustainable design solution on-site...|$|R
