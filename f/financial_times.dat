It is clearly of importance to study the <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series, to understand the mechanism giving rise to the data, and/or predict the future values of a series. This thesis is dedicated to statistical inferences {{of a number of}} models for <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. <b>Financial</b> <b>time</b> series often exhibit time-varying and clustering volatility (conditional vari-ance), which were not handled well by traditional models, until the development of the autore-gressive conditionally heteroscedastic (ARCH) and the generalized ARCH (GARCH) models.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series from U. S. Fixed Income Market, S&P 500, Exchange Market and Oil Market. It {{is well known}} that <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series reveal some anomalies as regards the Efficient Market Hypotesis and some scaling behavior is evident such as fat tails and clustered volatility. This suggests to consider <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> serie as "pseudo"-random time series. For this kind of time series the power of prediction of neural networks {{has been shown to be}} appreciable. We first consider the <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> serie from the Minority Game point of view and than we apply a neural network with learning algorithm in order to analyze its prediction power. We show that Fixed Income Market presents many differences from other markets in terms of predictability as a measure of market efficiency.

40|$|In this work, we {{deal with}} the {{modeling}} of multivariate <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. First, linear models of multivariate time series are described and further special features of the <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. In the next part of the thesis, we focus on modeling multivariate volatility and present several models {{that can be used in}} this context. In the practical part of the work, we apply some of these models on real data using the software systems EViews 9 and RATS 8. As the first one, we analyze gradually two-dimensional and five-dimensional <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. The aim of thesis is to survey the temporary state of multivariate volatility modeling in <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series including practical experience with specialized software. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Financial time {{sequence}} analysis {{has been a}} popular research topic {{in the field of}} finance, data science and machine learning. It is a highly challenging due to the extreme complexity within the sequences. Mostly existing models are failed to capture its intrinsic information, factor and tendency. To improve the previous approaches, in this paper, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) based approach to analyze the <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> sequence. The fluctuation of <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> sequence was predicted through introducing a dual-state HMMs. Dual-state HMMs models the sequence and produces the features which will be delivered to SVMs for prediction. Note that we cast a <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> sequence prediction problem to a classification problem. To evaluate the proposed approach, we use Shanghai Composite Index as the dataset for empirically experiments. The dataset was collected from 550 consecutive trading days, and is randomly split to the training set and test set. The extensively experimental results show that: when analyzing <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> sequence, the mean-square error calculated with HMMs was obviously smaller error than the compared GARCH approach. Therefore, when using HMM to predict the fluctuation of <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> sequence, it achieves higher accuracy and exhibits several attractive advantageous over GARCH approach...|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>time</b> series {{prediction}} is a challenging task {{due to the}} fluctuation of trading or economic exchange {{that is difficult to}} predict. Researchers from different fields have been attracted to perform several techniques for identifying reliability of the <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series prediction. Finding of research papers, the financial trend patterns repeat itself in the history. Thus, this research motivates and aims to investigate the repeat behaviour and pattern of trends from the historical <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series data, and utilise the strength of machine learning techniques to develop a promising <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series predictor engine. In this research, two frameworks are proposed for <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series prediction. In the first proposed framework, candlestick pattern is utilised as technical analysis method to identify the financial trends. Thereafter, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented separately to train with the trend patterns for predicting the movement direction of financial trends. In the second proposed framework, Linear Regression Line (LRL) is utilised to identify the trend patterns from historical <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series, which is supported by ANN and SVM for classification process separately. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is utilised through brute force to predict the trend movement. The experimental results showed that the second proposed model is consistent with the hypothesis, which provides better accuracy of prediction. Therefore, the findings of this research help in improving the accuracy of prediction model...|$|R

We also introduce an index to quantitatively measure the clustering behaviour of fluctuations in these time series and show that big losses in financial markets usually lump more severely than big gains. We further give examples to demonstrate that comparing to conventional methods, our index enables one to extract more information from the <b>financial</b> <b>time</b> series. ...|$|R
