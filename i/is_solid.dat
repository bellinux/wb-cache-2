5|$|Quantities {{of atoms}} {{are found in}} {{different}} states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An example of this <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond. Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it <b>is</b> <b>solid.</b> In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest protrudes past {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and {{malleable}} metal that <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> at room temperature, {{though it is}} hard and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35K.|$|E

5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance <b>is</b> <b>solid.</b> In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E
5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture <b>is</b> <b>solid,</b> after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|Its {{main body}} <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E

5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> and 2–2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E

50|$|The Catalan <b>solids</b> <b>are</b> all convex. They are face-transitive but not vertex-transitive. This {{is because}} the dual Archimedean <b>solids</b> <b>are</b> vertex-transitive and not face-transitive. Note that unlike Platonic solids and Archimedean solids, the faces of Catalan <b>solids</b> <b>are</b> not regular polygons. However, the vertex figures of Catalan <b>solids</b> <b>are</b> regular, and they have {{constant}} dihedral angles. <b>Being</b> face-transitive, Catalan <b>solids</b> <b>are</b> isohedra.|$|R
5|$|The protagonist <b>is</b> <b>Solid</b> Snake, {{a legendary}} infiltrator and saboteur. During the mission, Snake {{receives}} support and advice via codec radio. Colonel Roy Campbell, Solid Snake's former commanding officer, supports Snake with advice and tactics. While he initially keeps {{a number of}} secrets from Snake, he gradually reveals them. He is joined by Naomi Hunter, who gives medical advice; Nastasha Romanenko, who provides item and weapon tips; Master Miller, a former drill instructor and survival coach; and Mei Ling, who invented the soliton radar system used in the mission and is also in charge of mission data; the player can call her to save the game.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{moves out}} of the Van Houten house and manages to keep a cheery {{attitude}} until he is fired from {{his job at the}} cracker factory. Luann quickly readjusts to single life with Milhouse and starts a new relationship with an American Gladiator. While at Moe's, Kirk mentions that he never saw the divorce coming and regrets not being more sensitive to Luann's needs. Homer cheers Kirk up by telling him that his marriage to Marge <b>is</b> <b>solid,</b> but Homer soon begins to fear that his marriage may end in divorce. Homer enlists the aid of Lisa to help him figure out how to save his marriage, but Lisa tells Homer that he is lucky to have Marge. He recalls his wedding reception, which was nothing more than Homer and Marge eating a whale cake at a roadside truck stop. Homer tries to perform selfless gestures for Marge, but they only serve to annoy her.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Padayappa {{discovers that}} a hill on his {{property}} <b>is</b> <b>solid</b> granite, which allows him to start a granite business, from which he becomes rich. He uses the money {{to help the poor}} in his village, and provide them jobs. As his business flourishes, his family is able to once again settle down. Padayappa assumes his father's position as the village chieftain, and his sister gets married to one of the engineers who work in his company. When Neelambari learns about Padayappa's love for Vasundhara, she becomes jealous of her, and her parents beg Padayappa's widowed mother to allow Neelambari to marry Padayappa. However, to everyone's surprise, Padayappa's mother embarrasses Padayappa's maternal uncle in front of the entire village when she agrees to a marriage proposal made by Vasundhara's mother, her brother's servant. Unable to bear the humiliation, Padayappa's maternal uncle commits suicide. When Neelambari tries to kill Vasundhara by letting a bull loose on her, Padayappa saves her, after which the two marry. After the wedding, Neelambari locks herself in a room in Suryaprakash's house, thinking only about Padayappa for 18 years. In between, Padayappa finds his father's foster brother in trouble and was pulled out by a financier, from whom he had borrowed money on interest keeping the family house, and helps his father's foster brother, who is suffering financially. As a result, Padayappa's father's foster brother becomes indebted to him and seeks Padayappa's pardon for his misdeeds; Padayappa forgives him.|$|E
