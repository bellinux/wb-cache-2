5|$|Although Gooding's character, Darrin, was in {{love with}} Beyoncé's character, Lilly, the latter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> feel the same until later on in the film. Near the end of the film, he proposes to her and she accepts. They {{eventually}} get married (offscreen) and within eighteen months they had a baby son together, making Darrin a father and also stepfather to Lilly's other son.|$|E
5|$|Colonels wore three gold {{stars of}} the same size on their collar; the same as generals, but without the wreath. While {{lieutenant}} colonels wore two stars on their collars, majors wore one star, which was placed {{in the middle of the}} collar. Captains had three gold horizontal bars, first lieutenants wore two bars, and second lieutenants wore one bar. However, the Confederate Congress often created new commissions, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> standardize rank insignia immediately.|$|E

50|$|Polyandry {{could also}} pose genetic fitness consequences. Polyandry <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{result in the}} spread of the most {{adaptive}} genes. For example, some individuals may appear to be attractive due to genes that code for increased pheromone production. As a result, attractive individuals are more likely to reproduce more often. However, since these individuals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> contain adaptive genes, multiple mating events <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> result in the propagation of adaptive genes.|$|R

5|$|Most of the overtures are {{in three}} sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a {{concluding}} allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> follow this pattern. The overture to Princess Ida, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to Utopia Limited {{is dominated by}} a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed well away from the students, and partly because after the competition the students <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E

He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there for many of his classmates, and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Seymour Cray {{began the}} design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> meet this goal, this was a useful technique in defining the project and clarifying what sort of process improvements would be needed to meet it. For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E
50|$|Other terms {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} redevelopment include urban renewal (urban revitalization). While efforts described as urban revitalization often involve redevelopment, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> involve redevelopment as they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> involve the demolition of any existing structures but may instead describe the rehabilitation of existing buildings or other neighborhood improvement initiatives.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} met with mixed {{reception}} from video game critics. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> function properly. The Simpsons Game received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture {{capital in the}} state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|These later castles <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> have a keep, {{but this}} may have been because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E

5|$|Yet Brooks <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed {{her from}} the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A {{striking}} example is her 1914–15 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an interior designer whom she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{see eye to}} eye with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> {{play their}} home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the Second World War the stadium {{was used as}} an ARP station and was bombed; Arsenal played their matches at White Hart Lane, home of North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal's home UEFA Champions League matches in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons were played at Wembley Stadium, as Highbury's already limited {{capacity}} had to be reduced to accommodate advertising hoardings. Arsenal's record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not least because since Wembley closed for rebuilding in October 2000, {{it would not have been}} able to host their 2000–01 campaign.|$|E

5|$|By William's death, after {{weathering}} {{a series}} of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy {{had been replaced by}} Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.|$|E
5|$|Political {{boundaries}} {{drawn by}} the British <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark {{in the form of}} divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of Indians emigrating {{to other parts of the}} empire, such as Malaysia and Fiji, and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean. The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to immigration to Britain from its former colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Comos' first child, Ronnie, {{was born}} in 1940 while the Weems band was working in Chicago. Como left the {{performance}} to be at his wife's side {{even though he was}} threatened with dismissal if he did so. Though Perry was now making $250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem, young Ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were able to stay in one place for a period of time. The radio program Beat the Band <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> originate from Chicago, but was often done from locations such as Milwaukee, Denver and St. Louis, as the band continued to play road engagements while part of the radio show cast. The Comos decided road life was no place to try raising a child, and Roselle and the baby went back to Canonsburg.|$|E
