5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led {{to a decline in}} the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of coyotes practiced by rural people, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children. Non-rabid coyotes in these areas sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten.|$|E

5|$|Several inner-city neighborhoods <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> gentrify {{in recent}} years. Areas {{on both the}} west side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the east side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy) have been {{successful}} in attracting increasing numbers of creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development. Furthermore, a live-work zoning overlay for the city's near east side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.|$|E
60|$|On this {{beautiful}} isle, {{at the time}} of our tale, the churches and houses of Christian men <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> rise. The natives <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> cultivate the arts of civilisation, and to appreciate, in some degree, the inestimable blessings of Christianity. The plough had torn up the virgin soil, and the anchors of merchant-ships <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> kiss the strand. The crimes peculiar to civilised men had not yet been developed.

5|$|Although the Rolling Stones {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> view the Rolling Stones as an outdated band.|$|R
5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> appear in the library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect {{and the construction of}} a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> {{overflow}} at about 05:20.

5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E
5|$|Newark is New Jersey's {{largest and}} second-most racially diverse city (after {{neighboring}} Jersey City). It {{is divided into}} five political wards, which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.|$|E
5|$|Organizations are now {{attempting}} to assist and empower female migrant workers through {{training and education}} on their labor-related rights. Legal clinics <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> assist female migrants in filing claims against employers and local labor bureaus. One case of female worker exploitation in the Hua Yi garment factory in Beijing resulted in mistreatment by management as well as withholding pay for at least 24 women. After filing complaints, {{in collaboration with the}} Center for Women's Law Studies and Legal Services of Beijing University, the women received 170,000 Yuan in back wages and compensation.|$|E

5|$|Power remains {{relatively}} inexpensive along the Columbia, {{and in recent}} years high-tech companies like Google <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids {{in a large}} bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E

5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable. Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E

5|$|As the Osiris myth first {{appears in}} the Pyramid Texts, most of its {{essential}} features must have taken shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> coalesce into a single story {{by the time of}} the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain maat, and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.|$|E
