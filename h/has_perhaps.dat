5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to grow into one of Britain's largest cities. This led to {{widespread}} building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most surviving examples of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|E
5|$|Popery is {{favourable}} to ceremony; {{and among}} the ignorant nations ceremony is the only preservative of tradition. Since Protestantism was extended to the savage parts of Scotland, it <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{been one of the}} chief labours of the Ministers to abolish stated observances, because they continued the remembrance of the former religion.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich von Treitschke's History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, {{published}} in 1879, <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> a misleading title: it privileges {{the history of}} Prussia over the history of other German states, and it {{tells the story of}} the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this Borussian myth (Borussia is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this. According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. The story continues by drawing on Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon's power in 1815, at Waterloo, creating some semblance of economic unity, and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871.|$|E

5|$|The crocodilian <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{the most}} complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E

One manifestation of Japanese resistance to Sinocentrism was the insistence {{for many years in}} the early 20th century on using the name Shina (支那) for China, based on the Western word 'China', in preference to Chūgoku (中国 Central Country) advocated by the Chinese themselves.|$|E

In 1894, Ibrahim George Kheiralla, a Syrian Bahá'í immigrant, established a community in the U.S. He later left the main group and founded a rival movement. According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies newsletter published March, 2017, based on data from 2010, Bahá'ís were the largest minority religion in 80 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country.|$|E
25|$|No.46 Newington <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{the most}} unusual history. Following {{withdrawal}} in 1963, the locomotive was sold to the Sadler Rail Coach company based at Droxford, Hampshire on the disused Meon Valley Railway. It was used on occasion between the Droxford and Wickham stations on that line. Subsequently it was sold to the Portsmouth-based Brickwoods brewery in the Spring of 1966. The brewery wanted to purchase it for use outside a new public house to be opened on Hayling Island named The Hayling Billy. The engine was displayed there {{for a number of}} years, becoming locally famous, before being donated to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway in 1979.|$|E

25|$|While {{the first}} officially {{documented}} appearance of Blaufränkisch {{did not occur}} until 1862 when the grape was included in a viticultural exposition in Vienna, Austria, {{it is likely that}} the grape is much older, and <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> been around as long as the Middle Ages under a variety of Fränkisch synonyms. The term Fränkisch itself comes from Franconia, the German wine region that includes northwest Bavaria, the northeastern reaches of Baden-Württemberg around Heilbronn-Franken, and parts of southern Thuringia. During the Middle Ages the wine from this region was highly praised, and grapes that were thought to be capable of producing superior wines were called Fränkisch to distinguish them from the less highly prized Hunnic grapes. It is likely that from sometime during this period up until the 1900s, Blaufränkisch (literally Blue Frankish), began to be grown in the region.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the plume}} model, {{the source of}} Icelandic {{volcanism}} lies deep beneath {{the center of the}} island. The earliest volcanic rocks attributed to the plume are found {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Their ages have been determined to lie between 58 and 64 million years. This coincides with the opening of the north Atlantic in the late Paleocene and early Eocene, which has led to suggestions that the arrival of the plume was linked to, and <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> contributed to, the breakup of the North Atlantic continent. In the framework of the plume hypothesis, the volcanism was caused by the flow of hot plume material initially beneath thick continental lithosphere and then beneath the lithosphere of the growing ocean basin as rifting proceeded. The exact position of the plume at that time is a matter of disagreement between scientists, as is whether the plume is thought to have ascended from the deep mantle only at that time or whether it is much older and also responsible for the old volcanism in northern Greenland, on Ellesmere Island, and at Alpha Ridge in the Arctic.|$|E
25|$|Philip has {{generally}} left a poor legacy with historians. Three major historians {{of the period}} have described an 'undistinguished and insignificant man', a 'miserable monarch', whose 'only virtue appeared to reside in a total absence of vice'. More generally, Philip has largely retained the reputation of 'a weak, dim-witted monarch who preferred hunting and travelling to governing'. Unlike Philip IV, whose reputation has improved significantly {{in the light of}} recent analysis, Philip III's reign has been relatively unstudied, possibly because of the negative interpretation given to the role of Philip and Lerma during the period. Traditionally, the decline of Spain has been placed from the 1590s onwards; revisionist historians from the 1960s, however, presented an alternative analysis, arguing that in many ways Philip III's Spain of 1621 – reinforced with new territories in Alsace, at peace with France, dominant in the Holy Roman Empire, and about to begin a successful campaign against the Dutch – was in a much stronger position than in 1598, despite the poor personal performance of her king during the period. Philip's use of Lerma as his valido has formed one of the key historical and contemporary criticisms against him; recent work <b>has</b> <b>perhaps</b> begun to present a more nuanced picture of the relationship and the institution that survived for the next forty years in Spanish royal government.|$|E

500|$|In {{an early}} {{review in the}} 1831 Westminster Review, J.
