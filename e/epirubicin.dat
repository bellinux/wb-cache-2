25|$|Ellence (<b>epirubicin)</b> {{for cancer}} and a {{chemotherapy}} drug.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{depends on}} the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or {{carboplatin}} or oxaliplatin) every three weeks with fluorouracil (5-FU) either continuously or every three weeks. In more recent studies, addition of <b>epirubicin</b> was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, cisplatin and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial – for example – compares four regimens containing <b>epirubicin</b> and either cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and either continuously infused fluorouracil or capecitabine.|$|E
25|$|Cardiotoxicity (heart damage) is {{especially}} prominent {{with the use}} of anthracycline drugs (doxorubicin, <b>epirubicin,</b> idarubicin, and liposomal doxorubicin). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of free radicals in the cell and subsequent DNA damage. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are cyclophosphamide, docetaxel and clofarabine.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{clinical}} trials {{have shown that}} Totect (USA) or Savene (Europe) (dexrazoxane for extravasation) is effective in preventing the progression of anthracycline extravasation into progressive tissue necrosis. In two open-label, single arm, phase II multicenter {{clinical trials}}, necrosis was prevented in 98% of the patients. Dexrazoxane for extravasation is the only registered antidote for extravasation of anthracyclines (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, <b>epirubicin,</b> idarubicin, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in {{ovarian cancer}} {{typically}} consists of platins, {{a group of}} platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, <b>epirubicin,</b> and gemcitabine. Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel. Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin {{in that it is}} less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, lipiodol {{has been}} used with the {{chemotherapy}} agent <b>epirubicin,</b> but with less success than with doxorubicin. [...] <b>Epirubicin</b> is less lipophilic than doxorubicin. [...] However, a [...] "water/oil/water" [...] microemulsion, in which <b>epirubicin</b> was dissolved in droplets of water, and the droplets were suspended in lipiodol, significantly increased uptake of <b>epirubicin</b> by HCC cells.|$|E
2500|$|Among the anthracyclines, {{doxorubicin}} and daunorubicin {{were the}} first, and {{were obtained from}} the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. [...] Derivatives of these compounds include <b>epirubicin</b> and idarubicin. Other clinically used drugs in the anthracyline group are pirarubicin, aclarubicin, and mitoxantrone. The mechanisms of anthracyclines include DNA intercalation (molecules insert between the two strands of DNA), generation of highly reactive free radicals that damage intercellular molecules and topoisomerase inhibition.|$|E
2500|$|Iodized {{poppy-seed oil}} has an {{especially}} {{high rate of}} uptake into the cells of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). [...] This property was soon recognized {{as an opportunity to}} deliver to HCC a variety of highly toxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy agents, and formed the basis of several therapies for HCC not treatable by surgery alone. [...] Injected emulsions of <b>epirubicin</b> in lipiodol are popular, but greater stability is needed.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Epirubicin</b> is favoured over doxorubicin, {{the most}} popular anthracycline, in some {{chemotherapy}} regimens as it appears to cause fewer side-effects. <b>Epirubicin</b> has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4' carbon of the sugar - it has the opposite chirality - which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. <b>Epirubicin</b> is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|Patent {{protection}} for <b>epirubicin</b> expired in August 2007.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Epirubicin</b> is an {{anthracycline}} drug {{used for}} chemotherapy. It {{can be used}} in combination with other medications to treat breast cancer in patients who have had surgery to remove the tumor. It is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Ellence in the US and Pharmorubicin or <b>Epirubicin</b> Ebewe elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|Doxorubicin and <b>epirubicin</b> are two epimers {{that are}} used as drugs.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{to other}} anthracyclines, <b>epirubicin</b> acts by intercalating DNA strands.Intercalation results in complex {{formation}} which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It also triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in mechanisms {{that lead to}} cell death. Binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins {{may be involved in}} the compound's cytotoxic effects. <b>Epirubicin</b> also generates free radicals that cause cell and DNA damage.|$|E
50|$|Daunorubicin is {{also used}} as the {{starting}} material for semi-synthetic manufacturing of doxorubicin, <b>epirubicin</b> and idarubicin.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the many}} first’s, {{the company was}} able to develop several Doxoubicin, <b>Epirubicin,</b> Pantoprazole, Clopidogrel, Resperidone, Sertralene, Lamotrigene and Quinfadie drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first trial}} of <b>epirubicin</b> in humans was {{published}} in 1980.Upjohn applied for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in node-positive breast cancer in 1984, but was turned down {{because of lack of}} data. It appears to have been licensed for use in Europe from around this time however. In 1999 Pharmacia (who had by then merged with Upjohn) received FDA approval for the use of <b>epirubicin</b> as a component of adjuvant therapy in node-positive patients.|$|E
5000|$|Application of focused {{ultrasound}} {{in conjunction}} with microbubbles {{has been shown to}} enable non-invasive delivery of <b>epirubicin</b> across the blood-brain barrier in mouse models.|$|E

50|$|Results of {{two studies}} {{regarding}} adenocarcinomas have shown matuzumab {{to be well}} tolerated in combination with two standard chemotherapies - cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (PFL) as well as <b>epirubicin,</b> cisplatin and capecitabine (ECX) - as a first line therapy. Rates of response were up to 53% {{with a combination of}} matuzumab and ECX.|$|E

5000|$|Rituximab is {{a widely}} used {{monoclonal}} antibody in treating B-cell malignancies, it is directed against the surface protein CD20. Case studies have documented successful treatment of B-PLL solely with rituximab; additional studies have reported positive activity when rituximab is paired with the chemotherapeutic drugs fludarabine or bendamustine together with the anthracyclines mitoxantrone or <b>epirubicin</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Increased {{expression}} of LAPTM4B {{has been found}} in breast, liver, lung, ovarian, uterine, gastric cancers. Elevated LAPTM4B level contributes to chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. It was found that over{{expression of}} LAPTM4B causes anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and <b>epirubicin)</b> resistance by retaining drug in the cytoplasm and decreasing nuclear localization of drug and drug induced DNA damage.|$|E

5000|$|Stage IV. Cancer {{has spread}} to nearby tissues and more distant lymph nodes, or has metastasized to other organs. A cure is very rarely {{possible}} at this stage. Some other techniques to prolong life or improve symptoms are used, including laser treatment, surgery, and/or stents to keep the digestive tract open, and chemotherapy by drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, <b>epirubicin,</b> etoposide, docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine or irinotecan.|$|E

50|$|Dexrazoxane {{has been}} used to protect the heart against the cardiotoxic side effects of {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs such as anthracyclines, such as daunorubicin or doxorubicin or other chemotherapeutic agents. However, in July 2011 the US Food and Drug Administration released a statement restricting use only in adult patients with cancer who have received > 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin (an anthracycline) or > 540 mg/m2 <b>epirubicin</b> (another chemotherapeutic agent) and general approval for use for cardioprotection. That showed a possibly higher rate of secondary malignancies and acute myelogenous leukemia in pediatric patients treated for different cancers with both dexrazoxane and other chemotherapeutic agents that are associated with secondary malignancies.|$|E
5000|$|Anthracyclines {{are used}} to treat various cancers and as of 2012 {{were among the most}} {{commonly}} used chemotherapeutic agents. [...] Doxorubicin and its derivative, <b>epirubicin,</b> are used in breast cancer, childhood solid tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and aggressive lymphomas. Daunorubicin is used to treat acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemias, and its derivative, idarubicin is used in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and breast cancer. Other anthracycline derivates include nemorubicin, used for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, pixantrone, used as a second-line treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, sabarubicin, used for non-small cell lung cancer, hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer, and platinum- or taxane-resistant ovarian cancer, and valrubicin, which is used for the topical treatment of bladder cancer.|$|E

50|$|The {{first is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as random collection and screening of material, but in fact the collection is often far from random in that biological (often botanical) knowledge is used about which families show promise, based on a number of factors, including past screening. This approach is {{based on the fact that}} only a small part of earth’s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity. It is also based on the fact that organisms living in a species-rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive, mechanisms which might usefully be exploited in the development of drugs that can cure diseases affecting humans. A collection of plant, animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process. One example of a successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumour agents by the National Cancer Institute, started in the 1960s. Paclitaxel was identified from Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Paclitaxel showed anti-tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism (stabilization of microtubules) and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung, breast and ovarian cancer, as well as for Kaposi's sarcoma. Early in the 21st century, Cabazitaxel (made by Sanofi, a French firm), another relative of taxol has been shown effective against prostate cancer, also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells (such as cancer cells). Other examples are: 1. Camptotheca (Camptothecin · Topotecan · Irinotecan · Rubitecan · Belotecan); 2. Podophyllum (Etoposide · Teniposide); 3a. Anthracyclines (Aclarubicin · Daunorubicin · Doxorubicin · <b>Epirubicin</b> · Idarubicin · Amrubicin · Pirarubicin · Valrubicin · Zorubicin); 3b. Anthracenediones (Mitoxantrone · Pixantrone).|$|E
