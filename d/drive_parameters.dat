In {{each of them}} there are two {{independent}} panels to display the <b>drive</b> <b>parameters,</b> diagnostics and event recorder with a speedometer function. The two module driver's cabin is equipped with climate control and rear-view mirrors with a monitor for four cameras. The cabin is {{in accordance with the}} EN 1527 standard.|$|E

50|$|IBM AT's <b>Drive</b> <b>parameter</b> table {{listed the}} CMI-33 as having 615 {{cylinders}} {{instead of the}} 640 the drive was designed with, as to make the size an even 30 MB. Those who re-used the drives mostly found that the 616th cylinder was bad due to it {{being used as a}} landing area.|$|R
50|$|The Standard Disk Interconnect (SDI, {{sometimes}} Standard Disk Interface) {{was used}} by Digital Equipment Corporation for its line of RAxx disks, for example the RA90. There were two bi-directional serial communications paths between the controller and the drive. One path was for messages (from the controller to the drive) and responses (from the drive to the controller); messages controlled seeking, setting <b>drive</b> <b>parameters,</b> reporting errors, etc. This path was also used to transmit data {{to and from the}} drive. The other path consisted of a continuously transmitted set of control (controller-to-drive) or status (drive-to-controller) bits. There were about 6 bits in each direction, and they served the same purpose as having six dedicated lines in each direction.|$|E
50|$|All {{hard disk}} types in common use after the early 1990s have a drive-specific {{controller}} {{built into the}} actual drive enclosure. This includes all IDE, SCSI, SATA, and SAS hard drive types, among others. Those internal controllers know everything {{they need to know}} about their specific drive, including which strengths of precompensation are needed on which parts of the disk. Therefore they ignore any WPcom numbers stored in the computer's CMOS memory. Until the late 1990s, many PC BIOS setup programs still allowed the user to set WPcom numbers and other <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> for use with older hard disk types should the need arise; it wasn't always made very clear to the user that his more modern drive would almost certainly ignore the setting.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, {{the size}} of an ATA drive was stored in the system x86 BIOS using a type number (1 through 45) that {{predefined}} the C/H/S parameters [...] and also often the landing zone, in which the drive heads are parked while not in use. Later, a [...] "user definable" [...] format called C/H/S or cylinders, heads, sectors was made available. These numbers were important for the earlier ST-506 interface, but were generally meaningless for ATA—the CHS parameters for later ATA large drives often specified impossibly high numbers of heads or sectors that did not actually define the internal physical layout of the drive at all. From the start, and up to ATA-2, every user had to specify explicitly how large every attached drive was. From ATA-2 on, an [...] "identify drive" [...] command was implemented that can be sent and which will return all <b>drive</b> <b>parameters.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{parameter}} stability test against the alternative of observation driven generalized autoregressive score dynamics. The new test generalizes the ARCH-LM test of Engle (1982) to settings beyond time-varying volatility and exploits any autocorrelation in the likelihood scores under the alternative. We compare the test's performance with that of alternative tests developed for competing time-varying parameter frameworks, such as structural breaks and observation <b>driven</b> <b>parameter</b> dynamics. The new test has higher and more stable power against alternatives with frequent regime switches or with non-local <b>parameter</b> <b>driven</b> time-variation. For <b>parameter</b> <b>driven</b> time variation close to the null or for infrequent structural changes, the test of Muller and Petalas (2010) performs best overall. We apply all tests empirically to a panel of losses given default over the period 1982 [...] 2010 and find significant evidence of parameter variation in the underlying beta distribution...|$|R

General Proxy FBs for acyclic read/write of the <b>drive's</b> <b>parameters</b> are implemented.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{relative}} motions for the toroidal drive are analysed. The sliding factors between {{the planet and}} the stator or the worm are given. The friction coefficients between the planet and the stator or the worm under asperity contact or hydrodynamic lubrica-tion are presented. The friction coefficients between the planet and the stator or the worm under partial hydrodynamic lubrication are also given. Changes of the sliding factors between the planet and the stator or the worm along with <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> are presented. The friction coef-ficients between the planet and the stator or the worm under hydrodynamic lubrication are compared, and the changes of them along with <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> are discussed. Under asperity contact, the changes of the friction coefficient between the planet and the stator along with the <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> are given as well. Under partial hydrodynamic lubrication, the changes of the friction coefficient between the planet and the stator along with {{the ratio of the}} film thickness to mean standard deviations of the height distributions for two teeth are also discussed.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{demonstrate the}} phenomenon of dynamical many-body freezing in a periodically driven Ising chain. Theoretically [Phys. Rev. B 82, 172402 (2010) ], for certain values of the <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> all fundamental degrees of freedom contributing to the response dynamics freeze for all time and for arbitrary initial states. Also, since the condition of freezing involves only the <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> {{and not on the}} quantization of the momentum (i. e., the system-size), our simulation with a small (3 -spin) chain captures all salient features of the freezing phenomenon predicted for the infinite chain. Using optimal control techniques, we realize high-fidelity cosine modulated drive, and observe non-monotonic freezing of magnetization at specific frequencies of modulation. Time-evolution of the excitations in momentum space has been tracked directly through magnetization measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{controlled}} {{motion of}} a rigid {{body in the}} horizontal plane is investigated in this article. Three internal and acceleration-controlled masses are used to actuate the system. Dry friction acting between the system and the plane is isotropic. The dynamics of two basic motions of the system, that is, rectilinear and rotary motions, are first studied. Then by combining these two basic types of motions, planar locomotion {{of the system is}} constructed. Two typical planar trajectories of the system, that is, oblique lines and curve lines, are proposed and both approached with folding lines. The slope of the oblique lines and the curvature of the curves can be adjusted by varying the <b>drive</b> <b>parameters,</b> and the planar locomotion is thus controlled. To achieve a maximum average velocity, the <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> are optimized...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 55 - 59). Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) {{is a novel}} medical imaging modality, based on the magnetization of the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. In MPI, an external magnetic field called the drive field is applied to excite the nanoparticles. The link between the image quality and the <b>drive</b> field <b>parameters</b> is complex, as nanoparticle behavior changes with the <b>drive</b> field <b>parameters.</b> In addition, the maximum applicable drive field strength is limited by human safety restrictions. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the resolution improves at low drive field amplitudes and SNR enhances as drive field frequency increases. Other studies have confirmed that scanning at frequencies as high as 150 kHz is feasible for human-size MPI scanners. However, how the image quality is affected by <b>drive</b> field <b>parameters,</b> especially for high frequencies around 150 kHz, was not investigated. This thesis investigates the effects of the <b>drive</b> field <b>parameters</b> on the image quality in MPI with relaxometer experiments. The effects of the safety limits are also explored across different drive field frequencies via simulations. The results provide important insight in determining the optimal <b>drive</b> field <b>parameters</b> for safe MPI scanners. This thesis also introduces a new method for improving the image quality in MPI. MPI images can suffer from asymmetric hazing and irregular trending artifacts when nanoparticle response is delayed due to relaxation effects. This thesis proposes a new method based on averaging of relaxation effects from negative and positive half-cycles of the MPI signal, combined with a Savitzky-Golay detrending filter. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in image quality. by Ecem Bozkurt. M. S...|$|R

40|$|SRM drives are the {{upcoming}} drives nowadays as these have many advantages such as simplicity, low manufacturing and operating costs, fault tolerance, high torque/inertia ratio and efficiency. The estimation of SRM <b>drive</b> <b>parameters</b> {{is an important}} consideration in their field. Many methods are available for this. However the estimation of the optimal parameters is normally preferred. Making use of neural networks {{is one of the}} best ways to achieve this. This paper proposes an unsupervised learning method i. e., Kohonen‘s Self Organizing Feature Map method of estimation of SRM drives. Since the method makes use of ‗winner takes all ‘ of a neuron, the values obtained by this, will be the optimal values. The drive is first simulated and the parameters obtained are used for training the ANN. The Unsupervised learning method is the Kohonen‘s Self Organizing Feature Map method, which is used for the estimation of the SRM <b>drive</b> <b>parameters.</b> The parameters estimated are the currents and fluxes in the two axis. Because of the unsupervised learning, it can be stated that the estimated values are the best or the optimal values. MATLAB/Simulink is used for the simulation and the results are shown...|$|E
