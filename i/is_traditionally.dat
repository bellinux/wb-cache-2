5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which <b>is</b> <b>traditionally</b> the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation <b>is</b> <b>traditionally</b> the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
