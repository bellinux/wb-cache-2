5|$|Humpty Dumpty is a {{character}} in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle {{and one of the}} best known in the English-speaking world.

Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.|$|E

5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted <b>in</b> <b>James</b> D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E

5|$|Bellingham was immortalized as {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as {{the brother of}} Ann Hibbins, {{a woman who was}} executed (in real life in 1656, {{as well as in the}} book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to be based on a footnote <b>in</b> <b>James</b> Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{appears as}} a {{character}} in several modern plays and films. He is a central character <b>in</b> <b>James</b> Goldman's 1966 play The Lion in Winter, set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. The 1968 film adaptation communicates the modern popular view of Henry as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king although, as Goldman acknowledges, Henry's passions and character are essentially fictional. The Lion in Winter {{has proved to be}} an enduring representation of Henry, being turned into an Academy-Award-winning film and remade in 2003 for television. Henry also appears in the play Becket by Jean Anouilh, filmed in 1964; once again, however, the character of the King is deliberately fictitious, driven by the need for drama between Henry and Becket in the play. The Becket controversy also forms the basis for T. S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral, where the tensions between Henry and Becket form the basis both {{for a discussion of the}} more superficial events of Becket's death, and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>James</b> Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|James MacLachlan {{was born}} on 1 April 1919 at Styal in Cheshire, the second of six {{children}} of Hugh MacLachlan and his wife Helen (née Orr-Ewing). The MacLachlans lived in the family home in Styal, where Hugh was employed as an oil and chemical manufacturer until his premature death in 1928 from peritonitis. Following their father's death {{the family moved to}} Southampton to be close to Helen's parents. Her father Archibald Orr-Ewing was connected with the Plymouth Brethren, China Inland Mission and the missionary field. His influence resulted <b>in</b> <b>James</b> enrolling at King Edward's evangelical school for two years. After completing his preliminary education James boarded at the Anglican Monkton Combe School in September 1931 aged 12. James' brothers, Hugh Jnr, Gordon and Archie would follow him through the institution.|$|E
