5|$|On Earth, Arthur's double, {{known as}} the Skinless Boy, <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> a {{hospital}} near Arthur's home into panic by infecting staff and patients with a fungoid, extraterrestrial life-form which allows him to read and eventually control their thoughts and actions. This fungus, nicknamed Grayspot, is mistaken for a biological weapon, and the hospital put under quarantine. Leaf infiltrates the hospital, seeking to obtain and destroy the magical object used to create the Skinless Boy: a pocket torn from one of Arthur's shirts. She succeeds, but is infected by Grayspot in the process. She then leaves the hospital, {{only to find that}} the House has appeared above it and cannot be reached from the ground. With the help of a retired pharmacist named Sylvie, Leaf makes her way to Arthur's house where she uses a special telephone to contact Arthur's friends and get help, just as the fungus gains full control of her body.|$|E
5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

25|$|The Vishnu avatars {{appear in}} Hindu mythology {{whenever}} the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> the cosmos {{out of its}} balance.

25|$|By {{the time}} Clemens retired from Major League Baseball in 2007, his four-seam fastball {{had settled in}} the 91–94mph range. He also threw a two-seam fastball, a slider in the mid 80s, his hard splitter, and an {{occasional}} curveball. Clemens was a highly durable pitcher, leading the American League in complete games three times and innings pitched twice. His 18 complete games in 1987 is more than any pitcher <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> since. Clemens was {{also known as a}} strikeout pitcher, leading the AL in K's five times and strikeouts per nine innings three times.|$|E

Halladay's no-hitter was the fifth time a pitcher <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> two no-hitters in the same season, and {{was also the first}} time that one of the two occurred in the postseason. The Phillies went on to sweep the Reds in three straight games. In the 2010 National League Championship Series, the Phillies fell to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants in six games.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} debate among sociologists about {{the interpretation of}} this trend in census data. The increase in those indicating 'no religion' is often cited {{in support of the}} secularisation thesis, although more detailed research of this group <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> this assumption into question. An alternative theory is that the data indicates a decline in institutional religious affiliation rather than simply a decrease in spiritual belief. A 1985 survey showed that around one-quarter of those answering 'no religion' may believe in a god and that, conversely, between 7 percent and 36 percent of Christians (depending on their denomination) did not believe in the existence of deities.|$|E

25|$|In Vaishnava mythology, such {{as those}} {{presented}} in the Bhagavata Purana and the Pancaratra, whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> the cosmos out of its balance, an avatar of Vishnu appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the everpresent forces of good and evil. The most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, {{each has its own}} characteristics, legends and associated arts. The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.|$|E
25|$|Though he had {{a record}} of 6–8, pitcher Les Mueller {{appeared}} in 26 games and {{played an important role}} in the 1945 Tigers season. After missing the 1942–1944 seasons to military service, Mueller gave up a single to Pete Gray, the St. Louis Browns' famous one-armed outfielder, in Gray's first major league game in April 1945. Three months later, on July 21, 1945, Mueller pitched the first 19⅔ innings for the Tigers and left having given up only 1 run. No pitcher <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> as many innings in a major league game since Mueller's feat. The game lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes before the game was called due to darkness. Mueller also pitched 2 scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1945 World Series.|$|E
25|$|In 1819 William Sharp Macleay had {{published}} his {{ideas of the}} Quinarian system of biological classification, and Swainson soon became a noted and outspoken proponent. The Quinarian System fell out of favour, giving way to the rising popularity of the geographical theory of Hugh Edwin Strickland. Swainson was overworked by Dionysius Lardner, {{the publisher of the}} Cabinet Cyclopaedia and both Swainson and Macleay were derided for their support of the Quinarian system. Both proponents left Britain; Swainson emigrated to New Zealand and Macleay to Australia. An American visiting Australasia in the 1850s heard to his surprise that both Macleay and Swainson were living there, and imagined that they had been exiled to the Antipodes 'for the great crime of burdening zoology with a false though much laboured theory which <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> so much confusion into the subject of its classification and philosophical study'.|$|E
