30|$|The {{occurrence}} of short-timescale (∼ 1 – 100 s) perturbations (early VLF events) on four Very Low Frequency (VLF) transmitter signals (call signs: NWC, NPM, VTX, NLK), recorded at Suva (18.1 °S, 178.5 °E, L = 1.16), shows {{the most frequent}} occurrence on the NWC signal and least on the VTX. Daytime early/fast events on the NWC transmission are (0.2 – 0.5 dB) with only negative amplitude perturbations with comparatively lower recovery times (10 – 30 s) as compared with most nighttime events with amplitude perturbations of 0.2 – 1.5 dB and recovery times of 20 – 80 s. The World-Wide Lightning Location Network detected causative lightnings for 74 of 453 early VLF events out of which 54 (73 %) were produced due to narrow-angle scattering, and by 20 (27 %) due to wide-angle scattering. The recovery (decay) of the scattered amplitude of early/fast events on the NWC signal shows both exponential and logarithmic forms, but the linear correlation coefficient is better with a logarithm fit. The first observations of early/slow events in <b>daylight</b> <b>propagation</b> are presented. Initial results on early/fast events with unusually long recoveries (≥ 5 min) and strong perturbations (≥ 1 dB) indicate that they are mainly observed on the transmissions from NPM and NLK in the nighttime only, with rare occurrence on other transmissions. Such unusually long recovery of early/fast events {{may be associated with}} large ionic conductivity perturbations associated with gigantic jets.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the effects of solar flares and {{geomagnetic}} storms (purely low latitude) on VLF paths during the period December 2006 to 2008, a period of unprecedented minimum during solar cycles 23 and 24 which has provided us with a unique opportunity to study the low latitude D-region response to space weather effects. During this extended period of solar minimum, the ionosphere was contracted to the lowest level (Heelis et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2011). The signal perturbations due to solar flares of varying intensities and any relationship between them are investigated. Typical VLF perturbation events associated with solar flares are modeled using LWPC to determine the D-region parameters. The NWC and NPM signals have been analyzed for any variation in their average signal strengths during complete <b>daylight</b> and nighttime <b>propagation</b> conditions to study the geomagnetic storm effects.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} what {{a future}} environment for building system {{modeling and simulation}} may look like. As buildings continue to require increased performance and better comfort, their energy and control systems are becoming more integrated and complex. We therefore focus in this chapter on the modeling, simulation and analysis of building energy and control systems. Such systems can be classified as heterogeneous systems because they involve multiple domains, such as thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, electrical systems, control systems and communication systems. Also, they typically involve multiple temporal and spatial scales, and their evolution can be described by coupled differential equations, discrete equations and events. Modeling and simulating such systems requires {{a higher level of}} abstraction and modularisation to manage the increased complexity compared to what is used in today's building simulation programs. Therefore, the trend towards more integrated building systems {{is likely to be a}} driving force for changing the status quo of today's building simulation programs. Thischapter discusses evolving modeling requirements and outlines a path toward a future environment for modeling and simulation of heterogeneous building systems. A range of topics that would require many additional pages of discussion has been omitted. Examples include computational fluid dynamics for air and particle flow in and around buildings, people movement, <b>daylight</b> simulation, uncertainty <b>propagation</b> and optimisation methods for building design and controls. For different discussions and perspectives on the future of building modeling and simulation, we refer to Sahlin (2000), Augenbroe (2001) and Malkawi and Augenbroe (2004) ...|$|R
