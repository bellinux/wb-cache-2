Haze detection and removal is a <b>hallenging</b> and an important task for optical multispectral data correction. This work presents an empirical and automatic method for inhomogeneous haze detection and removal in medium and high resolution satellite optical multispectral images.

Rare scenes with a uniform and highly reflecting landcover result in limitations of the method.

It includes {{a wide spectrum of}} hip abnormalities ranging from dysplasia to subluxation and complete dislocation of the hip joint. The natural history of neglected DDH in adults is highly variable. The mean age of onset of symptoms is 34. 5 years for dysplastic DDH, 32. 5 years for low dislocation, 31. 2 years for high dislocation with a false acetabulum, and 46. 4 years for high dislocation without a false acetabulum. Thorough understanding of the bony and soft tissue deformities induced by dysplasia is crucial for the success of total hip arthroplasty.

40|$|The globalized {{and current}} {{competitive}} business {{environment of the}} twenty-first century has brought ever more <b>hallenging</b> pressures to the operations of organizations. In this century, operations are not only expected to contribute to the profitability and efficiency of organizations but also to serve as a platform to achieve contemporary organizational objectives that include customer satisfaction, quality, responsiveness, and sustainability. Therefore, neither operations managers nor organizations can be successful in achieving these objectives if they stick to the old assumptions and ways of designing, managing, and improving operations. In this scenario, innovation plays an essential role to ensure that operations contribute to the competitiveness of modern organizations and help them to overcome the challenges that the twenty-first century has brought to them. Thus, the purpose of this book is to allow business leaders, existing and potential operations managers, or all those interested in this subject, to acquire core skills in the field of operations and innovation management to understand and effectively promote competitiveness through the development or adoption of best practices in the design, management, and improvement of a company’s operations as well as to deploy a culture based on innovation and continuous improvement. We wrote this book based on our experience as industrialists, consultants, researchers, and academics, after working with all those organizations that wanted their operations and innovation activities to take a primordial role in their constant battle for competitiveness. Our experience made us realize that most operational issues and problems faced by organizations derive from the lack of core knowledge about operations and their poor interactions with other functions of the organization and the external environment that currently dominates the world’s markets. For this reason, we have divided this book into three main sections: the first section provides an understanding of the general context of innovation and operations management (Chapters 1 and 2), the second section provides a review of the external environmental factors that {{play a role in the}} innovative management of operations (Chapters 3 and 4), and the third one focuses on the internal aspects that surround the management of operations in an innovative way (Chapters 5 – 10). By focusing on core and well-established principles such as the role of operations managers, design of products, processes and services, organizational culture and structure within the context of managing operations and contemporary topics such as the economics of innovation and operations management, innovative global supply chains, innovation and sustainability, among others, the readers of this book will: • Gain knowledge of operations management concepts, business models,methods, tools, and best practices used by successful organizations to improve their operations. • Understand how to apply operations management concepts in a real industrial context. • Reflect upon and consider particular operational issues that have a direct impact on the competitiveness of contemporary organizations. Some of the chapters have also been complemented with case studies that have been written by industrial and academic experts with vast experience in various areas of operations and innovation. These cases show the practical application of some of the concepts, methods, tools, and/or techniques reviewed in the chapter where they appear.

The study concludes that successful waste management depends on adequate financing, enabling legislation, and a supporting institutional and policy environment. Successful waste management in Nigeria will require a holistic program rogram which will integrate all the technical, economic, social, cultural, and psychological factors that are often ignored in solid waste management programmes...|$|R
40|$|The North Carolina Geospatial Data Archiving Project (NCGDAP) is {{a three-year}} joint {{effort of the}} North Carolina State University Libraries and the North Carolina Center for Geographic Information and Analysis focused on {{collection}} and preservation of digital geospatial data resources from {{state and local government}} agencies. CGDAP is being undertaken in partnership with the Library of Congress under the ational Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP). “Digital geospatial data” consists of digital information that identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the earth. Such data resources include geographic information systems (GIS) data sets, digitized maps, remote sensing data resources such as digital aerial photography, and tabular data that are tied to specific locations. These complex data objects do not suffer well from neglect, and long-term preservation will involve some combination of format migration and retention of critical documentation. While the main focus of NCGDAP is on organizational issues related to the engagement of spatial data infrastructure in the process of data archiving [...] with the demonstration repository seen more as a catalyst for discussion rather than an end in itself [...] this paper focuses more narrowly on the technical challenges associated with eveloping an ingest workflow and archive development process. New preservation <b>hallenges</b> associated with emergent content forms are also resented...|$|R

40|$|Breakup and oales en e of free surfa e ows The pi ture of a dolphin, {{jumping out}} of the water in the New England {{aquarium}} in Boston (Fig. 1), gives a very good idea of the <b>hallenges</b> involved in the des ription of free-surfa e ows. In a omplex series of events, whi h is still not well understood, water swept up by the dolphin breaks up into thousands of small drops. A more detailed idea of what happens lose to the point of breakup is given in Fig. 2, whi h shows a drop of water falling from a fau et. On e an elongated ne k has formed, surfa e energy is minimized by lo ally redu ing its radius, and a drop separates at a point. On e the ne k is broken, it rapidly snaps ba k, forming a apillary waves on its surfa e. In the last pi ture on the right, the ne k has been severed on the other end as well. Thus in a single dripping event, two drops have a tually formed, and the smaller " drop will subsequently break up to form even smaller drops. This gives a good idea of the omplexity of just a single breakup event, driven by surfa e tension. The omplementary event of drop oales en e is illustrated by Fig. 3, whi h shows two drops whi h have been made to tou h at a point. Surfa e tension drives a motion that makes th...|$|R

While often overlooked, {{the time to}} stage data and binaries an be a signi ant ontributor to the wall- lo k program exe ution time in urrent Grid environments. This paper des ribes a simple s heduler for network data movement in Grid systems that an adaptively determine data distribution s hedules at runtime {{on the basis of}} Network Weather Servi e (NWS) performan e predi tions.

Grid omputing, data logisti s, data staging 1. Introdu tion. As Computational Grid environments proliferate, the ommunity must onstantly evolve the way in whi h omputing systems are used. Distributed omputing on the Grid has enabled new ways of harnessing omputing resour es and yet, has exposed its own set of <b>hallenges.</b> One su h problem is that of data movement. Appli ations that are drawn to the Grid be ause of large resour e requirements frequently onsume or generate large amounts of data. The problems of data lo ality and data movement are be oming more prominent and riti al to the performan e and deployability of Grid systems. Further, due to the dynamism inherent in Grid environments, it is lear that me hanisms for data staging must be adaptive like the omputations themselves...|$|R
