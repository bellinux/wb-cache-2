40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{behavior of}} the nickel base Alloy 602 CA in atmospheres, relevant to <b>gas</b> <b>separation</b> <b>units</b> in fossil fired power plants, was investigated in the temperature range 800 to 1100 °C. Isothermal oxidation kinetics were determined in Ar– 7 %H 2 O, Ar– 4 %H 2 – 7 %H 2 O, Ar– 20 %O 2 – 7 %H 2 O and, for comparative purposes, in Ar– 20 %O 2. The alloy formed an external alumina scale during oxidation at 800 °C, regardless of the atmosphere. Increasing the temperature results in gradual replacement of the alumina scale by an external chromia layer and internal alumina precipitates. The chromia growth rate {{is affected by the}} gas composition, due to titanium incorporation in the scale and outwardly protruding metallic nodules. The external alumina scale formation was strongly affected by surface cold work during specimen grinding.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} thermo-mechanical {{properties of}} La 0. 58 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -delta (LSCF) and Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 -delta (BSCF) perovskite materials, which are considered as oxygen transport membranes (OTM) for <b>gas</b> <b>separation</b> <b>units.</b> Ring-on-ring bending test with disk-shaped samples and depth-sensitive micro-indentation {{have been used}} as macroscopic and microscopic tests, respectively. In addition, the thermo-mechanical properties of a third OTM candidate material La 2 NiO 4 +delta (LNO) were investigated. The results of the thermo-mechanical measurements with the BSCF revealed an anomaly between 200 °C and 400 °C. In particular, the temperature dependence of Young’s modulus shows a minimum at ~ 200 °C. Fracture stress and toughness exhibit a qualitatively similar behavior with a minimum between 200 °C and 400 °C, before recovering between 500 °C and 800 °C. X-ray diffraction analyses verified that BSCF remains cubic in the relevant temperature range. Hence the anomalies were assumed {{to be related to the}} transition of Co 3 + spin states reported for other Co-containing perovskites. This assumption could be experimentally confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The fracture surfaces of the specimens are not affected by the mechanical anomalies at intermediate temperatures, since only a transgranular fracture mode has been observed. Complementary to the mechanical characterization of BSCF, also the temperature dependency of fracture stress and elastic behavior of LSCF have been determined. Phase compositions of LSCF have been studied by in-situ high temperature XRD. Changes in phase composition with temperature are observed. At ambient temperature the LSCF perovskite material comprises two phases: rhombohedral and cubic symmetry. The ratio of the two phases depends on both cooling rate and atmosphere. The transition of rhombohedral to cubic occurs between 700 °C and 800 °C in air. The transition appears to be associated with a change of heat capacity. The fracture stress of LSCF was determined on the basis of ring-on-ring bending tests between room temperature (RT) and 800 °C. Below 700 °C non-linear load-displacement curves are obtained, an effect that is attributed to the ferro-elasticity of the rhombohedral phase. Both SEM and TEM verify the existence of a domain structure in the rhombohedral grains. The importance of thermal history on phase composition and the resulting thermo-mechanical behavior is discussed. The indentation fracture toughness appears to be insensitive to temperature variations from RT up to 350 °C. In addition to the two perovskite materials also mechanical properties of LNO have been determined. Fracture stress and stiffness of LNO were evaluated from RT up to 900 °C based on 4 -point bending tests. Both mechanical parameters increase slightly from RT to 700 °C. However, at higher temperatures the stiffness decreases, whereas the fracture stress increases. Although oxygen is continuously released from the lattice up to 1000 °C, the thermal expansion coefficient shows an almost constant value from RT up to 1000 °C. Finally the mechanical results of the three membrane materials are summarized and compared with respect to practical application in <b>gas</b> <b>separation</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
40|$|EN] A novel {{method of}} {{producing}} methanol from {{coke oven gas}} (COG), involving the CO 2 reforming of COG to obtain an appropriate syngas for the synthesis of methanol is proposed. This method is compared with a conventional process of methanol synthesis from natural gas, in terms of energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, raw material exploitation and methanol purity. Whereas this new process requires the consumption of less energy, the conventional process allows a higher energy recovery. CO 2 emissions are considerably lower with the new process, but the geographic situation of the plant plays a determinant role. From {{the point of view}} of raw material exploitation and methanol purity, the process proposed yields better results. These results suggest that methanol production from coke oven gas would be a more attractive alternative to conventional processes. JMB acknowledges the support received from the CSIC JAE Program.

40|$|AbstractIn China {{polygeneration}} {{from coal}} via gasification {{is seen as}} a promising technology that responds to the issues of security of energy supply and climate change. However, the implementation of coal-gasification schemes is still hampered with a comparatively low operational availability, and the relative cost imposed by polygeneration is deemed high. First, the capital expenses become higher due to the more comprehensive processing scheme including oxygen production. Second, the inclusion of CCS will affect the operating cost owing to additional staff and reduced revenues, as there will be less electricity to sell. Third, the maintenance cost tends to grow due to increased complexity. A new virtual IGCC-CCS 11 I. e.  integrated gasification combined cycle with CCS. power cycle has been defined, which forms the base case for benchmarking. A reference case has been formed using the prestigious Chinese GreenGen project (phase 1) as model. The two cases are based with identical gasifiers as the core component. In contrast to the reference case using a gas turbine fuelled with syngas and without CO 2 capture, the virtual power cycle is made up using a generic hydrogen-burning gas turbine subsequent to an integrated <b>gas</b> <b>separation</b> <b>unit</b> in which CO 2 is removed (jointly with H 2 S). Hence, the two cases have been benchmarked in order {{to assess the impact of}} CO 2 capture on cost–notably without the inclusion of polygeneration, despite that polygeneration was part of the study (with hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and DME as co-products additional to electric power).

40|$|Capture {{and storage}} of CO 2 {{can be used}} to reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from combustion of fossil fuels. Chemical-looping combustion is a two-step combustion process where CO 2 is obtained in a separate stream, ready for compression and storage. The technology uses circulating oxygen carriers to transfer oxygen from an air reactor to a fuel reactor, thus avoiding an energy consuming <b>gas</b> <b>separation</b> <b>unit.</b> A thermal analysis of the process using a large number of possible oxygen carriers was performed by simulating chemical reactions. Based on the ability of the oxygen carriers to convert different gaseous fuels, stability in air and melting temperature some metal oxides based on Ni, Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, W and sulphates of Ba, Sr and Ca showed good thermodynamic properties and could be feasible as oxygen carriers. The promising systems were investigated further with respect to temperature changes in the fuel reactor as well as possible formation of carbon, sulphides and sulphates which may deactivate the oxygen carriers. Oxygen carriers of NiO, supported by NiAl 2 O 4, were prepared and investigated experimentally with respect to parameters important for chemical-looping combustion. These oxygen carriers were based on commercially available raw materials in contrast to most of the previously tested oxygen carriers, which have been prepared from pure chemicals. Further, it was investigated if spray-drying, which is a production method suitable for large-scale particle preparation, {{can be used to}} produce high performing oxygen carriers instead of the small-scale freeze-granulation method. Generally, materials prepared from commercially available raw material showed high reactivity with methane and oxygen. Oxygen carriers prepared by spray-drying, displayed a remarkable similarity when compared to oxygen carriers prepared from the same starting material by freeze-granulation, both regarding physical properties and reactivity. Further, the up-scaling of the particle production did not present any difficulties. To reduce the risk of fragmentation and attrition of these oxygen carriers in a circulating chemical-looping combustion system, the strength of the oxygen carriers can be improved by an addition of Ca(OH) 2, by increasing the sintering temperature or by extending the sintering time. Some unreacted CH 4 was released at high degrees of oxygen carrier oxidation. This fraction of unconverted CH 4 was fairly unchanged when the sintering temperature was increased while an extended sintering time resulted in a clearly improved conversion. Materials with MgO added during particle preparation or with MgAl 2 O 4 as supporting agent resulted in considerably increased CH 4 conversion...|$|E

The development of innovative <b>gas</b> <b>separation</b> techniques will evaluate the current state-of-the-art for the <b>gas</b> <b>separation</b> required, with the objective to demonstrate and develop light-weight, low-power methods for <b>gas</b> <b>separation.</b> Gas separation requirements include, {{but are not limited to}} the selective separation of: (1) methane and water from un-reacted carbon oxides (C 02 - CO) and hydrogen typical of a Sabatier-type process, (2) carbon oxides and water from unreacted hydrogen from a Reverse Water-Gas Shift process, (3) carbon oxides from oxygen from a trash/waste processing reaction, and (4) helium from hydrogen or oxygen from a propellant scavenging process. Potential technologies for the separations include freezers, selective membranes, selective solvents, polymeric sorbents, zeolites, and new technologies. This paper and presentation will summarize the results of an extensive literature review and laboratory evaluations of candidate technologies for the capture and separation of C 02 and other relevant gases...|$|R
40|$|The program {{objective}} was to develop materials and processes for industrial <b>gas</b> <b>separations</b> to reduce energy use and enable waste reduction. The approach chosen combined novel oxygen selective adsorbents and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes. Preliminary materials development and process simulation results indicated that oxygen selective adsorbents could provide a versatile platform for industrial <b>gas</b> <b>separations.</b> If fully successful, this new technology offered the potential for reducing the cost of producing nitrogen/oxygen co-products, high purity nitrogen, argon, and possibly oxygen. The potential energy savings for the <b>gas</b> <b>separations</b> are appreciable, but the end users are the main beneficiaries. Lowering the cost of industrial gases expands their use in applications that can employ them for reducing energy consumption and emissions...|$|R
