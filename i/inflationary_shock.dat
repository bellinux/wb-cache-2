50|$|Friedman's {{work began}} to gain {{increasing}} acceptance among academics after 1973, when stagflation - the simultaneous increase in both inflation and unemployment - became prominent, {{just as he}} had predicted. While the 1973 oil crisis was clearly an <b>inflationary</b> <b>shock</b> to the global economy, Friedman was able to argue persuasively that inflation was much higher {{than it would have been}} due to the rapid expansion of the money supply by governments in 1971. By the late 1970s, empirical data was also present to suggest that Friedman was right to emphasise the role of expectations on inflation, further increasing the acceptance of his ideas by mainstream economists. Post Keynesian economist Paul Davidson has argued that part of the reason for Friedman's intellectual victory was that Keynes' ideas were misunderstood by the mainstream academics of the time (the Neo-Keynesians) who therefore didn't have a consistent framework to rebut the attacks.|$|E

40|$|Low {{and stable}} {{inflation}} {{is important for}} maintaining the viability of Islamic banking and finance within a dual banking system. <b>Inflationary</b> <b>shocks</b> when transmitted to real output growth cause a shift of investment to fixed return products as a hedge against the uncertainty of returns on equity investment under Islamic profit-loss sharing contracts. This study examines the transmission of <b>inflationary</b> <b>shocks</b> to the real economy for nine Muslim-majority countries (Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey) that have introduced Islamic banking, all except Iran within dual-banking systems. A structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) framework is deployed to understand macroeconomic relationships using annual data from the late 1970 s to 2014. The key finding is that <b>inflationary</b> <b>shocks</b> affect real interest and exchange rates which in turn impact real output growth. The paper argues that the absorption of <b>inflationary</b> <b>shocks</b> in real interest and exchange rates is the outcome of rigidities in nominal interest and exchange rates within repressed financial systems. Policy regimes that allow for greater adjustment in nominal interest and exchange rates under a deregulated financial system would offer better shock absorption capacity which would lead to less volatility in inflation, real interest and exchange rates, and real output growth. The resulting more stable macroeconomic environment would be more conducive {{to the development of}} an Islamic financial sector that would promote economic growth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} role of {{monetary}} policy in the disinflation process {{that has taken place}} in the Mexican economy in recent years. The purpose is to show that, once an economy establishes a sustainable fiscal position, an inflation targeting framework can be seen as an efficient mechanism to impose discipline on monetary policy and, thus, to reduce inflation. This paper describes the measures that were taken after the 1995 crisis to stabilize the economy and that prevented the possibility of a fiscal dominance situation from arising. Consequently, {{the role of}} monetary policy in reducing inflation is analyzed, in particular its response to different <b>inflationary</b> <b>shocks.</b> Results show that in conducting the successful disinflationary process, Banco de México's responses to <b>inflationary</b> <b>shocks</b> have been consistent with inflation targeting principles. inflation targeting, inflation reduction, monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a two-country model. Each country is characterised by several different sources of nominal inertia. This distinguishes our model from {{others in the}} so called New Open Economy Macroeconomics and makes it a suitable framework within which analyse the stabilising properties of monetary policies. We show that the variance of inflation induced by domestic <b>inflationary</b> <b>shocks</b> is lower under CPI targeting than when we target a measure of output price inflation. In fact, market segmentation and staggered wage and price setting result in lower and more persistent foreign inflation responses to a domestic <b>inflationary</b> <b>shocks.</b> This inertia in foreign price adjustments is completely passed through into CPI inflation but not into output price inflation.

If the relative hierarchy goes the other way around (as we argue is likely for EC countries), the standard conclusion is reversed, resulting in insufficiently active monetary and fiscal policies.

The determinants of inflation are estimated by a VAR analysis, which shows that inflation, the interest rate and money supply move together. A VAR model assumes constant error variance. We relaxed this assumption by employing an ARCH/GARCH model and conclude that inflation is volatile in nature. For measuring the qualitative nature of the inflationary process we used an EGARCH model. It confirms that the time effect model is significant. It also suggests that in the first four months of the calendar year, the <b>inflationary</b> <b>shock</b> is negative and it can, therefore, hamper growth...|$|E

We find that supply factors, including those captured through upstream foreign commodity and producer prices, {{have been important}} drivers of non-food inflation, as has foreign demand for Chinese goods.

A series of unit root tests specified both linearly and nonlinearly investigate whether inflation persistence has the characteristic of a unit root. The overall results for the full sample period, 1950 - 2010, and two subsample periods, 1970 - 2010 and 1993 - 2010, suggest that Australia's high inflation persistence does not incorporate a unit root, with the post- 1993 analysis most emphatically yielding the result. High inflation persistence and volatility in Australia suggest that <b>inflationary</b> <b>shock</b> {{takes a long time}} to dissipate but does not permanently alter the low average level of inflation.

The model also suggests that a major <b>inflationary</b> <b>shock,</b> like the one to which all Central and Eastern European economies were subject when they allowed prices to be determined by the market, should give rise to a tightening of the exchange rate regime, followed by a gradual introduction of more flexibility as inflation subsides.

40|$|Much of the {{opposition}} to indexation {{as a means of}} adapting to on going inflation arises from the view that indexation is itself inflationary.

Evidence from a cross-section of forty countries on the effects of indexation on the inflationary impact of the oil price shock of 1974 suggests that indexation did not in general increase the inflationary impact of the oil shock. However, the impact of the oil shock was significantly stronger in those countries that had adopted bond indexation. ...|$|E
40|$|Any {{measure of}} unobserved {{inflation}} uncertainty relies on specific assumptions which {{are most likely}} not fulfilled completely. This calls into question whether an individual measure delivers a reliable signal. To reduce idiosyncratic measurement error, we propose using common information contained in different measures derived from survey data, a variety of forecast models, and volatility models. We show that all measures are driven by a common component which constitutes an indicator for inflation uncertainty. Moreover, the idiosyncratic component of survey disagreement contains systematic measurement error during economic downturns. Finally, we study the Friedman-Ball hypothesis. Using the indicator, {{it turns out that}} higher inflation is followed by higher uncertainty. By contrast, we obtain contradictory results for the individual measures. We also document that, after an <b>inflationary</b> <b>shock,</b> uncertainty decreases in the first two months which is traceable to the energy component in CPI inflation.

On the other hand, a substantial segment of emerging economies, which suffered no permanent damages in the balance sheets of their households, firms, or governments, is currently experiencing what can be an incipient start of a credit and economic rebound.
