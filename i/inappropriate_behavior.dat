5|$|In April 1995, the State Duma {{considered}} {{the first draft}} of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book Punitive Medicine, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behavior.</b> Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity. A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{displayed}} by prospective teachers through digital devices in terms of certain variables, and to reveal the causes of these <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Employing quantitative and qualitative research methods, the study was carried out during the 2011 - 2012 academic year with participation of 185 prospective teachers from a faculty of education in Turkey. Quantitative data were analyzed by use of multiple linear regression analysis and independent samples t-test. Qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. Validity and reliability were investigated via peer-review, member checks, and inter-coder reliability processes. The findings of the study show that there is a (low-level) significant positive relationship between the <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> displayed by prospective teachers through digital devices and gender, social media usage status, and duration of the internet usage and mobile phone usage. It was concluded that male students displayed more <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> through digital devices in comparison to female students, and prospective teachers using social media displayed more <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> through digital devices in comparison to those not using the social media. The causes of undesired/inappropriate behaviors were found to be compulsion, absent-mindedness and indifference...|$|R

Findings from the project showed a significant increase in awareness of bullying following the educational intervention.

40|$|Functional {{analysis}} techniques traditionally used in {{the assessment}} of problem behaviors in humans were used to identify the reinforcing consequences for undesirable, human-directed behaviors such as feces throwing and spitting in two captive adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} using the obsessions of children with autism to reduce their <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Baseline consisted of a traditional differential reinforcement of other behaviors (DRO) in which food reinforcers were provided contingent upon a period of nonoccurrence of the <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Then, three treatment conditions were assessed using a multielement design. One condition provided objects of obsession as reinforcers for periods of nonoccurrence of the <b>inappropriate</b> <b>behaviors.</b> A second condition also provided the obsessions as reinforcers, but in conjunction with mild reductive procedures (verbal “no”, time-out). A final condition used the food reinforcers of baseline, but with mild reductive procedures. Results indicated that all three treatment conditions were {{more effective than the}} traditional food DRO of baseline.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the <b>inappropriate</b> eating <b>behaviors</b> of {{adolescents}} as a function of habitual level of physical activity. METHODS: Participants were 462 youth of both genders aged 10 to 19 years. The Eating Attitudes Test- 26 was used for <b>inappropriate</b> eating <b>behaviors</b> assessment. A short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used for classifying the habitual level of physical activity. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found for the comparison of <b>inappropriate</b> eating <b>behaviors</b> in the multivariate covariance model either for females or males. Moreover, the level of physical activity had no significant influence on the <b>inappropriate</b> eating <b>behaviors</b> of these adolescents. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, <b>inappropriate</b> eating <b>behaviors</b> in both genders were similar regardless of the habitual level of physical activity...|$|R

After learning from its captain Benito Cereno that a storm has taken many crewmembers and provisions, Delano offers to help out.

When he leaves the San Dominick and captain Cereno jumps after him, he finally discovers that the slaves have taken command of the ship, and forced the surviving crew to act as usual. Employing a third-person narrator who reports Delano's point of view without any correction, the story has become a famous example of unreliable narration.|$|E

As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of appropriate behavior, these behaviors were changed.
