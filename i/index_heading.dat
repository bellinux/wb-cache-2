40|$|Functional markers {{are needed}} for key genes {{involved}} in drought tolerance to improve selection for crop yield under moisture stress conditions. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) characterize five drought tolerance candidate genes, namely dehydration responsive element binding 1 A (), enhanced response to abscisic acid (and), and fructan 1 -exohydrolase (and), in wheat (L.) for nucleotide and haplotype diversity, Tajima’s D value, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and (ii) associate within-gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with phenotypic traits in a spring wheat association mapping panel (= 126). Field trials were grown under contrasting moisture regimes in Greeley, CO, and Melkassa, Ethiopia, in 2010 and 2011. Genome-specific amplification and DNA sequence analysis of the genes identified SNPs and revealed differences in nucleotide and haplotype diversity, Tajima’s D, and patterns of LD. showed associations (false discovery rate adjusted probability value = 0. 1) with normalized difference vegetation <b>index,</b> <b>heading</b> date, biomass, and spikelet number.

40|$|Recently, the {{incorporation}} of exotic germplasm from Avena sterilis L. into cultivated oats (A. sativa L.) has {{become a part of}} several oat improvement programs. To date, this research has involved only nuclear genes; yet, variation among cytoplasms in Avena may provide much opportunity for improving oats as an agricultural crop. The objectives of this study were (a) to determine if cytoplasmic effects occurred in reciprocal interspecific matings, (b) to assess whether backcrossing to the cultivated parent influenced cytoplasm effects, and (c) to determine if there were specific nuclear x cytoplasmic interactions;Sixty populations of 20 oat lines each, representing the BC(, 0), BC(, 1), and BC(, 2) of the matings among five A. sterilis accessions and two A. sativa cultivars with reciprocals, were evaluated in a field-grown experiment for grain yield, straw yield, harvest <b>index,</b> <b>heading</b> date, plant height, unit straw weight, and vegetative growth rate. The data from this experiment were analyzed {{in such a way that}} the effects of nuclear genes, of cytoplasms, and of nuclear genes x cytoplasms could be assessed;A. sterilis nuclear effects on grain yield, straw yield, and plant height were large, even in the BC(, 2), indicating much genetic variability was present in A. sterilis for these traits. The importance of the A. sativa parents to differences among matings increased with backcrossing to the A. sativa parent for all traits except plant height and grain yield. With random backcrossing, specific nicking ability of A. sterilis and A. sativa was lost, with the result that parental performance per se was a good indicator of the performance of a mating;Generally, the values for straw yield, plant height, unit straw weight, and vegetative growth rate were increased by A. sterilis cytoplasm, but these advantages decreased with backcrossing and were lost by BC(, 2). Probably, this relationship with level of backcrossing resulted because interactions between A. sterilis cytoplasms and A. sterilis nuclear genes were responsible for the improved performance. Harvest index showed an advantage for A. sterilis cytoplasm in the BC(, 1) and BC(, 2). Grain yield and heading date were significantly increased by A. sterilis cytoplasm and these effects were not diminished by backcrossing. The effect of A. sterilis cytoplasm on heading date showed no mating interactions of importance, an indication of a direct cytoplasmic effect. The grain yield increase due to A. sterilis cytoplasm was most likely due to specific favorable interactions with A. sativa nuclear genomes;These results suggest that plant breeders might improve crop performance by making use of diverse cytoplasms. An additional benefit would be the added cytoplasmic diversity which could be a stabilizing influence on production...|$|E

50|$|CNC <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> may be {{controlled}} {{in two different}} modes. The most basic method of operation uses simple control functions built into the dividing head. It {{does not require a}} CNC machine. The operator enters the desired angle into a control box attached to the <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> and it automatically rotates to the desired position and locks into place for machining. Changing angles is as simple as typing a new angle value onto the control pad. This is simpler than setting up a manual <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> because {{there is no need to}} interchange indexing plates or to calculate which hole positions to use. It is also faster for repetitive operations because the work can be indexed by simply pressing a button, eliminating the need to count rotations of the hand crank or specific hole positions on the indexing plate. A CNC dividing head may be used in this manner on either manual or CNC machinery.|$|R
50|$|An <b>indexing</b> <b>head,</b> {{also known}} as a {{dividing}} head or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions. <b>Indexing</b> <b>heads</b> are usually used on the tables of milling machines, but may be used on many other machine tools including drill presses, grinders, and boring machines. Common jobs for a dividing head include machining the flutes of a milling cutter, cutting the teeth of a gear, milling curved slots, or drilling a bolt hole circle around the circumference of a part.|$|R

50|$|Non-IT-assisted {{physical}} guidance was {{the first}} means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age. It is achieved by jigs, fixtures, and machine tool parts and accessories, which control toolpath by {{the very nature of}} their shape, physically limiting the path for motion. Some archetypal examples, developed to perfection before the advent of the IT era, are , the turrets on manual turret lathes, <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> for manual milling machines, rotary tables, and various indexing fixtures and blocks that are simpler and less expensive than <b>indexing</b> <b>heads,</b> and serve quite well for most indexing needs in small shops. Although <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> of the pre-CNC era are now mostly obsolete in commercial manufacturing, the principle of purely mechanical indexing is still a vital part of current technology, in concert with IT, even as it has been extended to newer uses, such as the indexing of CNC milling machine toolholders or of indexable cutter inserts, whose precisely controlled size and shape allows them to be rotated or replaced quickly and easily without changing overall tool geometry.|$|R

50|$|A {{rotary table}} is a {{precision}} work positioning device used in metalworking. It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis.

40|$|Main memory {{index is}} built with the {{assumption}} that the RAM is suﬃciently large to hold data. Due to the volatility and high unit price of main memory, indices under secondary memory such as SSD and HDD are widely used. However, the I/O operation with main memory is still the bottleneck for query eﬃciency. In this paper, we propose a self-tuning indexing scheme called Tide-tree for RAM/Disk-based hybrid storage system. Tide-tree aims to overcome the obstacles main memory and disk-based indices face, and per- forms like the tide to achieve a double-win in space and performance, which is self-adaptive with respect to the running environment. Particularly, Tide- tree delaminates the tree structure adaptively with high eﬃciency based on storage sense, and applies an eﬀective self-tuning algorithm to dynamically load various nodes into main memory. We employ memory mapping technol- ogy to solve the persistent problem of main memory index, and improves the eﬃciency of data synchronism and pointer translation. To further enhance the independence of Tide-tree, we employ the <b>index</b> <b>head</b> and the level address ta- ble to manage the whole index. With the <b>index</b> <b>head,</b> three eﬃcient operations are proposed, namely index rebuild, index load and range search.
