40|$|O monossialotetra-hexosilgangliosídeo (GM 1) é um glicoesfingolipídio presente nas membranas celulares que exerce propriedades antioxidantes e neuroprotetoras. Os mecanismos neuroquímicos envolvidos na neuroproteção induzida pelo GM 1 não são completamente conhecidos. Recentemente, foi demonstrado que o GM 1 aumenta a quantidade da enzima {{catalase}} no SNC por causar vasodilatação, e sugeriu-se que a vasodilatação possa ser responsável pelas suas propriedades neuroprotetoras. Contudo, o mecanismo pelo qual o GM 1 causa vasodilatação não foi determinado. Dado o papel central do óxido nítrico (NO), bem como de canais de potássio no controle do tonus do músculo liso, o objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar a participação do NO e de canais de K+ na vasodilatação induzida pelo GM 1. Primeiramente, avaliamos o efeito da administração de L-NAME (metil éster de NGnitro- L-arginina, 60 mg/kg, i. p.), um inibidor da enzima óxido nítrico sintase (NOS), na vasodilatação cerebral induzida pelo GM 1 (50 mg/kg, i. p.) em ratos Wistar machos adultos. Verificamos que o L-NAME preveniu o aumento do diâmetro dos vasos cerebrais induzido pelo GM 1. Tendo em vista a participação do NO no efeito vasodilatador do GM 1, determinamos o conteúdo de nitritos e nitratos (NOx), bem como de hemoglobina (Hb) no hipocampo e no córtex cerebral, 15, 30 e 60 min após a administração de GM 1. Observamos um aumento no conteúdo de Hb e uma redução dos níveis <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> após 60 min. Dado que nitritos e nitratos podem ser removidos in vivo pelo sangue por ligação com a Hb, um possível efeito do GM 1 sobre o conteúdo <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> poderia ser mascarado. No intuito de contornar essa situação, determinamos os níveis <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> em fatias de córtex cerebral incubadas com GM 1 (0, 10, 30 e 100 µM). Verificamos que o GM 1 (100 µM) aumentou os níveis <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> em 30 min e, reduziu o conteúdo em 60 min, sem alterar o conteúdo de Hb. Ainda, mostramos que o L-NAME (100 µM) reverte o aumento <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> induzida pela incubação com GM 1 (100 µM, por 30 minutos) em fatias de córtex cerebral, sem alterar o conteúdo de Hb. Tendo em vista a participação do NO no efeito vasodilatador do GM 1, e conhecendo a capacidade de ligação da Hb com o NO, determinamos a via de relaxamento muscular mediada pelo NO em anéis de artéria mesentérica superior isolada de ratos. Verificamos que o GM 1 causou relaxamento vascular através de uma curva cumulativa de concentrações (10 nM a 3 mM), e também determinamos que a participação do endotélio é fundamental para este efeito. O efeito vasorelaxante do GM 1 além de ser dependente da presença do endotélio vascular, é completamente bloqueado pela presença de L-NAME (1 µM), da mesma forma que os resultados encontrados nos experimentos com vasos cerebrais. Considerando que o NO formado no endotélio ativa a guanilato ciclase (GCs), também testamos o efeito do inibidor desta enzima (ODQ- 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -alpha]quinoxalin- 1 -one) no efeito vasorelaxante do GM 1. Neste caso, o efeito do GM 1 foi bloqueado parcialmente pelo ODQ (10 µM). Além da participação da GCs, avaliamos o papel dos canais de K+ no efeito vasorelaxante do GM 1. Verificamos que o tetraetilamônio (1 mM), um bloqueador não seletivo, assim como a glibenclamida (10 µM), bloqueador dos canais de K+ sensíveis ao ATP bloquearam parcialmente o efeito do GM 1. Por outro lado, a apamina (50 nM), um bloqueador de canais de K+ dependentes voltagem e Ca²+ (KCa) de baixa condutância não alterou o efeito do GM 1, enquanto que a caribdotoxina (50 nM), um bloqueador de KCa de alta condutância deslocou a curva de relaxamento para a direita. Em resumo, neste trabalho mostramos a participação do NO e dos canais de K+ na vasodilatação induzida pelo GM 1. Embora mais estudos sejam necessários para estabelecer o mecanismo vasodilatador do GM 1, sugerimos que uma terapia adjunta com GM 1 ou com drogas correlatas é válida em condições clínicas onde o aumento do fluxo sanguíneo é associado a um melhor prognóstico, como doenças vasculares obstrutivas e doenças neurodegenerativas. Monosialotetra-hexosylganglioside (GM 1) is a glycosphingolipid {{present in}} most cell membranes which displays antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Additionally, {{it has been}} recently demonstrated that GM 1 increases catalase content in the CNS due to vasodilation, {{and it has been}} suggested that vasodilation may be responsible, at least in part, for the neuroprotective properties of GM 1. However, the mechanisms underlying GM 1 -induced vasodilation have not been determined. Given the pivotal role of nitric oxide and potassium channels in the control of vascular tonus, we decided to investigate whether these mediators are involved in the vasodilation induced by GM 1. Initially, we investigated the effect of L-NAME (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 60 mg/kg, i. p.), an inhibitor of nitric oxide sinthase (NOS), on the cerebral vasodilation induced by GM 1 (50 mg/kg, i. p.) in male wistar rats. L-NAME fully prevented the increase in outer diameter of pial vessels induced by GM 1. In addition, we investigated the content of stable NO end products, namely, nitrites and nitrates (NOx), as well as the content of the hemoglobin (Hb) in the hipocampus and cerebral cortex 15, 30 and 60 min after GM 1 administration. Interestingly, GM 1 increased Hb content and decreased NOx content 60 min after administration. Since it has been demonstrated that NO end products like NOx can be removed from brain in vivo by blood flow, a possible effect of GM 1 on NOx levels could be masked. Therefore, we decided to investigated the effect of GM 1 (0, 10, 30 e 100 µM) on NOx content in slices of cerebral cortex. The incubation of slices with GM 1 (100 µM) for 30 min significantly increased NOx levels. In addition, we observed decreased NOx levels after 60 min of incubation, without changes in Hb content. In order to obtain pharmacological evidence for the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in GM 1 -induced increase of NOx content in situ, cortical slices were incubated with L-NAME (100 µM) in the presence or absence of GM 1 (100 µM) for 30 minutes, and the NOx content was measured. L-NAME blunted GM 1 -induced increase of NOx content. Since it has been demonstrated that GM 1 induces pial vessel vasodilation and increases NOx content in cerebral cortex, which are fully prevented by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, we further investigated whether GM 1 relaxes larger vessels, as well as the mechanisms by which GM 1 causes vasorelaxation. We found that GM 1 (10, 30, 100, 300 µM, 1 and 3 mM) induced vascular relaxation of the rat mesenteric artery, as determined by isometric tension studies in arterial rings contracted with 1 µM phenylephrine. The vasorelaxation induced by GM 1 was abolished by endothelium removal, by incubation with LNAME (1 µM) and partially inhibited by the blockade of potassium channels by 1 mM tetraethylammonium, 10 μM glibenclamide, by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1 H- [1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -alpha]quinoxalin- 1 -one (10 µM), and by 50 nM charybdotoxin, a blocker of large and intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. Moreover, GM 1 - induced relaxation was not affected by apamin (50 nM), a small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel blocker. Althogether, these results indicate that nitric oxide and potassium channels participate in the vasodilation induced by GM 1. Although more studies are necessary to definitely establish the mechanisms underlying the GM 1 -induced vasodilation, we suggest that vasodilation may underlie some of the biological effects of exogenous GM 1 ganglioside and that adjunct therapy with GM 1 may be of value in clinical conditions in which increased blood flow is associated to a better prognosis, such as obstructive vascular and neurodegenerative diseases.

A frota considerada é constituída pelos veículos cadastrados no Detran-PR com ano/modelo igual ou {{superior}} a 1980. Os fatores médios de emissão daCetesb foram corrigidos pelos fatores de deterioração da Cetesb e do AP 42. Os fatores de deterioração do AP- 42 se mostraram mais adequados para representar o aumento nas emissões dos veículos, principalmente para veículos mais novos. A frota considerada apresentou maior concentração de veículos mais recentes a gasolina e o quasedesaparecimento dos veículos a álcool. Veículos com ano/modelo inferior a 1988, representando apenas 9, 90 % da frota considerada, contribuíram com quase 35 % das emissões de CO, 28 % das emissões de HC e 17 % das emissões <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> no caso dos veículos a gasolina.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1) Objectives : During {{a typical}} day a person's time is mostly divided between their home, workplace and either public or private transport. The dose received over the timescale of a day {{is the sum of}} doses received in these different micro-environments, which supposes knowledge of the time spent in each of them as well as the quality and variability of pollutant concentrations. The aim of the project presented here is to study the levels and dynamics of pollutants entering a particularly important micro-environment, that of the passenger compartment. This is done by considering: - nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particle number and size; - monitoring exposure during various trips (highway, beltways); - taking into account factors that influence exposure, such as the distance between the source vehicle and the target vehicle. 2) Method : A vehicle was equipped with two NOx analysers (TEI), a CO analyser (Maihak), a granulometer (ELPI J DEKATI) and particle counter (P-Track / TSI). The measurements focused on the air expelled at the outlet of the passenger compartment ventilator. Trips were made in different environments such as a highway and the Paris beltway, as well as in a tunnel at night behind a known type of vehicle for a known distance. 3) Results and conclusions : Orders of magnitude of concentration were determined for the pollutants considered for different exposure conditions (open and closed environments, and light and heavy traffic). During tunnel driving tests, a clear link was established between exposure characteristics on the one hand and, on the other, factors such as the nature of the vehicle followed, its engine rating and the distance separating the target and the source. Au cours de sa journée, un citadin répartit essentiellement son temps entre son domicile, son lieu de travail et les transports individuels ou collectifs. La dose reçue à l'échelle d'une journée, est la somme des doses reçues dans ces différents micro-environnements.

40|$|Contemporary {{architecture}} is increasingly {{influenced by the}} concept of landscape, and this is particularly {{the case in the}} Netherlands. Like at many other places, a new mindset is emerging, transforming the core values of the disciplines of architecture and urbanism with the notion of the organization of architectural space as a landscape. Through experiment our lab develops methods to analyze such phenomena in focused studies of specific cases, understanding how architects use landscape not only as a metaphor but also as a method to design buildings. 32 students selected and analyzed outstanding built work of a wide field of architects from four generations of Dutch practitioners starting with Huig Maaskant (founder of the RAvB), Huig Maaskant, Wim QUist, OMA, SANAA, Mecanoo, MVRDV, <b>NOX,</b> <b>De</b> Zwarte Hond, NL-Architects, Onix, FACT and MonderschijmMoonen.

Biogas combustion is analyzed by numeri cal model simulations, which take in account the mass, energy (gas and solid phases) and species conservation equations. The model is structured with a flexible code in languag e FORTRAN, which includes equilibrium calculation performed through premixed combustion simulation software, the PREMIX, adapted to the combustion process and heat transfer in porous medium. The simulation allows the prediction of the temperature distribution profiles along the burner and the combustion products as function of two main operation parameters, the equivalence ratio and the air-fuel mixture flow vel ocity.

40|$|A minimização das emissões de óxidos <b>de</b> nitrogênio (<b>NOx)</b> na atmosfera tem sido um dos grandes desafios da área de proteção ambiental. Dentre os processos para o tratamento dos NOx possíveis, a redução catalítica seletiva do NO com hidrocarbonetos (RCS-HC) vem apresentando excelentes perspectivas. Para este processo os catalisadores metal/zeólita ZSM- 5 possuem adequados níveis de conversão em condições oxidantes. Dentro deste contexto, este trabalho teve como objetivo preparar catalisadores Cu, Co e FeZSM- 5. As amostras foram caracterizadas por DRX, DRS-UVVIS, FTIR, RTP-H 2, MEV e sua atividade verificada através da redução de NO a N 2 com propano ou metano em atmosfera oxidante, na presença ou ausência de vapor de água. Os resultados de RTP-H 2 mostraram que as espécies presentes nos catalisadores Cu, Co e FeZSM- 5, após ativação térmica, foram principalmente os cátions Cu 2 + (Cu&# 945; 2 + e Cu&# 946; 2 +), Co 2 + e Fe 3 + compensando carga na zeólita, respectivamente. A partir de FTIR e DRS-UVVIS foi possível, também, identificar espécies oxidas, as quais estavam presentes em teores menores. Na redução de NO a N 2 na ausência de vapor de água os catalisadores CuZSM- 5 apresentaram maiores conversões de NO que os contendo Fe ou Co. Entretanto, os catalisadores FeZSM- 5 apresentaram, nessa condição, atividade em temperaturas menores, o que mostra uma vantagem para o seu uso prático. Na presença de vapor de água, verificou-se uma maior queda da atividade no catalisador CuZSM- 5, somente recuperada com a retirada desse composto na alimentação, sendo que para os catalisadores CoZSM- 5 e FeZSM- 5 a perda de atividade foi parcialmente recuperada ao longo do tempo. The {{minimization}} of {{the emissions}} of nitrogen oxides (NOx) {{in the atmosphere}} {{has been one of}} the great goals in the area of environmental protection. Among the possible processes to treat the NOx, the selective catalytic reduction of NO with hydrocarbons (SCR-HC) has presented important expectations. For this process, the metal/ZSM- 5 type catalysts have appropriate levels of conversion in oxidative conditions. In this context, the aim of this work was to prepare Cu, Co and FeZSM- 5 catalysts. The samples were characterized by XRD, DRS-UVVIS, FTIR, H 2 -TPR, SEM and tested in the reduction of NO to N 2 with propane or methane in oxidative atmosphere in the presence or absence of water steam. The H 2 -TPR data showed that the cationic species present in the prepared Cu, Co and FeZSM- 5 catalysts, after thermal activation, were mainly Cu 2 + (Cu&# 945; 2 + e Cu&# 946; 2 +), Co 2 + and Fe 3 + cations located in charge compensation sites in the zeolite, respectively. From FTIR and DRS-UVVIS it was also possible identify oxide species, which were present in a lower content. In the reduction of NO to N 2 in the absence of water steam, the CuZSM- 5 catalysts showed higher levels of conversion of NO than those based in Co and Fe. However, the FeZSM- 5 catalysts showed, in this condition, activity at lower temperatures. This behavior makes them potentially interesting to be applied for practical purposes. On the other hand, in the presence of water steam, it was verified a higher loss of activity of the CuZSM- 5 catalyst, which was totally restored removing the water in the feed. For the Co and FeZSM- 5 catalysts, the activity loss in the presence of water steam was partially recovered during time on stream...|$|R
40|$|Ces travaux s'inscrivent dans le cadre du {{programme}} national de MEsure des Retombées Atmosphériques (MERA). Ils portent sur la recherche de l'origine des précipitations collectées entre 1997 et 1999 dans trois (Morvan, Iraty, Le Casset) des onze stations du réseau MERA localisées en différents points du territoire français. Deux méthodes statistiques ont été utilisées dans cette étude. Les régions à l'origine des fortes concentrations mesurées au site récepteur ont d'abord été déterminées à l'aide d'un modèle (méthode de Seibert) combinant les mesures réalisées sur site et les rétrotrajectoires de masses d'air puis, dans un second temps les différents profils de transport atmosphérique, leur fréquence et concentrations associées ont été évaluées à l'aide d'une classification par Nuées Dynamiques (méthode K-means/distance Euclidienne simple) des rétrotrajectoires de masses d'air. Le test de Kruskal-Wallis a été utilisé pour vérifier si les médianes des concentrations associées à chaque classe sont statistiquement différentes. L'étude réalisée à Iraty (Pyrénées) et au Casset (Alpes) a montré que ces deux stations sont influencées différemment du Morvan. Plus exactement, ces deux sites ne sont pas, ou pratiquement pas, influencés par les zones d'Europe centrale ou du Nord-Ouest fortement émettrices de SO 2, <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> et de NH 3. Seul le pH des précipitations collectées à Iraty semble dépendre des émissions de SO 2 et <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> d'une de ces zones. Iraty et le Casset sont très influencées par les émissions anthropiques et par les poussières d'origine terrestres en provenance d'Afrique du Nord. Néanmoins, les niveaux de concentrations mesurés dans les flux en provenance d'Afrique du Nord sont similaires pour Iraty, le Casset et le Morvan (sauf en ions calcium, pour lequel le Casset et Iraty montrent de fortes concentrations). Une autre région européenne peut influencer les niveaux en composés acidifiants mesurés au Casset, il s'agit de l'Italie et de la zone localisée {{au niveau}} de l'ex-Yougoslavie. Mais, les niveaux de concentrations qui en résultent sont faibles par rapport à ceux mesurés dans certains flux arrivant au Morvan. The chemistry of precipitation in France was examined {{using data from the}} French atmospheric deposition network (MERA). In order to examine the source-receptor relationships responsible for acid rain at three background sites in France, a receptor-oriented model was applied to the precipitation data collected from 1997 to 1999. This methodology combined precipitation and chemical data with air parcel backward trajectories to establish concentration field maps of likely contributing sources. Then, a clustering technique using partitioning methods (K-means/Euclidian distance) was performed to backward trajectories and the distributions of mixing samples associated with backward trajectories in each cluster were compared. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to verify that the concentration medians associated with each cluster were statistically significant. The results of this study demonstrated that two stations (Iraty and le Casset) were not influenced by the same sources as Morvan. Specifically, these sites were less influenced by high emissions from Central or Northwestern Europe when compared to Morvan. Only the pH seemed under the influence of SO 2 and NOx emissions from one of these areas. Iraty and Le casset are very influenced by anthropogenic emissions and the crustal sources around the Mediterranean Basin and North Africa. Other European areas (e. g. Italy) can influence the concentrations recorded at Le Casset but the levels of concentration are lower than those measured at Morvan. This paper represents a complete statistical analysis of wet-only deposition chemistry data for three stations (Iraty, Le Casset and Morvan). Two statistical methods were used in this study. In order to examine the source-receptor relationships responsible for acid rain at these three background sites in France, a receptor-oriented model was applied to the precipitation data collected from 1997 to 1999. This methodology combined chemical data with air parcel backward trajectories to establish concentration field maps of likely contributing sources. This receptor-oriented model was developed by Seibert and it assumes that if a trajectory endpoint falls in a grid cell (i,j), the air mass is assumed to collect components emitted in this cell and once the components are incorporated, they are transported along the trajectory to the receptor site. This model doesn't take into account the atmospheric diffusion and the removal mechanisms occurring during the trajectory from the sources to the receptor. Finally, a concentration field map for the selected species was calculated taking into account all grid cells. For mapping, the grid cells counting fewer than 10 endpoints were not taken in consideration because the confidence of their results was considered too low. The role of three-dimensional backward trajectories is fundamental, so we used three different information sources: the French Institute of Meteorology, Météo-France; the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC); and the Atmospheric Environment Service Long Range Transport model of Air Pollution (AES-LRTAP), Canada. These trajectory models were compared for different chemical species. All data were projected in the EMEP grid (150 x 150 km) for establishment of the concentration field map. A clustering technique by partitioning methods (K-means/Euclidian distance) was performed on backward trajectories and the distributions of mixing samples associated with backward trajectories in each cluster were compared. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to verify that the median concentrations associated with each cluster were statistically significant. The results of this study for Morvan determined five classes of backward trajectories associated with the precipitation collected at this station located in the centre of France. The fluxes from SW and WSW sectors contribute for 52 % of events, while the fluxes of NW and E contribute for 31 % of events but are mainly responsible for high concentrations of sulphates, nitrates, ammonium and hydronium ion. Regions found to be responsible for rain events coincide with European regions known for their high anthropogenic emissions of SO 2 and NOx (Great Britain, North of France, Belgium, The Netherlands and the North of sea). The results for Iraty (South of France) yielded five classes of backward trajectories associated with the precipitation collected in this station. The fluxes from W sectors (NNW, NW, W and WSW) were responsible for 71 % of events, while the flux of S (low wind) was responsible for 29 % of events but is mainly responsible for high concentrations of sulphates, nitrates, ammonium and calcium. High concentrations of hydronium ion were identified in the NNW sector. The results for Le Casset (East region and mountainous) gave four classes of backward trajectories associated with the precipitation collected in this station. The fluxes from W and WSW sectors were responsible for 35 % of events, while the flux of SSW was responsible for 43 % and the flux from the SE was responsible for 22 % of events. This last sector was mainly responsible for high concentrations of sulphates, nitrates, ammonium and calcium. The concentrations measured at this station were low. Regions found to be responsible for rain events coincide with southern and eastern areas known for their high anthropogenic emissions of SO 2 and NOx (north Africa, northern Italy, Yugoslavia). All these results demonstrate that the Iraty and Le Casset stations were not influenced by the same sources as Morvan. Specifically, these sites were less influenced by the high emissions from central or northwestern Europe than Morvan. Only the measurement of pH seemed to be under the influence of SO 2 and NOx emissions of one of these areas. Iraty and Le Casset were very influenced by the anthropogenic emissions and the crustal sources around the Mediterranean Basin and North Africa. Other European areas (e. g., Italy) can influence the concentrations recorded at Le Casset but the levels were lower than those measured at Morvan. A relation between sulphates, nitrates and ammonium was identified for Morvan and Le Casset. This observation suggests that aerosol transport of NH 4 HSO 4, (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and NH 4 NO 3 is occurring...|$|E

Este estudo teve como objetivo {{investigar}} a ação do H 2 S nos marcadores de estresse oxidativo e sua interação com o oxido nítrico ('NO) na inflamação alérgica pulmonar de camundongos. Camundongos BALB/c foram sensibilizados com ovalbumina (OVA) e tratados com o doador de H 2 S, hidrosulfeto de sódio (NaHS), ou com o inibidor da oxido nítrico sinatase induzível (iNOS), 1400 W, 30 minutos e 2 h antes do desafio com OVA, respectivamente. Vinte e quatro, 48 e 96 h após o desafio, os animais foram sacrificados e coletou-se o lavado broncoalveolar para contagem total e diferencial de leucócitos e dosagem dos níveis de NOx; os pulmões foram homogeneizados para análise da expressão das proteínas iNOS, MnSOD e Cu/ZnSOD por Western blotting e verificação dos níveis da 3 -nitrotirosina (3 -NT) por Slot blotting. A atividade da iNOS foi analisada pela conversão de L-arginina para L-citrulina. Os resultados demonstraram que o tratamento com NaHS inibiu a migração de neutrófilos para os pulmões de camundongos sensibilizados em 24 h e 48 h e de eosinófilos em 48 h após o desafio alergênico, quando comparados com os camundongos controles (não tratados). De maneira semelhante, o tratamento com 1400 W inibiu o influxo de eosinófilos para o pulmão dos camundongos alérgicos em 48 h. O controles em 48 h que foi inibida tanto pelo tratamento com NaHS como pelo 1400 W. Neste período,desafio com OVA provocou aumento da expressão da iNOS nos pulmões dos animais observou-se aumento da atividade da NOS Ca -independente nos pulmões dos camundongos controles. O tratamento com 1400 W, mas não com NaHS, provocou redução desta atividade. Quando comparados com os animais não desafiados, os níveis <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> nos controles estavam aumentados em todos períodos estudados. Os tratamentos com 1400 W e NaHS reduziram seus níveis em 48 h e 96 h, respectivamente. A expressão da 3 -NT foi reduzida pelo 1400 W em 48 h, mas nenhum efeito foi observado com o NaHS. O desafio com OVA nos animais controles não alterou a expressão de MnSOD, mas provocou aumento da expressão da Cu/ZnSOD em 48 h após o desafio com OVA. Neste período, o NaHS reduziu a expressão da MnSOD e o 1400 W a expressão da Cu/ZnSOD. Estes resultados demonstram que o efeito anti-inflamatório do H 2 S na asma ao inibir a migração de eosinófilos e neutrófilos para os pulmões não é decorrente de mecanismos relacionados à via do 'NO. Se a redução da expressão da MnSOD verificada nos animais tratados com NaHS está relacionada à apoptose de eosinófilos e/ou neutrófilos e, consequentemente, à diminuição do conteúdo destas células no LBA precisa ser verificado.

Twenty-four, 48 and 96 h after challenge, mice were sacrificed and the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was collected to investigate the total and differential leukocyte counts and the NOx leveis. The lungs were homogenized to analyze the iNOS, MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD protein expressions by Western blotting and the 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT) leveis by Slot blotting. The iNOS activity was determined by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Results showed that NaHS-treatment of sensitized mice inhibited neutrophil migration at 24 h and 48 h, as well as the eosinophil influx to the lungs at 48 h after allergen challenge when compared with control mice (untreated). Similarly, 1400 W-treatment reduced the content of eosinophils in the BAL of allergic mice at 48 hours. OVA-challenge caused an increase in iNOS expression in the lungs of control mice at 48 hours, which was inhibited by NaHS or 1400 W treatments. At this time, an increase in Ca+-independent NOS activity was observed in the lungs of control mice. The 1400 W-treatment, but not NaHS-treatment, caused a reduction in this activity. When compared with non-challenged mice, NOx leveis were increased in coritrols at ali times studied. Treatment with 1400 W or NaHS reduced their leveis at 48 h and 96 h, respectively. The 3 -NT expression was reduced by 1400 W at 48 hours, but no effect was observed with the NaHS-treatment. The OVA-challenge of control mice did not modify the MnSOD expression, but caused increased of Cu/ZnSOD expression at 48 hours. However, the NAHS reduced the MnSOD expression and 1400 W inhibited the Cu/ZnSOD expression at this time. These results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of H 2 S in asthma by inhibiting eosinophils and neutrophil migration to the lungs is not due to mechanisms associated with 'NO pathway. If the reduced MnSOD expression observed in NaHS-treated mice is related with the eosinophil apoptosis and, consequently, decrease of inflammatory cells content in the BAL needs to be studied...|$|E

Parmi celles-ci, l'échangeur de chaleur et de matière à parois poreuses proposé par l'Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) est destiné aux opérations de séparation de mélanges gazeux contenant au moins un produit condensable. La première application assurée par Chaudières Seccacier SA concerne le chauffage au gaz industriel ou collectif. Le procédé consiste à effectuer le transfert de chaleur et d'eau entre fumées et air de combustion à travers une paroi poreuse qui assure la séparation des deux fluides par le film d'eau retenu par capillarité dans ses pores. Après la phase probatoire qui a concerné une chaudière de 200 kW, le développement en cours, avant la diffusion commerciale, s'effectue sur des chaudières de 500 kW. Le rendement énergétique est accru de 5 à 10 % si l'on se réfère aux chaudières à condensation, ce qui induit une réduction des émissions de CO 2 de 20 à 50 % selon les installations et l'énergie déplacée. La réduction des émissions <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> imputable à l'utilisation d'un air comburant saturé d'eau est de 65 % environ. The {{increase in}} the energy efficiency of processes is now a constant preoccupation that is included in all procedures aiming for the technico-economic optimization of industrial production. This trend is leading to the designing of systems integrating several simultaneous functions : chemical reaction, separation and heat transfer. In addition to the energy increase {{there is often a}} reduction in the bulk of installations, an improvement in reliability and better control of how the process operates. The porous-wall heat and mass exchanger (ECMP) proposed by Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) for this purpose, which is covered by a basic patent, aims to separate gaseous mixtures containing at least one condensable product. The first application under the responsibility of Chaudières Seccacier SA involved industrial or district heating. The aim was to transfer part of the heat and water from the flue gases of a condensation boiler to the air of combustion. The ECMP was substituted for a heat exchange system based on patents held by Chaudières Seccacier SA and Gaz de France. Its job was to perform heat and mass transferts between the two fluids in two successive phases in two direct combustion air/water and flue-gas/water contact columns (Fig. 1 a). The simplification made possible by the ECMP (Fig. 1 b) stems from the performing of both operations in a single module. The two gases between which the heat and mass exchanges occur circulate on either side of a porous membrane, which, because of its hydrophilic nature and porous structure (pore diameters and porosity in particular), separates the two gases by a film of condensed water held in place by capillarity in its pores. In addition to the advantages of compactness and reliability thus obtained, this design defines the circulation spaces of the fluids (distance between two porous membranes, with both fluids being acted upon alternately) according to the pressure drops requested by the user. This technique is thus based mainly on the choice of the porous medium (nature of the constituent material, structure) so as to give the membrane the right properties for it to fulfill its heat and mass transfer and physical separation functions of the two fluids. In addition to these purely operational aspects, the membrane must also meet the technological constraints required by the manufacturing and the physical operating conditions. The analysis of the functional roles (heat and mass transfer, separation) leads to a definition of the range of pore diameters capable of ensuring both mass transfer according to a kinetics compatible with the flow rates required by the evaporation and condensation phases and the capillary retention of water to create a film resisting the pressure variations that may occur {{on either side of the}} wall. The values to which this analysis leads obviously depend on the specific conditions chosen by the user. However, it can be assumed that the pore diameters must not exceed 150 µm for applications of the type considered. The choice of the nature of the material making up the porous medium is very large : metals, polymers, glass or composites. The way they are implemented also covers a wide range : sintering, felting, weaving. The obvious simplification resulting from the use of the ECMP for the applications developed by Chaudières Seccacier SA (Figs. 4 and 5) gives access to this means of recovery for the market for medium-powered boilers of around 500 kW, which, to date, has been inaccessible for systems implementing two coupled heat-exchange columns. The {{increase in the}} energy efficiency of boilers equipped with the ECMP and technological improvements making for optimum boiler operating (now fed With saturated air at a temperature close to that of the flue gases) is between 5 and 10 % when referring to conventional condensation boilers and between 1 and 5 % compared to boilers equipped with the device including the two heat-exchange columns (Fig. 6). Likewise, the impact on the environment resulting from the increase in efficiency and the use of water-saturated oxidizer air results during operating in a reduction of emissions, which, for CO 2, is between 20 and 50 % depending on the installations and the energy displaced, and about 65 % for NOx (Fig. 7). After probatory tests performed on a 200 kW boiler, thus confirming the proper choice of the porous medium, development is continuing on 500 kW boilers (Fig. 8) designed for district heating. This achievement displayed at EXPOTHERM 92 was the reason why Chaudières Seccacier SA received the Super Oscar for Innovation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we analyse {{some aspects of the}} interdependences between the economy and the {{environment}} by applying the input-output approach. Although economic activity affects the environment in many ways, in {{this study we}} only focus on one: the atmospheric pollution. Concretely, we consider nine different gases. On one hand, the six greenhouse gases regulated by Kyoto protocol: carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). And, on the other hand, three gases related to local environmental problems such as acidification and eutrophication: sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ammonia (NH 3). The study is structured in four self-contained essays that examine the relation between the economic activity and emissions in Spain from different perspectives. After an introductory chapter, in Chapter 2 we describe the methodology and the database used in other chapters. First, we present the basis of the input-output analysis emphasising those characteristics that make it a suitable approach to study the interdependences between the economy and the environment. Then, we describe the database and the procedure required to obtain an environmentally extended input-output table for Spain. We apply the environmentally extended input-output model presented in this chapter to describe the Spanish situation regarding atmospheric pollution in 1995 and 2000. In Chapter 3, we examine the contribution of the driving forces of the evolution of emissions in Spain from 1995 to 2000. For doing so, we decompose the change in emissions into the three main 'sources'. First, shifts in total intensity emission matrix (the eco-technological effect); second, changes in the composition of final uses (the structure effect); and third, changes in the level of final uses (the level effect). We quantify the effects of these three determinants performing a structural decomposition analysis. Chapter 4 shows the capacity of input-output analysis to study the relationship between the economic activity and the environment at a micro level. The purpose of this chapter is to analyse the different impact on atmospheric pollution of different households with different 'economic position'. We calculate total (direct and indirect) emissions generated by private consumption of Spanish households classified by quintiles of expenditure in the year 2000. In Chapter 5 we estimate the emissions embodied in Spanish international trade. By applying a multiregional input-output model we define and compare two approaches: the responsibility emission balance and the trade emission balance. We evaluate the international responsibility of Spain in 1995 and 2000. Finally, Chapter 6 summarises the conclusions of this study. El propósito de esta tesis es el de analizar algunos de los factores que determinan las interdependencias existentes entre la economía y el medio ambiente. Aunque la actividad económica afecta al medio ambiente de forma muy diversa, el objeto de estudio de este trabajo está centrado en el análisis de un único problema medio ambiental: la contaminación atmosférica. Concretamente se consideran nueve gases diferentes. Por un lado los seis gases de efecto invernadero regulados por el protocolo de Kioto: dióxido de carbono (CO 2), metano (CH 4), óxido nitroso (N 2 O), hexafluoruro de azufre (SF 6), hidrofluorocarbonos (HFCs), y perfluorocarbonos (PFCs). Y por otro lado, tres gases relacionados con problemas medioambientales de carácter más local y/o regional como son la acidificación y la eutrofización: óxidos de azufre (SOx), óxidos <b>de</b> nitrógeno (<b>NOx),</b> y amoniaco (NH 3). </i...|$|R

The city of Manaus has been growth {{in recent decades}} mainly due to the secondary sector because of industries, {{as well as the}} tourism, leading increasing construction and the vehicle fleet. Consequently, there were an increase of pollutant generation, especially the emission of the total particulate matter (TPM) to the atmosphere. The TPM in the atmosphere is mainly related to resuspension of soil, industrial and vehicular emissions, or to reactions in the atmosphere with gases released by burning fossil fuels, such as NOx and SOx. The {{purpose of this study is}} to quantify the soluble inorganic species, especially the ions Cl-, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, PO 4 3 - NO 2 -, F-, Br-, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Li+ and NH 4 +, in the total particulate matter collected in four locations of Manaus city, with different characteristics: industrial, vehicular, green urban area and the background, a location with a minimum human interference. The active sampling was performed with average flow of 19, 5 ? 2, 5 L min- 1 weekly for 8 hours. Samples were collected in the rainy season (between December 2012 and March 2013) and in the dry season (June- August 2013), The ions were determined by ion chromatography with conductometric detection. Among all ions studied, those that stood out were NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and NH 4 +. NO 3 -, SO 4 2 - and NH 4 + were characterized as derived from fossil fuel burning and K+ as an indicator of biomass burning, a common practice in the metropolitan area.

40|$|Periodontitis, a {{relevant}} cause of teeth loss in adults, is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by alveolar bone resorption and collagen fibers and cementum destruction. S-nitrosogluthathione (GSNO) {{is considered to}} be an NO donor and to act as a reservoir of NO in vivo. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of GSNO in experimental periodontal disease (EPD). EPD was induced by a nylon thread ligature surgically placed around the cervix of the second left maxillary molars of female Wistar rats. Animals were treated with 50 &# 956;L GSNO (0, 5, 2 or 10 mmol L- 1), PVP or saline subgingivally 30 minutes before periodontits induction and daily until sacrifice on 11 th day. The parameters analysed were alveolar bone loss (ABL), bone alkaline phosphatase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cytokines levels (IL- 1 &# 946; and TNF-&# 945;), malondialdeyhyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) content, nitrite/nitrate levels, and immunohistochemistry for metalloproteinase (MMP- 1 / 8), inducible nitric oxide syntase (iNOS) and nuclear factor-&# 954;B (NF&# 954;B). In order to confirm the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of GSNO was used the peritonitis and paw edema models. Peritonitis was induced by injection of 1 mL carrageenan (500 &# 956;L/cavity) or saline ip in naÃve rats or in rats that received saline, PVP or GSNO (0, 5, 2 or 10 mmol L- 1, ip) 1 hour prior to the carrageenan. After 4 hours, the animals were sacrificed for collection of the fluid peritoneal. Paw edema was induced by subplantar injection of carrageenan (500 &# 61549;g/paw). Saline, PVP or GSNO (0, 5, 2 or 10 mmol L- 1, ip) were administered 1 hour before the inflammatory stimuli into the left hind paw. The animals were sacrificed 4 hours after the ip injection of carrageenan. The parameters analysed were volume of paw edema, migration of leukocytes for cavity peritoneal, MPO, cytokines (IL- 1 &# 946; and TNF-&# 945;), GSH and MDA. The GSNO in the concentrations of 0, 5 and 2 mmol L- 1 reduced ABL, MPO, inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 &# 946; and TNF â&# 945;), nitrite/nitrate, and it increased GSH. GSNO 0, 5 and 2 mmol L- 1 also decreased the demarcation to MMP- 1 /- 8, NOSi and NF -&# 954;B. However, just GSNO 2 mmol L- 1 reduced MDA. Results similar were found in the peritonitis and in the paw edema, added to the fact that GSNO 0, 5 and 2 mmol L- 1 decreased the volume of the paw edema and the migration of leukocytes and neutrophils to the cavity peritoneal. These results show that GSNO has a protective effect on the experimental periodontal disease, peritonitis and paw edema by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. A periodontite, importante causa de perda dentÃria em adultos, Ã uma doenÃa inflamatÃria crÃnica caracterizada pela reabsorÃÃo do osso alveolar e das fibras colÃgenas, bem como destruiÃÃo do cemento. O S-nitrosoglutationa (GSNO) Ã considerado um doador de NO e atua como reservatÃrio de NO in vivo. O objetivo do presente estudo foi investigar o efeito do GSNO na doenÃa periodontal experimental (DPE). A DPE foi induzida passando-se um fio de nÃilon 3. 0 em torno do segundo molar superior esquerdo de ratos Wistar fÃmeas. Os animais foram tratados com 50 &# 956;l GSNO (0, 5, 2 e 10 mmol L- 1), PVP (polivinil pirrolidona, diluente do GSNO) ou salina subgengivalmente 30 minutos antes da induÃÃo da periodontite e diariamente atÃ o dia do sacrifÃcio no 11 Â dia. Foram analisados os seguintes parÃmetros: Ãndice de perda Ãssea (IPO), fosfatase alcalina Ãssea (FAO), mieloperoxidase (MPO), dosagem de citocinas (IL- 1 &# 946; e TNF-&# 945;), malondialdeÃdo (MDA), glutationa reduzida (GSH), conteÃdo <b>de</b> nitrito/nitrato (<b>NOx)</b> e imunohistoquÃmica para metaloproteinase- 1 /- 8 (MMP- 1 /- 8), Ãxido nÃtrico sintase induzida (NOSi) e fator de transcriÃÃo nuclear-&# 954;B (NF-&# 954;B). A fim de confirmar o efeito antiinflamatÃrio e antioxidante do GSNO foram utilizados os modelos de peritonite e edema de pata. A peritonite foi induzida atravÃs da injeÃÃo de 1 mL de carragenina ou salina (500 &# 956;L) na cavidade peritoneal 1 hora apÃs a administraÃÃo intraperitoneal (i. p.) de salina, PVP ou GSNO (0, 5, 2 ou 10 mmol L- 1). ApÃs 4 horas, os animais foram sacrificados para coleta do fluido peritoneal. Para o edema de pata, salina, PVP ou GSNO (0, 5, 2 ou 10 mmol L- 1, i. p.) foram administrados uma hora antes da injeÃÃo de 0, 1 mL de carragenina (500 &# 956;g/pata) ou salina por via subplantar (sp) na pata traseira esquerda de cada rata. O sacrifÃcio dos animais ocorreu 4 horas apÃs a injeÃÃo do estÃmulo inflamatÃrio. Os seguintes parÃmetros foram analisados: volume do edema da pata, migraÃÃo de leucÃcitos para cavidade peritoneal, MPO, IL- 1 &# 946;, TNF-&# 945;, GSH e MDA. O GSNO nas concentraÃÃes de 0, 5 e 2 mmol L- 1 reduziu o IPO, MPO, citocinas prÃ-inflamatÃrias IL- 1 &# 946; and TNF-&# 945;, nitrito/nitrato, e aumentou GSH. O GSNO nas concentraÃÃes de 0, 5 e 2 mmol L- 1 tambÃm diminuÃram a imunomarcaÃÃo para MMP- 1 /- 8, NOSi e NF-&# 954;B. Contudo, apenas GSNO 2 mmol L- 1 diminuiu MDA. Resultados semelhantes foram encontrados na peritonite e no edema de pata, acrescido de que o GSNO 0, 5 e 2 mmol L- 1 diminuiu tanto o volume do edema de pata como a migraÃÃo de leucÃcitos e neutrÃfilos para a cavidade peritoneal. Esses resultados mostram que o GSNO possui efeito protetor na doenÃa periodontal experimental, no edema de pata e na peritonite atravÃs da reduÃÃo da inflamaÃÃo e do estresse oxidativo...|$|R
40|$|Europe's cities – home to 70 % of the EU {{population}} and generating over 80 % of the Union's GDP - are connected {{by one of}} the world's best transport systems (European Commission Regional Policy, 2011). The Barcelona metropolitan area is home to 3 million people and occupies a surface area of 636 km 2. This thesis, is structured into four chapters and this introductory one. While chapter two analyze mobility characteristic in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area with policy implications, chapter three and four pursue to evaluate specific mobility policies. On chapter 5 concludes and add policy recommendations. On chapter 2 we analyze the factors influencing CO 2 emissions from daily urban mobility. Concerns about the unequal distribution of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to mobility are gaining increasing attention in scholarly analyses {{as well as in the}} public policy arena. Factors influencing on different emitters are largely unknown; and the influence is assumed to be the same for all emitters, be them low or high emitters. We use a household travel survey in the metropolitan area of Barcelona to differentiate the factors that result in different rates of emission. As a results, we find that top ten per cent emitters produce 49 % of total emissions, while non-daily emitters account for 38. 5 % of the sample. We adopt a quantile regression approach, which allows us to find significant differences between groups. Gender, income and home-municipality type are influential in accounting for CO 2 emissions for all groups. Educational level appears to be less significant, and occupation shows no significance at all. We confirm that socioeconomic factors have different influences on different emitting groups; these characteristics do not impact equally across all the population. On chapter 3 two speed management policies – a variable speed system and an 80 km/h speed limit – have been implemented on Barcelona’s urban motorways to mitigate NOx and PM 10 air pollution. In 2008, the maximum speed limit was reduced from 120 and 100 km/h to 80 km/h and, in 2009, a variable speed system was introduced on some metropolitan motorways. To do so, we use difference-in-differences methodology on the average and on different quantiles for fixed effect panel data, which allows us analyzing different scenarios. We find that the variable speed system improves air quality with regard to the two pollutants considered here, being most effective when nitrogen oxide levels are not too low and when particulate matter concentrations are below extremely high levels. However, reducing the maximum speed limit from 120 / 100 km/h to 80 km/h has no effect - or even a slightly increasing effect -on the two pollutants, depending on the pollution scenario. On chapter 4 we compare the relative merits of public and private delivery within a mixed delivery system. We study the role played by ownership, transaction costs, and competition on local public service delivery within the same jurisdiction. Using a stochastic cost frontier, we analyze the public-private urban bus system in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. Academics and policy makers are increasingly shifting the debate concerning the best form of public service provision beyond the traditional dilemma between pure public and pure private delivery modes, because, among other reasons, there is a growing body of evidence that casts doubt on the existence of systematic cost savings from privatization, while any competition seems to be eroded over time. We find that private firms have higher delivery costs than those incurred by the public firm, especially when transaction costs are taken into account. Furthermore, tenders tend to decrease delivery costs. Esta tesis doctoral pretende analizar las políticas públicas de movilidad y medio ambiente en el Área Metropolitana de Barcelona. Fuertes externalidades negativas en congestión, efectos ambientales nocivos de polución así como la generación de gases de efectos invernadero se dan en esta área. Se analizan tres políticas públicas de movilidad en el Área Metropolitana de Barcelona. En concreto, se analizan los factores socioeconómicos que afectan a la emisión de gases de efecto invernadero, un sistema de gestión mixta de autobuses urbano, entre la compañía pública concesiones privadas de autobuses que discurren por la misma zona y, por último, se analizan las políticas de reducción de la velocidad máxima de 120 a 80 km/h entre el año 2008 y 2010, así como la política de velocidad variable introducida en 2009. Los factores socioeconómicos no son un gran descriptor de las emisiones de efecto invernadero en la movilidad diaria. Sin embargo, se encuentran diferencias de efecto entre los diferentes tipos de emisores al aplicar técnicas de cuantiles. Se encuentra que la última decila más contaminante emite casi la mitad de las emisiones de gases invernadero. Así, se obtiene un coeficiente del índice de Gini de 0. 491. Para el caso del área de Barcelona, se encuentra que la política de peajes de acceso a Barcelona es insuficiente. La política de prestación mixta en el caso de Barcelona ha implicado que el operador público es mucho más eficiente al prestar el servicio que los concesionarios privados en la misma zona. Uno de los principales motivos es la falta de competencia por los contratos de prestación de servicio a los operadores privados. Además, se ha incorporado los costes de transacción del regulador. La política de reducción de la velocidad máxima de 120 / 100 a 80 km/h no tiene efectos en los niveles <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> y PM 10 una vez aplicada. No se recomienda la activación de esta política los días con unos altos niveles de contaminación. Sin embargo, la política de reducción de la velocidad variable tiene efectos sobre la reducción de estos contaminantes. Así, recomendamos la extensión de esta política a otras vías...|$|E

Neste cenÃÂrio, o desenvolvimento e a procura por fontes alternativas de energia se tornam, a cada dia, mais relevantes. Este trabalho teve como objetivo {{principal}} avaliar as diferenÃÂas entre as emissÃÂes de poluentes inorgÃÂnicos e orgÃÂnicos do biodiesel de soja e do biodiesel produzido pelas blendas de sebo bovino (62 %) e soja (38 %), e de suas misturas com o diesel mineral em diferentes proporÃÂÃÂes volumÃÂtricas (B 0, B 5, B 20, B 50 e B 100). Para realizaÃÂÃÂo dos testes utilizou-se Diesel Interior tipo A, biodiesel de soja e biodiesel composto conjuntamente por soja (38 %) e sebo bovino (62 %) em motor de bancada com injeÃÂÃÂo direta e potÃÂncia de 7, 36 kW (10 cv), acoplado a um gerador de 5, 5 kW. Para avaliaÃÂÃÂo do desempenho do motor, determinou-se o consumo mÃÂssico, especÃÂfico e energÃÂtico para as diferentes misturas combustÃÂveis bem como a eficiÃÂncia de conversÃÂo do combustÃÂvel em energia, para as formulaÃÂÃÂes testadas. Para a avaliaÃÂÃÂo das emissÃÂes de combustÃÂo utilizou-se filtros de fibra de celulose para retenÃÂÃÂo e quantificaÃÂÃÂo de particulados, analisador automÃÂtico da marca Bacharach, modelo PCA 3, na amostragem e anÃÂlise de gases inorgÃÂnicos e amostragem ativa com concentraÃÂÃÂo para coleta de gases orgÃÂnicos (BTEX), conforme o mÃÂtodo TO 17 da USEPA, o qual prescreve o uso de resinas adsorventes para captura de compostos de natureza orgÃÂnica. O mÃÂtodo de anÃÂlise dos gases orgÃÂnicos compreendeu o uso de cromatÃÂgrafo a gÃÂs, acoplado a uma unidade de dessorÃÂÃÂo tÃÂrmica (ATD) e de um detector de ionizaÃÂÃÂo de chama (DIC). Os resultados obtidos indicaram que nÃÂo houve diferenÃÂa estatÃÂstica entre os consumos especÃÂficos do diesel e dos biodiesel utilizados, que o consumo energÃÂtico do diesel foi levemente maior que o dos biodiesel usados e que a eficiÃÂncia de conversÃÂo do combustÃÂvel em energia aumentou quando se forneceu maior carga ao motor e conforme se adicionou biodiesel ao diesel. Quanto ÃÂs emissÃÂes de material particulado, verificou-se que a concentraÃÂÃÂo mÃÂssica retida em filtro foi cerca de 50 % menor com o uso do biodiesel, para as duas condiÃÂÃÂes de carga aplicadas (0, 5 kW e 1, 5 kW). Obteve-se uma reduÃÂÃÂo nas emissÃÂes de CO com o uso do biodiesel de soja (BS 100) de 48 %, 55 % e 46 % sob as cargas de 0, 5 kW, 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW, respectivamente. JÃÂ em relaÃÂÃÂo ao uso do biodiesel de gordura animal (BG 100) os resultados levaram a uma reduÃÂÃÂo de 65 % sob a carga de 0, 5 kW e 66 % para as cargas de 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW. Para o SO 2 os percentuais de reduÃÂÃÂo foram de 72 %, 73 % e 80 % para o B 100, nas cargas de 0, 5 kW, 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW, respectivamente. JÃÂ com o BG 100, conseguiu-se reduÃÂÃÂes da ordem de 80 % (para a carga de 0, 5 kW) e 76 % (para as cargas de 1, 0 e 1, 5 kW), em relaÃÂÃÂo ao diesel. As emissÃÂes <b>de</b> <b>NOx</b> aumentaram em condiÃÂÃÂes de carga mais elevada. As maiores concentraÃÂÃÂes foram verificadas para o BG 100, nas cargas de 0, 5 kW e 1, 0 kW (46 % e 57 % maiores, respectivamente, comparativamente ao petrodiesel). As emissÃÂes de BTEX apresentaram significativa reduÃÂÃÂo, em relaÃÂÃÂo ao diesel, quando do uso dos biodiesel puro. Tais reduÃÂÃÂes foram da ordem de 80 % (em 0, 5 kW), 68 % (em 1, 0 kW) e 37 % (em 1, 5 kW) com o uso do BS 100. Para o BG 100, as reduÃÂÃÂes totais de BTEX foram de 95 %, 85 % e 73 %, nas cargas de 0, 5 kW, 1, 0 kW e 1, 5 kW, respectivamente. Concluiu-se que o uso do biodiesel puro em motor gerador apresentou vantagens ambientais, pois promoveu a reduÃÂÃÂo de uma grande quantidade de gases poluentes lanÃÂados ÃÂ atmosfera e nÃÂo comprometeu, de forma significativa, o desempenho (consumo especÃÂfico e eficiÃÂncia) do motor. Sugere-se, para trabalhos futuros, que sejam realizadas tambÃÂm avaliaÃÂÃÂes da engenharia do motor gerador para se determinar quais fatores mecÃÂnicos induzem a um aumento / reduÃÂÃÂo das emissÃÂes quando do emprego do biodiesel como combustÃÂvel. Most of {{the energy}} consumed on the planet comes from fossil fuels, which {{are a source of}} non-renewable energy, and with limited forecasting future depletion. In this scenario, the development and demand for alternative energy sources become relevant. This study aimed to evaluate the differences of pollutant emissions from soybean and tallow beef biodiesel and their blend with diesel (B 0, B 5, B 20, B 50 and B 100). To perform the tests we used Diesel Interior Type A, soybean biodiesel and beef tallow biodiesel in a diesel engine with direct injection and power of 7. 36 kW (10 hp) coupled to a generator of 5. 5 kW. To evaluate the performance of the engine was determined the mass consumption, brake specific fuel consumption and energetic consumption to the various fuel blends as well. The efficiency of conversion of each fuel in energy was also determined. For the evaluation of particulate matter we used a pulp fiber filter. The exhaust emissions of inorganic gases have been performed by a Bacharach portable gas analyzer. The BTEX were sampled according to the method TO- 17 of USEPA, which prescribes the use of adsorbent resin for the capture of organic gases. The method of BTEX analysis included the use of gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a thermal desorption unit (ATD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The results indicated that there was no statistical difference between the specific consumption of diesel and biodiesel used, the energy consumption of diesel was slightly higher than that of biodiesel used and the efficiency of conversion of fuel to energy increased when provided greater load as if the engine and biodiesel added to diesel. Regarding the emissions of particulate material, {{it was found that the}} concentration by weight retained on filter was about 50 % lower with the use of biodiesel, for both loading conditions applied (0. 5 kW and 1. 5 kW). CO emissions decrease with the use of soybean biodiesel (BS 100) about 48 %, 55 % and 46 % under loads of 0. 5 kW, 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW, respectively. In relation to the use of biodiesel animal fat (BG 100) results led to a reduction of 65 % under the load of 0. 5 kW and 66 % for loads of 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW. SO 2 reduction percentages were 72 %, 73 % and 80 % for B 100, in loads of 0. 5 kW, 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW respectively. Already, with the BG 100 was achieved by reductions of 80 % (for the 0. 5 kW load) and 76 % (for loads of 1. 0 and 1. 5 kW) compared to diesel. NOx emissions increased in higher load conditions. The highest concentrations were observed for BG 100, in loads of 0. 5 kW and 1. 0 kW (46 % and 57 % higher, respectively, compared to petrodiesel). The emissions reported significant reduction in BTEX, in relation to diesel, when the use of pure biodiesel. Such reductions were approximately 80 % (0. 5 kW), 68 % (at 1. 0 kW) and 37 % (1. 5 kW) using the BS 100. For the BG 100, the reductions of total BTEX were 95 %, 85 % and 73 % under loads of 0. 5 kW, 1. 0 kW and 1. 5 kW, respectively. It was concluded that the use of biodiesel in motor generator showed environmental advantages, since promoted reduction of a large quantity of polluting gases released to the atmosphere and did not affect significantly the performance (specific consumption and efficiency) of the engine. It is suggested for future work, which are also held engineering evaluations engine generator to determine which mechanical factors induce an increase / decrease in emissions when the use of biodiesel as a fuel...|$|E

(Laminaceae), conhecida como alecrim, é uma planta nativa da região mediterrânea e atualmente é cultivada em várias partes do mundo, incluindo o Brasil. Esta planta é empregada na {{medicina}} popular para o tratamento de doenças inflamatórias como a asma brônquica. Além disso, estudos têm demonstrado que esta planta possui atividades antimicrobiana, antioxidante, anti-inflamatória, hipoglicemiante, hepatoprotetora, antiplaquetária, antinoceptiva e antiviral.

Neste protocolo experimental foram utilizados camundongos albinos Swiss. A pleurisia foi induzida segundo metodologia descrita por SALEH et al., 1996 e, foram avaliados os seguintes parâmetros inflamatórios no lavado da cavidade pleural: leucócitos, exsudação, atividades das enzimas mieloperoxidase (MPO) e adenosina-desaminase (ADA), e as concentrações <b>de</b> nitrito/nitrato (<b>NOx),</b> interleucina- 17 A (IL- 17 A) e interleucina- 10 (IL- 10), além do RNAm para IL- 17 A e IL- 10. Neste estudo, diferentes grupos de animais foram tratados com EBSO (10 - 100 mg/kg), HEX (10 - 50 mg/kg), EtOH (10 - 50 mg/kg), AcOEt (10 - 50 mg/kg), CAR (1 - 10 mg/kg) ou RA (2, 5 - 10 mg/kg) administrados (i. p.) 0, 5 h antes da carragenina (1 %) administrada por via intrapleural (i. pl.). Os parâmetros inflamatórios foram avaliados 4 h após. Para avaliar a exsudação, os animais foram tratados previamente com solução Azul de Evans (25 mg/kg, i. v.). Diferenças estatísticas entre os grupos foram determinadas pela análise dos testes de variância (ANOVA), e complementadas pelo teste Dunett e/ou teste t de Student. Valores de p Abstract : Introduction: Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Laminaceae), {{known as}} rosemary, {{is a native}} plant from Mediterranean region, which is currently cultivated {{in many parts of}} the world, including Brazil. This plant is widely used in folk medicine to treat inflammatory diseases, such as bronchial asthma. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that this plant has antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, hepatoprotective, antiplatelet, antinociceptive and antiviral activities. Objectives: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the crude extract oil free (EBSO), fractions and isolated compounds from R. officinalis L., administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) in the carrageenan-induced murine model of pleurisy. Methodology: The fresh R. officinalis L. aerial parts were underwent extraction through the steam technique to remove the essential oils and maceration with ethanol 96 %, to obtain the crude extract oil free (EBSO). This extract was partitioned with hexane, ethanol and ethyl acetate solutions to obtain the hexane (HEX), ethyl acetate (AcOEt) and ethanol (EtOH) fractions, both with essential oils free. The isolated compounds, carnosol (CAR) and rosmarinic acid (RA) were isolated from the AcOEt fraction and EBSO respectively. Analysis of capillary electrophoresis, physical characteristics, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H and 13 C NMR) were used to identify and elucidate the structure of the isolated compounds present in the R. officinalis L. Swiss mice were used throughout the experiments. Pleurisy was induced according to the methodology described by SALEH et al., 1996 and, the following inflammatory parameters were evaluated in the fluid leakage of the pleural cavity: leukocytes, exudation, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities, and the concentrations of nitrite/nitrate (NOx), interleukin- 17 A (IL- 17 A), and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), and mRNA for IL- 17 A and for IL- 10. In this study, different groups of animals were pretreated with EBSO (10 - 100 mg/kg), HEX (10 - 50 mg/kg), EtOH (10 - 50 mg/kg), AcOEt (10 - 50 mg/kg), CAR (1 - 10 mg/kg) or RA (2. 5 - 10 mg/kg) administered (i. p.) 0. 5 h before carrageenan (1 %) which was administered by intrapleural route (i. pl.). The inflammatory parameters were evaluated after 4 h. To evaluate the exudation, the animals were pretreated with Evans blue dye (25 mg/kg, i. v.). Statistical differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance test (ANOVA), and supplemented by test Dunett and/or Student's t test. p < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: EBSO (50 - 100 mg/kg), HEX (25 - 50 mg/kg), EtOH (50 mg/kg), AcOEt (25 - 50 mg/kg), CAR (2. 5 - 10 mg/kg) and RA (5 - 10 mg/kg) inhibited leukocytes, neutrophils, mononuclears and exudation (p < 0. 05). Also, EBSO (50 mg/kg), HEX (25 mg/kg), EtOH (50 mg/kg), AcOEt (25 mg/kg), CAR (2. 5 mg/kg) and RA (5 mg/kg) inhibited the MPO and ADA activities, concentrations of NOx, concentration/mRNA for IL- 17 A, and increased concentration/mRNA for IL-hj 10 (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The results demonstrated that the Rosmarinus officinalis L. has important anti-inflammatory activity mainly due to reduce the influx of leukocytes and exudation. This effect appears to be related to the reduction of release and/or production of pro-inflammatory mediators (NOx, IL 17 A) and increased release and/or production of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL- 10), including modulation of mRNA expression. Also, the carnosol and rosmarínic acid appear to be partly responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect presented by Rosmarinus officinalis L...|$|R
40|$|When {{rape oil}} is {{chemically}} extracted, rape seed meal, a solid residue remains. Currently, {{it is used}} as animal feed. Several plants {{for the production of}} rape methyl ester (RME, biodiesel) are in operation or under construction. Combustion properties have been studied for rape seed meal produced as a by product to rape-methyl esther (RME, biodiesel). Composition of the material has been measured, using proximate and ultimate analysis. The lower heating value was 18. 2 ± 0, 3 MJ/kg d. w. and the ash content was 7 - 8 percent d. w. The material is rich in nitrogen and sulphur. Concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg are high in the fuel. Rape seed meal was mixed with bark and pelletised. Bark pellets were also used as a reference fuel. Pellets with 10 and 30 percent rape seed meal were produced. Material with 80 percent rape seed meal and 20 percent planer shavings was also pelletised. Wood had to be added to provide enough friction in the pelletising process, with adapted equipment rape seed meal could probably be easily pelletised). The material was studied using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and compared with data from tests with wood powder. The pyrolysis of the rape seed meal has a characteristic temperature of 320 oC. Devolatilisation starts at 150 oC (at a lower temperature than for wood powder), and proceeds within a rather wide temperature range. The probable cause is the difference in organic content, in particular protein content. The result does not suggest that the material will be difficult to ignite. Experiments in a bench-scale fluidised bed (5 kW) showed that pellets containing only bark, and the mixture rape seed meal/wood had a bed agglomeration temperature well over the normal operational bed temperature. For the fuel mixtures rape seed meal and bark, the agglomeration temperature was slightly over the operational temperature. Particle emissions from fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion were, the latter simulated using a commercial pellet burner, were roughly doubled with fuels containing rape seed meal compared to bark. In the powder burner tests, particle emissions increased with a factor 17 with rape seed meal compared to wood powder. The emitted particles were mainly found in the fine (1 µm) and a fine mode fraction. The particles from grate combustion of bark contain mostly K, S, Na and Cl apart from oxygen and carbon. When rape seed meal is present, Cl and Na concentrations decrease considerably and the main contents of the particles are K and S (and O and C). The results from the X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD) analyses showed the presence of crystalline K 2 SO 4 och KCl. The fine particles (< 1 µm) from powder combustion contain mainly K, P and S. The only identified crystalline phase was K 2 SO 4, suggesting that most phosphorus was in the amorphous phase, i. d. most probably molten. The deposit formation on a cooled probe was studied during the fluidized bed and powder combustion experiments. The fine particles deposited during fluidised bed combustion contained K, Cl and S. When bark was combusted in the fluidised bed, the coarse fraction contained Ca and Si, when rape seed meal in different mixes was combusted this changed to P, K, Ca and Mg. The deposits formed during combustion of rape seed meal in the powder burner were mainly made up of phosphates (Ca-, Mg/K-, Ca/Mg-phosphates) and MgO. Sintered material (slag) from grate combustion of bark contained mainly Si, Ca, K and Al, probably as silicates. Adding rape seed meal tended to increase P, Ca and Mg while Si and Ca content tended to decrease. Through XRD a number o crystalline phases in the sintered material {{and the rest of the}} bottom ashes could be identified. NO emissions from the combustions tests increased two to four times with rape seed meal compared to typical wood fuels. For the fluidised bed test, SO 2 concentrations were rather high for the rape seed meal pellets (with 20 percent wood), still only about 20 percent of the sulphur in the fuel formed SO 2. For the grate combustion and powder burner combustion, 60 percent and 70 percent of the sulphur respectively formed SO 2. HCl emissions were low for all tests. The rather high emissions of NOx and SOx mean that the material should be used in large-scale facilities with external SOx and NOx cleaning. In smaller facilities, the material may be used in small amounts mixed with other fuels. The risk of slagging is not very high, and should not rule out grate combustion of pellets with rape seed meal mixed with other fuels. The risk of corrosion of superheater surfaces during combustion is probably low since the smaller-size particles formed at fluidised bed combustion and grate combustion contain K 2 SO 4. However, a large fraction of the particles formed in powder burner combustion probably contains low temperature melting K 2 PO 4, making the risk for deposit formation significant. Rape seed meal for powder burner applications should be used with care. The content of phosphorus in the material may be an advantage when mixes of rape seed meal and other fuels are considered. The high affinity between potassium and phosphorus means that more sulphur in the fuel will be available for sulphatising of any KC. (formed from combustion of many forest and agricultural fuels). Use of rape seed meal as a sulphur containing additive could thus be an option. For grate combustion and fluidised bed combustion, addition of rape seed meal may reduce the risk of slagging and bed agglomeration, respectively. Full scale tests in fluidised beds or grate combustors with problematic biofuels (containing Cl and K) would be useful to test whether ash-reduced operational problems could be reduced through the addition of rape seed meal. Effektiva värmevärdet hos rapsmjöl är 18, 2 +/- 0, 3 MJ/kg TS och askhalten varierar mellan 7 - 8 %. Bränslet har högt N- och S-innehåll, och bränslet är rikt på K, P, Ca och Mg. Partikelemissionerna från fluidbäddseldning och rosterförbränning med rapsmjölsblandningar var ungefär dubbelt så höga som från barkförbränning. Vid pulverförbränning av rapsmjöl ökade partikelemissionerna med en faktor 17 jämfört med träpulver. <b>De</b> höga <b>NOx</b> och SOx emissionerna från rapsmjölsförbränning innebär att materialet bör utnyttjas i storskaliga anläggningar med extern svavel. - eller NO-rening, eller i relativt låga inblandningsgrader i andra bränslen. Mindre anläggningar med enbart cyklonrening är olämpliga på grund av de höga stofthalterna. Rapsmjöl torde vara ett intressant sameldningsbränsle vid roster- och fluidbäddseldning med klor- och kaliumrika skogs- och åkerbränslen då rapsmjöl eventuellt skulle kunna användas som svaveladditiv för reduktion av klorinducerad korrosion på t ex överhettare. Slaggningstendensen torde minska vid inblandning av rapsmjöl i båda dessa bränslekategorier och bäddagglomereringstendensen torde minska vid inblandning av rapsmjöl i åkerbränslen.

Metodologia: As cascas secas da E. leiocarpa Engl. foram maceradas e extraídas com etanol para obter o EBH. A partir deste extrato, foram obtidas as frações n-hexano (Hex), acetato de etila (AcOEt), aquosa (Aq) e alcaloídica (Alc), sendo que esta última fração foi extraída com éter etílico originando duas subfrações: uma alcaloídica polar (AlcP) e outra apolar (AlcAp). O composto majoritário, o alcaloide indólico dihidrocorinanteol (DHC), foi isolado da subfração AlcAp.

Valores de P Abstract : Introduction: Esenbeckia genus (Rutaceae) includes approximately 30 species native from tropical regions such as Mexico and Brazil, {{mainly in the}} Brazilian states of Sao Paulo, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Goias and Mato Grosso do Sul. Studies using in vivo and in vitro models have demonstrated that plants of this genus have anti-inflammatory properties. Objectives: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of the crude hydroalcoholic extract (CHE), fractions and compounds isolated from Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl., administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) in the carrageenan-induced murine model of pleurisy. Methodology: The dried E. leiocarpa Engl. bark was macerated and extracted with ethanol to obtain the CHE. The n-hexane (Hex), ethyl acetate (AcOEt), aqueous (Aq) and alkaloids (Alk) fractions were obtained from CHE, and two alkaloid subfractions, polar (polar Alk) and nonpolar (nonpolar Alk) {{were obtained from the}} Alk fraction using an ethyl ether extraction. The major compound, the indole alkaloid dihydrocorinantheol (DHC) was isolated from nonpolar Alk subfraction. Analysis of capillary electrophoresis, physical characteristics, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H and 13 C NMR) and mass spectrometry were used to identify and elucidate the structure of the major compound present in the E. leiocarpa Engl. In another protocol, the isolated compound was subjected to chemical structural modifications by nucleophilic substitution reactions to develop the acetyl, p-methyl, benzoyl, p-methoxy and p-chloro analogs, which were used in a study of structure-activity relationships to evaluate the effect of these compounds upon leucocytes and exudation concentrations and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Swiss mice were used in the carrageenan-induced murine model of pleurisy and the following inflammatory parameters were evaluated the fluid of the pleural cavity: leukocytes, exudation, MPO and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities, and the concentrations of nitrite/nitrate (NOx), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 â) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-á). In this study, different groups of animals were pretreated with CHE (10 - 100 mg/kg), Hex (10 - 50 mg/kg), AcOEt (10 - 50 mg/kg), Aq (2 - 10 mg/kg), Alk (1 - 10 mg/kg), polar Alk (0. 5 - 5 mg/kg), nonpolar Alk (0. 1 - 2 mg/kg) or DHC (0. 1 - 0. 5 mg/kg) administered (i. p.) 0. 5 h before carrageenan (1 %) which was administered by intrapleural route (i. pl.). The inflammatory parameters were evaluated after 4 h. To evaluate the exudation, the animals were pretreated with Evans blue dye (25 mg/kg, i. v.). Statistical differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance test (ANOVA), Newman-Keuls and/or Student#s t test. P < 0. 05 was considered significant. Further, the toxicity study of CHE we performed by analyzing the survival curve. In this study, different groups of animals received different doses of EBH (250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, i. p.) and the number of deaths was observed daily for 10 days. Results: CHE (25 - 100 mg/kg), Hex (25 - 50 mg/kg), AcOEt (25 - 50 mg/kg), Aq (5 - 10 mg/kg), Alk (5 - 10 mg/kg), polar Alk (1 - 5 mg/kg), nonpolar Alk (0. 5 - 2 mg/kg) and DHC (0. 25 - 0. 5 mg/kg) inhibited leukocytes, neutrophils, mononuclears and exudation (P < 0. 05). Also, CHE (25 mg/kg), Hex (50 mg/kg), AcOEt (50 mg/kg), Aq (5 or 10 mg/kg), Alc (10 mg/kg), polar Alk (1 or 2 mg/kg), nonpolar Alk (0. 5 mg/kg) and DHC (0. 25 mg/kg) inhibited the MPO and ADA activities, and the concentrations of NOx, IL- 1 â and TNF-á (P < 0. 05). In relation to toxicity, it was observed that the dose of 250 mg/kg of CHE was safe because its administration resulted in 100 % survival of the animals after 10 days, whereas at the doses of 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg all animals died in the first day of observation. Furthermore, the DHC alkaloid showed better anti-inflammatory effect than its analogs: acetyl, p-methyl, benzoyl, p-methoxy and p-chloro, because only the DHC inhibits both studied inflammatory parameters: leukocytes and exudation concentrations (P < 0. 01). Further, the DHC analogs inhibited MPO activity (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: The results showed that: 1) E. leiocarpa Engl. has important anti-inflammatory activity; 2) this effect occurs mainly in relation to inhibition of leukocyte migration and exudation concentrations; 3) the Inhibition of these inflammatory parameters is also related to NOx, IL- 1 â and TNF-á inhibition; 4) the inhibition of MPO and ADA activities are associated with decrease of activated leukocytes; 5) the doses used in the experiments of this study appear to be safe; 6) DHC was more effective than its analogs in this model of inflammation, and the physicochemical modifications in the DHC after insertion of the acetyl, p-methylbenzoyl, benzoyl, p-methoxybenzoyl and p-chlorobenzoyl substituents radicals on the hydroxyl group at carbon 17 determine the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory action...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the characterization of several biomass materials under thermal conversion conditions using small [...] scale equipment. The fuels are tested under the conditions of slow and fast heating rate pyrolysis and combustion, with the main goal of investigating the chemistry of fuel [...] bound nitrogen. New energy policies put forward in almost {{every country in the}} world, and especially in the European Union, are strongly promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Decreasing the use of imported fossil fuels in favour of locally available renewables is the answer to many energy [...] related problems of the 21 st century: global warming, security of supply and high energy prices among some. Among renewable sources, biomass materials hold a special position because they can, in the short term, substitute or integrate fossil fuels in all of their applications applying comparatively few changes to the existing equipment. Biomass wastes, from agriculture or other processes, are convenient in more respects since their use would not only substitute fossil fuels but it would also valorize waste streams. These materials, however, present several issues that are highly delaying their deployment on a large scale. Three of the most important problems are dealt with in this thesis: the heterogeneous nature of the materials, high amount of ash forming matter containing troublesome compounds such as K, Cl and P, and finally, high content of nitrogen. First of all, many biomass residues contain a higher amount of nitrogen compared with woody biomass or even coal. This high content of fuel [...] N could directly translate into high NOx emissions in combustion conditions or into a high content of nitrogen containing gases such as NH 3 and HCN in the syngas from gasification. Primary measures, such as air staging, can be applied directly in the reactor in order to promote the reduction of NOx and NOx [...] precursors to molecular nitrogen. However, in order to apply such measures and optimize the syngas composition or minimize emissions without relying on expensive catalysts, a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of fuel [...] N conversion is required. This thesis has as its main purpose to study the release of volatile nitrogen compounds under pyrolysis conditions and the analysis of the emissions of NO under combustion conditions from high [...] N fuels. Secondly, as explained in the first two chapters of this dissertation, the definition of biomass is very broad and it includes materials with extremely different composition and characteristics. Additionally, the interest in exploiting some of these materials, such as manures, for energy conversion has never been high enough to trigger substantial research. As a consequence, fundamental data such as reactivity and products distribution are almost completely lacking for many biowastes. One of the purposes of this thesis is, therefore, to gather extensive fundamental data for potential fuels, which have not yet fully characterized. Finally, some elements such as K, Cl, P and S, contained in biomass materials, are known to cause several problems during boiler operation. At high temperatures alkali silicates with melting temperatures lower than the operating one are formed; these partly molten particles can then create issues like slagging, fouling, loss of fluidization and, when Cl is present, corrosion of the boiler surfaces. Together with specific research on boiler materials and optimization of operating conditions, possible pre [...] treatments used to remove these compounds from the fuel before entering the reactor could greatly enhance the overall process. In this thesis, the effects of a water [...] leaching pre [...] treatment on the fuels' reactivity and product yields during pyrolysis are explored. After a general introduction, Chapter 2 has the purpose of providing the reader with an overview of definitions and concepts that are used {{in the rest of the}} dissertation. The main components of biomass are listed as well as their behavior under thermal conversion conditions. A special focus is given to nitrogen structures, such as proteins and heterocyclic compounds, and the mechanisms of their decomposition under pyrolysis conditions as reported in available literature studies. Finally, an overview of NOx formation mechanisms is given. The materials studied in this work and the setups used are introduced in Chapter 3. The materials are divided into two main categories: agricultural residues, including wheat straw, olive residues and peach stones, and biomass waste streams, including dry distiller's grains, palm kernel cake and chicken manure. All these materials have a high nitrogen content and are not yet fully exploited because of the issues mentioned above. Several different small [...] scale setups have been used in this work depending on the conditions that needed to be study. Chapter 4, then, presents the results of measurements performed on agricultural residues under slow pyrolysis conditions. The measurements were carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) connected with a Fourier Transform InfraRed spectrometer (FTIR). All the fuels presented peaks of reactivity at approximately 330 - 360 °C associated with the decomposition of cellulose. A shoulder was also found at lower temperatures, approximately 290 - 310 °C, and was associated with the pyrolysis of hemicellulose. The main volatile species released resulted to be CO 2 for all the fuels followed by CO and methane. No nitrogen compounds were detected because of too little concentrations in the pyrolysis gases which could not be accurately detected by the FTIR. The kinetic parameters for the pyrolysis reactions were found using a Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM). This analysis revealed a common reaction path for the main structures (cellulose and hemicellulose) among the various fuels. The water [...] leaching pre [...] treatment seemed very effective in removing the troublesome inorganic elements from these fuels. The removed elements, furthermore, had a catalytic effect on the pyrolysis of the fuels; once removed, the samples reacted at higher temperatures and with less reaction paths. Only the peach stones sample, which already had a very low ash content, did not seem to be affected by the treatment. Chapter 5 reports the results of a similar analysis to the previous one, that was performed on different biomass residues: dry distiller's grains with solubles (DDGS) and chicken manure. Also these fuels were found to react with two main peaks at about 280 °C and 330 °C. Accordingly, also the kinetic parameters resulted very similar to the ones of the agricultural residues, clearly indicating a similar decomposition path for common structures. For DDGS and chicken manure, an additional component was found to react at approximately 400 - 430 °C and it was assigned to proteinic structures decomposing. The main volatile nitrogen compounds were found to be NH 3 and HCN for DDGS with traces of HNCO. The manure released more of its fuel [...] bound nitrogen in volatile form and the main compound was found to be HNCO, followed by HCN and ammonia. The water leaching pre [...] treatment, similarly to what was found for the peach stones sample, did not seem to affect substantially the reactivity of the fuels nor their ash composition. The share of fuel [...] N released as light volatiles, however, increased for the washed fuels. Building up on the results of the previous two chapters, Chapter 6 describes the results of fast pyrolysis measurements of DDGS and palm kernel cake. These tests were carried out on a heated foil reactor integrated with an FTIR using much higher heating rates, closer to industrial applications. A numerical model of the reactor has been developed in order to have a better insight into the temperature and velocity profiles in the reactor chamber. The simulations, in combination with non [...] contact temperature measurements, have indicated a significant difference between the expected foil temperature and the actual one. This has been corrected in the experimental campaign, granting a more precise knowledge of the actual conditions. The fast pyrolysis measurements have shown an increased weight loss compared to slow heating rates. CO 2 resulted to be still the main light volatile at temperatures below 900 °C while CO became more relevant at high temperatures due to tar cracking in the hot area around the foil. Compared to low heating rates measurements of the DDGS sample, HCN was the main volatile nitrogen compound while the yield of NH 3 was much lower. The palm kernel cake sample only released detectable yields of HCN, nor ammonia nor HNCO were found. Even at high temperatures, approximately 10 % of the initial N was retained in the char of DDGS. The water leaching pre [...] treatment again did not affect the weight loss behaviour neither the main gaseous product distribution but the yields of light volatile nitrogen compounds increased for the washed samples. After the pyrolysis behaviour of different nitrogen compounds has been analyzed, Chapter 7 presents the results of measurements under combustion conditions for several biomass residues. It is shown that the devolatilization profiles for carbon to CO + CO 2 and fuel [...] N to NO are very similar among very different fuels, implying that a common approach could be taken for their modeling and it could very well be acceptable as a first approximation. Moreover, the conversion of fuel [...] N to NO appeared to follow a decaying trend where the fuels with lower initial N content presented a higher conversion than fuels with higher nitrogen content. Fuels with high nitrogen content, in fact, are likely to release a larger amount of it in volatile form with a consequent larger amount of NHi radicals available for thermal <b>De</b> [...] <b>NOx</b> reactions. Finally, the release of carbon as CO 2 and nitrogen as NO during devolatilization was found to be proportional for temperatures around 800 °C while at 1000 °C almost all of the NO was released during devolatilization. Finally, in Chapter 8 the main conclusions of the work described in thesis are drawn and recommendations for future research are expressed.

40|$|Since a few decades, {{the balance}} of the {{nitrogen}} (N) cycle has been deeply disturbed by human activies. The global impact of these activities on the N cycle can be described as a doubling of the transfer from the vast and unreactive atmospheric pool to biologically available forms (N fixation). The main sources responsible for the increase of reactive N emissions are the use of artificial fertilisers (NH 3) as well as the combustion processes (NOx). Reactive N is then transformed, transported by both the atmosphere and the hydrosphere and, finally, deposited on both the terrestrial and the aquatic ecosystems with potentially strong impacts. Amongst the terrestrial ecosystems, the temperate forests are particularly sensitive to reactive N increases for various reasons: they are located near to strongly anthropised areas and are thus subjected to strong depositions; they are naturally N-limited and their biochemical cycle can indeed be strongly influenced by additional N, which leads to eutrophication and potential impacts such as soil acidification, nitrate leaching and losses of biodiversity within microorganisms, plants and fauna communities. Previous studies carried out in temperate forest ecosystems have shown that the soil, namely the soil organic matter, acts as a main deposited N sink for the ecosystem. However, biogeochemical reactions responsible for N retention in the soil are still not fully understood. Moreover, the majority of the concerned studies were conducted in acidic or hydromorphous soils and very little is known today about the fate of N deposition under other soil physico-chemical conditions. Consequently, the present research aims at filling some of the gaps described above and deals with two main topics concerning the retention of atmospherically deposited N in soils that are (1) the characterisation of the retention of atmospherically deposited N in the soil, in terms of both duration and quantity, more specifically, in a well drained calcareous soil and (2) the mechanisms and processes responsible for such a retention. From a practical point of view, the retention of N deposition in the soil was characterised by means of a 15 N field labelling experiment simulating N atmospheric deposition and conducted at the Grandvillard research site, in the riparian zone of La Sarine River (Swiss Prealps). The stand is a beech forest mixed with planted spruces. The soil consists of a well drained calcareous fluvisol with a fast organic matter turnover. We tracked the N tracers (15 NH 4 + or 15 NO 3 -, corresponding to the main forms of deposition) from short-term (hours, days or weeks) to longer-term intervals (one year), by measuring the partitioning of 15 N into different biochemical soil fractions (extractable N, microbial N, roots N and N immobilised in soil). Aiming at studying the mechanisms and processes responsible for N retention, we performed two laboratory experiments. The first one was an acid hydrolysis, {{in order to determine the}} proportion of N deposition retained in the hydrolysable fraction (i. e. the more labile N forms, including the most bioavailable ones) as well as in the non-hydrolysable fraction covering the more recalcitrant N compounds. Within the framework of this experiment, we compared the results obtained in Grandvillard and in an aditional constrasting site (Alptal). The second experiment was a short-term (one hour to one week) laboratory incubation of sterilised and not sterilised soils, which purpose was to highlight the relative importance of biotic and abiotic processes in N immobilisation. Soils were labelled with either 15 NH 4 + or 15 NO 3 - and subjected to 15 N CPMAS NMR spectroscopy analysis, which is a powerful technique to identify the N organic molecules in soils. Within the framework of the field labelling experiment, more than half of the tracers (either 15 NO 3 - or 15 NH 4 +) was recovered in the soil between one hour and one year after labelling. Therefore, the general assumption that non-fertilised temperate forest soils are the main sink for deposited N can be confirmed. Since previous studies showing the importance of the soil for the retention of deposited N were all conducted on either acidic or hydromorphous soils, our results allow us to extend the validity of their general conclusions to a wider range of unfertilised temperate forest soils. We further showed that the main forms of N deposition (i. e. NO 3 -and NH 4 +) were retained in the soil within the same range of magnitude, in spite of their different biochemical pathways. N retention occurred mainly in the soil organic layers and, consequently, our results confirme the importance of the organic fraction in the deposited N retention. Since deposited N was retained in the soil in the very short term, we confirmed the presence of very fast processes and demonstrated that the very short term dynamics determined the fate of deposited N in the longer term: the main processes were i) a loss of deposited N as extractable through lixiviation (and lateral fluxes) and ii) a retention as N immobilised in soil. Furthermore, we demonstrated that N immobilisation brought deposited N both into the hydrolysable and into the recalcitrant fractions of soil N within short-time range (i. e. one week). We also demonstrated that the hydrolysability (hydrolysable N/ total N) was constant over the year. Within the framework of the laboratory incubation of soils subjected to the 15 N CPMAS NMR spectroscopy analysis, we showed that all NMR spectra were dominated by a single signal corresponding to the amide-peptide structure, whatever the soil layer concerned (organic or organo-mineral), the form added (NO 3 - or NH 4 +) and whether the soil was sterilised or not. Such dominance of proteinaceous compounds was in agreement with the results obtained in humic substances and in various soils all over the world. Further to the extractable 15 N dynamics during the incubation, we proposed that biotic processes were dominant in the short-term N immobilisation. However, an abiotic fixation of less importance was not excluded for 15 NO 3 -. Considering our results, we propose two mechanisms responsible for the retention of deposited N in soil in the long term. The first mechanism is a rapid and stable immobilisation in the recalcitrant pool of soil organic matter. Our results showed that biotic and abiotic processes could be involved: the afore-mentioned process of abiotic nitrate fixation could lead to the N immobilisation in heterocycles whereas N incorporated in amides and then stabilised in soil organic matter seemed to be the major pathway. The second mechanism of retention we are proposing is the biological recycling within the soil or the soil-plant system: on a short scale, microbial recycling seemed to be very rapid because deposited N was mainly present under a biosynthesised form (amides), in spite of the low amounts of tracer found in the microbes. Within the soil profile, roots recycling was probably efficient: fine roots, which are often the major contributors of soil organic matter were an important sink for N deposition all over the year. The combination of various scales and techniques allowed the connection between the dynamics of N retention in soil organic layers observed and the mechanisms responsible for it (i. e. rapid immobilisation in a recalcitrant pool and biological recycling through micro-organisms and plants). The results of this multi-scale approach suggest further developments and impacts for the modelling of the long-term fate of deposited N. Depuis de nombreuses décennies, l'équilibre du cycle de l'azote (N) a été fortement perturbé par les activités anthropiques, dont l'impact se traduit par un doublement des transferts chimiques de l'azote atmosphérique non réactif en formes assimilables par les organismes vivants (processus connu sous le terme de fixation de l'azote). L'augmentation des émissions d'azote sous forme réactive est principalement due à l'utilisation de fertilisants synthétiques (NH 3) ainsi qu'à la combustion <b>de</b> carburants fossiles (<b>NOx).</b> L'azote émis est transformé, puis transporté par l'atmosphère et l'hydrosphère pour se déposer dans les écosystèmes aquatiques et terrestres. Cette augmentation des dépôts atmosphériques azotés a une incidence importante sur les forêts tempérées, qui sont généralement très exposées car elles sont souvent proches des sources azotées d'origine anthropique. De plus, l'azote, en conditions naturelles, est un facteur limitant pour la productivité de ces forêts. Un apport additionnel de celui-ci peut se traduire par un dérèglement de leur cycle biogéochimique conduisant à l'eutrophisation et à d'autres impacts: acidification du sol, lixiviation de nitrate et diminution de la biodiversité au sein des communautés végétales, animales et de microorganismes, notamment. Lors d'études précédentes dans les écosystèmes forestiers tempérés, il a été démontré que le sol, en particulier sa fraction organique, agit comme un puits majeur face à ces dépôts. Les réactions biogéochimiques à l'origine de la rétention de ces dépôts ne sont pas encore totalement connues et la plupart des recherches menées sur des sols acides ou à caractère hydromorphe ne fournissent que peu d'informations sur leur devenir dans des sols soumis à d'autres conditions physico-chimiques. Notre étude a pour objectif de combler ces lacunes et traite deux points essentiels: (1) la caractérisation quantitative et temporelle de la rétention de ces dépôts dans le sol qui se focalise sur les sols carbonatés et bien drainés; (2) l'étude des mécanismes et processus à l'origine de cette rétention. Dans la pratique, une étude sur la rétention des dépôts atmosphériques azotés a été effectuée grâce à un marquage avec l'isotope 15 N. Une expérience, réalisée in situ et simulant ces dépositions, a été menée à Grandvillard, site alluvial d'importance nationale au bord de la Sarine (Préalpes suisses)|$|R
