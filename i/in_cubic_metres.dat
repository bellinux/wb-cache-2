25|$|In {{the rest}} of the world, natural gas is sold in {{gigajoule}} retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) are traded in metric tons or MMBTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed <b>in</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres,</b> and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes (1,000kg). The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized transport ships, as the gas is liquified at cryogenic temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{features}} of the British metrication programme as announced in 1966 was a voluntary adoption of the metric programme with the costs being absorbed where they fell. As a result, the costs and savings of metrication in the United Kingdom have not been comprehensively determined and studies have {{tended to focus on}} specific programmes. The impact of a voluntary programme meant that industry was free to take the most cost-efficient approach, which in many cases has meant installing equipment calibrated in metric units as part of an ongoing maintenance cycle rather than as part of a specific metrication programme. Such an approach was taken by the gas industry where all newly installed meters record usage <b>in</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres,</b> but many older installations will measure in cubic feet.|$|E
40|$|The {{quantity}} of fungal spores collected in routine aerobiological monitoring of atmosphere in Tartu 1989 – 1994 was studied {{with respect to}} two aspects: daily mean concentration (measured {{as the number of}} spores <b>in</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> of air <b>in</b> 24 hours), and spore totals of a period (measured as the number of spores <b>in</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> of air <b>in</b> a period). The aerobiological calendar method was used to indicate seasonal character of the {{quantity of}} spores. During the 6 -year period the main spore season occurred from March to November, the total annual amount of fungal spores exceeded  1 × 106  spores <b>in</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> per year.

50|$|The {{energy content}} <b>in</b> one <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> is {{normally}} higher than <b>in</b> one <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> wood logs, but can vary greatly depending on moisture.

The energy content, then, is approximately 3.5-4.5kWh/kg (~150-250 kg/cubic metre).|$|R
