Esprits built before 1993 used many British Leyland parts and those built in the mid- to late-1980s incorporated more Toyota parts while those built after 1993 had many GM (Vauxhall, Opel) parts. Door handles from the Morris Marina/Austin Allegro were used until the S4 model in 1994 when GM Calibra door handles were used. Early cars used a Momo steering wheel, while later ones had the same wheel as the Pontiac Trans Am. Headlight lift motors came from the Pontiac Fiero. The aerial mount and whip on the S4 and V8 was the same as the GM Calibra and Tigra. The side mirrors were from the Citroën CX. Non-SE fog lamps from about 1989 were GM Astra MK1. The <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> came from the Ford Fiesta Mk2. The alternator on the V8 models was a standard GM unit also found in the V6 Opel Omega B and the earlier Lotus Carlton/Omega, which also provided interior plastic fittings such as door handles and steering column covering. The clutch master and slave cylinders on 1998 and newer models were Girling parts shared with the series 2A Land Rover. The S1 and S2 shared some front suspension components with the Opel Ascona. The GT3's Brembo front brake pads were the same as on a Fiat Coupé Turbo or a Peugeot 406 3.0 V6. The SE's fuel pump was from the Renault Fuego.|$|E

5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. <b>Fan</b> <b>motors</b> are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/ ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − In {{order to}} provide a low cost system of thermal comfort, a common model of home fan, 40 cm {{diameter}} size, had its manual four-button control system replaced by an automatic speed control. The new control system has a temperature sensor feeding a microcontroller that, by using an optic coupling, DIAC or TRIAC-based circuit, varies the RMS value of the <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> input voltage and its speed, according to the room temperature. Over {{a wide range of}} velocity, the fan net power and the <b>motor</b> <b>fan</b> input power were measured working under both control system. The temperature of the motor stator and the voltage waveforms were observed too. Measured values analysis showed that the TRIAC-based control system makes the <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> work at a very low power factor and efficiency values. The worst case is at low velocity range where the higher <b>fan</b> <b>motor</b> stator temperatures were registered. The poor power factor and efficiency and the harmonics signals inserted in the motor input voltage wave by the TRIAC commutation procedure are correlated...|$|R
40|$|Chillers {{consume more}} than 40 {{of the total}} energy used in the {{commercial}} and industrial buildings for space conditioning. In this paper, energy consumption by chillers and chilled water pumps, condenser pumps and <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> has been estimated using data collected by a walkthrough energy audit for the 16 faculties of the University of Malaya. It {{has been estimated that}} chillers and motors and pumps used in chillers consume 10, 737 MWh (i. e. 51 of total energy consumption) of electric energy for different percentage of loadings. As chillers are major energy users, variable speed drives are applied in chillers to reduce their energy consumption. It has been estimated that about 8368 MWh annual energy can be saved by using efficient chillers at different loadings. It has also been found that about 23, 532 MWh annual energy can be saved for chilled water supply pumps, condenser pumps and cooling tower <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> by matching required speeds using variable speed drives for 60 of speed reduction. About 1, 274, 692 kg of CO 2 emission could be avoided for using energy efficient chillers at 50 load. It has been also found that about 2, 426, 769 kg CO 2 emission can be reduced by using variable speed drives for 60 speed reductions. Payback periods found to be only few months for using variable speed drives in chilled water pumps, condensers and <b>fan</b> <b>motors...</b>|$|E
40|$|Evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> used in {{commercial}} refrigeration applications are fractional horsepower in size, {{are responsible for}} moving air across the evaporator coil, and typically run at one speed. Historically, shaded-pole motors {{have been the most}} commonly used evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> {{in commercial}} refrigeration equipment and beverage vending machines. These motors, a type of single-phase AC induction motor, are the simplest and least expensive type of fractional-horsepower motor. They are also the least efficient, with the common 9 â€“ 12 W sizes exhibiting an efficiency of approximately 20 %. Electronically commutated (EC) motors, also known as brushless DC motors, became widely commercialized in the late 1980 s, and their use in commercial refrigeration applications has increased within the last 10 to 15 years because of economic incentives and regulatory requirements. Another motor type, the permanent split capacitor (PSC) motor, offers a mid-point between shaded-pole and EC motor price and efficiency levels. Typically for commercial refrigeration evaporator fan motor applications, EC motors are 66 % efficient and PSC motors are usually about 29 % efficient. Â A new motor technology, a type of permanent magnet synchronous AC motor that can directly use grid-supplied AC current without the need to rectify to DC, has recently been commercialized. This new motor has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption of evaporator fans in commercial refrigeration equipment. Previously, synchronous motors have been prohibitively expensive for evaporator fan applications because of the high cost of the electronic control circuit that is required to bring the synchronous motor up to synchronous speed. However, this new motor technology makes use of a novel patent-pending controller that is simpler and lower in cost than previous synchronous motor controllers or EC motor controllers, making the new motor a cost-effective alternative in the commercial refrigeration market. Â In this paper, the results of field demonstrations, consisting of side-by-side measurements of the power consumption of the new motor technology versus shaded-pole, PSC, or EC evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> in identical refrigerated display cases, are presented. Measured quantities include fan motor power, current, and power factor, as well as display case discharge and return air temperatures and ambient store temperature. Currently, field demonstrations are being conducted at six supermarkets and commissaries located in Kansas City, MO, San Antonio, TX and San Diego, CA, with the duration of these tests ranging from approximately one month to over six months. Initial results from the field demonstrations indicate that the new synchronous AC motor technology is approximately 20 to 30 % more energy efficient than existing EC motors and nearly 80 % more energy efficient than shaded-pole motors. In addition, the new motor exhibits a power factor of approximately 0. 86, which is on average 40 % greater than that of existing evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors.</b> Analyses indicate that retrofitting the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors</b> with the new motors would produce a 68 % evaporator fan site energy savings, or 4. 9 Ã— 109 Â kWh/year for the installed base of commercial refrigeration evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>motors.</b> This would result in an annual cost savings of $ 516 million and reduce the annual CO 2 equivalent emissions by 8. 1 Ã— 109 Â lb...|$|E
