5|$|The {{original}} scientific bureau, {{or think}} tank, of the Centre Democrats was the Stichting Wetenschappelijke Onderbouwing Centrumdemocratische Ideologie (Foundation for the Scientific Elaboration of the Centre Democratic Ideology, SWOCI). In 1992 its name {{was changed to}} the Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> Stichting (Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> Foundation), after Janmaat's favorite political philosopher.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Leibniz, Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> and René Descartes {{explored}} {{the possibility that}} all rational thought could be made as systematic as algebra or geometry.|$|E
5|$|When Stewie imagines how {{a holiday}} in Hawaii {{would be with}} Rupert, he {{references}} the classic Calvin and <b>Hobbes</b> series.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Philip Sydney, Thomas Kyd, John Donne, and Ben Jonson {{are other}} {{established}} {{authors of the}} Elizabethan age. Francis Bacon and Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> wrote on empiricism and materialism, including scientific method and social contract. Filmer wrote on the Divine Right of Kings. Marvell was the best-known poet of the Commonwealth, while John Milton authored Paradise Lost during the Restoration.|$|E
5|$|Oxford's {{philosophical}} tradition {{started in}} the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste and William of Ockham, commonly known for Occam's razor, among those teaching at the university. Thomas <b>Hobbes,</b> Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter's main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the conatus, as used in Baruch Spinoza's psychology, is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates {{principles}} that the Stoics, Cicero, Laertius, and especially <b>Hobbes</b> and Descartes developed. One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the conatus ad motum, (conatus to motion), is not mental, but material.|$|E
5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and <b>Hobbes)</b> are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, <b>Hobbes,</b> and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E
5|$|In other media, the {{television}} series Sledge Hammer! (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with {{such topics as}} capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. Sesame Street (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; the sketches refer {{to some of the}} typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as Garfield's Babes and Bullets (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of Calvin and <b>Hobbes</b> have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.|$|E
5|$|St James' {{suffered}} from a major scandal in the late 1820s ("a period of personal quarrels and violent newspaper controversies") when Commissioner Bigge's secretary and brother-in-law, Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> Scott, who had been made Archdeacon of New South Wales in 1825, came into conflict with a parishioner, Edward Smith Hall. Archdeacon Scott ordered that Hall should vacate the pew he rented at St James' {{for himself and his}} six daughters. As Hall continued to occupy the pew, constables attended Sunday services to prevent his occupation of the pew by boarding it up and making it secure with iron bands. Hall, critical of both the archdeacon and Governor Ralph Darling, was also a partner with Arthur Hill in the ownership of newspaper The Monitor. He published an attack on the archdeacon, for which he was sued for libel. The courts fined him only £1 and placed him on a bond. Hall appealed to Reginald Heber, Bishop of Calcutta (who was the relevant ecclesiastical authority at the time) and to the law where he was awarded £25 damages. The archdeacon, who was extremely unpopular, returned to London in 1828.|$|E
25|$|The famous {{frontispiece}} for Leviathan by Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> (1651) {{was created}} with input from <b>Hobbes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before {{discussing}} Petty's economic theories, it {{is important}} to point out two crucial influences in his life. The first is Thomas <b>Hobbes,</b> for whom Petty acted as personal secretary. According to <b>Hobbes,</b> theory should set out the rational requirements for 'civil peace and material plenty'. As <b>Hobbes</b> had centred on peace, Petty chose prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Leviathan and the Air-Pump: <b>Hobbes,</b> Boyle, and the Experimental Life (published 1985) {{is a book}} by Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer. It {{examines}} the debate between Robert Boyle and Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> over Boyle's air-pump experiments in the 1660s. In 2005, Shapin and Schaffer were awarded the Erasmus Prize for this work.|$|E
25|$|The More, Hertfordshire, Wardrobe in {{the charge}} of Richard <b>Hobbes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The last {{strip of}} Calvin and <b>Hobbes</b> was {{published}} on December 31, 1995.|$|E
25|$|He edited Reason of State, Propaganda, and the Thirty Years' War: An Unknown Translation by Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> (Clarendon Press, 2007), and The Correspondence of Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> (1994) and Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan (3 volumes, Oxford University Press, 2012), {{for which}} he was awarded a British Academy Medal. He has also contributed over 40 journal {{articles}} or chapters in books since 2002.|$|E
25|$|Calvin and <b>Hobbes</b> {{character}} Calvin {{was in the}} Cub Scouts in some of {{the early}} strips.|$|E
25|$|A Calvin and <b>Hobbes</b> {{strip in}} which Calvin reenacts the painting, first {{published}} Nov. 3, 1993.|$|E
25|$|The Vulgate {{continued}} {{to be regarded as}} the standard scholarly Bible throughout most of the 17th Century. Walton's London Polyglot of 1657 disregards the English Language entirely. Walton's reference text throughout is the Vulgate. The Vulgate Latin is also found as the standard text of scripture in Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> Leviathan of 1651, indeed <b>Hobbes</b> gives Vulgate chapter and verse numbers (e.g., Job 41:24, not Job 41:33) for his head text.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 the {{documentary}} Dear Mr. Watterson, exploring the cultural impact of Calvin and <b>Hobbes,</b> was released.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, the English {{political}} philosopher Thomas <b>Hobbes,</b> whose Leviathan advocated absolute monarchy, admired Thucydides and in 1628 {{was the first}} to translate his writings into English directly from Greek. Thucydides, <b>Hobbes</b> and Machiavelli are together considered the founding fathers of political realism, according to which, state policy must primarily or solely focus on the need to maintain military and economic power rather than on ideals or ethics.|$|E
25|$|Frank Horstmann, in Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> in der Luftpumpe, {{has criticized}} Shapin and Schaffer's {{use of the}} {{historical}} evidence. He argues that Shapin and Schaffer {{have a lot of}} important facts wrong. Before May 1648, for example, <b>Hobbes</b> preferred vacuist interpretations of experimental pneumatics and strictly rejected plenist interpretations as not imaginable; but Shapin and Schaffer turn the vacuist into a plenist by ignoring all the vacuist interpretations and by producing a very faulty translation as a putative proof for a plenist interpretation. Horstmann argues that there are many similar errors and wrong quotations in Leviathan and the Air-Pump and suggests that the chapters dealing with <b>Hobbes</b> are constructed on heavy and sometimes systematic misrepresentations of the historical record.|$|E
25|$|There are 631 {{students}} (397 undergraduates, 198 postgraduates, 36 visiting students). Some famous alumni include William Tyndale, John Donne, Thomas <b>Hobbes,</b> Jonathan Swift and Evelyn Waugh.|$|E
25|$|Lawson and Wooliscroft (2004) {{drew the}} link between human nature and the {{marketing}} concept, not explicitly biology, where they considered the contrasting views of <b>Hobbes</b> and Rousseau on mankind. <b>Hobbes</b> believed man had a self-serving nature whereas Rousseau was more forgiving towards the nature of man, suggesting them to be noble and dignified. <b>Hobbes</b> saw {{the need for a}} governing intermediary to control this selfish nature which provided a basis for the exchange theory, and also links to Mcgregor’s Theory of X and Y, relevant to management literature. He also considered cooperation and competition, relevant to game theory as an explanation of man’s motives and can be used for understanding the exercising of power in marketing channels. Pinker outlines why the nature debate has been suppressed by the nurture debate in his book The Blank Slate.|$|E
25|$|Swift's {{explanation}} {{for the title of}} the book is that the Ship of State was threatened by a whale (specifically, the Leviathan of Thomas <b>Hobbes)</b> and the new political societies (the Rota Club is mentioned). His book is intended to be a tub that the sailors of state (the nobles and ministers) might toss over the side to divert the attention of the beast (those who questioned the government and its right to rule). <b>Hobbes</b> was highly controversial in the Restoration, but Swift's invocation of <b>Hobbes</b> might well be ironic. The narrative of the brothers is a faulty allegory, and Swift's narrator is either a madman or a fool. The book is not one that could occupy the Leviathan, or preserve the Ship of State, so Swift may be intensifying the dangers of Hobbes's critique rather than allaying them to provoke a more rational response.|$|E
25|$|The first work Huygens put {{in print}} was Theoremata de quadratura (1651) {{in the field}} of quadrature. It {{included}} material discussed with Mersenne some years before, such as the fallacious nature of the squaring of the circle by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent. His preferred methods were those of Archimedes and Fermat. Quadrature was a live issue in the 1650s, and through Mylon, Huygens intervened in the discussion of the mathematics of Thomas <b>Hobbes.</b> Persisting in trying to explain the errors <b>Hobbes</b> had fallen into, he made an international reputation.|$|E
25|$|In Roberto Bolaño's novel 2666, the {{philosophy}} professor Oscar Amalfitano begins his three-columned list of philosophers with Pico della Mirandola. Adjacent to Mirandola, Amalfitano writes <b>Hobbes,</b> while beneath him he writes Husserl (p.207, 2008).|$|E
25|$|The Muqaddimah {{deals with}} various {{questions}} of political theory. In some ways, his political theories show {{the influence of}} Aristotle, while in other ways they anticipate the works of Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas <b>Hobbes.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to <b>Hobbes,</b> {{there are}} {{nineteen}} Laws. The first two are expounded in chapter XIV of Leviathan ("of {{the first and}} second natural laws; and of contracts"); the others in chapter XV ("of other laws of nature").|$|E
25|$|The {{work also}} rebuts {{theories}} posited by Robert Filmer and Thomas <b>Hobbes.</b> Specifically, Milton {{took issue with}} the notions that a separation of powers leads to anarchy and that the king's power was naturally absolute.|$|E
25|$|Classical liberals {{agreed with}} Thomas <b>Hobbes</b> that {{government}} {{had been created}} by individuals {{to protect themselves from}} each other and that the purpose of government should be to minimize conflict between individuals that would otherwise arise in a state of nature.|$|E
25|$|He claimed this {{doctrine}} was not original to him. Previously, {{it appeared in}} the writings of Plato, Seneca, <b>Hobbes,</b> Pufendorf, and Anselm Feuerbach. Schopenhauer declared that their teaching was corrupted by subsequent errors and therefore was in need of clarification.|$|E
25|$|In the October 11 and 12, 1989, Calvin and <b>Hobbes</b> comic strips, Calvin has a dream where Stupendous Man {{takes the}} lens from the Palomar Observatory {{telescope}} (though really the telescope has {{a mirror and}} not a lens) and uses it to destroy his school.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the end of Calvin and <b>Hobbes,</b> many attempts were made to locate Watterson in his hometown of Chagrin Falls. Both The Plain Dealer and the Cleveland Scene sent reporters in 1998 and 2003, respectively, but were unable to locate him.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of Cumberland is expounded in De legibus naturae. Its main design is {{to combat the}} principles which <b>Hobbes</b> had promulgated as to the constitution of man, the nature of morality, and the origin of society, and to prove that self-advantage is not the chief end of man, that force is not the source of personal obligation to moral conduct nor the foundation of social rights, and {{that the state of}} nature is not a state of war. The views of <b>Hobbes</b> seem to Cumberland utterly subversive of religion, morality and civil society. He endeavours, as a rule, to establish directly antagonistic propositions. He refrains, however, from denunciation, and is a fair opponent up to the measure of his insight.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of Calvin and <b>Hobbes,</b> Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. He has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strip's characters, or embarking on new commercial projects, though he has published several Calvin and <b>Hobbes</b> anthologies. He does not sign autographs or license his characters, staying true to his stated principles. In previous years Watterson was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore {{in his hometown of}} Chagrin Falls, Ohio. He ended this practice after discovering that some of the autographed books were being sold online for high prices.|$|E
