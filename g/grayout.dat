50|$|A greyout (US English <b>grayout)</b> is a {{transient}} {{loss of vision}} characterized by a perceived dimming of light and color, sometimes accompanied by a loss of peripheral vision. It is a precursor to fainting or a blackout and is caused by hypoxia (low brain oxygen level), often due {{to a loss of}} blood pressure.|$|E
40|$|Attempt to {{determine}} if peripheral visual response time (RT) {{could be used as}} a reliable advanced predictor of +G sub z-related blackout or <b>grayout.</b> The relatively high luminance of the peripheral stimuli used in the experiments may account for the finding that peripheral RT was not sensitive to impending blackout or <b>grayout.</b> The relatively consistent mean RTs within subjects across test days in bed is probably due to the relatively constant response characteristics of the retina and to the high repeatability of the stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Tolerance to {{positive}} g accelerations {{was measured in}} ten normal male subjects using both standard and advanced techniques. In addition to routine electrocardiogram, heart rate, respiratory rate, and infrared television, monitoring techniques during acceleration exposure included measurement of peripheral vision loss, noninvasive temporal, brachial, and/or radial arterial blood flow, and automatic measurement of indirect systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 60 -sec intervals. Although brachial and radial arterial flow measurements reflected significant cardiovascular changes during and after acceleration, they were inconsistent indices of the onset of <b>grayout</b> or blackout. Temporal arterial blood flow, however, showed a high correlation with subjective peripheral light loss...|$|E
50|$|Titan {{has been}} known for {{occasionally}} causing blackouts or <b>grayouts</b> in the helices. Some riders have complained about headaches caused by sections of the course. Most of these incidents occur during the summer when riders are dehydrated due to the extreme Texas sun. Because of the complaints about the G-forces given during the second helix, the train is severely braked at the mid-course block brake, {{almost to the point of}} stopping. Park Policy prohibits re-rides due to the extreme G-forces.|$|R
5000|$|Mako {{has been}} well {{received}} among guests and critics. Dewayne Bevil from the Orlando Sentinel had described the ride as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and stated [...] "SeaWorld has delivered on its marketing promise with the fastest, tallest, longest coaster in the Orlando market". Marjie Lambert from the Miami Herald had commented that the ride was like a [...] "retro coaster" [...] and mentioned [...] "its design is reminiscent of old wooden coasters where the track couldn’t be shaped into the pretzels and upside down loops that are so popular in today’s steel coasters". Sharon Wynne from the Tampa Bay Times suggested [...] "it will likely to take {{two or three more}} trips on this coaster to appreciate all its tricks" [...] and coaster enthusiast Jim Terry attending the soft opening had acclaimed it was the best roller coaster in Florida. Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and five stars for adults. An editor commented that ride had complemented the two other major roller coasters at SeaWorld, Manta and Kraken. Arthur Levine of USA Today remarked that [...] "it's more than enough to get pulses racing and senses heightened, but not so much as to cause tunnel vision, <b>grayouts,</b> or other unpleasant side effects". Elle Gordon of the Irish Independent likened the [...] "weightless airtime" [...] as a highlight of her park visit and added it was well worth a night time ride.|$|R
40|$|A {{centrifuge}} {{study was}} carried out to measure physiological stress and control task performance during simulated space shuttle orbiter reentry. Jet pilots were tested with, and without, anti-g-suit protection. The pilots were exposed to simulated space shuttle reentry acceleration profiles before, and after, ten days of complete bed rest, which produced physiological deconditioning similar to that resulting from prolonged exposure to orbital zero g. Pilot performance in selected control tasks was determined during simulated reentry, and before and after each simulation. Physiological stress during reentry was determined by monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate. Study results indicate: (1) heart rate increased during the simulated reentry when no g protection was given, and remained at or below pre-bed rest values when g-suits were used; (2) pilots preferred the use of g-suits to muscular contraction for control of vision tunneling and <b>grayout</b> during reentry; (3) prolonged bed rest did not alter blood pressure or respiration rate during reentry, but the peak reentry acceleration level did; and (4) pilot performance was not affected by prolonged bed rest or simulated reentry...|$|E
