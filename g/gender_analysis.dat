Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology will benefit from advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological understandings of pastoral care, the multicultural contexts of pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and <b>gender</b> <b>analysis</b> will be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, legal {{scholars}} have noted with alarm the increasing alignment between immigration enforcement and {{the goals and}} methods {{of the criminal justice}} system, terming this alignment 2 ̆ 2 crimmigration. 2 ̆ 2 Although discussions of race and nativism have played a large part in this analysis, the same cannot be said for the connection between crimmigration and gender. This Commentary begins by introducing the reader to the rise of crimmigration, the intersection of gender with the criminal justice system, and the intersection of gender with immigration. Then, using examples of immigrant women 2 ̆ 7 s lived experiences, the author explores scholars 2 ̆ 7 failure to consider a <b>gendered</b> <b>analysis,</b> demonstrating that a gender-blind approach ignores how most immigrant families interact with the state.

40|$|The {{study of}} gender and {{associated}} questions about masculinity, femininity and inequality are important elements of social science research. While gender has often been a focus in disciplines such as sociology and anthropology, {{the social construction of}} gender is now analysed in areas ranging from criminology to international political economy. Disaster studies, however, adopted the use of <b>gendered</b> <b>analysis</b> quite late, and {{it was not until the}} 1990 s that a substantial body of literature started to emerge. Since then, there has been a steady increase in international research dealing with the relationship between gender and disaster. Australian research on bushfire is yet to make significant use of the insights from this work. In this paper, we offer some reasons as to why a <b>gendered</b> <b>analysis</b> of disaster and emergency management is important and how this applies specifically to bushfire. We also highlight some of the shortcomings associated with previous attempts at understanding bushfire through a gendered lens and suggest that, in order to move forward, we must acknowledge that constructions of masculinity may affect bushfire preparation and response...|$|R

40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{a number}} of themes useful in the <b>gendered</b> <b>analysis</b> of democratic consolidation in Latin America {{by means of a}} comparative analysis of Argentina and Chile. It starts from the assumption that much of the work on democratisation in Latin America – both orthodox and the literature concentrating on women and transitions – produced up until now, has been too voluntaristic in its approach. It argues that what is needed, particularly in the study of democratic consolidation, is an analysis not only of the impact of women and women's organisations on institutions and structures but also of how these institutions and structures can shape and change gender relations and different women's activities. Any <b>gendered</b> <b>analysis</b> of democratic consolidation must begin by examining the terms of transition which, while they can be subject to some renegotiation later, affect the nature of the subsequent system and the space available to different actors. It is argued that {{a number of}} characteristics of the post-transition system are significant: first the impact of more arbitrary populist or presidential systems, second the importance of women's organising {{both inside and outside the}} state and party systems and third the existence of an institutionalised party system...|$|R

The existing literature focusses primarily on the experiences of males and tends to be void of any conceptual <b>analysis</b> regarding <b>gender</b> biases. Debates surrounding the implementation of EM programs have been primarily concerned with issues relating to increased surveillance within the private sphere, cost-effectiveness, net-widening, and legal and ethical challenges. This lack of a <b>gendered</b> <b>analysis</b> is unfortunate since a review of the criminological literature clearly demonstrates that women's experiences with the criminal justice system are significantly different from those of men.

The unique situation of female offenders, as evidenced by the findings of this research, is at best a marginal consideration by local correctional officials in designing programs. The question of whether or not such programs can be 'modified’ to better suit the needs of women is one important dimension of this research.
