25|$|In 2006, a small, <b>front-wheel-drive</b> {{concept car}} called Hornet was {{designed}} and developed by Dodge (see Dodge Hornet).|$|E
25|$|Oldsmobile 98 (1941–1996) - Oldsmobile {{full-sized}} luxury coupe and sedan {{that was}} downsized in 1977 and 1985, became <b>front-wheel-drive</b> in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Frua also {{proposed}} a concept car {{based on the}} SM, a <b>front-wheel-drive</b> car that closely resembled the mid-engine Maserati Merak.|$|E
25|$|The engine had a {{distinctive}} design; the gearbox and differential were located directly below the engine block. This design helped Peugeot produce its first <b>front-wheel-drive</b> car.|$|E
25|$|Some {{particular}} contemporary {{developments are}} {{the proliferation of}} front- and all-wheel drive, {{the adoption of the}} diesel engine, and the ubiquity of fuel injection. Most modern passenger cars are <b>front-wheel-drive</b> monocoque/unibody designs, with transversely mounted engines.|$|E
25|$|Also {{familiar}} from {{a succession}} of post war Panhard saloons was the four-speed all-synchromesh gear box and the <b>front-wheel-drive</b> configuration. The wheels were independently suspended with telescopic shock absorbers and a torsion bar for the rear axle.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the company}} {{considered}} a revamped 5th-generation Falcon and even studied {{the possibility of}} fully imported replacements such as the American <b>front-wheel-drive</b> Ford Taurus or rear-wheel-drive Ford Crown Victoria, the European rear-wheel-drive Scorpio and, reportedly, even the Japanese rear-wheel drive Mazda 929 (then part of the Ford conglomerate).|$|E
25|$|By late 1972, Volkswagen {{had decided}} to cancel the nearly {{finished}} , a project for a mid-engined car to replace the Beetle, and to focus on <b>front-wheel-drive,</b> water-cooled cars. Rudolf Leiding, recently made head of Volkswagen, cited noise, heat, and servicing problems with the mid-engine layout, {{as well as the}} difficulty of making it a station wagon.|$|E
25|$|Citroën had {{developed}} expertise with front-wheel drive {{due to the}} pioneering Traction Avant, {{which was the first}} mass-produced steel monocoque <b>front-wheel-drive</b> car in the world. The 2CV was originally equipped with a sliding splined joint, and twin Hookes type universal joints on its driveshafts; later models used constant velocity joints and a sliding splined joint.|$|E
25|$|Only {{minor changes}} marked the 1985 model, {{which was in}} its last year before a major {{downsizing}} and conversion to <b>front-wheel-drive.</b> The same assortment of models in the Royale, Brougham and Brougham LS continued as before. The '85 88s {{would be the last}} full-sized Oldsmobile sedans and coupes to feature rear-wheel-drive, Rocket V8 power, and body-on-frame construction.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of launch in 2003, it became the world's first dual-clutch {{transmission}} in a series-production car, in the German-market Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32, and shortly afterwards worldwide, in the original Audi TT 3.2. For {{the first few years}} of production, this original DSG transmission was only available in transversely oriented front-engine, <b>front-wheel-drive</b> and Haldex Traction-based four-wheel-drive vehicle layouts.|$|E
25|$|This {{generation}} Rex was {{marketed as}} the Viki in certain Southeast Asian markets, a name {{which was also}} used for a special edition (Rex ViKi) in the Japanese domestic market. The end for the Rex came in March 1992, when it {{was replaced by the}} Vivio. A total of 1,902,811 Subaru Rexes were built in its lifetime. Recently the Rex has become somewhat of a cult car in Japan, being popular in <b>front-wheel-drive</b> drift events.|$|E
25|$|Although American Motors' Eagle Premier (and Dodge Monaco) was {{discontinued}} by Chrysler {{after the}} 1992 model year, the new Concorde's packaging {{was derived from}} the Premier, and all the suspension and drivetrain development mules were Premiers. Other design features found their way into the Chrysler LH platform, most notably the longitudinal engine layout, a hallmark of Renault's <b>front-wheel-drive</b> designs. This design allowed Chrysler to lower the hoodline, made maintenance/servicing simpler, and tightened the car's turning diameter.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Life {{represented}} Honda's {{efforts in}} {{competing in the}} kei car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, {{appears to be an}} influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a transversely installed engine with a <b>front-wheel-drive</b> powertrain.|$|E
25|$|Sales {{slowed to}} a trickle {{in the wake of}} the {{introduction}} of the Renault Alliance. These were more modern, space-efficient, fuel-efficient 4-cylinder, <b>front-wheel-drive</b> cars compared to the rear-drive Concord with its aging platform. The imported Renault 18-based 18i sedan Sportwagon sold by AMC/Jeep/Renault dealers were also more efficient replacements. All Concord and Spirit models were quietly dropped by the end of the 1983 model year. The future for AMC's Concord and Spirit series was sealed for the 1980s as rear-drive cars were replaced by front-drive models.|$|E
25|$|This {{would be}} the final year for the {{rear-drive}} LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to <b>front-wheel-drive</b> for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992–96 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to {{mark the end of}} an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} Supra {{was introduced in}} May 1986 as a free standing model, officially separating it from the Celica. Whereas the Celica became a <b>front-wheel-drive</b> sport coupe, the Supra retained its image as a rear-wheel-drive sports/GT car. The new Supra would continue to move upscale and become a showcase for Toyota technology. Originally meant {{to be released in}} 1985, production delays caused the model to actually be introduced mid year. The all new Supra was powered by a 3.0-liter DOHC inline six-cylinder engine rated at 200bhp. Notable features included an electronically controlled independent suspension (called the Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension – TEMS), and some came with a removable Sport-Roof panel (Targa top).|$|E
25|$|Stung by the {{criticism}} of the original Mark V (which was still hugely popular despite motoring press criticism of its styling, ride and handling), Ford facelifted the Escort and Orion in September 1992, giving the revised cars a new grille, bonnet and, in the Escort hatchback's case, a new rear end. A new 1.6L 16-valve 90bhp (66kW) Zetec engine was introduced, replacing the previous CVH. Fuel injection was now standard on all petrol models, and Ford introduced a four-wheel-drive variant of the RS2000, offering much improved handling over its <b>front-wheel-drive</b> cousins. A first for the Escort also saw the introduction of all disc brakes on all four wheels as standard on all RS2000 and XR3i models.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a version}} of <b>front-wheel-drive</b> 2013 Acura TL with {{distinctive}} 10-spoke 18-inch alloy wheels, a color-matched deck lid spoiler, trunk-mounted Special Edition badging, Keyless Access System with Keyless Access Remote, pushbutton start, choice of 4 body colors (Bellanova White Pearl, Crystal Black Pearl, Graphite Luster Metallic and Silver Moon Metallic) matched with an Ebony interior leather upholstery with contrast stitching, Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifter system, 10-way adjustable power driver's seat, an 8-way adjustable power front passenger's seat, power moonroof, 276-watt audio system with eight speakers, dual-zone dual-mode automatic climate control system with automatic humidity control. The vehicle was produced using domestically and globally sourced parts at Honda of America Mfg., Inc., in Marysville, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the two- and four-door saloons, there was a ‘pillarless’ coupé which shared {{the profile of the}} saloons apart from the absence of any fixed B pillar. A three-door estate version was also offered, branded as the ‘Universal’, between 1959 and 1962. For the new decade, the saloon was renamed Auto Union 1000S and received, in August 1959, an eye catching wrap around windscreen. Neither the windscreen nor the name changes entirely concealed the fact that at a time when competitor designs employed the modern ponton, three box form, this Auto Union’s body along with most of its technical features descended directly from that of the Zwickau developed DKW F9 prototype of 1938. Fortunately in 1938 the <b>front-wheel-drive</b> DKW design had been an innovative one.|$|E
25|$|LeSabres were {{rear-drive}} six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction {{along with}} a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to <b>front-wheel-drive,</b> unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived Roadmaster series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.|$|E
25|$|The G20 {{was first}} {{unveiled}} to Infiniti dealers at the 1989 New York International Auto Show (appearing {{to the public}} at the 1990 show), with the first series production example being assembled on July 10, 1990. The final 1996 G20 was rolled off the assembly line on July 19, 1996. The P10 featured the first application of Nissan's multi-link front suspension in a <b>front-wheel-drive</b> car, with an independent MacPherson strut setup in the rear. It came standard with a 5-speed manual transmission. The only options to begin with were an automatic transmission, leather interior, and a power glass moonroof; a Touring package (labeled G20t) was introduced in 1994 and featured a black leather interior with sport front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats, as well as a limited-slip differential in the transmission and a spoiler on the rear decklid.|$|E
25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed <b>front-wheel-drive</b> powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable valve timing technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E
25|$|The 1988 Chevrolet Nova added a sporty {{model to}} its lineup of subcompact <b>front-wheel-drive</b> cars. This new 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam {{got its name}} from a double-overhead-cam version of the Toyota-built 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Novas {{continued}} to share their basic design with the Corolla, and this engine had previously {{been used in the}} Toyota FX-16, a performance version of the Corolla. The twin-cam produced , 36 more than its single-cam sibling. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, as in the regular Novas, but the Twin-Cam offered a four-speed automatic as an option versus the three-speed offered on other models. The more potent engine elevated the 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam into junior sport-sedan territory, but the advancement didn't come cheaply. The base Nova listed at about $8,800, the Twin-Cam went for $11,395. That price included fuel injection, sport suspension, power steering, leather-covered steering wheel, tachometer, four-wheel disc brakes, and wider tires on aluminum wheels, but it was a stiff tariff, and few were ordered (approximately 3,300 Twin-Cam models were built). There were no color choices; all 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cams wore black metallic paint with a grey interior; and there was no hatchback version offered. Every 1988 Chevrolet Nova got rear shoulder belts, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo radio as standard equipment. This was the last model year for the Nova name at Chevrolet. Starting with 1989, Chevrolet pushed this car into its new Geo division and renamed it the Prizm. Geo was Chevy's effort {{to come up with an}} import-sounding label to attract buyers who were not inclined to shop American.|$|E
2500|$|Oldsmobile Toronado (1966–1992) - a {{front-wheel drive}} coupe in the {{personal}} luxury car category, introduced in 1966. At the time, {{the largest and most}} powerful <b>front-wheel-drive</b> car ever produced, {{and one of the first}} modern <b>front-wheel-drive</b> cars equipped with an automatic transmission. The original Toronado was powered by a 425CID Super Rocket V8 engine rated at , mated to a three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission.

After building over 406,000 Concords, AMC dropped the line and made its successor the smaller <b>front-wheel-drive</b> Renault Alliance, a car that alienated many AMC loyalists.|$|E
2500|$|... 1959: The Mini car begins {{production}} at Birmingham's Longbridge plant. The original {{is considered a}} British icon of the 1960s, and its space-saving <b>front-wheel-drive</b> layout (which allowed 80% of {{the area of the}} car's floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage) influenced a generation of car makers. In 1999 the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T.|$|E
