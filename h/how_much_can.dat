500|$|Presley was keen {{to resume}} regular live performing. Following {{the success of}} the Comeback Special, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker $28,000 for a one-week engagement. He responded, [...] "That's fine for me, now <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>can</b> you get for Elvis?" [...] In May, the brand new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest {{showroom}} in the city, announced that it had booked Presley, scheduling him to perform 57 shows over four weeks beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and The Sweet Inspirations. Nonetheless, he was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal, and he had neither forgotten nor forgiven that failure. To revise his approach to performances, Presley visited Las Vegas hotel showrooms and lounges, at one of which, that of the Flamingo, he encountered Tom Jones, whose aggressive style was similar to his own 1950s approach; the two became friends. Already studying karate at the time, Presley recruited Bill Belew to design variants of karatekas's gis for him; these, in jumpsuit form, would be his [...] "stage uniforms" [...] in his later years. Parker, who intended to make Presley's return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the raids, twelve {{civil rights groups}} led by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the National Lawyers Guild, filed a lawsuit demanding that the ADL release its surveillance information and end its investigations, as well as ordering it to pay punitive damages. The lawsuit fueled speculation that the organization was waging a secret campaign to repress political dissent. The plaintiffs' attorney, former Representative McCloskey, claimed that the information the ADL gathered constituted an invasion of privacy. The ADL, while distancing itself from Bullock, countered that it is entitled like any researcher or journalist to research organizations and individuals. Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, stated that like journalists, the ADL's researchers [...] "gather information however they can" [...] and welcome disclosures from confidential sources, saying [...] "they probably rely on their sources to draw the line" [...] on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>can</b> legally be divulged. Bullock admitted that he was overzealous, {{and that some of}} the ways in which he gathered information may have been illegal.|$|E
