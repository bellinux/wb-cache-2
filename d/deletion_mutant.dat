25|$|The {{observation}} that A. salmonicida contains the spf gene (which encodes Spot 42), but lacks the galK operon (the natural Spot 42 target in E. coli), have inspired scientists {{to study the}} role of Spot 42 in this fish pathogen. A. salmonicida is unable to utilize galactose (lacks gal operon) in minimal medium and addition of galactose has {{little effect on the}} growth rate. When cells are grown in glucose the level of Spot42 is increased 16-40 folds, but is in contrast decreased 3 folds when cAMP is added, indicating that Spot42 probably have similar roles as in E. coli (i.e., in carbohydrate metabolism). It has been hypothesized that Spot 42 works in concert with a novel sRNA gene, called VSsrna24, located 262 nt downstream of spf. The VSsrna42 RNA is approximately 60 nt in length and has an expression pattern opposite to that of Spot42. Furthermore, in a spf <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> a gene encoding a pirin-like protein was upregulated 16 folds. Pirin has key roles in the central metabolism by regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 and therefore select if pyruvate will be fermented or go through respiration through the TCA cycle and electron transport.|$|E

Through the use of overlapping reading frames, the same PRRSV genetic locus codes for the ORF 3 “RKASLSTS” sequence, and a previously described ORF 4 epitope (Meulenberg, J. J. M., Van Nieuwstadt, A.

Phylogenetic analysis showed {{the presence of a}} highly accurate ORF 3 molecular clock, according to which <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> and nondeleted viruses evolved at differing speeds. Furthermore, <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> and nondeleted viruses evolved as separate lineages. These distinctions suggested that <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> were a hitherto unrecognized subtype of European-type PRRSV. Currently, <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> appear to be outcompeting nondeleted viruses in the field, highlighting the importance of the porcine antibody response against the minor structural glycoproteins of European-type PRRSV for viral evolution...|$|R

These toxins consist of a linear polyketide-derived backbone substituted at various positions with an amine, one to four hydroxyl, two methyl, and two tricarballylic ester functions. In this study, we generated and characterized <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> of G. moniliformis for five genes, FUM 7, FUM 10, FUM 11, FUM 14, and FUM 16 in the fumonisin biosynthetic gene cluster. Functional analysis of mutants in four genes, predicted to encode unrelated proteins, affected formation of the tricarballylic esters. FUM 7 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> produced a previously undescribed homologue of fumonisin B 1 with an alkene function in both tricarballylic esters, FUM 10 and FUM 14 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> produced homologues of fumonisin B 3 and fumonisin B 4 that lack tricarballylic ester functions, and FUM 11 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> produced fumonisins that lack one of the tricarballylic ester functions. These phenotypes indicated specific roles for FUM 7, FUM 10, FUM 11, and FUM 14 in fumonisin biosynthesis {{that are consistent with}} the predicted proteins encoded by each gene.

The {{functions}} of the MpkB and MpkC MAPKs are unknown for A. fumigatus and the closely related and genetically amenable species Aspergillus nidulans. mpkC <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> of A. fumigatus were made and their phenotypes characterized. The mpkC <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> were viable and had normal conidial germination and hyphal growth on minimal or complete media. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> with <b>deletions</b> in the closely related MAPK gene sakA/hogA that we previously reported had a nitrogen source-dependent germination phenotype. Similarly, the growth of the mpkC <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> was wild type on high-osmolarity medium. Consistent with these two MAP kinase genes regulating different cellular responses, we determined that the mpkC <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> were unable to grow on minimal medium with sorbitol or mannitol as the sole carbon source. This result implicates MpkC signaling in carbon source utilization. Changes in mRNA levels for sakA and mpkC were measured in response to hypertonic stress, oxidative stress, and a shift from glucose to sorbitol to determine if there was overlap in the SakA and MpkC signaling pathways. These studies demonstrated that SakA- and MpkC-dependent patterns of change in mRNA levels are distinct and have minimal overlap in response to these environmental stresses...|$|R

5000|$|APOBEC3G (Apolipoprotein editing complex 3 G) {{is another}} {{intrinsic}} immune protein which interferes with HIV infection. APOBEC3G is a cytidine deaminase against single stranded DNA which introduces transversion mutations into the HIV genome during reverse transcription by randomly changing cytidine basepairs into uracil. Though {{this will not}} necessarily stop viral integration, the resulting progeny viral genomes are too riddled with mutations to be viable. APOBEC3G expression is disrupted by the HIV vif protein which induces its degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Vif actually exploits our intrinsic immunity, titrating the degree of APOBEC3G polyubiquitination in order to augment the genetic variability already present in HIV-1 (owing to its mutation-happy reverse transcriptase). Vif therefore acts via APOBEC3G to {{increase the likelihood of}} the generation of escape mutants in HIV-1 pathogenesis.

50|$|Synthetic genetic array {{analysis}} (SGA) is a high-throughput {{technique for}} exploring synthetic lethal and synthetic sick genetic interactions (SSL).

Using SGA methodology a query gene <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> can be crossed to an entire genome deletion set to identify any SSL interactions, yielding functional information of the query gene and the genes it interacts with. A large-scale application of SGA in which ~130 query genes were crossed to the set of ~5000 viable deletion mutants in yeast revealed a genetic network containing ~1000 genes and ~4000 SSL interactions. The results of this study showed that genes with similar function tend to interact with one another and genes with similar patterns of genetic interactions often encode products that tend to work in the same pathway or complex. Synthetic Genetic Array analysis was initially developed using the model organism S. cerevisiae. This method has since been extended to cover 30% of the S. cerevisiae genome.

40|$|Background/PurposeThe genomes of {{different}} Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A actinomycetemcomitans) strains contain many strain-specific genes and genomic islands (defined as DNA {{found in some}} but not all strains) of unknown functions. Genetic analysis for the functions of these islands will be constrained by the limited availability of genetic markers and vectors for A actinomycetemcomitans. In this study, we tested a novel genetic approach of gene deletion and restoration in a naturally competent A actinomycetemcomitans strain D 7 S- 1. MethodsSpecific genes' <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> and mutants restored with the deleted genes were constructed by a markerless loxP/Cre system.

While investigating the genomic diversity of B. dolosa strains collected from an outbreak among CF patients, we previously identified fixL as a gene showing signs of strong positive selection. This gene has homology to fixL of the rhizobial FixL/FixJ two-component system. The goals of this study were to determine the functions of FixLJ and their role in virulence in B. dolosa. We generated a fixLJ <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> and complemented controls in B. dolosa strain AU 0158. Using a fixK-lacZ reporter we found that FixLJ was activated in low oxygen in multiple BCC species. In a murine pneumonia model, the B. dolosa fixLJ <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> was cleared faster from the lungs and spleen than wild-type B. dolosa strain AU 0158 at 7 days post infection. Interestingly, the fixLJ <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> made more biofilm, albeit with altered structure, but was less motile than strain AU 0158. Using RNA-seq with in vitro grown bacteria, we found ~ 11 % of the genome was differentially expressed in the fixLJ <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> relative to strain AU 0158. Multiple flagella-associated genes were down-regulated in the fixLJ <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant,</b> so we also evaluated virulence of a fliC <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant,</b> which lacks a flagellum.

We investigated the genomic response at the level of mRNA expression to the deletion of SSA 1 / 2 in comparison with the mild heat-shocked wild-type using cDNA microarray. Results Yeast cDNA microarray analysis revealed that genes involved in the stress response, including molecular chaperones, were up-regulated in a similar manner in both the ssa 1 / 2 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> and the mild heat-shocked wild-type. Genes involved in protein synthesis were up-regulated in the ssa 1 / 2 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant,</b> but were markedly suppressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type. The genes involved in ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation were also up-regulated in the ssa 1 / 2 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant,</b> whereas the unfolded protein response (UPR) genes were highly expressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type. RT-PCR confirmed that the genes regulating protein synthesis and cytosolic protein degradation were up-regulated in the ssa 1 / 2 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant.</b> At the translational level, more ubiquitinated proteins and proteasomes were detected in the ssa 1 / 2 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant,</b> than in the wild-type, confirming that ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation was up-regulated by the deletion of SSA 1 / 2.

Polypeptone dramatically induced cell lysis in the ura 4 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> when cells approached the stationary growth phase, and this phenotype was suppressed by supplementation of uracil. To determine the specificity of this cell lysis phenotype, we created deletion mutants of other genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of uridine monophosphate (ura 1, ura 2, ura 3, and ura 5). Cell lysis was not observed in these gene deletion mutants. In addition, concomitant disruption of ura 1, ura 2, ura 3, or ura 5 in the ura 4 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> suppressed cell lysis, indicating that cell lysis induced by polypeptone is specific to the ura 4 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant.</b> Furthermore, cell lysis was also suppressed when the gene involved in coenzyme Q biosynthesis was deleted.

The ura 4 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> was sensitive to zymolyase, which mainly degrades (1, 3) -beta-D glucan, when grown {{in the presence of}} polypeptone, and cell lysis was suppressed by the osmotic stabiliser, sorbitol. Finally, the induction of cell lysis in the ura 4 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> was due to the accumulation of orotidine- 5 -monophosphate. Cell wall integrity was dramatically impaired in the ura 4 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> when grown in the presence of polypeptone. Because ura 4 is widely use...|$|E
40|$|Two-component {{systems are}} {{important}} constituents of bacterial regulatory networks. Results {{of this investigation}} {{into the role of}} the MprAB two-component system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis indicate that it is associated with the regulation of several stress-responsive regulons. Using a <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> lacking portions of the response regulator, MprA, and the histidine kinase, MprB, it was demonstrated by real-time PCR, primer extension analyses and DNA microarrays that MprAB activates sigma factor genes sigE and sigB, under SDS stress and during exponential growth. SDS-inducible, MprA-dependent transcriptional start points were identified for mprA, sigE and sigB, and variations in distance between these points and MprA-binding sites suggest that MprA is involved in different mechanisms of promoter activation. Although most of the SigE regulon was downregulated in the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant,</b> the cluster of genes Rv 1129 c, Rv 1130 and Rv 1131, which is associated with growth in monocytes, was upregulated in the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> under SDS stress, and this upregulation was dependent upon atmospheric growth conditions. Multiple stress-associated genes of the DosR, SigD and IdeR regulons were also upregulated in the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant,</b> during exponential growth and/or in the presence of SDS. Surprisingly, the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> had increased resistance to SDS compared to the parental strain, and enhanced growth in human peripheral blood monocytes, characteristics which may result from a loss of repression of stress-associated genes. 1568...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 5 (BoHV- 5) is a important {{cause of}} viral encephalitis in cattle in South America. Within {{the framework of}} developing a differential vaccine against BoHV- 5, a <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> was constructed based on a Brazilian BoHV- 5 isolate. The target of the deletions were genes that code proteins implicated in the neurovirulence of BoHV- 5, the glycoprotein I (gI), glycoprotein E (gE) and membrane protein US 9. To construct the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> of BoHV- 5, the flanking regions of all three genes were cloned in a prokaryotic plasmid. This deletion fragment was co-transfected with the viral DNA into bovine cells. Identification of deletion mutants was performed by immunostaining with an anti-gE monoclonal antibody. One of the gE negative viral populations found was purified, amplified and further examined by restriction endonuclesase analysis of its genomic DNA. The plaque sizes and penetration kinetics of the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> and wild type viruses were compared. The plaque sizes of the <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> were significantly smaller {{than those of the}} parental strain (p <= 0. 05), but no statistical differences were observed in penetration kinetics. The results indicate that the gI/gE/US 9 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutant</b> of BoHV- 5 may have a reduced virulence in the host and is still viable enough to be a good candidate {{for the development of a}} BoHV- 5 vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Magnaporthe oryzae is a hemibiotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} rice blast disease. A compatible interaction requires overcoming plant defense responses to initiate colonization {{during the early}} infection process. Nitric oxide (NO) plays important roles in defense responses during host-pathogen interactions. Microbes generally protect themselves against NO-induced damage by using enzymes. Here, we characterized an S-(hydroxymethyl) -glutathione dehydrogenase gene in M. oryzae, MoSFA 1, the homologs of which are involved in NO metabolism by specifically catalyzing the reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in yeasts and plants. As expected from the activities of S-(hydroxymethyl) glutathione dehydrogenase in formaldehyde detoxification and GSNO reduction, MoSFA 1 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> were lethal in formaldehyde containing medium, sensitive to exogenous NO and exhibited {{a higher level of}} S-nitrosothiols (SNOs) than that of the wild type. Notably, the mutants showed severe reduction of conidiation and appressoria turgor pressure, as well as significantly attenuated the virulence on rice cultivar CO- 39. However, the virulence of MoSFA 1 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> on wounded rice leaf was not affected. An infection assay on barley leaf further revealed that MoSFA 1 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> exhibited a lower infection rate, and growth of infectious hyphae of the mutants was retarded not only in primary infected cells but also in expansion from cell to cell. Furthermore, barley leaf cell infected by MoSFA 1 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> exhibited a stronger accumulation of H 2 O 2 at 24 and 36 hpi. MoSFA 1 <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> displayed hypersensitivity to different oxidants, reduced activities of superoxide dismutases and peroxidases, and lower glutathione content in cells, compared with the wild type. These results imply that MoSFA 1 -mediated NO metabolism is important in redox homeostasis in response to development and host infection of M. oryzae. Taken together, this work identifies that MoSFA 1 is required for conidiation and contributes to virulence in the penetration and biotrophic phases in M. oryzae...|$|R
40|$|<b>Deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) are {{often found in}} chronically HBV-infected patients. It has not been possible to study the significance of such <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> on liver diseases in a suitable animal model. In this study, we characterized naturally occurring <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) in 11 chronically WHV-infected woodchucks. Deletions within the WHV preS region (nt 2992 - 338) had a length of 72 or 84 bp and were located in the amino terminal part of preS 1. Internal deletions with the core gene (CID) had variable lengths (103 to 312 bp) and were identified within {{the center of this}} gene (nt 2021 - 2587). Four of seven CIDs were in-frame deletions, whereas the remaining three CIDs were out-of-frame deletions and led to the interruption of the reading frame. Sequence analysis of cloned PCR products of CIDs showed that heterogeneous WHV <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> coexisted in single woodchucks. In addition, WHV genomes with double deletions in the preS 1 and the core region could be found. We were unable to detect the expression of truncated core proteins in transfection experiments. The CID mutations led to a marked increase of the expression of the luciferase gene which was fused to the start codon of WHV polymerase, probably due to the shortening of the untranslated region or the removal of AUGs preceding the polymerase start codon. The characterization of naturally occurring WHV <b>deletion</b> <b>mutants</b> will allow us to study their biological and pathogenic properties in the woodchuck model in the future. (orig.)
