40|$|In recent years, a {{significant}} {{body of literature}} has emerged {{on the subject of}} information infrastructure (II) within the IS field. Nevertheless, issues <b>of</b> risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> II have seldom been addressed. This dissertation addresses this important gap by drawing on recent contributions to sociological theories of risk to study the relationship between risk, culture and the occurrence <b>of</b> danger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> IT as corporate information infrastructure (CII). The thesis is established on findings from an ethnographic study <b>of</b> risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> II with a multinational banking corporation. This thesis makes several key contributions to the field of IS, firstly to the understanding <b>of</b> risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> II. Secondly, to theory development in IS risk research through the novel integration of sociological theories of risk into a theoretical model for the analysis of risk, culture, and danger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> ICT. A further contribution to IS research is achieved through the adoption of the impressionist autoethnographic approach, as a novel means of narrative construction within IS research...|$|R

Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
