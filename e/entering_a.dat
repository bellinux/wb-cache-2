5|$|A {{lutetium}} atom has 71 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f145d16s2. When <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, {{and as a result}} lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E

5|$|After CR4, NY179 {{proceeds}} east through Orchard Park as a two-lane boulevard, intersecting {{the northern}} terminus of CR461 (California Road). After crossing under another railroad, NY179 returns to four-lanes, passing south of several strip malls in Orchard Park. The route soon becomes a divided highway, <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> cloverleaf interchange with US219 (the Southern Expressway). After the interchange, NY179 parallels as a four-lane boulevard between several strip malls, soon intersecting with US20 (Southwestern Boulevard), where NY179 terminates.

Archie Thompson, who scored a record-setting 13 goals, was delighted with his record, but he also agreed with Farina's comments. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both comments and suggested {{a change in the}} qualification format, with the smaller teams <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> preliminary round. However, Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil Scarsella, opposed both comments and claimed that the smaller teams have the right to face Australia and New Zealand, similar to Australia having the rights to face stronger opponents such as Brazil and France.|$|E

5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E

5|$|From Beckford's {{house in}} Lansdown Crescent {{to the tower}} a series of {{interlinked}} gardens were laid out which became known as Beckford's Ride.

Specialist planting included: Pinus arborea, Royal Fern (Osmunda regalis) and Cistus alpina. These were to encourage bird species including nightingales, linnets and thrushes.

5|$|From {{its origin}} to Birdwood the river follows rolling, {{relatively}} level country before <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> hilly section {{that continues to}} Gumeracha. The river then follows sedimentary rock strata before <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> gorge after Cudlee Creek. It flows through the gorge to Athelstone, passing over the Eden Fault Zone of the Adelaide Hills face and associated escarpment. After the scarp it flows over sedimentary rocks of varying resistance to erosion, {{which has led to}} interspersed narrows and broad basins. From the base of the Adelaide Hills to Adelaide's central business district it runs in a shallow valley with a terraced floor, then down the slope of its own alluvial fan. The structure of this fan shows that the river formerly entered Gulf St Vincent via the Port River. Over time the Torrens deposited sediment, choking its own outflow; becoming locked behind coastal sand dunes and forming the swampy areas of the Cowandilla Plains and the reedbeds.|$|E
