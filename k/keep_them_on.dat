However, things {{proved to be more}} fortunate with the third group; Khulayd managed to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> bay, but was unable to withdraw back to Bahrain as the Sassanians were blocking his way at the sea. Umar, founding out about al-'Ala's invasion of Fars, had him replaced with Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas as the governor of Bahrain. Umar then ordered Utbah ibn Ghazwan to send reinforcements to Khulayd. When the reinforcements arrived, Khulayd and some of his men managed successfully to withdraw back to Bahrain, while the rest withdrew to Basra.|$|E
25|$|Polish {{children}} in Austrian Galicia were largely uneducated; by 1900, 52 {{percent of all}} male and 59 percent of all female Galicians over six years of age were illiterates. Austrian Poles started immigrating from the United States beginning in 1880. The Austrian government tightened emigration in the late 1800s, as many young Polish males were eager to leave the mandatory conscription of the Austrian government, and peasants were displeased {{with the lack of}} upward opportunities and stability from heavy, labor-intensive agricultural work. The Galician government wanted to tie peasants to contracts and legal obligations to the land they worked on, and tried to enforce legislation to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the lands. Polish peasant revolts in 1902 and 1903 changed the Austrian government's policies, and emigration from Galicia increased tremendously in the early 1900–1910 period.|$|E
25|$|The colonists did {{not object}} that the taxes were high; they were {{actually}} low. They objected {{to the fact that}} they had no representation in the Parliament, and thus no voice concerning legislation that affected them. Benjamin Franklin testified in Parliament in 1766 that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said that local governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the French and Indian War alone. London had to deal with 1,500 politically well-connected British Army soldiers. The decision was to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> active duty with full pay, but they had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so the decision was made to station them in America and have the Americans pay them. The soldiers had no military mission; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no threat to the colonies.|$|E

500|$|First Nations {{people had}} been {{frequent}} participants in the city's exhibitions since they were first held in 1886, taking part in parades and sporting events and entertaining spectators with traditional dances. By 1912 however, pressure from agents of the Department of Indian Affairs to suppress their historic traditions and to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> their farms nearly ended native participation. [...] Weadick hoped to include native people as a feature of his Stampede, but Indian Affairs opposed his efforts and asked the Duke of Connaught, Canada's Governor General, to support their position. [...] The Duke refused, and after Weadick gained the support of political contacts in Ottawa, including future Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, the path was cleared.|$|E

500|$|Camping is {{available}} at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, {{as well as in}} Grand Teton National Park to the south. Backcountry campsites are accessible only by foot or by horseback and require a permit. There are [...] of hiking trails available. The park is not considered to be a good destination for mountaineering because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates.

500|$|Welsh Corgis have {{historically}} been used as herding dogs, specifically for cattle. They are {{of the type of}} herding dog referred to as [...] "heelers", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the move. Both Pembrokeshire and Cardigan are historically agricultural areas of Wales. The combination of the low height off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. The term [...] "corgi" [...] means either cur dog or dwarf dog (cor = dwarf, gi = lenitive of ci, dog) in the Welsh language, which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. There is also a folk legend that says corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles.|$|E

2500|$|Surface {{dry suits}} may have socks or ankle seals fitted. Socks are {{normally}} made from latex rubber {{or from a}} breathable material similar {{to the rest of}} the suit. An outer boot or shoe would normally be worn over these socks to protect them from wear and the risk of puncture. The outer boot also provides more warmth than the thin layer of latex. A regular sock (e.g. a woollen sock) would normally be worn inside the drysuit sock for comfort. Latex rubber ankle seals are sometimes fitted in place of socks and can allow better foot control of water skis and surfboards.

The Dakotas were used on cargo runs, in troop movement and in paratroop and leaflet drops within Malaya. The Lincolns, operating from bases in Singapore and from Kuala Lumpur, formed the backbone of the air war against the CTs, conducting bombing missions against their jungle bases. Although results were often difficult to assess, they allowed the government to harass CT forces, attack their base camps when identified and <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the move. Later, in 1958, Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF were deployed to Malaya and took part in bombing missions against the CTs.|$|E
2500|$|The boat, {{a vessel}} named the Neptune, had 289 convicts on board, among whom was the famous Irish rebel John Mitchel and his colleagues. Sir Harry Smith {{had the support}} of the extremist {{settlers}} of the Eastern Cape, whose expansion onto Xhosa lands he had facilitated, but he could not govern without the consent of the powerful Cape Town elite, or his Legislative Council from which they had resigned en masse. Confronted with public resistance, he agreed not to allow the convicts to land when the Neptune arrived in Simon's Bay on 19 September 1849, but to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> board the ship until he received orders to send them elsewhere.

Although the students had dispersed by late afternoon, replacement forces were brought in to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> campus through the night. When they were allowed to return home hours later, police reportedly stopped a group of students and assaulted them. Word of this attack spread through several witnesses, and a large group later attacked and destroyed a traffic police post. As the outnumbered police fled, protesters began attacking shopping malls and another police post. Thousands poured into the streets and burned cars and shops through the late night.|$|E

2500|$|For Daredevil's red suit, {{introduced}} {{at the end}} of the first season, Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which lead to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists higlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor's face is going to be doing something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, [...] "There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [...] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side. So while it would have been easier to place the holster on the right we all felt that we had to keep to the classic profile and <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the left." ...|$|E
