5|$|In {{contrast}} to the older AN/MPQ-53 Passive <b>Electronically</b> Scanned Array (PESA) radar set of the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, the Green Pine is an active <b>electronically</b> scanned array (AESA) solid state radar. Unlike the advanced AN/TPY-2 X band radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, Green Pine operates at L band - in the range 500 MHz to 1,000MHz, or 1,000MHz to 2,000MHz.|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{generally}} works alone, performing or <b>electronically</b> creating all of {{the instrument}} tracks for his music and layering the result to create a single track. He provides most of the vocals for his songs himself, plays guitar, bass and keyboard, and can use electronic programs for drums and many other instruments, including orchestral pieces. However, he has collaborated with other artists at times for vocals or other instruments that he cannot play or create <b>electronically.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vocals were sporadic, {{and were}} {{as likely to}} be bubblegum pop as they were to be {{abrasive}} polemics. Cabaret Voltaire's Stephen Mallinder's vocals were <b>electronically</b> treated.|$|E

5|$|Bank1 <b>electronically</b> transmits {{the check}} {{image and the}} MICR line data {{captured}} from the original check to the paying bank (Bank2) for settlement. If no agreement exists between Bank1 and Bank2 to exchange check images and data, Bank1 must provide either the original check or the legal equivalent of the substitute check to Bank2.|$|E
5|$|Broadcast News: Since May 2010, the British Library {{has been}} making off-air {{recordings}} of daily TV and radio news broadcasts from seventeen channels, including BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky News, Al-Jazeera English, NHK World, CNN, France 24, Bloomberg, Russia Today and China's CCTV News. Many of the programs come with subtitles, which can be <b>electronically</b> searched, greatly enhancing {{the value of the}} collection as a research tool.|$|E
5|$|F-16E/F: The F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat) are newer F-16 variants. The Block 60 {{version is}} based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52 and has been {{developed}} especially for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It features improved AN/APG-80 active <b>electronically</b> scanned array (AESA) radar, avionics, conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), and the more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engine.|$|E
5|$|Ghosts I–IV {{features}} a wide assortment of musical instruments, including piano, guitar, bass, synthesizer, marimba, tambourine, banjo, dulcimer, and xylophone, {{many of which}} were sampled and distorted <b>electronically.</b> Percussion instruments, contributed primarily by Brian Viglione, were constructed largely out of found objects and household items.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{a janitor}} named James Spangler {{working for the}} Hoover family invented the first <b>electronically</b> {{portable}} vacuum cleaner. Production of the device began at a factory in New Berlin (later renamed North Canton), and today the company is known as The Hoover Company, with its headquarters still located in North Canton.|$|E
5|$|In International elite competition, <b>electronically</b> {{tethered}} starting blocks {{sense the}} reaction {{time of the}} athletes. If the athlete reacts in less than 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{changes for}} the 2014 model year include a manual release for the charge port door {{in place of the}} <b>electronically</b> {{activated}} door found on previous models, and the addition of two new paint colors. A leather wrapped steering wheel becomes standard.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected <b>electronically</b> by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive <b>electronically</b> scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has {{introduced}} the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers {{to check in}} and print their boarding passes <b>electronically,</b> since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, {{they would have to}} go to an airline representative at the counters.|$|E
5|$|F-16V: At the 2012 Singapore Air Show Lockheed Martin {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the new F-16V variant with the V suffix for its Viper nickname. It is to feature an active <b>electronically</b> scanned array (AESA) radar, a new mission computer and electronic warfare suite, and various cockpit improvements; this package is an option on current production F-16s and can be retrofitted to most in service F-16s. First flight took place 21 October, 2015. Production run to upgrade Taiwan's F-16 fleet started January, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Field {{was raised}} in the San Fernando Valley. He played guitar in Los Angeles {{for a period of time}} as a young man. He contributed to {{productions}} including electric guitar, jazz, and rock music. He acquired his first computer about 1998, wherein he began to learn musical composition and production. He experimented by taking compositions from Ludwig van Beethoven and Sergei Prokofiev, and inputting them <b>electronically</b> into his computer. He noted in a 2006 interview that his wife Katie O'Brien Field helped with promotion of his music.|$|E
5|$|Full-featured USB3.1 Type-C cables are <b>electronically</b> marked cables {{that contain}} {{a full set}} of wires and a chip with an ID {{function}} based on the configuration data channel and vendor-defined messages (VDMs) from the USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification. USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V power bus in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, CART {{became the}} 39th public {{transportation}} {{system in the}} United States to be featured on Google Transit, a website that allows transportation users to <b>electronically</b> plan their travel routes. In 2010, CART buses were modified to include a GPS tracking system that allows riders to see the location of buses and their predicted arrival times via the CART and Google websites. CART buses transport more than 1.3million travelers annually.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bell {{began to}} lay off workers on the V-22 {{production}} line following the implementation of defense cuts, which had reduced the US order to about half the originally planned number of aircraft. Production rate went from 40 in 2012 to 22 planned for 2015. Manufacturing robots have replaced older automated machines for increased accuracy and efficiency in production. Large parts are {{held in place by}} suction cups and measured <b>electronically.</b> Raw materials arrive frozen.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined <b>electronically</b> when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{monitors}} Erwin Lukesh, {{a suspected}} serial killer who cuts out his victims' tongues. While pursuing him, Reyes goes {{into an apartment}} building and is attacked by Lukesh with a razor. John Doggett (Robert Patrick), observes the pursuit <b>electronically</b> and hears a scream. He rushes to help Reyes and finds her dying, her throat cut. Doggett chases Lukesh into an alleyway, where the killer seemingly vanishes. Lukesh then appears behind Doggett and fires at him with Reyes' gun.|$|E
5|$|The F-16E/F is {{outfitted}} with Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-80 active <b>electronically</b> scanned array (AESA) radar. Northrop Grumman developed the latest AESA radar upgrade for the F-16 (selected for USAF and Taiwan Air Force F-16 upgrades), named the Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR). In July 2007, Raytheon {{announced that it}} was developing a Next Generation Radar (RANGR) based on its earlier AN/APG-79 AESA radar as a competitor to Northrop Grumman's AN/APG-68 and AN/APG-80 for the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive <b>electronically</b> scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} {{actively}} scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E
5|$|The Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A {{was to be}} a 767-400ER-based {{replacement}} for the USAF's 707-based E-3 Sentry AWACS, Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS, and RC-135 SIGINT aircraft. The E-10 MC2A would have included an all-new AWACS system, with a powerful active <b>electronically</b> scanned array (AESA) that was also capable of jamming enemy aircraft or missiles. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a testbed for systems integration, but the program was terminated in January 2009 and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport.|$|E
5|$|The hospital's {{design was}} criticised for not {{providing}} {{space for the}} storage of medical files. It was expected that all files would be stored <b>electronically</b> within five years. In the meantime, the paper medical files were transferred {{to the site of}} the old Falkirk Royal Infirmary. An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department at a cost of £40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Pendennis was neglected; many of its guns became {{unserviceable}} {{and some}} buildings fell into ruin. The old post of captain of Pendennis Castle was abolished in 1837, with the fortification commanded by a conventional military appointment. In the 1850s, renewed fears of a French invasion led to investment in new artillery at the castle, and nineteen 32- and 56-pounder (14.5 and 24.5 kg) guns were installed. Falmouth continued to be an important harbour, particularly for the Royal Navy. When new concerns about France emerged, an <b>electronically</b> operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from Pendennis and St Mawes. New 6- and 12-pounder (2.7 and 5.4 kg) quick-firing guns, supported by machine-guns for close defence, were assigned to the castle to deal with the emerging threat from enemy torpedo boats.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, O'Brien placed {{second in}} his {{heat of the}} 200m breaststroke {{in a time of}} 2min 36.8s, which placed him 13th. He was eliminated, having been 2.9s slower than the last-placed {{qualifier}} for the final. The eventual winner posted a time 0.9s slower than that of O'Brien four years earlier. O'Brien did better in the newly introduced 100m event, winning his heat in a time of 1min 8.9s to qualify second-fastest for the semifinals. O'Brien scraped into the final after coming second in his semifinal in a time of 1min 9.0s. It was the barest of margins; O'Brien was the slowest qualifier and could not be <b>electronically</b> separated from the ninth-fastest semifinalist, with judges being used to decide the placings. O'Brien went on to finish sixth in a time of 1min 8.6s.|$|E
5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was <b>electronically</b> deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Kaegi {{was invited}} to compose at Utrecht's Institute of Sonology, {{formerly}} known as STEM, in The Netherlands, where he created the tape music of Hydrophonie I. Owing to {{a grant from the}} Swiss government, he permanently relocated to The Netherlands in 1971 to work at the Institute and soon {{became a member of the}} board of directors. At the Institute, Kaegi worked as a composer, researcher and teacher in the field of <b>electronically</b> generated music and composition – his students have among others included Benno Ammann, Lasse Thoresen, Jos Janssen, Cort Lippe, Kathleen St John, Trevor Batten, Maarten In 't Veld, Martin Supper, Peter Pabon, Kees van Prooijen. After Floris van Maanen the Canadian composer Paul Goodman, born 1955, became his assistant in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying <b>electronically</b> with an EZ Pass issued in New York State. These discount toll was {{implemented a}}t several tunnels and bridges connecting New York City and New Jersey, including the George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel, and Holland Tunnel, {{and at some}} other bridges administrated by PANYNJ. Since March 2008, qualified low-emission automobiles with a fuel economy of at least 45 miles per gallon are eligible to receive a Port Authority Green Pass, which allows for a 50% discount during off-peak hours {{as compared to the}} regular full toll.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the majestic yet fairly traditional compositions by the two Strausses and Khachaturian, Kubrick used four highly modernistic compositions by György Ligeti that employ micropolyphony, the use of sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly. This technique was pioneered in Atmosphères, the only Ligeti piece heard in its entirety in the film. Ligeti admired Kubrick's film but, in {{addition to}} being irritated by Kubrick's failure to obtain permission directly from him, he was offended that his music was used in a film soundtrack shared by composers Johann Strauss II and Richard Strauss. Other music used is Ligeti's Lux Aeterna, the second movement of his Requiem and an <b>electronically</b> altered form of his Aventures, the last of which was also used without Ligeti's permission and is not listed in the film's credits.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and <b>electronically</b> controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1929, The Capitol Theatre, a major Jasper Avenue {{competitor}} to the Princess, {{closed for}} renovations promising {{a change that}} “will please every theatre-goer in Edmonton”. Almost three months later on March 27, the theatre reopened with dual Movietone and Vitaphone sound systems. The availability of <b>electronically</b> indexed articles from the Edmonton Journal has caused the proliferation of a research error in several local histories. These histories claim that the first talkie screened in Edmonton was The Canary Murder Case, {{and that it was}} screened at the Princess. In fact, the first talkie in Edmonton was Mother Knows Best, screened at the Capitol.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be <b>electronically</b> scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. <b>Electronically,</b> it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E
5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are <b>electronically</b> amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E
