50|$|Functional {{regions are}} usually {{understood}} to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011; Klapka et al., 2013; Smart, 1974). A <b>functional</b> <b>region</b> is not an abstract spatial concept, but {{to a certain extent}} it can be regarded as a reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. The <b>functional</b> <b>region</b> is conceived as a general concept while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only selfcontainment. The concept of self-containment remains the only crucial defining characteristic of a <b>functional</b> <b>region.</b> Nodal regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), or travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) are considered to be special instances of a general <b>functional</b> <b>region</b> that need to fulfil some specific conditions regarding, for instance, the character of the region-organising interaction or the presence of urban cores, (Halas et al., 2015).|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{discussed}} the impact of municipalities’ territorial changes of Slovenia on the modeling of <b>functional</b> <b>regions.</b> The analysis was performed for the period 1991 - 2010. The systems of <b>functional</b> <b>regions</b> were modeled {{with the help of}} labor mobility between the municipalities of Slovenia using Intramax method. Modeling was carried out for (a) the actual flows between the actual municipalities analyzed in 1991 and 2000 to 2010, and (b) the adjusted flows to basic municipalities in 1991 and 2000. Results of the analysis showed that municipalities’ territorial changes are affecting the design of <b>functional</b> <b>regions.</b> Like Openshaw (1984) established, we also did not detect any general rule to clarify the impact of territorial changes of spatial units at a lower level in the development of spatial units at a higher level. At the same time we find out that the formation of <b>functional</b> <b>regions</b> is significantly affected by the relative strength of labor mobility and the position of the municipality that has changed territorial. We divided Slovenia by 2 to 30 and 50 to 70 <b>functional</b> <b>regions</b> - given the scale of research and large-scale results in more detail we compared a division of the country into 2 to 20 <b>functional</b> <b>regions.</b> Comparative analysis of municipalities` territorial changes of Slovenia in the period 1991 - 2010 showed that in general there are minor differences in the structure and form of <b>functional</b> <b>regions,</b> rarely appear even larger differences.

5000|$|Ventrolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (VLPFC), {{part of the}} prefrontal cortex, {{is located on the}} {{inferior}} frontal gyrus, is bounded superiorly by the inferior frontal sulcus and inferiorly by the lateral sulcus, being attributed to the anatomical structures of Brodmann's area (BA) 47, 45 and 44 (considered the subregions of the VLPFC - the anterior, mid and posterior subregions). Specific functional distinctions have been presented between these three subregions. There are also specific functional differences in activity in the right and left VLPFC. Neuroimaging studies employing various cognitive tasks have shown that right VLPFC region is a critical substrate of control. At present, two prominent theories feature right VLPFC as a key <b>functional</b> <b>region.</b> From one perspective, right VLPFC is thought to {{play a critical role in}} motor inhibition, where control is engaged to stop or override motor responses. Alternatively, Corbetta and Shulman [...] have advanced the hypothesis that there are two distinct fronto-parietal networks involved in spatial attention, with right VLPFC being a component of a right-lateralized ventral attention network that governs reflexive reorienting. From this perspective, right lateral PFC, along with a region spanning right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the inferior parietal lobule, are engaged when abrupt onsets occur in the environment, suggesting that these regions are involved in re-orienting attention to perceptual events that occur outside the current focus of attention.Also, VLPFC is the end point of the Ventral Pathway (Stream) that brings information about the stimuli's characteristics.|$|E

For a given {{cognitive}} task such as language processing, {{the location}} of corresponding <b>functional</b> <b>regions</b> in the brain may vary across subjects relative to anatomy.

Individual fMRI data is represented as a weighted sum of these <b>functional</b> <b>regions</b> that undergo deformations. We demonstrate the proposed method on a language fMRI study.
