40|$|To my knowledge, no {{specimen}} of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee</b> (Contopus virens) {{has been reported}} from New Mexico, although a state occurrence was verified {{on the basis of}} a vocalizing bird recorded in Santa Fe County on 11 June 1988 (Hubbard 1988; identification confirmed by J. R. Travis). Based on that record, a few other reports of vocalizing birds, and the species ’ status in adjacent states (e. g., A. O. U. 1998), the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee</b> (henceforth EAWP) is probably a regular, but rare migrant in New Mexico. Additional verified occurrences, however, are needed to validate this species ’ status in the state, including tape recordings and collections of vocalizing birds. In addition, using the mensural criteria of Phillips et al. (1966), Pyle (1997 b), and as expanded in the present paper, existing New Mexico woodpewee specimens should be reexamined to determine if EAWP’s have been overlooked or misidentified as Western Wood-Pewees (C. sordidulus, henceforth WEWP). Toward this end, I have recently begun this process at the University of New Mexico Museum of Southwestern Biology (MSB), which has 38 study skins of this complex from the state. As a result, I have identified one specimen that is certainly an EAWP, plus another that is probably this species. In the process, I have also reevaluated, and hopefully improved, the mensural criteria by which specimens of this species can be distinguished from the closely similar WEWP. BACKGROUND As is well known, determining the specific identity of non-vocalizing birds of the EAWP/ WEWP complex is among the most difficult challenges in bird identification in North America (Phillips et al. 1966, Rising and Scheuler 1980, Pyle 1997 a,b). This is especially true in the field, but such difficulties also apply to museum specimens and birds captured for banding. Until recently, identification of wood-pewee species has been largely based on plumage and softpart characters, which will separate “typical ” specimens of each reasonably well. For example, in adults that are not excessively worn, the EAWP tends to be paler, more greenish (less brownish) on the...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2009 Many birds {{replenish}} {{energy reserves}} during semiannual migratory stopover periods in northeastern Costa Rica. Despite {{the importance of}} tropical staging areas to migrants, little {{research has focused on}} tropical stopover ecology. In this study, habitat use of 11 fall migrant species in northeastern Costa Rica were examined using bird banding data in association with a priori modeling methodologies. Frugivore capture rate and ripening of fruit peaked correspondingly in mid-October indicating a potential relationship between migrant arrival and the timing of ripe fruit availability. Top migrant habitat use models (encompassing a cumulative 95 % AICc weight) contained fruit or arthropod abundance for 73 % of the study species. Only Canada Warbler, Mourning Warbler and <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-pewee,</b> all insectivores, had top models that emphasized vegetative attributes without resource variables. Model results suggest that frugivorious migrants used fruit and insectivorous migrants used structure as cues for habitat use. Insectivores may have used habitat structure as a cue because of inherent difficulties associated with directly assessing arthropod availability.

40|$|Expert {{knowledge-based}} species-habitat {{relationships are}} used extensively to guide conservation planning, particularly when data are scarce. Purported relationships describe the initial state of knowledge, but are rarely tested. We assessed {{support in the}} data for suitability rankings of vegetation types based on expert knowledge for three terrestrial avian species in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States. Experts used published studies, natural history, survey data, and field experience to rank vegetation types as optimal, suitable, and marginal. We used single-season occupancy models, coupled with land cover and Breeding Bird Survey data, to examine the hypothesis that patterns of occupancy conformed to species-habitat suitability rankings purported by experts. Purported habitat suitability was validated for two of three species. As predicted for the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee</b> (Contopus virens) and Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla), occupancy was strongly influenced by vegetation types classified as "optimal habitat" by the species suitability rankings for nuthatches and wood-pewees. Contrary to predictions, Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) models that included vegetation types as covariates received similar support by the data as models without vegetation types. For all three species, occupancy was also related to sampling latitude. Our results suggest that covariates representing other habitat requirements might be necessary to model occurrence of generalist species like the woodpecker.

40|$|A habitat {{specific}} bird {{monitoring program}} was established on the Chequamegon, Chippewa, and Superior National Forests in 1991 and 1992 (Chequamegon National Forest). The program {{was designed to}} assess annual differences in bird relative abundance, and to attribute changes in numbers to habitat changes on the forest, or to natural fluctuations in bird numbers. Data collected from 1991 to 1994 or 1992 to 1994 have provided information on annual variation among guilds and individual species, and on relative densities of species within representative cover types on the Forests. A total of ten species (all Forests total) showed significant trends during the monitoring period.

40|$|General EcologyThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of forest succession on bird species composition and to test the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. We surveyed three forest plots – an early successional logging plot, a mid successional aspen plot, and a mature hardwood forest, in lower Northern Michigan where forests follow succession from aspen and beech to hardwood and pine. At each site we determined tree species, diameter at breast height, and distance from the point of our point-quarter center method along two transects. We also conducted bird surveys along the same transects, using the line transect method, and recorded all birds heard or seen. The red-eyed vireo and <b>eastern</b> <b>wood-pewee</b> were the most prevalent bird species at each of our three sites. Our comparisons of variables (tree density, H’, richness, and ground cover) between each forest plot were significant, indicating differences due to successional stages. Bird richness followed the predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, being highest in the mid successional plot. Our results for bird and tree diversity were entirely opposite the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, being lowest in the mid-successional plot. We found one significant positive correlation between bird species diversity and tree density. This result leads us to believe that the density of trees has the greatest effect on bird populations. We can conclude that each forest plot is at a different successional stage, and that bird richness is affected more by density of trees than the type, size, or understory composition...|$|E

40|$|CHAPTER 2. A COMPARISON OF TWO METHODS TO ESTIMATE BUTTERFLY DENSITY ABSTRACT The Pollard-Yates {{transect}} is {{a widely}} used method for sampling butterflies. Data from these traditional transects are analyzed to produce density estimates, which are then used to make inferences about population status or trends. A key assumption of the Pollard-Yates transect is that detection probability is 1. 0 out to a fixed distance (generally 2. 5 m {{on either side of}} a transect line), although this assumption has not been well tested with field data. Our objectives were to (1) estimate detection probabilities for butterflies with differing natural histories, (2) compare butterfly density estimates from Pollard-Yates line transects to those that incorporate distance sampling, and (3) offer advice on future butterfly sampling techniques to estimate population density. We conducted Pollard-Yates transects and distance-sampling transects at four grassland sites in central Iowa in 2014. For comparison to densities derived from Pollard-Yates transects (number of detections/total area sampled), we used Program DISTANCE to model detection probability (p) and estimate density (D) for eight butterfly species representing a range of life-history attributes. Although we noted little variation in detectability within 2. 5 m, we found that detection probability among species varied widely beyond 2. 5 m, with considerable variation apparent even within 5 m of the line. Such variation corresponded with size and natural-history attributes of each butterfly species. Program DISTANCE provided more robust density estimates at these greater distances, often considerably 3 ̆c 1. 0, particularly for smaller, cryptic species. Estimated detection probabilities ranged from 0. 53 to 0. 79 across the eight species. Thus, we recommend that researchers integrate distance sampling into butterfly sampling and monitoring, particularly for studies utilizing survey transects 3 ̆e 5 m wide. Narrower transects are more likely to meet the assumption of perfect detection, but this assumption was clearly violated for many species when transect widths exceeded 10 m. CHAPTER 3 : LANDSCAPE EFFECTS ON WOODLAND, SAVANNA, AND SCRUB-SHRUB BIRDS AT MULTIPLE SCALES IN IOWA ABSTRACT North American birds across multiple guilds continue to experience widespread declines. As a result, there has been increasing interest in defining habitat associations and the impact of landscape configuration on avian population dynamics, especially in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Using bird-survey data collected at 476 sites across Iowa during the Multiple Species Inventory and Monitoring (MSIM) program from 2007 - 2014, we estimated rates of occupancy, colonization, and extinction for 10 bird species of forest, savanna, and scrub-shrub habitats. We used presence-absence data in robust design occupancy models to estimate the effects of landscape-habitat metrics (edge density and percentage of landscape in grassland, agriculture, and woodland) at multiple scales (200 m, 500 m, 1000 m, and 5000 m). We also modeled the impact of weather covariates (temperature, cloud cover, and wind speed) on detection probability. Occupancy probability ranged from 0. 021 for Pileated Woodpecker to 0. 610 for <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee.</b> Colonization probability (mean = 0. 159) was estimated for all ten species and ranged from 0. 021 for Kentucky Warbler to 0. 508 for <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee</b> while extinction probability (mean = 0. 239) ranged from 0. 069 for <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee</b> to 0. 398 for Wood Thrush. Our results suggested that habitat associations and dynamics of site colonization and extinction varied by species and spatial scale. The contrasting positive impacts of woodland and negative effect of row-crop agriculture in the landscape were evident for multiple forest birds, particularly area-sensitive species, whereas savanna and scrub-shrub birds showed more species-specific results. Wind speed had a negative impact on detectability across guilds. Our results provide further insight into the habitat associations of birds spanning multiple habitats and serve as a means to enhance management and conservation of birds in highly fragmented landscapes. CHAPTER 4 : LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE EFFECTS ON BUTTERFLIES AT MULTIPLE SCALES IN IOWA Butterflies are declining around the globe, and they are particularly at risk in increasingly fragmented landscapes, such as those found in the Midwestern USA. Growing concern over these taxa, which are often regarded as proxies for other insects and the environment as a whole, has intensified interest in understanding the impacts of local and broad-scale features on butterfly population dynamics. Using butterfly-survey data collected at 314 sites across Iowa during the Multiple Species Inventory and Monitoring (MSIM) program 2007 - 2014, we estimated occupancy, colonization, and extinction probabilities for four butterfly species: giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes), summer azure (Celastrina neglecta), viceroy (Limenitis archippus), and pearl crescent (Phyciodes tharos). We used presence-absence data in robust design occupancy models to estimate the effects of microhabitat characteristics (litter depth, canopy cover, visual obstruction, and presence/absence of larval food plant), as well as landscape-habitat metrics (edge density and percentage of landscape in grassland, agriculture, and woodland) at multiple scales (100 m, 200 m, 500 m, 1000 m, and 5000 m). We also modeled the impact of weather covariates (temperature, cloud cover, and wind speed) on detection probability. Occupancy probability ranged from 0. 16 for P. cresphontes to 0. 73 for P. tharos. Likewise, colonization probability spanned from 0. 083 for P. cresphontes to 0. 409 for P. tharos and extinction probability ranged from 0. 141 for L. archippus to 0. 437 for C. neglecta. Landscape covariates surfaced in the top model on occupancy for all four species and on colonization rates for three species. Microhabitat variables impacted colonization for one species and extinction for two species; the direction of these effects were positive in each case. Woodland and grassland at differing spatial scales were each more prevalent than agriculture in the best models. Wind showed a strong negative impact on detection for two species, while percent cloud cover (negative effect) and temperature (positive effect) moderately impacted one species each. In what may be the first robust design occupancy study of butterflies in North America, we hope our findings will provide new insights into the life histories and conservation of butterflies in Iowa and beyond...|$|E

Several species also had new fall high counts, notably Cliff Swallow (30, 000 !) and Blue-winged Teal (14, 500 !). Stephen Dinsmore 2 ̆ 7 s diligent coverage of the Panhandle yielded no fewer than four first state records: Reddish Egret, Arctic Tern, Dusky Flycatcher (using mist-nettting, photography, and measurements!), and Black Rosy-Finch.

"May 2012 "Savanna and woodland habitats were historically prevalent in the midwestern United States, and efforts to restore these communities are growing. Better knowledge of the responses of breeding and non-breeding birds to restoration of savanna and woodland is needed to inform management. Our objective was to determine densities of common winter migrants and resident birds in savannas, woodlands, and non-managed forests in the Missouri Ozark Highlands. We estimated detection probabilities and densities using distance and time-removal models to obtain robust density estimates. We surveyed 561 points along 42 transects, with 10 -minute unlimited-radius point counts at 10 sites across the Missouri Ozarks December-February, 2009 - 2011. We fit distance models for 14 species and time-removal models for 6 species. Detection probabilities varied between distance and time-removal models and were affected by covariates such as observer, temperature, wind, vegetation type (savanna, woodland, and forest), and distance. Generally, restoration did not have a substantial impact on most winter birds, because density did not vary greatly for species across savanna, woodland, or non-managed forest. Dark-eyed Junco and Eastern Bluebird were the only species with considerably higher densities in restored savanna or woodland. We also studied the breeding demography of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee</b> (Contopus virens; hereafter Pewee), because it breeds across a gradient of wooded habitats ranging from open-canopy savanna, to woodland, to closed-canopy forest. Our objectives were to determine relationships between temporal factors and habitat structure and breeding demography and densities of the Pewee across the savanna-woodland-forest vegetation gradient during the breeding season. We determined nest success, clutch size, fledge rate, and breeding densities of the Pewee across the vegetation types and tested for effects of year, stage, ordinal date, nest height, percent stocking, and percent forest in a 10 -km radius. We conducted point counts at 906 points at 15 sites and estimated detection probability and density of Pewees using distance models {{to examine the effects of}} observer, type of detection, minutes since sunrise, habitat type, day of year, and distance on detection probability. We found and monitored 310 nests at 13 study sites across the Missouri Ozark Highlands from 2009 - 2011. Nest stage had a strong effect on daily survival rate. Period survival increased with decreasing forest cover in a 10 -km radius. Daily survival rate was 0. 977 (95 % CI: 0. 972, 0. 981), average clutch size was 2. 568 (95 % CI: 2. 456, 2. 679; n= 111), and average fledge rate was 2. 2 (95 % CI: 2. 034, 2. 366; n= 65) young per nest. Only 4 (1. 25 %) nests were parasitized by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Average feeding rate was 7. 89 visits per hour (n= 56), and frequency of parent visits to the nest was positively correlated with nestling age (p= 0. 049). We recorded 20 cases of double brooding in the Pewee, and some successful nests were reused for a second brood. Pewee densities were greater in woodland and forest vegetation types compared to savanna. In general, restoration did not have a substantial impact on Pewee nest survival, because survival did not vary greatly across savanna, woodland, or non-managed forest. Given the negative effect of stocking on clutch size, weak negative effect on nest survival, and lower densities in savanna, we suggest Pewees are well-adapted to intermediate stocking levels found in woodland...|$|E

Annual surveys have been conducted since 1991 in the Chippewa and Superior NF, and since 1992 in the Chequamegon NF. • Comprehensive surveys of vegetation structure were carried out on 93, 74, and 63 points in the Chequamegon, Chippewa, and Superior NFs, respectively, on over 50 observer-days of sampling. Monitoring personnel on the Chippewa and Superior NFs provided excellent assistance in the coordination and completion of this effort. • Trends in relative abundance were calculated for 72 bird species, including 57 species in the Chequamegon NF, 57 in the Chippewa NF, and 49 in the Superior NF. Thirty-nine species were also tested for a pooled trend by combining data from the three national forests. • A total of 163 species/national forest trends were calculated in 2006 (not including pooled trends), 68 (42 %) of which were significant (P ≤ 0. 05). Twenty three species increased significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) {{in at least one}} national forest and 24 species decreased.

Of the 158 species/national forest trends calculated in 2005, 19 (12 %) changed in 2006. • The percent of increasing species on each national forest ranged from 9 % in the Chequamegon NF, to 25 % in the Chippewa NF. The percent of decreasing species ranged from 20 % in the Superior NF, to 28 % in the Chequamegon NF. • The short-distance migrant guild showed highly significant declines on all national forests. Long-distance migrants also declined on all national forests. Permanent residents increased on the Chippewa and Superior NF and in the pooled NFs, but were stable on the Chequamegon NF. • The ground nesting guild showed highly significant declines on all national forests. Shrub/sub-canopy nesters increased on Chippewa NF, but were stable in Chequamegon and Superior NFs. Canopy nesters increased in Chquamegon NF and cavity-nesters increased in Chippwa and Superior NFs. All nesting guilds showed significant trends in the pooled NFs with increases in shrub/subcanopy-nesters and cavity-nesters and decreases in ground- and canopy-nesters. • The deciduous and mixed forest bird guilds declined on the Chequamegon and Superior NFs and the pooled NFs. The lowland coniferous forest bird guild declined on the Chippewa NF and the pooled NFs. The early-successional bird guild increased on the Chippewa NF and the upland coniferous bird guild increased on the Chippewa and Superior NFs {{as well as in the}} pooled NFs. • Evidence from previous regional studies have demonstrated greater nest predation rates on ground nests near forest/clearcut edges, as well as a significant increase in the creation of forest edges in recent years. Increasing amounts of forest edge and nest predation may be having negative effects on declining ground-nesters such as the Winter Wren, Veery, Hermit Thrush, Ovenbird, and White-throated Sparrow. • Of the 1274 survey sites on the three national forests, 15. 5 % have been at least partially harvested since the beginning of monitoring, which is about 1 % a year. This harvest rate is comparable to the documented 4. 8 % change from mature forest to early-successional types on federally managed forest lands in northeastern Minnesota between 1990 and 1995 (i. e., ~ 1 % annual change). Thus, it appears that management activities on our sample sites are representative of the national forests as a whole, and that the trends we are documenting are probably occurring across the regional landscape. • Many of the declining trends that we have detected appear to be consistent across years instead of being due to a few years with very low or high abundance. One of the main goals of this monitoring program is to identify potential declines of forest bird species, especially for species of conservation concern such as the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Wood-Pewee,</b> Winter Wren, Hermit Thrush, Ovenbird, and White-throated Sparrow. The declines observed over the past years for common species such as the Ovenbird and White-throated Sparrow are a continuing concern and special management consideration should be given to these species...|$|E
