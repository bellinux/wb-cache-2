40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of the {{business}} press in disseminating management earnings guidance news to capital market participants. Using a unique sample of over 55, 000 articles that relate specifically to management guidance, I find that 48 percent of all <b>guidance</b> receives <b>coverage</b> in the business press, with substantial within-firm variation. I then identify firm and guidance characteristics that are associated with the likelihood that <b>guidance</b> receives press <b>coverage.</b> Controlling for the endogeneity of press coverage, I find that dissemination in the press has {{a significant impact on the}} market reaction to guidance, and this effect is economically large. This study is the first to provide evidence that there is systematic variation in the extent to which guidance news is disseminated through the press, and that this variation has a significant effect on the market consequences of guidance...|$|R

40|$|A novel Backus-Naur-form- (BNF-) based {{method to}} {{automatically}} generate test programs from simple to complex ones for advanced microprocessors {{is presented in}} this paper. We use X 86 ar-chitecture to illustrate our design method. Our method is equally applicable to other processor architectures by redefining BNF production rules. Design issues for an automatic program gener-ator (APG) are first outlined. We have resolved the design issues and implemented the APG by a top-down recursive descent parsing method which was originated from compiler design. Our APG can produce not only random test programs but also a sequence of instructions for a specific module to be tested by specifying a user menu-driven file. In addition, test programs generated by our APG have the features of no infinite loop, not entering illegal states, controllable data dependency, flex-ible program size, and data cache testable. Our method {{has been shown to}} be efficient and feasible for the development of an APG compared with other approaches. We have also developed a coverage tool to integrate with the APG. Experimental evaluation of the generated test programs indicates that our APG, with the <b>guidance</b> of the <b>coverage</b> tool, only needs to generate a small number of test programs to sustain high coverage...|$|R

Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series studies, conducted in PHC in low- and middle-income countries. Supervision includes site visits from a central level of the health system, plus at least one supervisory activity. We excluded studies aimed solely at improving the clinical skills of PHC workers. Data collection and analysis We extracted data using a predefined form and assessed for risk of bias using the EPOC risk of bias criteria. Data are presented in a narrative way without pooling the effects on the outcomes as studies and outcomes were diverse. Main results Nine studies met the inclusion criteria: three compared supervision with no supervision, five compared enhanced supervision with routine supervision, and one study compared less intensive supervision with routine supervision. Most outcomes were scores relating to providers’ practice, knowledge and provider or user satisfaction. The majority of the outcomes were measured within nine months after the interventions were introduced. In two studies comparing supervision with no supervision, small benefits on provider practice and knowledge were found. For methods of enhancing supervision, we identified five studies, and two studies of frequent supportive supervision demonstrated small benefits on workers performance. The one study examining the impact of less intensive supervision found no evidence that reducing the frequency of visits had any effect on the utilisation of services. The GRADE evidence quality for all comparisons and outcomes was "low" or "very low". Authors' conclusions It is uncertain whether supervision has a substantive, positive effect on the quality of primary health care in low- and middle-income countries. The long term effectiveness of supervision is unknown...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{collective}} instrumental case study design, this study explored, described, and analyzed how three U. S. and three international graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) {{at a major}} Midwestern state university perceived their instructional roles and engaged in classroom management in their classes during the Fall Semester of an academic year. ^ The major sources of information for this collective case study consisted of semi-structured interviews, participant observations, fieldnotes, and document review. Themes {{that emerged from the}} case data were first examined within individual cases and then across all the cases. ^ This study generated seven major findings. First, GTAs varied their instructional roles according to the nature of courses, course materials, and student needs. Second, GTAs experienced problems in their classroom instruction, such as lack of commitment and disengagement on the part of students. Third, when handling classroom problems, U. S. GTAs focused more on communication skills, whereas international GTAs emphasized prevention and understanding students. Fourth, U. S. GTAs tended to enhance classroom communication by the proficient use of the language and the creation of an interactive classroom via group work and role playing. In contrast, international GTAs were likely to use handouts, visual aids, computer solutions, and printouts. Fifth, GTAs relied on their supervisors for <b>guidance</b> in course <b>coverage,</b> potential problems, and institutional expectations. Six, GTAs found GTA experience beneficial in providing career training, experience, job satisfaction, and opportunities of learning from students. However, they found it time-consuming to assume GTA responsibilities and challenging to grade exams, design a syllabus, or provide better answers to students 2 ̆ 7 questions. Finally, GTAs 2 ̆ 7 supervisors perceived a need to train GTAs on generic issues of teaching and help GTAs socialize to their roles and responsibilities and grow professionally. ^ With the scarcity of literature on GTAs 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of instructional and classroom management issues, this study provided specific information by identifying themes and frameworks that could be examined in future cases. Recommendations for GTA training and implications for future research were included. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from BMJ Publishing Group via the DOI in this record. OBJECTIVE: This study reviewed the news media coverage of statins, seeking to identify specific trends or differences in viewpoint between media outlets and examine common themes. DESIGN: The study is a content analysis of the frequency {{and content of the}} reporting of statins in a selection of the British newsprint media. It involved an assessment of the number, timing and thematic content of articles followed by a discourse analysis examining the underlying narratives. The sample was the output of four UK newspapers, covering a broad-spectrum readership, over a six month timeframe 1 October 2013 to 31 March 2014. RESULTS: A total of 67 articles included reference to statins. The majority (39, 58 %) were reporting or responding to publication of a clinical study. The ratio of negative to positive coverage was greater than 2 : 1 overall. In the more politically right-leaning newspapers, 67 % of coverage was predominantly negative (30 / 45 articles); 32 % in the more left-leaning papers (7 / 22 articles). Common themes were the perceived 'medicalisation' of the population; the balance between lifestyle modification and medical treatments in the primary prevention of heart disease; side effects and effectiveness of statins; pharmaceutical sponsorship and implications for the reliability of evidence; trust between the public and government, institutions, research organisations and the medical profession. CONCLUSIONS: Newsprint media coverage of statins was substantially influenced by the publication of national <b>guidance</b> and by <b>coverage</b> in the medical journals of clinical studies and comment. Statins received a predominantly negative portrayal, notably in the more right-leaning press. There were shared themes: concern about the balance between medication and lifestyle change in the primary prevention of heart disease; the adverse effects of treatment; and a questioning of the reliability of evidence from research institutions, scientists and clinicians in the light of their potential allegiances and funding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH), and the European Union (EU) have {{encouraged}} countries to organize occupational health services (OHS) for all working people {{irrespective of the}} sector of economy, size of enterprise or mode of employment of the worker. The objective {{of this study was}} to survey the status of OHS in a sample of countries from all continents. Methods A questionnaire focusing on the main aspects of OHS was developed on the basis of ILO Convention No. 161 and several other questionnaire surveys used in various target groups of OHS. The questionnaire was sent to 58 key informants: ICOH National Secretaries. Results A total of 49 National Secretaries responded (response rate 84. 5 %), from countries that employ 70 % of the total world labour force. The majority of the respondent countries, 67 %, had drawn up an OHS policy and implement it with the help of national occupational safety and health (OSH) authorities, institutes of occupational health or respective bodies, universities, and professional associations. Multidisciplinary expert OHS resources were available in the majority (82 %) of countries, but varied widely in quantitative terms. The average OHS coverage of workers was 24. 8 %, with wide variation between countries. In over two thirds (69 %) of the countries, the content of services was mixed, consisting of preventive and curative services, and in 29 % preventive only. OHS financing was organized according to a mixed model among 63 % and by employers only among 33 % of the respondents. Conclusions The majority of countries have drawn up policies, strategies and programmes for OHS. The infrastructures and institutional and human resources for the implementation of strategies, however, remain insufficient in the majority of countries (implementation gap). Qualitatively, the content and multidisciplinary nature of OHS corresponds to international <b>guidance,</b> but the <b>coverage,</b> comprehensiveness and content of services remain largely incomplete due to a lack of infrastructure and shortage of multiprofessional human resources (capacity gap). The estimated coverage of services in the study group was low; only a quarter of the total employed population (coverage gap) ...|$|R
