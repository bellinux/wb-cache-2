50|$|Fahrenheit {{proposed}} his {{temperature scale}} in 1724, basing it on two reference points of temperature. In his initial scale (which {{is not the}} final Fahrenheit scale), the zero point is determined by placing the thermometer {{in a mixture of}} ice, water, and ammonium chloride (salis Armoniaci). This is a <b>frigorific</b> mixture which stabilizes its temperature automatically: that stable temperature was defined as 0 °F (−17.78 °C). The second point, 96 degrees, was approximately the human body's temperature (sanguine hominis sani, the blood of a healthy man).|$|E
50|$|Other {{fixed points}} {{used in the}} past are the body {{temperature}} (of a healthy adult male) which was originally used by Fahrenheit as his upper fixed point (96 F to be a number divisible by 12) and the lowest temperature given by a mixture of salt and ice, which was originally the definition of 0 F. (This {{is an example of a}} <b>Frigorific</b> mixture). As body temperature varies, the Fahrenheit scale was later changed to use an upper fixed point of boiling water at 212 F.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{use of a}} <b>frigorific</b> mixture is to melt ice. When {{ammonium}} chloride salt is placed on ice when the ambient temperature is greater than −17.8 °C (0 °F), the salt melts some of the ice and the temperature drops to −17.8 °C. Since the mixture is colder than the ambient temperature, heat is absorbed and the temperature rises. This causes the salt to melt more of the ice to drive the temperature down again. The process continues until all of the salt is dissolved in the melted ice. If there is enough salt present, then all of the ice will be melted.|$|E
50|$|According to Fahrenheit's 1724 article, he {{determined}} his scale {{by reference}} to three fixed points of temperature. The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a <b>frigorific</b> mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride (a salt), and {{waiting for it to}} reach equilibrium. The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point. The thermometer's reading there was taken as 0 °F. The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface. This was assigned as 32 °F. The third calibration point, taken as 96 °F, was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{existence}} of frigorigic mixtures {{can be viewed}} as a consequence of the Gibbs phase rule, which describes the relationship at equilibrium between the number of components, the number of coexisting phases, and the number of degrees of freedom permitted by the conditions of heterogeneous equilibrium. Specifically, at constant atmospheric pressure, in a system containing [...] linearly independent chemical components, if +1 phases are specified to be present in equilibrium, then the system is fully determined (there are no degrees of freedom). That is, the temperature and the compositions of all phases are determined. Thus, in for example the chemical system H2O-NaCl, which has two components, the simultaneous presence of the three phases liquid, ice, and hydrohalite can only exist at atmospheric pressure at the unique temperature of -21.2 °C. The approach to equilibrium of a <b>frigorific</b> mixture involves spontaneous temperature change driven by the conversion of latent heat into sensible heat as the phase proportions adjust to accommodate the decrease in thermodynamic potential associated with the approach to equilibrium.|$|E

The conventional system, used as reference, is largely employed in cooling fish industry.

The cold water is supplied by ammonia-water absorption system integrated to the conventional compression system. The calorific energy supplied is obtained from waste exceeding of the fish meal production thus the energy delivered to the integrated refrigeration system is considered of zero cost.

O m??todo utilizado foi o de estudo de caso ??nico, tendo como unidade de an??lise a cadeia da pecu??ria de corte do estado de Goi??s. A pesquisa ocorreu em duas etapas, uma explorat??ria e outra descritiva. Na etapa explorat??ria buscou-se familiaridade com o tema por meio de an??lise de estudos j?? publicados e pela realiza????o de oito (8) entrevistas semiestruturas com representantes das entidades de classe, certificadoras e fornecedores de TIMS. Na etapa descritiva realizou-se treze (13) entrevistas semi-estruturadas com representantes de onze empresas pertencentes aos elos (cria, recria, engorda, frigor??fico e trader) da cadeia para compreender o processo de ado????o ou n??o das TIMS. A an??lise dos resultados aponta que o frigor??fico ?? o elo mais forte dentro da cadeia. Que a falta de coordena????o da cadeia ?? um dificultador tanto para a rastreabilidade quanto para a utiliza????o de TIMS. Para esta cadeia, o entendimento de tecnologia compreende principalmente t??cnicas de manejo, irriga????o, melhoramento gen??tico e alimenta????o, isto ??, embora presentes, as TIMS n??o s??o percebidas como tecnologias priorit??rias para o funcionamento da cadeia. Problemas de infraestrutura b??sica, como energia el??trica e telecomunica????es, bem como a compreens??o das necessidades tecnol??gicas e informacionais das propriedades rurais, dificultam a implanta????o e ado????o das TIMS. A falta de regulamenta????o quanto ao uso de dispositivos eletr??nicos retarda a aplica????o dos brincos de RFID para garantir a rastreabilidade. O custo da tecnologia e a baixa qualifica????o da m??o de obra s??o tamb??m apontados como outros dificultadores de ado????o. Observa-se que ao mesmo tempo em que o sistema de rastreabilidade brasileiro estabelece rigorosos controles na operacionaliza????o, por outro lado d?? margem para controle tardio do rebanho. Percebe-se que a rastreabilidade ?? mais intensamente trabalhada no elo de engorda, elo mais pr??ximo ao frigor??fico. Tamb??m observa-se que o frigor??fico, por ser o elo com maior ???poder??? na cadeia e aquele que tem necessidade direta da rastreabilidade para atender ao mercado europeu exige a rastreabilidade, por??m os custos dessa rastreabilidade s??o de exclusiva responsabilidade dos pecuaristas. O pr??mio europa vem sendo reduzido de forma gradativa, desestimulando muitos produtores a manterem-se no sistema de rastreabilidade (SISBOV). No entanto, verificou-se que, al??m do seu poss??vel uso para rastreabilidade, e apesar de alguns fatores dificultadores para ado????o, a TI e as TIMS trazem diversos benef??cios para a gest??o das organiza????es na cadeia pesquisada, tais como: melhor controle de estoque, de custos individuais, de volume e tempo da produ????o, de previs??o de vendas, de produtividade dos funcion??rios, redu????o nos erros de lan??amento, aumento da efici??ncia do manejo, seguran??a para o acionista e melhoria na qualidade e disponibilidade da informa????o. The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the use of Wireless and Mobile Information Technology (TIMs, its acronym in Portuguese) in {{different}} links of the bovine chain in the state of Goi??s and to identify the challenges and opportunities to use these technologies in the studied context. The method used was a single case study that has as unity of analysis the chain of beef cattle in the state of Goi??s. The research was conducted in two stages: one exploratory and one descriptive. At the exploratory stage the objective was to become familiar with the topic through the analysis of published studies and through the completion of eight (8) semi-structured interviews with professional associations, certifying agencies and TIMs suppliers representatives. The descriptive stage held thirteen (13) semi-structured interviews with representatives from eleven companies belonging to the mentioned chain links (raising, breeding, fattening, <b>frigorific</b> and trader) in order to understand the process of the adoption or not adoption of TIMs. The analysis of the results points that <b>frigorific</b> is the strongest link of the chain. The lack of coordination is an impediment for both traceability and for the use of TIMs. For this chain, the understanding of the technology embraces mainly the management, irrigation, breeding and feeding techniques, this means that although TIMs are present, they are not perceived as priority technologies for the chain operation. Problems of basic infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunications, and the understanding of technological and information needs of rural properties hinder the implementation and adoption of TIMs. The lack of regulation regarding the use of electronic devices slows the application of the RFID earrings in order to ensure traceability. The technology costs and the low qualification of the workforce are also mentioned as hindering to adopt the technology. It is observed that at the same time the Brazilian traceability system establishes strict controls on the operation it gives room for late cattle control. One can notice that traceability is intensively worked at the fattening link, which is closer to the <b>frigorific.</b> It is also noticed that the <b>frigorific,</b> for being the most ???powerful??? link in the chain and the one with greater needs of the traceability to attend the European market demands the traceability, however the costs of this traceability are farmers??? responsibility. The Europe award has been reduced gradually, discouraging many farmers to remain in the traceability system (SISBOV). However, it was confirmed that besides its possible use to traceability, and despite some difficulties to adopt the technology, Information Technology and TIMs bring several benefits to the organizations management, such as better control of: inventory individual costs, time production volume, sales forecast, employee productivity, reduction in entry errors, increased efficiency of management, security for stockholders, and the improvement of quality and availability of the information...|$|E

Em setembro de 1950, no contexto das eleições para Presidente da República, ocorreu um episódio dramático na cidade de Livramento mais especificamente, no Parque Internacional, limítrofe com Rivera, cidade uruguaia. O Partido Comunista estava na ilegalidade e na clandestinidade e a polícia avisara que não permitiria a atuação de seus militantes mais claramente, a pichação de nomes de candidatos defendidos pelo PCB. Um grupo de comunistas, no entanto, decide fazer pichações na cidade e é reprimido. A forma de repressão se dá com uso de armas de fogo e quatro militantes são mortos. O presente trabalho visou analisar as lutas operárias e comunistas em Livramento, tomando esse episódio ocorrido na cidade, em setembro de 1950, como emblemático da luta social e política no período, O trabalho tratou da relação entre a atividade sindical dos grevistas do frigorifico Armour e a chacina destes operários, já como militantes do PCB, em 1950, no Parque Internacional. A política anticomunista do Presidente Eurico Gaspar Dutra (1946 - 1951) e o seu alinhamento com a Doutrina Truman, defendida pelos Estados Unidos, são vertentes importantes para a explicação da conjuntura vivida pelos comunistas gaúchos no ano de 1950. O episódio da morte dos comunistas ficou conhecido como A chacina dos quatro As, pois os quatro comunistas mortos tinham seus nomes iniciados com a letra A: Ari, Abdias, Aladim e Aristides. The {{purpose of}} this master {{dissertation}} is to highlight the historical role {{of the working class}} on the border of Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay, specifically in the town of Santana do Livramento. In September 1950, in the context of elections for president, there was a dramatic episode in the town of Livramento - more specifically, at International Park, in the border with Rivera, Uruguayan city. The Communist Party was in illegality and in clandestinity and the police had warned them that they would not allowed actions of its militants - more clearly, they would not allowed to graffiti the candidates' names defended by the PCB. A group of communists, however, has decided to do some graffiti in the city and it is repressed. The form of repression occurs with the use of firearms and four militants were killed. This study aims to analyze the workers' struggle and the communists in Livramento, taking this episode, occurred in the city in September 1950, as emblematic of social and political struggle in the period. This paper focuses on the relationship between the union activities of the strikers from Armour&# 8223;s <b>frigorific</b> and the slaughter of these workers, as activists from PCB in 1950, at International Park.

The challenge is to manage this system from an environmental view, since this activity produces significant quantities of waste with high pollution load. On the other hand, this material has great potential for power generation, because, if properly treated produces methane. Thus, the main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential of replacing conventional sources of energy by methane generated by swine in the Rio Marreco hydrographic basin. The squad installed in the watershed is 95, 129, divided into 121 farms, with 116 UCT and 5 UPL systems, with a production of approximately 12, 905 mÂ/day. The development of the bioenergy project considered the replacement of the wood used as a source of thermal energy in the <b>frigorific</b> of Sadia S. A. located in Toledo/PR, where the monthly consumption of 2, 820, 000 kilograms of wood chips can be replaced by methane at 54. 7 %. Measured properties presented good economic indicators of the point of the investment by the energy producers, which varied according to the breeding animal. The project implementation from the perspective of the consumer of energy also showed positive viability by NPV and IRR indicators, with the balance of R$ 1, 749, 180 saved annually. The results showed that there are viable possibilities for the use of methane generated by swine manure and how this material is managed, considering an entire watershed or just part of it as a planning unit, influences the total volume of methane produced and, thus, the identification of potential consumers...|$|E
40|$|Em um matadouro-frigorífico de suínos, no Estado de São Paulo sob Serviço de Inspeção Federal, avaliou-se as condições higiênico-sanitárias de 240 meias-carcaças realizando a contagem de coliformes totais, de Escherichia coli e a pesquisa da presença de Salmonella spp em três regiões pré-definidas (face lateral externa do pernil, do peito e da papada), após o abate e depois do resfriamento; e analisou-se as dificuldades e facilidades na aplicação de uma Lista de Verificação de procedimentos de abate, adaptada a partir daquela utilizada pelo Serviço de Inspeção Federal, propondo-se uma nova. Vinte e uma Listas de Verificação foram preenchidas ao longo de 12 meses de estudo. Obteve-se coliformes totais em 98, 7 % (711 / 720) e Escherichia coli em 90, 7 % (653 / 720) das meias-carcaças analisadas e houve aumento do número de coliformes e Escherichia coli após o resfriamento das meias-carcaças. Salmonella spp esteve presente nas carcaças após o abate e depois do resfriamento numa freqüência de ocorrência de 5, 4 % (13 / 240). Concluiu-se que para se alcançar qualidade higiênica e higiênico-sanitária aceitável em carcaças de suínos faz-se necessário padronizar os procedimentos que envolvem o abate desde o recebimento dos animais até o resfriamento das meias-carcaças, incluindo-se o funcionamento e uso da câmara frigorífica, e para tanto implementar boas práticas formalizadas é o primeiro passo. A aplicação de uma Lista de Verificação mostrou-se um instrumento útil para se avaliar procedimentos de abate e permite identificar, de forma organizada, não-conformidades, implementar medidas corretivas e criar o histórico do controle da qualidade higiênico-sanitária do estabelecimento. In one swine {{slaughterhouse}} in the State of São Paulo {{under the}} Federal Inspection Service the hygienic and the sanitary conditions of 240 swine half-carcasses {{have been evaluated}} by the counting of total coliforms and Escherichia coli and the research of presence of Salmonella spp in three predetermined regions (external lateral face of the ham, the belly and the neck), after the slaughter and after the cooling; and analyzed the facilities and the difficulties on {{the application of a}} Check-list of procedures in slaughter, based on that one used by the Service of Federal Inspection in the State of São Paulo, purposing a new Check-list. Twenty one Check-lists of good manufacturing practices (GMP) have been filled throughout 12 months of study. In the present work, it has been achieved coliforms in 98, 7 % (711 / 720) e Escherichia coli in 90, 7 % (653 / 720) of the half-carcasses assessed and the number of coliforms and Escherichia coli have increased after the cooling process. The Salmonella spp was present in the carcasses after the slaughter and after the cooling and the frequency of occurrence was of 5, 4 % (13 / 240). In conclusion, to acquire acceptable hygienic and sanitary quality in swine carcasses in a slaughterhouse it becomes necessary to standardize the procedures that involve the slaughter since the receiving of the animals until the cooling of the half-carcasses, including the working {{and the use of the}} <b>frigorific</b> room; in this way the implementation of GMP in the plant is the first step to be adopted. The resource of GMP Check-list shows itself as a useful instrument to verify the procedures of swine slaughter; it allows the organized identification of non-conformities, to implement corrective actions and creates a description registered on the performance of the establishment...|$|E
