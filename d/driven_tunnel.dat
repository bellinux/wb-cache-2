40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} of a quantum mechanical description of current <b>driven</b> <b>tunnel</b> junctions. Based on this description we predict several new effects. These effects can be observed for k,T i E, < e*/C, where E, = h/RC for a normal tunnel junction and ET = Ft. Ts / 2 e for a Josephson junction, C being the junction’s capacitance. Recent advances in the fabrication of small tunnel junctions [l] {{made it possible to}} attain the limit kn T < e 2 /C. In this letter we predict possible new observ-able effects in this limit. We base our prediction on a new quantum mechanical approach we propose for describing a current <b>driven</b> <b>tunnel</b> junction. Under-lying our description is the observation that the re-sponse of an open system driven by a current source, I(t), is equivalent to that of a closed system (i. e., open-ended junction) subject to an external time-de-pendent voltage bias A(t), where A(t) = 1 (t). We consider both a current biased Josephson junc-tion (JJ) and a normal tunnel junction (NJT), and predict the following effects: 1. Voltage oscillations in dc current biased junctions (CBJ), both JJs and NTJs, with no dc voltage. 2. Steps of dc voltage in a CBJ in the presence of microwave radiation (“inverse Shapiro steps”), for a discrete set of values of the dc current such that I/q = (n/m) f, where 4 is the elementary charge that tunnels and f is the frequency of the radiation. 3.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach which combines a vortex-lattice method (MPUF- 3 A) with a RANS solver (FLUENT) for the unsteady flow analysis {{to predict the}} effective wake of rim <b>driven</b> <b>tunnel</b> thrusters.

The effect of the viscosity on the effective wake is evaluated through MPUF- 3 A/FLUENT coupling. The results of the coupling method MPUF- 3 A/FLUENT are validated with those calculated from PROPCAV and those measured in the experiments. The results of MPUF- 3 A/FLUENT and PROPCAV show that the coupling method can predict reasonable forces.

40|$|The ongoing {{development}} in the world's urban areas inevitably leads {{to the construction of}} structures in close proximity to already driven tunnels. Care should be taken to ensure that construction is carried out without damaging the tunnels or any other adjacent or overlying infrastructure. Considerable research has been undertaken for the case of a single tunnel where empirical methods for predicting tunnel induced deformations are applicable. For more complex geometries, however, empirical methods fail to make accurate predictions since they do not account for the soil- tunnel-structure interaction mechanism. The finite element method (FEM) appears to be a solution to this prediction problem, however many difficulties in its use remain. The aim of this thesis is to investigate and validate tools for numerical modelling of tunnelling related interactions in soft ground. The generation of a suitable mesh is a major overhead in the use of three dimensional (3 -D) FE analyses. Preparing and checking a complex tunnelling mesh can be extremely time consuming. Thus, a parametric scheme for automated, efficient and robust 3 -D mesh generation was part of this project. FE analyses of a single <b>driven</b> <b>tunnel</b> are made for comparison with empirical methods on the direction of the surface displacement vectors. Another parametric study of twin tunnelling schemes is carried out in both 2 -D and 3 -D using various FE packages. The objective is to focus on the effects of surface loading on the tunnels themselves in terms of deformations and bending moments and study the changing effect as tunnel layout is altered. The results obtained highly depend on the constitutive relations assumed, the soil properties and the discretization employed. Further to this the predictions show areas of general agreement and disagreement between the different types of analyses and FE packages used, indicating that accurate numerical modelling of this problem remains difficult and requires care.

40|$|Combining several {{different}} investigation methods within one project {{is something that}} is done on a daily basis. This master thesis analyses results from a project where methods that are relatively unusually within the geotechnical society are combined. The sounding program was also almost entirely executed on water. In the thesis geotechnical investigations performed by Vectura Consulting for the City Link project are evaluated. The City Link project is a TBM <b>driven</b> <b>tunnel</b> under the city of Stockholm, and the investigations was performed on the behalf of “Svenska kraftnät”. The thesis is performed on behalf of Vectura in Sundsvall where Per Nilsson has driven the issues which are the subject of this thesis. The methods used in the project has been soil-rock sounding, reflection- and refraction seismic, MWD-guided down the hole drill (DTH) and core drilling sampling. Every sounding except the core drilling sampling has been conducted on water. The core drilling sampling has in this thesis been infringed for the other methods. Complications and solutions regarding the performed sounding on water were found during the project, which resulted in a list of recommendations for performing sounding on water. Soil-rock sounding has been linked to the performed refraction seismic to investigate whether the seismic inferred rock quality could be shown in the soil-rock sounding. The analysis shows that it strongly tends to be possible, although more studies have to be done to confirm this theory. The study also shows the importance of having a seismic survey within a large scale geotechnical investigation where the bedrock level is of interest. MWD-guided down the hole drill is, within the geotechnical society, an uncommon method for rock-sounding. In this project the DTH were carried out on the sounding points where soil-rock sounding was estimated not to be possible to use, because of too large sounding depths. The aim of the investigations where to find the bedrock surface, which it also did. Further analysis also indicates that the rock quality in relation to all executed DTH soundings within the project could be distinguished. For both soil-rock sounding and DTH the method to integrate the sink rate and to form an index has given a simpler graphical interpretation of the soundings. The index which is formed by the driving force and the sink rate has also, and can be used to interpret the rock quality. The study also showed some significance regarding the weight of the sounding rods, especially for rock-soil sounding. Validerat; 20130609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho de doutoramento é um estudo de propriedades físicas e aspectos estruturais de filmes de óxidos e heteroestruturas multiferróicas, englobando técnicas de caracterização do nível macroscópico ao microscópico. O objectivo {{principal}} é a compreensão de novas heteroestruturas epitaxiais multifuncionais e as suas interfaces para junções de túnel magnetoelétricas e filtros de spin. Os principais materiais em estudo foram manganitas à base de La dopadas com iões divalentes (ba, Sr), apresentando efeito magnetoelétrico, sendo preparadas em diferentes substratos e diferentes técnicas de crescimento, optimizadas para epitaxia e qualidade de interface. O estudo combinado de propriedades eléctricas e magnéticas permitiu estabelecer as condições necessárias para a aplicação dos materiais multiferróicos em estudo, por técnicas experimentais apresentadas neste trabalho. O trabalho consistiu no estudo sistemático de microestrutura de filmes finos de La 0 : 7 Sr 0 : 3 MnO 3 em substratos de SrTiO 3, preparados por {{pulsed laser}} deposition, o filme fino de La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 e a heteroestrutura La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 em substrato de Al 2 O 3, e filme fino de La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3, BaTiO 3 e heteroestrutura de La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 em substrato de Si, preparado por RF magnetron sputtering. A caracterização estrutural das amostras foi feita principalmente por difracção de raio-X (XRD) convencional e de alta resolução e Microscopia de Transmissão de Alta Resolução (HRTEM). A composição química foi analisada por Electron Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) e energy filtered {{transmission electron microscopy}} (EFTEM). As medidas de magnetização forram realizada com a um magnetómetro {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID). A análise da topografia e efeitos locais foi realizada por microscopia de varimento de ponta usando microscopia da Força Atómica (AFM) e de resposta piezoeléctronica (PFM). Os resultados mostram claramente uma evolução da microestrutura dos filmes finos de La 0 : 7 Sr 0 : 3 MnO 3, á medida que aumenta a sua espessura, passando de uma estrutura policristalina no filme mais fino (13. 5 nm) a colunar inclinado (45 nm e 200 nm), a uma estrutura ramificada no filme mais espesso (320 nm). A alteração na estrutura do filme é devida à tensão pelo substrato e deformação da estrutura nas etapas iniciais de crescimento, onde se detectaram fronteiras anti-phase e maclas. A evolução da estrutura modificou as propriedades magnéticas dos filmes a baixa temperatura (abaixo da temperatura de transição estrutural do substrato de SrTiO 3), mostrando magnetização em excesso e defeito, para espessuras abaixo e acima de 100 nm, respectivamente. Análises STEM-EELS e EFTEM mostraram a diferença em composição elementar dos filmes perto das fronteiras e na interface com o substrato. No âmbito do plano de trabalhos de doutoramento, o segundo substrato consiste em estudar as propriedades físicas e estruturais de filmes finos de La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 e heteroestruturas La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 em substratos de Al 2 O 3, revelando estruturas altamente orientadas. A razão La/Ba do filme e heteroestrutura é drasticamente diferente do alvo providenciado, La 0 : 7 Ba 0 : 3 MnO 3, como provado por XRD, RBS e transições de fase magnéticas. As propriedades magnéticas e eléctricas das estruturas mostraram uma forte dependência na cristalinidade do filme e da heteroestrutura. A parte final do trabalho é dedicada aos filmes de La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3, BaTiO 3 e a heteroestrutura de La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 em substrato de Si, que em comparação com as estruturas em substrato de ALO, provaram o efeito da cristalinidade nas propriedades magnéticas, eléctricas e de magneto-resistência do filme e heteroestrutura. Foi mostrado que um grau superior de cristalinidade leva a uma mais elevada magnetização, reduzindo a resistividade das estruturas. Pela primeira vez, um estudo de deformação de topografia por aplicação de uma tensão dc externa foi feito num filme fino de BaTiO 3 em Si, usando uma técnica de poling num microscópio de força piezoresponse. Os resultados mostraram a capacidade de uma modificação controlada da superfície, por aplicação de uma voltagem externa nointervalo 14 V < Vapp < 20 V. Abaixo destes valores, não se observou alguma deformação na topografia, enquanto acima deste intervalo, a 30 V, a superfície foi completamente danificada. A mudança topográfica produzida mostrou estabilidade no tempo, onde após a aplicação de 20 V, a área modificada alcançou 83 % da altura as-poled (9 nm) em 90 minutos, a 7, 4 nm. A resposta assimétrica de piezoresponse da área poled foi associada à existência de um campo eléctrico interno na amostra, que foi também provado através de medidas de espectroscopia de switching no filme fino. A heteroestrutura no substrato de Si mostraram o mesmo fenómeno que a mono-camada de BaTiO 3, onde o arranjo de heteroestrutura realça o efeito de voltagem aplicada na topografia. Aplicando 10 V, a estrutura da superfície foi alterada na heteroestrutura e houve uma modificação visível da camada de BaTiO 3, alterando também a topografia da camada superior de La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3. This present PhD work made a study of structural aspects and physical properties of the oxide films and multiferroic heterostructures, encompassing the techniques from macroscopic level to microscopic description. The understanding of novel multifunctional epitaxial heterostructures and their interfaces for magneto-electrically <b>driven</b> <b>tunnel</b> junctions and spin-filters is the central objective. The main materials in study were La based doped manganites with magnetoelectric effect prepared on different substrates and growth conditions, optimized for epitaxy and interface quality. The combined study of electric and magnetic properties allowed us examining the conditions required for application of the studied multiferroic materials and experimental techniques are presented in this work. The work consists of three main substrates, a systematic study of microstructure of La 0 : 7 Sr 0 : 3 MnO 3 thin films on SrTiO 3 substrate, prepared by pulsed laser deposition, the La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 thin film and La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 heterostructure on Al 2 O 3 substrate, and the La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 thin film, BaTiO 3 and La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 heterostructure on Si substrate, prepared by RF magnetron sputtering. Main structural characterization of samples was performed by conventional and high resolution X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM); chemical composition was determined by Electron Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS), Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Energy Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy (EFTEM); Magnetization measurements done with a Superconducting Quantum Interface Device (SQUID) magnetometer. Surface probing of topography and local effects was performed, using Atomic Force (AFM) and Piezo-Response (PFM) Microscopy. Results clearly showed that there is an evolution in the microstructure of the La 0 : 7 Sr 0 : 3 MnO 3 thin films, by increasing their thickness, changing from polycrystalline structure in the thinnest film (13. 5 nm) to tilted columnar structure(45 nm and 200 nm) and to a branched structure in the thickest film (320 nm). The change {{in the structure of the}} film is due to the strain from the substrate and deformation of the structure in the early stages of the growth, where anti-phase boundaries and twinning were detected. The evolution of the structure modified the low temperature (below structural phase transition of SrTiO 3 substrate) magnetic properties of the films, showing in-excess and in-defect magnetization, below and above 100 nm thickness, respectively. Also, STEM-EELS and EFTEM analysis showed the difference in the elemental composition of the films near the boundaries and interface with the substrate. In the scope of the PhD work plan, the second substrate consists of studying the structural and physical properties of La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 thin film and La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 heterostructure on Al 2 O 3 substrate, where they showed highly oriented structure. The La/Ba ratio of the single layer film and heterostructure is drastically different from the target, La 0 : 7 Ba 0. 3 MnO 3, proven by XRD, RBS, and magnetic phase transitions. The magnetic and electrical properties of the structures showed strong dependence on the crystallinity of the samples. The final part of the work is devoted to the La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 and BaTiO 3 thin films and La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 heterostructure on Si substrate, which in comparison with the structures on Al 2 O 3 substrate, highlights the influence of crystallinity on magnetic, ferro-electrical and magnetoresistance properties of the film and heterostructure. It is shown that higher degree of crystallinity leads to higher magnetization and lowers the resistivity. For the first time, a study of the topography deformation by applying a dcexternal voltage was done on BaTiO 3 thin film on Si, using a poling technique in a piezoresponse force microscope. The results show the ability of controlled modification of the surface, by applying an external voltage/electric field in the range of 14 V< Vapp< 20 V. Below this range, no deformation is observed on the topography, and above this interval, at 30 V, the surface is completely damaged. The produced topographical change show stabilization in respect to time, where after applying 20 V, the modified area reaches its 83 % of the as-poled height (9 nm) in 90 minutes, to 7. 4 nm. The asymmetrical response in the piezoresponse of the poled area is related to the existence of an internal built-in electric field in the sample, which is also confirmed by performing switching spectroscopy measurements on the single layer. The heterostructure on the Si substrate shows the same phenomena, as the BTO single layer, where the heterostructure arrangement enhances the applied voltage effect on the topography. With applying 10 V, the structure of the surface changes in the heterostructure and a visible modification of BaTiO 3 layer, changing also the topography of La 0 : 9 Ba 0 : 1 MnO 3 top layer is observed.
