500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

[...] This reply was reported in The Sun under the headline [...] "Crisis? What Crisis?". Callaghan also later admitted in regard to the Winter of Discontent that he had [...] "let the country down".|$|E
2500|$|After the event, {{president}} Asif Ali Zardari {{appealed for}} [...] "all democratic forces" [...] {{to help to}} save Pakistan and he pledged to rid Pakistan of Islamic militants: [...] "Terrorism is a cancer in Pakistan, we are determined, God willing, we will rid the country of this cancer. <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> such actions by these cowards will not lower our resolve." [...] Pakistan's chief adviser on internal security, Rehman Malik, said [...] "the authorities would fight on until the last terrorist is cleared. We think that the safe Pakistan, safe Afghanistan is safety for the world and therefore we will not let them have easy way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the film, Hugo and his {{grandfather}} were supposed to [...] "travel to a diamond moon" [...] and the storyboards showed Hugo battling Scylla in space. The plot premise was described by Helbrandt as following: [...] "Afskyelia [...] have obtained a way to threaten Hugo and his forest friends. Therefore Hugo has to do something, and when he discovers a moon behind the moon we know today, he will set forth. Afskyelia chases after him. But <b>I</b> <b>promise</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> unfortunately for her, the story is to end happily." [...] The movie's basic plot premise resembles the educational game Hugo in Space, which was released in 2003, {{one year after the}} planned release of the movie. In this game, she plans to extract the rare magical black diamonds (first introduced in an action game [...] in 2002) from an asteroid's core and become the most powerful witch of all time.|$|E

Meanwhile, producer RedOne described it as Gaga's [...] "freedom album" [...] as her manager, Troy Carter, felt her public image would begin to change after the release of Born This Way. A few months after the announcement, Gaga exclaimed that she had finished writing songs for the album: [...] "It came so quickly. I've been working on it for months, and I feel very strongly that it's finished right now. Some artists take years. I don't. I write music every day."
