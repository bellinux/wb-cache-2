40|$|It {{is known}} that experts {{identify}} or perceive meaningful patterns in visual stimuli related to their domain of expertise. This study explores {{the speed with which}} <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> detect changes in physics diagrams. Since change detection depends on where individuals direct their attention, differences in the speed with which <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> detect changes to diagrams would suggest differences in attention allocation between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices.</b> We present data from an experiment using the “flicker technique,” in which both physics <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> physics <b>novices</b> viewed nearly identical pairs of diagrams that are representative of typical introductory physics situations. The two diagrams in each pair contain a subtle difference that either does or does not change the underlying physics depicted in the diagram. Findings indicate that experts are faster at detecting physics-relevant changes than physics-irrelevant changes; however, there is no difference in response time for novices, suggesting that expertise guides attention for experts when inspecting physics diagrams.

30|$|Holistic {{processing}} {{is often}} {{characterized as a}} process by which objects are perceived as a whole rather than a compilation of individual features. This mechanism may {{play an important role}} in the development of perceptual expertise because it allows for rapid integration across image regions. The present work explores whether holistic processing is present in latent fingerprint examiners, who compare fingerprints collected from crime scenes against a set of standards taken from a suspect. We adapted a composite task widely used in the face recognition and perceptual expertise literatures, in which participants were asked to match only a particular half of a fingerprint with a previous image while ignoring the other half. We tested both <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices,</b> using both upright and inverted fingerprints. For upright fingerprints, we found weak evidence for holistic processing, but with no differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> with respect to holistic processing. For inverted fingerprints, we found stronger evidence of holistic processing, with weak evidence for differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices.</b> These relatively weak holistic processing effects contrast with robust evidence for holistic processing with faces and with objects in other domains of perceptual expertise. The data constrain models of holistic processing by demonstrating that latent fingerprint <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> may not substantively differ in terms of the amount of holistic processing and that inverted stimuli actually produced more evidence for holistic processing than upright stimuli. Important differences between the present fingerprint stimuli and those in the literature include the lack of verbal labels for <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> the absence of strong vertical asymmetries, both of which might contribute to stronger holistic processing signatures in other stimulus domains.|$|R

40|$|Research {{on crime}} scene {{investigation}} has strongly {{focused on the}} technical aspects of the process, while cognitive aspects (searching, reasoning and perception) have often been overlooked. Textbooks on forensic sciences tend to focus on identifying and processing evidence, and the use of equipment while {{it can be argued that}} cognitive factors in processing such evidence and using equipment are equally important. This thesis studies the cognitive aspects of crime scene investigation by comparing eye movement patterns in <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices.</b> Studies in various domains, including surgery, sports, and chess playing have shown that eye movements differ between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices,</b> providing a tool towards a more objective assessment of skill than is possible with peer assessment. In four experiments eye movements of <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> were examined during (1) inspection of photographs of crime scenes on a computer screen (2) a change blindness task on crime and non-crime scene images, (3) active exploration of a simulated crime scene and (4) the assessment of emotional crime and natural scenes. While some trends in eye movement differences, such as a tendency on longer fixation durations and a broader focus on the overall scene and less on the direct evidence could be found in experts compared to <b>novices,</b> differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> were considerably smaller than in other domains, despite the broad range of measures extracted from the data. This lack of clear expertise effects may relate to the rather diverse range of perceptual layouts of crime scenes, reducing possible top-down effects of expertise on the deployment of attention.

It {{was based upon}} a desire to compare the design problem solving strategies of novices, in this case key stage three pupils studying technolgy within the United Kingdom National Curriculum, with designers who could be considered to have developed expertise. The findings helped to provide insights into potential teaching strategies to suit novice designers. Verbal protocols were made as samples of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> designers solved a design problem and talked aloud as they worked. The verbalisations were recorded on video tape. The protocols were transcribed and segmented, with each segment being assigned to a predetermined coding system which represented a model of design problem solving. The results of the encoding were analysed and consideration was also given to the general design strategy and heuristics used by the <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> designers. The drawings and models produced during the generation of the protocols were also analysed and considered. A number of {{significant differences between the}} problem solving strategies adopted by the <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> designers were identified.

30|$|These {{considerations}} place {{a burden}} on the perceptual and visual working memory capacities of human <b>experts.</b> Thompson <b>and</b> Tangen (2014) demonstrated {{that the nature of}} expertise among fingerprint examiners might lie in an improved ability to discriminate subtle differences among highly similar non-mated impressions. In their experiments, experts performed much better than novices on a matching task with similar and dissimilar distractors. This held even when a 5 -s delay was inserted between two sequentially presented images and inversion surprisingly produced no differences in performance. However, differences between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> on a long-term memory task were mainly due to changes in response criteria, because <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>novices</b> showed equivalent ability to discriminate prints in a long-term memory task.

The two novices were the first year teacher and the two experts had more than ten years ’ experiences.

Qualitative analysis methodologies provided rich in-depth descriptions of each teacher’s belief and decision making process. Differences found between decision making of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> teachers most notably involved in two areas: the integration of the information and the estimation of students ’ needs in the preactive stage.

40|$|Background: Research {{indicates}} <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> teachers communicate differently during instruction. However, {{these differences}} {{have yet to}} be investigated in relation to student learning. Receiver selectivity theory offers an interpretive framework for understanding how expert-novice communication differences might function to discriminate student learning when it is defined as the student’s ability to recall the most important information the teacher intended to communicate. Purpose: This study examined <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> golf instructors’ communication and student learning using receiver selectivity as a theoretical framework. Specifically, student recall was investigated in relation to the teachers’ communication behaviors and the perceived outcomes of these behaviors. Participants and setting: Stage theory guided the selection of four expert and four novice female golf instructors (n ¼ 8). Eight students, who were male and female and varied in age (19 – 26) and skill level, were also recruited for participation. This study was conducted at two golf course driving ranges in Orlando, Florida and by telephone from the researcher’s university. Study design: This study employed a qualitative research design to provide a descriptive account of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> golf instructors’ communication {{from the perspective of the}} teachers’ students, identify perceived outcomes of teacher communication, and examine student recall. Receiver selectivity theory guided data collection and interpretation of the results. Research techniques were drawn from seminal sourcebooks on semi-structured interviews and data management/reduction. Data collection: Students were assigned to take an individual lesson on the full swing with either an expert or a novice teacher. Following their lessons, the teachers were asked to identify the target information they had intended to communicate to their students. Two weeks later, students were asked by telephone to identify the most important information from their lessons, to describe their teachers’ communication behaviors, and to discuss the perceived outcomes of their teachers’ communication. Data analysis: Teacher and student perceptions of target information were compared to determine if students recalled what teachers had intended to communicate in their lessons. Inductive analysis was used to find patterns of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> communication behaviors. Student interviews were searched for statements about perceived outcomes of teacher communication. Findings: Seven of the eight students recalled the target information their teachers had intended to communicate. Themes in the teachers’ communication behaviors revealed expert-novice differences but perceived outcomes of teacher communication were positive – and in some cases, the same – for both groups. Conclusions: Positioned against receiver selectivity theory, the findings indicate both <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> teachers successfully engaged students in the learning process. Teacher behaviors (both <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice)</b> and their perceived outcomes support previous research highlighting strategies for increasing student learning. Distinctive elements of this study, including nonverbal behaviors that were featured and the one student to one teacher ratio, are important considerations for explaining divergent findings between this study and those of previous research comparing the expositive discourse of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>novice</b> classroom teachers...|$|E
