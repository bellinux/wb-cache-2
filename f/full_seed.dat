Therefore, estimating the time (in weeks) after pollination that fertilisation might occur can help to estimate viable seed set during interspecific hybridisation and make subsequent tissue-culture (embryo rescue and micropropagation) projects more effective (Cisneros and Tel-Zur 2010). Previous studies used radiography to determine whether mature seed can be viable (Bramlett et al. 1977; Tigabu and Odén 2003).

The carapace was found to be a significant layer of lignin surrounding the embryo of this species. This carapace can be removed (partially or fully) by prolonged pre-treatment with different bleach concentrations and exposure times (overnight incubation in 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite or sodium dichloroisocyanurate was optimum, data not included). However, we did not find a statistically significant improvement in germination when bleach was used. This could be due to harmful effects of bleach on the embryo proper.|$|E

The reported pollination behaviour of Aerangis ellisii (Nilsson and Rabakonandrianina 1988; Nilsson et al. 1992) explains the low <b>full</b> <b>seed</b> percentage, and the fragmentation we have found in the wild shows very little recruitment, all of which could drive the species to serious population decline in the coming decades.

In years with larger crop sizes more avian seed predators were attracted with an increase in the proportion of <b>full</b> <b>seeds</b> predated on the ground. However, for abundant crops, the presence of empty seeds decreased the proportion of <b>full</b> <b>seeds</b> predated. Empty seeds remained for a very long period in the tree, making location of <b>full</b> <b>seeds</b> more difficult for pre-dispersal predators and expanding the overall seed drop period at a very low cost (in dry biomass and allocation of C, N and P). Parthenocarpy (non-fertilized seeds) was the main cause of seed emptiness whereas seed abortion was produced in low quantity. These aborted seeds fell prematurely and, thus, could not work as deceptive seeds. A proportion of 50 % empty seeds significantly reduced ground seed predation by 26 %. However, a high rate of parthenocarpy (beyond 50 % empty seeds) did not significantly reduce seed predation in comparison to 50 % empty seeds.

Our data show that DNA synthesis and mitotic microtubule arrays are markers for cell division activity and histo-differentiation during early embryogenesis. Cortical microtubular cytoskeleton alone is a marker for expansion growth during maturation, as seed and embryo gain dry weight and attain their final size. During this phase germinability, desiccation tolerance and dormancy are acquired, and a transient increase in ABA occurs, preceding the achievement of physiological maturity and subsequent quiescence. In the gib 1 mutant embryo development was retarded in all parameters studied, except for a transient rise in ABA content. In the sitw mutant embryonic DNA synthesis activity was resumed upon completion of histo-differentiation, the microtubular cytoskeleton network was re-established during maturation and followed by viviparous germination. This suggests that ABA controls the suppression of these events during maturation and quiescence. Induction of <b>full</b> <b>seed</b> germinability, desiccation tolerance and dormancy was related to the completion of embryo histo-differentiation but was independent {{of the state of the}} microtubular cytoskeleton during maturation...|$|E

The Columbia site was located on Mexico silt loam, and the Mount Vernon site on Viraton silt loam. The first study examined the feasibility of harvesting switchgrass for biomass and summer forage within a season. Yields and forage quality were compared between four harvest management treatments: a single post-frost harvest for biomass, a forage harvest at boot stage followed by a post-frost biomass harvest, biomass harvest at post-anthesis with summer regrowth harvested as forage, and biomass harvest at pre-anthesis with summer regrowth harvested as forage. Summer regrowth was minimal at Mount Vernon due to a fragipan and shallower rooting depth at that site. Regrowth had greater lignin content and as a result, was less digestible.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{individual}} species of Larix MILL. are characterized by the extremely high percentage of produced non-vital empty seeds and therefore (despite the appreciable importance of this genus in forestry and landscape ecology) their breeding, seed management and artificial regeneration are complicated. Concurrently, the Larix species are characterized by large, heavy and wing-less (so-called non-saccate) pollen grains whose mobility is considered relatively low in most cases (DYLIS 1948; CHALUPA 1961, 1985, and others). Besides that, the re-ceptive period of female generative organs is relatively short (BARNER, CHRISTIANSEN 1960; VILLAR et al. 1984; SAID et al. 1991; OWENS et al. 1994) and the success of pollination is closely related to the amount of produced pollen and the existing meteorological conditions during its shedding (KRIŽO, SLOBODNÍK 1996). Concerning these weak links of the pollination process {{and the fact that the}} integument is able to transform into the normally developed testa in unfertilized larch ovules as well (unlike various species of Picea A.

In this context, the success of pollina-tion should be studied as one of several factors affecting the quality of the produced larch seeds and the actual importance of insufficient pollination should be assessed and quantified.
