However, he left the unit in September and when he returned on 25 January 1788, he was immediately granted leave. After {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution, his father served as a Deputy in the Constituent Assembly. He was appointed sous-lieutenant in the Meuse Volunteer Battalion on 15 September 1791 and became lieutenant in 1792. Several months later, he emerged as captain of hussars in the Légion du Nord. In May 1793, the Representative-on-mission of the Army of the North (France) promoted him to adjutant general (a rank equivalent to colonel) for bravery. This appointment was later confirmed. On 16 October 1793 at the Battle of Wattignies, he accompanied the 3,500-man column of Jacob Job Élie on the far right flank of the army. In the middle of the night, the outposts were attacked by the Austrians and the untried foot soldiers took to their heels. Élie managed to rally his men but Johann Andreas Benjowski's Austrians launched an assault in a heavy fog at dawn. The second line panicked and fired into the backs of the first line, whereupon the infantry bolted again, throwing away their muskets in order to run faster. They might have been butchered but for Loison who led the cavalry to the rescue and fought off the pursuit. French losses were 400 soldiers and 12 artillery pieces while the Austrians lost 138 men in the clash.|$|E

50|$|From about 500 AD, the Franks {{controlled}} {{this part}} of northeastern France, and the Carolingian Empire was the last stage of their rule. The Carolingian territories were divided into three sections in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun, and the area that is now the <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Meuse,</b> became part of Middle Francia. The new ruler was Lothair I, and on his death in 855, his territory north of the Alps was passed to his second son Lothair II, after whom the hitherto nameless territory was called Lotharingia, which name eventually evolved into the modern Lorraine. Lothair II died without legitimate heirs and Lotharingia was divided into an east and west part. The king of East Francia, Louis the German, received the eastern part and Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, received the western part, which included Meuse, thus effectively establishing the medieval Kingdoms of Germany and France.|$|E

This was the battalion's first experience of the front and although they were not involved in any major conflict at this time, it helped to prepare them for their later engagements by enabling them to learn about how the war was fought on the Western Front. The battalion was not deployed as a complete unit at this time though. Instead, it was split up and its individual companies were attached to the various battalions of the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments.

5000|$|The {{congregation}} {{was founded}} in 1851, at the former Norbertine Abbey of Benoite-Vaux in the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Meuse.</b> The constitutions and spirit of the congregation were those of the Congregation of Canons Regular of Our Savior, which had been established in 1623 as a reform of the various canonical monasteries in the Duchy of Lorraine by St. Peter Fourier, C.R.S.A., of the Abbey of Chaumousey, and confirmed by Pope Urban VIII in 1628. The scope of the reformed Order, as outlined in the Summarium Constitutionum of Fourier, was the Christian education of youth and the pastoral care {{of the poor and}} neglected. The congregation flourished exceedingly throughout the Duchy of Lorraine and made its way into France and the Duchy of Savoy, but was completely destroyed by the French Revolution. In 1851 four zealous priests of the Diocese of Verdun, anxious to see revived the apostolic labours of the followers of Fourier, withdrew to the secluded site of the former abbey, whose church had become the Shrine of Our Lady of Benoite-Vaux. There they began to follow religious life according to the Rule of Life given to his canons by Fourier. Three years later they received the approval of the Holy See, which changed their structure from that of Canons Regular, the form of the earlier congregation, to that of Clerics Regular. Its special work being the education of youth, during the next half of the 19th century the congregation spread and numbered several houses, including one in Verdun, which later became a Carmel. The members of the congregation were of three grades, priests, scholastics (seminarians), and lay brothers. Though possessing the title [...] "clerics regular" [...] they were not such in the strict sense of the word, as their religious vows, though perpetual, were simple, according to the practice of the Roman authorities of establishing no new institutes of solemn vows.|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} a simple {{framework}} on wheat producer behaviour {{in a context of}} price output uncertainty. More precisely, we establish a relationship between ex post output price level and allocative inefficiency that allows to characterize farmers’ risk preferences. Given this analysis, the connection between risk aversion and other socioeconomic variables (such as degree of output specialisation, total asset, debts, farmer’s age…) can furthermore empirically be explored. This relationship is empirically tested on an unbalanced panel including about 650 wheat producers located in the French <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Meuse</b> over 1992 - 2003.

5000|$|The modern Limburg region, {{containing}} the Belgian and Dutch provinces of that name, were first united within one province {{while under the}} power of revolutionary France, and later the Napoleonic empire, but then under the name <b>of</b> the French <b>department</b> <b>of</b> the Lower <b>Meuse</b> (Maas). After Napoleon's defeat, a united Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed, containing modern Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. While it kept many of the French provincial boundaries, the first king, William I, insisted that the name be changed to the [...] "Province of Limburg", based on {{the name of the}} medieval Duchy of Limburg. The only part of Belgian or Dutch Limburg which was really in the Duchy of Limburg is the extreme east of Voeren, the villages of Teuven and Remersdaal, and these only became part of Belgian Limburg in 1977.|$|R
50|$|During the First French Empire, {{after the}} French revolution, {{the city of}} Maastricht became {{the capital of the}} area called the French <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> the Lower <b>Meuse.</b> This {{comprised}} not only the area of the modern province of Limburg in Belgium, but also the neighbouring province of the same name in the Netherlands. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Belgium became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. During this time, King William I confusingly named the area after the medieval Duchy of Limburg, which had been centered in Limbourg on the Vesdre river, (now in the Liège province of Belgium), which had never encompassed Hasselt or Maastricht. Belgium split from the Netherlands in 1830, but the status of Limburg was only resolved nine years later in 1839, with the division of Limburg into Belgian and Dutch parts. Hasselt became the provisional capital of the Belgian province of Limburg. In ecclesiastical terms Belgian Limburg became an independent entity from the Diocese of Liège in 1967, and Hasselt became the seat of the new Diocese of Hasselt.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the spread of {{pesticide}} practices with respect to crop production (wheat, barley, and rapeseed) in French agriculture and to evaluate the potential pesticide reductions for cost-efficient farmers. This is made possible by conducting a double-step analysis based on non-parametric robust technology. First, from a panel data of 650 farms over a 12 -year period located in the French <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Meuse,</b> we selected the cost-efficient farms thanks to a robust free disposal hull (RFDH) technology. A second RFDH frontier analysis was run only on the selected cost-efficient farms thus enabling us to reveal the units which minimize the pesticide use per hectare while maintaining constant yields. Therefore, all the different total cost-efficient practices among farmers were evaluated in terms of pesticide per hectare and the minimum uses were selected. Our main conclusion is that the pesticide reductions per hectare for the cost-efficient farms could reach 24 %...|$|E
