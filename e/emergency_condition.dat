5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on <b>Emergency</b> <b>Condition</b> 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a state of}} the art of path choice and traffic {{assignment}} models in road <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> is reported. The approaches proposed in literature are classified, distinguishing two approaches for path choice and three approaches for traffic assignment (static, pseudo dynamic and dynamic). In literature, several applications of models in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> are available: at the beginning models specified in ordinary conditions were applied in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions.</b> Afterwards, a first generation of models specified in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> was proposed. After 9 / 11 and Katrina Hurricane a second generation of <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> models was specified. Evolution of models applied in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> is presented in this paper: first, models in ordinary conditions are treated; second, models in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> are treated. In the last ten years several applications of models in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> have been carried out. Main applications in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> are summarized in this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCalibration and {{validation}} of dynamic assignment models to simulate {{urban road transport}} systems in ordinary conditions are still an open issue. This problem is further emphasized {{in the case of}} transport systems analysis in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions,</b> as there are no standardised methods and {{there is a lack of}} experience of real-world applications. The paper presents a DA model and a procedure able to simulate transport supply and transport supply – travel demand interaction of an urban road transport system in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions.</b> The transport supply models are calibrated and validated through traffic data observed during a real-world evacuation experiment conducted in the town of Melito di Porto Salvo (Italy). The DA model has been applied in order to reproduce the observed real-world evacuation experiment and a set of indicators for testing the performance of a road network in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> is estimated. We think that the findings reported in the paper represent a contribution in the field of transportation systems analysis in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> at urban scale. The specified and calibrated DA model and the applied set of indicators can be a useful tool to support the planning and management of road networks and mobility in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{emergency}} {{detection system}} (EDS) sensed initial development of {{conditions in the}} flight vehicle during the boost phases of flight which could cause vehicle failure. The EDS reacted to these emergency situations {{in one of two}} ways. If breakup of the vehicle were imminent, an automatic abort sequence would be initiated. If, however, the <b>emergency</b> <b>condition</b> were developing slowly enough or were of such a nature that the flight crew can evaluate it and take action, only visual indications were provided to the flight crew. Once an abort sequence had been initiated, either automatically or manually, it was irrevocable and ran to completion.|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of production systems negatively affects operator's {{ability to make}} decisions during <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions.</b> The aim of the present research is to propose a hybrid model for human error probability analysis, called Emergency Human Error Analysis (EHEA), which considers all contingency factors that influence decisions and actions of the operator. The model aims to evaluate the human error probability in <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> in industrial plants and critical infrastructures. The proposed model is based on SHERPA model (simulator for human error probability analysis) and on the performance shaping factors relationship, which represents the environmental system. This model {{can be used in}} preventive phase to analyze the possible accident scenarios.

50|$|The Three Mile Island {{accident}} was a compounded group of emergencies {{that led to}} core damage. What led to this was an erroneous decision by operators {{to shut down the}} ECCS during an <b>emergency</b> <b>condition</b> due to gauge readings that were either incorrect or misinterpreted; this caused another <b>emergency</b> <b>condition</b> that, several hours after the fact, led to core exposure and a core damage incident. If the ECCS had been allowed to function, it would have prevented both exposure and core damage. During the Fukushima incident the emergency cooling system had also been manually shut down several minutes after it started.|$|E
