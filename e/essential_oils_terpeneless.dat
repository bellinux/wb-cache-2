Literature research focuses on yeasts and their importace in dairy as well as antimicrobial influence of active substances in plants. Three types of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> were selected {{for the purpose of}} experimental determination; <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> from melissa, <b>essentiaĺ</b> <b>oil</b> from rosemary and <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> from thyme. Antimicrobial effect of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> was tested on specific yeasts types, isolated from specific dairy products samples. The next step after yeasts identification was testing antimicrobial influence of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> using disk diffusion method and broth dilution method. The influence of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> was tested in two concentrations, 1 % and 10 %. The best result employing the disk diffusion method was achieved using 10 % concentration <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> from melissa. <b>Essential</b> <b>oil</b> from rosemary resulted as worse option.

Yield, chemical composition and toxicity against neonates of the Mediterranean fruit fly were determined. Based on chemical analysis, the toxicity of commercially purchased major and minor components (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> was determined. In addition, fractions were prepared to evaluate the role of minor components in the toxicity of crude <b>essential</b> <b>oils.</b> Limonene {{was by far the}} most abundant ingredient (96. 2 - 97. 4 %) in all sweet orange varieties and in bitter orange, while the concentration of limonene was much lower in lemon <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> (74. 3 %). Orange and bitter orange <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> were more toxic than lemon <b>essential</b> <b>oils.</b> The toxicity of orange and bitter orange <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> was similar to that of their major component limonene. In tests of commercially purchased chemicals, the oxygenated components of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> were more toxic than hydrocarbons but their low concentration in citrus <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> could not affect the toxic activity of <b>essential</b> <b>oils.</b> The presence of alpha-pinene and beta-pinene seems to account for the lower toxicity of lemon <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> in relation to other citrus <b>essential</b> <b>oils.</b> The importance of understanding the toxicity of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> in relation to their composition and their role regarding the resistance of citrus fruits to Ceratitis capitata infestation is discussed...|$|R

Furthermore, the in vitro inhibitory effects of these <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> on the production of aflatoxins were evaluated by HPLC. Results showed that all <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> retarded the time for visible growth. Growth rate was affected differently depending on the <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> S. montana <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> prevented growth in all cases. The <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> of R. graveolens inhibited most of the aflatoxin production even though growth inhibition was low, while with C. citratus <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> trace levels of aflatoxins were detected. <b>Essential</b> <b>oils</b> containing carvacrol and/or thymol (S. montana and O. vulgare) have the highest activity against fungal growth, while an <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> (R. graveolens) containing 2 -undecanone and 8 -phenyl- 2 -octanone inhibited the synthesis of aflatoxins. Although the main component of this <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> was 2 -undecanone (91 %), when pure 2 -undecanone was tested, it did not inhibit aflatoxin production.

40|$|Zingiber officinale (Zingiberaceae) and Piper cubeba (Piperaceae) was <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> were {{investigated}} for repellent, insecticidal, antiovipositional, egg hatching, persistence of its insecticidal activities against pulse beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). <b>Essential</b> <b>oil</b> vapours repelled bruchid adults significantly as oviposition was found reduced in choice oviposition assay. Z. officinale and P. cubeba <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> caused both fumigant and contact toxicity in C. chinensis adults. In fumigation toxicity assay, median lethal concentrations (LC 50) were 0. 34 and 0. 27 μL cm - 3 for Z. officinale and P. cubeba <b>essential</b> <b>oils,</b> respectively, while in contact toxicity assay, LC 50 were 0. 90 and 0. 66 μL cm - 2 for Z. officinale and P. cubeba <b>essential</b> <b>oils,</b> respectively. These two <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> reduced oviposition in C. chinensis adults when treated with sublethal concentrations by fumigation and contact method. Oviposition inhibition was more pronounced when adults {{come in contact}} than in vapours. Both <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> significantly reduced egg hatching rate when fumigated. Persistence in insecticidal efficiency of both <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> decreased with time. P. cubeba showed less persistence than Z. officinale <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> because no mortality was observed in C. chinensis adults after 36 h of treatment with P. cubeba and after 48 h of treatment of Z. officinale <b>essential</b> <b>oil.</b> Fumigation with these <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> {{has no effect on}} the germination of the cowpea seeds. Findings of the study suggest that Z. officinale and P. cubeba <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> can be useful as promising agent in insect pest management programme...|$|R

They could be {{obtained}} by cold press, hydro-distillation etc. In this study, the effects of cold press and hydro‑distillation applications on essential composition of bitter orange peel oil were investigated. Additionally changes in <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> compositions by drying were presented. <b>Essential</b> <b>oil</b> composition was affected from extraction techniques and drying process. Limonene was determined as the main component of bitter orange <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> (94. 00 - 94. 65 %). The other highest components were β-myrcene (1. 77 - 1. 90 %), linalool (0. 53 - 0. 81 %), β-pinene (0. 29 - 0. 72 %) and α‑pinene (0. 45 - 0. 51 %) in descending order. As a result, the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> compositions of oil obtained by cold-press were more similar to fresh peel oil than the oils obtained by hydro distillation. On the other hand, the <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> content of fresh sample significantly decreased during drying process. While <b>essential</b> <b>oil</b> content was 3. 00 % for the fresh peel, it was 2. 50 % for dried one.
