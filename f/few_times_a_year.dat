40|$|Vibrations in {{buildings}} can cause occupant discomfort {{in the form}} of annoyance, headache, or sickness. While occupant comfort is considered in international standards regarding the design of high rise buildings against wind loading, it is neglected in the design of buildings with seismic protective base isolation systems. Nevertheless, due to their low flexibility, base isolated buildings can be prone to wind-induced vibrations, which makes occupant discomfort a potentially significant serviceability limit state. This paper presents a study on occupant comfort conditions in wind-excited base isolated buildings. A numerical simplified parametric procedure is proposed in order to evaluate the return period of wind events causing human discomfort. A parametric investigation is then presented to evaluate the effects of salient parameters on comfort conditions. The procedure is based on (i) the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the structure modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator with hysteretic base isolators, (ii) the digital generation of time histories of turbulent wind velocity, and (iii) comfort evaluations based on international standards. Results demonstrate that discomfort conditions can occur <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> in <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> depending upon the wind-exposure of the site, what suggests considering this serviceability limit state in the design of base isolated buildings...|$|R

2500|$|By 1798 Rapp and {{his group}} of {{followers}} {{had already begun to}} distance themselves from mainstream society and intended to establish a new religious congregation of fellow believers. In the Lomersheimer declaration, written in 1798, these religious Separatists presented their statement of faith, based on Christian principles, to the Wurttemberg legislature. Rapp's followers declared their desire to form a separate congregation who would meet in members’ homes, free from Lutheran Church doctrines.

They also believed that confirmation for youth was not necessary and communion and confession would only be held a <b>few</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Although the Separatists supported civil government, the group refused to make a physical oath in its support, [...] "for according to the Gospel not oath is allowed him who gives evidence of a righteous life as an upright man."

2500|$|In her Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven, Uta Ranke-Heinemann {{says that}} three discussions of {{marriage}} in the New Testament (Matthew 19, I Corinthians 7, and Ephesians 5:22-32) do not refer to generating children, which later became consistently emphasized in Catholic moral doctrine as {{the primary purpose of}} sexual relations, although, according to her, those texts does not indicate that conceiving children is excluded in marriage. The view that marriage is primarily intended for the purpose of procreation dominated early Christianity, and held by many Church Fathers. During the entire Middle Ages, the question of when intercourse was allowed and when it was not, was very important. Intercourse was prohibited on all Sundays and all the many feast days, as well as the 20 days before Christmas, the 40 days before Easter, and often the 20 days before Pentecost, as well as three or more days before receiving Communion (which at that time was offered only a <b>few</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>year).</b> These forbidden days altogether totaled about 40% of each year. Some church leaders warned believers that children conceived on holy days would be born leprous, epileptic, diabolically possessed, or crippled. Penalties of 20 to 40 days of strict fasting on bread and water were imposed on transgressors. Intercourse was forbidden during the menstrual period and after childbirth, since [...] "physicians mistakenly believed that the blood of a menstruating woman or one who has just given birth was poisonous". It was also forbidden during pregnancy, with concern for protecting the fetus as the main reason. [...] "Christian theologians", including Pope Gregory I, held that abstinence should continue until a baby was weaned.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} work {{associated with}} antenna related error sources, {{as well as}} antenna design, in space geodesy utilizing the techniques of Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Geodetic VLBI uses large radio telescopes, often in global networks observing at least <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> per <b>year.</b> <b>As</b> the number of dedicated antennas for this purpose is limited, also antennas designed for radio astronomical research are used. However, new feed systems are needed to handle the simultaneous dual-frequency observations and the large bandwidth in geodetic VLBI. This thesis describes and numerically evaluates such a feed system. The design {{has the advantage of}} not interfering with existing front-end receivers of traditional Cassegrain antennas. In contrast to VLBI antenna systems, GPS antennas have low directivity in order to receive signals from the satellites in different directions simultaneously. The disadvantage with such antennas is the relatively high susceptibility to scattering from structures close to the antenna. Two studies presented in this thesis show that signal scattering from structures associated with the mounting of the antenna to the pillar and with the pillar itself, might be a significant source of error. As nearby structures are in general located below the antenna, scattering from these structures may be minimized using antennas with reduced side- and back-lobe levels. This thesis presents results from a preliminary study of two new designs of such antennas. The Swedish permanent GPS network, SWEPOS, consists of 20 stations distributed across Sweden. One of the scientific motivations for this network is to monitor crustal motions associated with postglacial rebound. This thesis describes SWEPOS, and results from almost 18 months of daily observations are presented and compared to models of postglacial rebound. The results from SWEPOS have also uncovered two major error sources. One of them is the scattering effect mentioned above. The other, which also is investigated in this thesis, is related to snow accumulated {{on the top of the}} pillars and on the radomes that covers the antennas. This accumulation appears to refract and delay the GPS signals, and thus degrade the positioning accuracy...|$|R
