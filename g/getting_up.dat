5|$|A {{standard}} {{match between}} Daivari and Tommy Dreamer followed with The Great Khali accompanying Daivari {{to the ring}} but was ejected from ringside early on for interfering. After Daivari won the match using a roll-up, Khali came {{back out to the}} ring and gave Dreamer a chokebomb. EMTs came out to help Dreamer get up, but he ended up <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> on his own and headed backstage.|$|E
5|$|De Lucía {{lived for}} five years in Yucatan, Mexico, but {{returned}} to his native Spain in 2003 after professing to have become really tired with spending his whole life touring for six to eight months a year, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> {{at the crack of}} dawn and living in hotels. He continued to keep a holiday home in Mexico though and regularly visited with his family.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were exhausted and virtually naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had swollen bellies due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all were suffering from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases. Some children died after the effort of simply <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1981 Icke {{became a}} sports {{presenter}} for the BBC's national programme, Newsnight, which {{had begun the}} previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on {{the first edition of}} the BBC's Breakfast Time, British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news for them until 1985, which meant <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the summer of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted Grandstand, at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme. He also published his first book that year, It's a Tough Game, Son!, about how to break into football.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{he got a}} job distributing newspapers. This respectable work {{required}} <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> at 6 a.m., {{not good}} for a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to urge them to bring their troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E
5000|$|Irving Berlin wrote a tune called, [...] "Oh, How I Hate to <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> in the Morning".

5000|$|The song {{opens with}} Elton on piano, and then kicks {{off to the}} beat, with the song's first of two slide guitar solos by Davey Johnstone along with the heavy {{percussion}} rhythms of Ray Cooper The rest of the band notably includes, among others, Caleb Quaye. The song begins {{to turn into a}} jam after about the first two minutes, prominently including a choir of singers chanting [...] "Bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - (<b>get</b> <b>up)</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance - bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - (<b>get</b> <b>up</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance - bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance, dance, dance! (Dance, dance...) (Dance, dance, daaaaaance!)". Like the amount of vocals, the amount of instrumentation increases significantly during this portion, but with John on piano, the piano is obviously the dominant instrument; there are three piano solos in the song. As a result of the musical free-for-all, the song is six minutes and forty-three seconds, making it one of John's longest.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} match, Cesaro {{defeated}} Sami Zayn. In {{the first half}} of the match, Zayn dove through the ropes looking for a tornado DDT, only for Cesaro to intercept with a European uppercut. Cesaro went on to target Zayn's left knee. In the second half of the match, Cesaro attempted to superplex Zayn from the apron into the ring, but Zayn countered and tried to perform a frankensteiner to Cesaro. Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn then hit his signature Helluva Kick to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to stay down, but Zayn kept <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> to receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature Neutralizer, but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro then hit a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of a pin at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the Neutralizer on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn.|$|E

25|$|Sprawling limbs require {{sideways}} flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, {{which are}} very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that {{spend most of their}} time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time—because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> and lying down.|$|E
25|$|Morrison {{had begun}} writing fiction {{as part of}} an {{informal}} group of poets and writers at Howard University who met to discuss their work.

25|$|In the 10th round, Calzaghe hit Hopkins with a punch that Hopkins {{claimed was}} low.

Calzaghe thought Hopkins was acting and waved for the crowd to show their displeasure with Hopkins. The fans booed on cue. Hopkins used the full five minutes to recuperate.|$|E
25|$|Bevan {{remained}} at the College until 1921, attending {{at a time when}} a number of his contemporaries from South Wales, including Jim Griffiths, were also students at the College. However, some historians have questioned how influential the College was on his political development. He was not, apparently, one of the most diligent students, and found it difficult to follow an organised routine, including <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> early for breakfast.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, four German states, totaling 10 million people, {{relied on}} wind power for 43-52% of their annual {{electricity}} needs.

25|$|Erect limbs {{increase}} {{the costs of}} <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because natural selection would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish {{and spent most of}} their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.|$|E
