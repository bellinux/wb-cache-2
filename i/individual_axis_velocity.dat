40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we focus}} on {{improving}} contour tracking in precision motion control (PMC) applications {{through the use of}} Cross-Coupled Iterative Learning Control (CCILC). Initially, the relationship between <b>individual</b> <b>axis</b> errors and contour error is discussed, including insights into the different reasons for implementing CCILC versus <b>individual</b> <b>axis</b> ILC. A Norm Optimal (N. O.) framework is used to design optimal learning filters based on design objectives. The general N. O. framework is reformatted to include the contour error, as well as <b>individual</b> <b>axis</b> errors. General guidelines for tuning the different weighting matrices are presented. The weighting approach of this framework enables one to focus on <b>individual</b> <b>axis</b> or contour tracking independently. The performance benefits of N. O. CCILC versus ILC are illustrated through simulation and experimental testing on a multi-axis robotic testbed. I...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} pattern of global and {{regional}} left ventricular long axis motion during early diastole in patients with ischaemic heart disease with and without myocardial infarction using magnetic resonance velocity mapping. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of 26 patients {{with a history of}} myocardial infarction (age 29 - 78, mean 55 years) and 21 patients with coronary artery disease without infarction (age range 39 - 71, mean 58 years). Values were compared with a control group (19 controls, age 35 - 76, mean 52 years) with a low likelihood of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS [...] Regional long <b>axis</b> <b>velocity</b> varied with time and position around the ventricle. All measurements were taken at the time of maximum early diastolic long <b>axis</b> <b>velocity.</b> Patients with coronary artery disease without infarction had lower values for maximum (mean (SD)) (99 (30) v 125 (33) mm/s, P < 0. 05) and mean peak early diastolic wall motion (63 (13) v 82 (22) mm/s, P < 0. 05) than controls. The coefficient of variation showed greater inhomogeneity of relaxation in patients than in controls (38 (18) % v 27 (10) %). All values were lower in patients with previous infarction than in patients with coronary artery disease without infarction and normal subjects. In patients with previous myocardial infarction the maximum (mean (SD)) early diastolic velocity was 80 (22) mm/s (P < 0. 01 compared with controls and P < 0. 05 compared with patients without infarction) and the mean (SD) velocity was 47 (18) mm/s (P < 0. 01 compared with controls). The coefficient of variation was greater (52 (33) %) than for controls (P < 0. 05) and patients with coronary artery disease without infarction. 18 of 26 patients with previous myocardial infarction and 13 of 21 patients with coronary artery disease without infarction had regional abnormalities corresponding to areas of fixed or reversible ischaemia on exercise electrocardiography or thallium myocardial perfusion tomography. CONCLUSIONS [...] Magnetic resonance velocity mapping can be used to assess regional long <b>axis</b> myocardial <b>velocity.</b> Ischaemic heart disease causes alterations in the patterns of left ventricular long <b>axis</b> <b>velocity</b> during early diastole...|$|R

A population analysis of the response behavior showed that DSCT neurons encode a combination of limb axis position and movement velocity, whereas the Purkinje cells located in the DSCT cerebellar target areas encode limb <b>axis</b> <b>velocity</b> and position independently.

40|$|Master of Science in MedicineSaccadic and vestibular-evoked eye {{movements}} {{are similar in}} that their three-dimensional kinematic properties show eye position-dependence. When the line of sight is directed towards an eccentric target, the eye <b>velocity</b> <b>axis</b> tilts {{in a manner that}} depends on the instantaneous position of the eye in the head, with the magnitude of tilt also depending on whether the eye movement is saccadic or vestibular-evoked. The mechanism responsible for producing eye <b>velocity</b> <b>axis</b> tilting phenomena is not well understood. Some authorities have suggested that muscle pulleys in the orbit are critical for implementing eye <b>velocity</b> <b>axis</b> tilting, while others have suggested that the cerebellum plays an important role. In the current study, three-dimensional eye and head rotation data were acquired, using the magnetic search coil technique, to confirm the presence of eye position-dependent eye <b>velocity</b> <b>axis</b> tilting during saccadic eye movements. Both normal humans and humans with cerebellar atrophy were studied. While the humans with cerebellar atrophy were noted to have abnormalities in the two-dimensional metrics and consistency of their saccadic eye movements, the eye position-dependent eye <b>velocity</b> <b>axis</b> tilts were similar to those observed in the normal subjects. A mathematical model of the human saccadic and vestibular systems was utilized to investigate the means by which these eye position-dependent properties may arise for both types of eye movement. The predictions of the saccadic model were compared with the saccadic data obtained in the current study, while the predictions of the vestibular model were compared with vestibular-evoked eye movement data obtained in a previous study. The results from the model simulations suggest that the muscle pulleys are responsible for bringing about eye position-dependent eye <b>velocity</b> <b>axis</b> tilting for both saccadic and vestibular-evoked eye movements, and that these phenomena are not centrally programmed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPatients {{undergoing}} {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting (CABG) experience a reduction in right ventricular long <b>axis</b> <b>velocities</b> post surgery. ObjectivesWe tested whether the phenomenon of right ventricular (RV) long <b>axis</b> <b>velocity</b> decline depends on the chest being opened fully by mid-line sternotomy, pericardial incision, or {{on the type of}} operation performed. MethodBy intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) we recorded serial right ventricular (RV) systolic pulse-wave tissue Doppler velocities during 6 types of elective procedure: 53 CABG surgery, 15 robotic-assisted minimally-invasive CABG (RCABG), 28 aortic valve replacement (AVR), 8 minimally-invasive aortic valve replacement (mini-AVR), 5 mediastinal mass excision, and 1 left atrial myxoma excision. Pre and post operative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were also conducted. ResultsSurgery without substantial opening of the pericardium did not significantly reduce RV systolic velocities (RCABG 13 ± 1. 8 versus 12. 4 ± 2. 7 cm/s post; mini-AVR 11. 9 ± 2. 3 versus 11. 1 ± 2. 3 cm/s; mediastinal mass excision 13. 9 ± 3. 1 versus 13. 8 ± 4 cm/s). In contrast, within 5 min of pericardial incision those whose surgery involved full opening of the pericardium had large reductions in RV velocities: 54 ± 11 % decline with CABG (11. 3 ± 1. 9 to 5. 1 ± 1. 6 cm/s, p< 0. 0001), 54 ± 5 % with AVR (12. 6 ± 1. 4 to 5. 7 ± 0. 6 cm/s, p< 0. 001) and 49 % with left atrial myxoma excision (11. 3 to 15. 8 cm/s). This persisted immediately after pericardial opening to the end of surgery (61 ± 11 %, p< 0. 0001; 58 ± 7 %, p< 0. 0001; 59 % respectively). ConclusionsIt is full opening of the pericardium, and not cardiac surgery in general, which causes RV long axis decline following cardiac surgery.
