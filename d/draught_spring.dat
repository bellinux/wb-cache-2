40|$|The paper {{presents}} principal {{properties of}} 5 new cultivars of small grains {{created in the}} Center for Agricultural and Technological Research in Zaječar. They are as follows: Arena (winter bread wheat), Premium (winter malting barley), Tango (winter triticale), Center (spring oat) and Balsa (spring naked barley). In 2004 and 2005 these cultivars were registered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of the Republic of Serbia. The Arena cultivar has good indices of technological quality and high yield genetic potential which is successfully preserved even in dry years. The Premium cultivar, besides high yield capacity, has a very low protein grain content what makes it especially suitable for brewers industry. Triticale Tango is intended, in the first place, for animal feeds and like Arena cultivar. is highly tolerant to <b>draught.</b> <b>Spring</b> oat Center is Zaječar's first made oat cultivar in this group of small grains. Cultivar Balsa is the first spring six-row naked barley in Serbia and Montenegro. Creating of Balsa cultivar is the attempt to meet the future demands on the market. By the act of registering above mentioned cultivars the Center in Zajecar has completed and enlarged its already existing variety of small grains assortment...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{measurements}} of Musculus longissmus dorsi thoracis et lumborum (MLD) were taken of Dorper (n= 99) and Dorper x Merino (n= 65) lambs at 156 days {{of age and}} comparisons made to various body dimensions to ascertain whether sex, genotype, birth type and live weight had any effect on these parameters. Lambs were weaned two months after birth and placed ad libitum on basic dry land pasture during the <b>draught</b> <b>spring</b> and summer months of 2014 in the arid southeastern region of Turkey. Least square means of backfat thickness, skin+backfat thickness, muscle depth, body length, chest girth and live weight, at {{the mean age of}} 156 days, were 0. 17 cm, 0. 32 cm, 1. 75 cm, 63. 30 cm, 72. 37 cm and 25. 16 kg, respectively. Genotype was a statistically significant factor in terms of back fat thickness (BFT), skin and backfat thickness (S+BFT), muscle depth (MD), body length (BL) and live weight (LW). The study showed that Dorper and Dorper x Merino genotypes into Turkey show a clear advantage over the native breeds in terms of meat production and quality not to mention the high potential for lean carcass production. Ultrasonic {{measurements of}} Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (MLD) will provide an important contribution to selection index in breeding programs for Dorper and Dorper crossbred genotypes. However estimation of genetic parameters are required in containing a pedigree database in order to establish an effective selection index...|$|E
60|$|Fred {{felt very}} hungry, {{and could not}} resist the {{tendency}} to meditate on beefsteaks and savoury cutlets for some time after resuming his journey; but, after warming to the work, and especially after taking a long refreshing <b>draught</b> at a <b>spring</b> that bubbled like silver in the moonlight, these longings passed away. Hour after hour sped by, and still the sturdy youth held on at the same steady pace, for he knew well that to push beyond his natural strength in prolonged exertion would only deduct {{from the end of}} his journey whatever he might gain at the commencement.|$|R

Ay, {{and no more}} classed with the court Junkern I was with to-day. The dullards! No one {{reasonable}} thing know they but the chase. One had been at Florence; and when I asked him of the Baptistery and rare Giotto of whom my uncle told us, he asked {{if he were a}} knight of the Medici. All he knew was that there were ortolans at Ser Lorenzo's table; and he {{and the rest of them}} talked over wines as many and as hard to call as the roll of AEneas's comrades; and when each one must drink to her he loved best, and I said I loved none like my sweet mother, they gibed me for a simple dutiful mountaineer. Yea, and when the servants brought a bowl, I thought it was a wholesome <b>draught</b> of <b>spring</b> water after all their hot wines and fripperies. Pah!" ...|$|R
40|$|Self inflicted {{injury to}} the eyes {{including}} self-enucleation is a rare phenomenon. The authors describe a case of bilateral self-enucleation in a patient with paranoid schizophrenia. A review of literature shows that self-enucleation is correlated with moral,religious. and psychodynamic paradigms and various unconscious mechanisms ha ve been proposed to explain this unusual behaviour. Key words: Self-enucleation,deliberate self- harm, schizophrenia Self inflicted {{injury to the}} eyes, including self- diabetes(Tapper et al, 1979). Rosen and enucleation is a rare phenomenon. Despite this they are widely mentioned in ancient literature and assume a prominent place in mythology.

60|$|The {{effect of}} this futile {{interview}} upon Lady Harman was remarkable. She took to herself an absurd conviction that this inconclusiveness had been an achievement. Confronted by a dilemma, she had chosen neither horn and assumed an attitude of inoffensive defiance. Springs in England vary greatly in their character; some are easterly and quarrelsome, some are north-westerly and wetly disastrous, a bleak invasion from the ocean; some are but the broken beginnings of what {{are not so much}} years as stretches of meteorological indecision. This particular spring was essentially a south-westerly spring, good and friendly, showery but in the lightest way and so softly reassuring as to be gently hilarious. It was a spring to get into the blood of anyone; it gave Lady Harman the feeling that Mrs. Pembrose would certainly be dealt with properly and without unreasonable delay by Heaven, and that meanwhile it was well to take the good things of existence as cheerfully as possible. The good things she took were very innocent things. Feeling unusually well and enjoying great <b>draughts</b> of <b>spring</b> air and sunshine were the chief. And she took them only for three brief days. She carried the children down to Black Strand to see her daffodils, and her daffodils surpassed expectation. There was a delirium of blackthorn in the new wild garden she had annexed from the woods and a close carpet of encouraged wild primroses. Even the Putney garden was full of happy surprises. The afternoon following her visit to Black Strand was so warm that she had tea with her family in great gaiety on the lawn under the cedar. Her offspring were unusually sweet that day, they had new blue cotton sunbonnets, and Baby and Annette at least succeeded in being pretty. And Millicent, under the new Swiss governess, had acquired, it seemed quite suddenly, a glib colloquial French that somehow reconciled one to the extreme thinness and shapelessness of her legs.|$|R
60|$|His {{constant}} practice, both {{winter and}} summer, was {{to rise and}} set with the sun; and if the weather would permit, he never failed to walk in some unfrequented place, for three hours, both morning and evening, {{and there it is}} supposed he composed the following meditations. The chief part of his sustenance was milk, with a little bread boiled in it, of which in the morning, after his walk, he would eat the quantity of a pint, and sometimes more. Dinners he never eat any; and at night he would only have a pretty large piece of bread, and drink a <b>draught</b> of good <b>spring</b> water; and after this method he lived during the whole time he was at St. Helen's. It is observed of him that he never slept out of a bed, nor never lay awake in one; which I take to be an argument, not only of a strong and healthful constitution, but of a mind composed and calm, and entirely free from the ordinary disturbances of human life. He never gave the least signs of complaint or dissatisfaction at anything, unless it was when he heard the tinners swear, or saw them drunk; and then, too, he would {{get out of the way}} as soon as he had let them see, by some significant signs, how scandalous and ridiculous they made themselves; and against the next time he met them, would be sure to have a paper ready written, wherein he would represent the folly of drunkenness, and the dangerous consequences that generally attended it.|$|R
