Hemings remained enslaved in Jefferson's house until his death.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and <b>France</b> <b>or</b> Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E

5|$|The {{parliament}} first authorized approximately 871million Swiss francs {{to build}} 100Mirage IIIS under license. But this procurement was soon crushed under massive budget overruns {{and the government}} asked for an additional CHF 576million. The cost overruns {{were the result of}} fitting U.S. electronics to the French platform, installing hardpoints for moving the aircraft inside of the caverns by cranes, structural reinforcements for jet-assisted takeoffs, and other extras to improve the off-the-shelf Mirage IIIC. The wish to procure the Mirage IIIS was also boosted by the possibility that the Swiss could acquire aircraft-delivered nuclear weapons, either from <b>France</b> <b>or</b> by producing them themselves.|$|E
5|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Bogdan-Pitești was educated in Geneva, at a local Catholic institution. Raised in the Romanian Orthodox faith, he {{converted}} to Catholicism in his twenties, but was no longer a practicing Catholic by the time of his death. He supposedly attended medical school at the University of Montpellier, without ever graduating, and afterwards left to join the bohemian milieu of Paris. He may have enrolled at the University of Paris, studying Law and Letters, but probably withdrew after a short while. Art historian Sanda Miller recounts that Bogdan-Pitești attended the École des Beaux-Arts in the French capital, but that he was ultimately expelled. Other sources express doubt that the Romanian aristocrat was ever affiliated with any university or college, in either <b>France</b> <b>or</b> Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern <b>France</b> <b>or</b> Flanders.|$|E
5|$|During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences {{along the}} coasts of England {{to protect against the}} {{possibility}} of an invasion either by <b>France</b> <b>or</b> by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local level was fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E
5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} fodder was the single largest {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from <b>France</b> <b>or</b> Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated {{the amount of food}} they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.|$|E

5|$|In 1796 British Royal Navy {{dominance}} in the East Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars was challenged {{by the arrival of}} a squadron of six French Navy frigates, commanded by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey. Among these ships was the new 40-gun frigate Preneuse, commanded by Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Preneuse had not sailed from France with Sercey, instead passing independently through the Atlantic and uniting with the squadron at Port Louis on Île de France. Sercey deployed his squadron to the Dutch East Indies, but suffered frustration at the Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident of January 1797 and subsequently returned to the base at Port Louis. There the squadron began to fracture, with a succession of ships sent back to <b>France</b> <b>or</b> detached on independent missions.|$|E
5|$|In November 1700, Charles II of Spain died childless. The {{dispute over}} who should succeed him– the Bourbon Prince Philip of Anjou, {{grandson}} of Louis XIV of <b>France,</b> <b>or</b> the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria– soon plunged Europe {{into a major}} war. Louis XIV supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Savoy {{and some of the}} German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the barrier towns. In May 1702, England's Queen Anne formally declared war on France.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte then {{sailed to}} rejoin Sercey and the {{corvette}} Brûle-Gueule at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for a planned junction with an allied Spanish squadron at Manila. This combined force then attacked an East India Company convoy {{gathering in the}} Pearl River in January 1799, but in the ensuing Macau Incident they were driven off by the Royal Navy escort squadron. Dispirited, Sercey returned westwards to Île de France, narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large British squadron blockading the port. On arrival he discovered that Preneuse and Brûle-Gueule were the only ships remaining of his original command, the others having returned to <b>France</b> <b>or</b> been lost in battle.|$|E

5|$|Lord Ashley's mother {{decided to}} move back to her native France with the children. In August 1947, she {{remarried}} ColFrançois Goussault and the newly formed family settled in Paris. The children spent the next few years shuttling across the English Channel to their boarding schools, Eton for Lord Ashley and Heathfield School in Ascot for his sister, Frances. Holidays were alternately spent in <b>France</b> <b>or</b> with their grandparents at the Manor House in Wimborne St Giles. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Armoured Corps, where he did his national service, on 29 June 1957. On 29 October 1958, he was placed in the emergency reserve of the 10th Royal Hussars. Lord Ashley was 22 years old when he succeeded his grandfather.|$|E
5|$|Oldenburg {{participated in}} the {{ceremonial}} transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control {{in the summer of}} 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. She remained with the I Division in 1891; the year's maneuvers simulated a two-front war against Russia and either <b>France</b> <b>or</b> Denmark. In 1892, however, Württemberg replaced Oldenburg in the I Division, and the latter went into reserve. The ship remained out of service for the next five years. She returned to active duty in 1897 to join an international naval demonstration off the island of Crete, which had been annexed by Greece. The ship remained in the demonstration until March 1898, when Germany and Austria-Hungary withdrew their naval contingents in a show of dissatisfaction over the compromise solution, which left Crete under Ottoman control, but with a Greek prince.|$|E
5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, <b>France</b> <b>or</b> the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the bubble burst, Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E
