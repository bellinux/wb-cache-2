Emission of gravitational waves drives the f-mode (fundamental mode) unstable in fast-rotating, newborn neutron stars. The initial growth phase of the mode is followed by its saturation, because of energy leaking to other modes of the star. The saturation point determines the strain of the generated gravitational-wave signal, which can then be used to extract information about the neutron star equation of state. The parent (unstable) mode couples via parametric resonances with pairs of daughter modes, with the triplets' evolution exhibiting a rich variety of behaviors.

The complex morphological features involved in the nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode deformation.

Neutron stars are a place where both effects may be at work. We wish to decipher the solution of this problem {{in the context of}} r-modes <b>instability</b> in <b>neutron</b> stars, as it appears when these modes are coupled to gravitational radiation. We consider a rotating spherical shell filled with a viscous fluid but of infinite electrical conductivity and analyze propagation of modal perturbations when a dipolar magnetic field is bathing the fluid layer. We perform an extensive numerical analysis and find that the m= 2 r-mode oscillation is influenced by the magnetic field when the Lehnert number (ratio of Alfvén speed to rotation speed) exceeds a value proportional to the one-fourth power of the Ekman number (non-dimensional measure of viscosity). This scaling is interpreted as the coincidence of the width of internal shear layers of inertial modes and the wavelength of the Alfvén waves. Applied to the case of rotating magnetic neutron stars, we find that dipolar magnetic fields above 10 ^ 14 G are necessary to perturb the r-modes instability.

We apply it to the specific case of a class of cosmological SGWBs, known as the broken power-law models. We derive how the template density varies in their three-dimensional parameter space and show that for the LIGO 4 km detector pair, with LIGO-I sensitivities, about a few hundred templates will suffice to detect such a background while incurring a loss in signal-to-noise ratio of no more than 3 %.

Our formalism differs in two significant ways from a similar 3. 5 Post-Newtonian approach proposed by Blanchet (1993, 1997). Firstly we concentrate only on the radiation-reaction effects produced by a time-varying mass-current quadrupole $S_{ij}$. Secondly, we adopt a gauge in which the radiation-reaction force densities depend on the fourth time derivative of $S_{ij}$, rather than on the fifth, as in Blanchet's approach.

Under the force free approximation, the plasma dynamics is entirely determined by the magnetic field. The plasma provides the currents and charge densities required by the dynamics of electromagnetic fields, but these currents carry no inertia. We present a high order Godunov scheme to study such force-free electrodynamics. We have implemented weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) spatial interpolations in our scheme.

The entropy of strongly magnetized neutron matter turns out to be larger than the entropy of the nonpolarized matter.
