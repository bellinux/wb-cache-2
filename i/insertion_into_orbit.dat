40|$|A {{procedure}} for minimizing total impulsive Delta-V for constrained multiple-flyby trajectories, which was originally developed for application to satellite tours, has been modified for application to interplanetary trajectories.

30|$|Akatsuki was {{successfully}} inserted into orbit surrounding Venus during December 2016, {{but with a}} period of[*]~[*] 10  days, approximately[*]~[*] 8 times longer than the originally intended orbit. LAC can be powered only inside the umbra of Venus because the strong sunlight can cause damage to its detector. Therefore, the frequency of observation opportunities was reduced to 1 / 8 of that of the original plan. Adding to this decrease in observational frequency, the elongated orbit resulted in a more rapid motion of spacecraft near periapsis where LAC can observe the night side disk at a close distance, meaning that the duration of observation for one revolution was shorter {{than that of the}} original. Indeed, most of the observational periods were approximately 20 – 30  min, while the original plan anticipated sessions a few times longer. Thus, the total observational period per year was reduced to less than 10 % of that of the original plan because of the change in the orbital parameters. On the other hand, the successful <b>insertion</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> around Venus, 5  years later than the original plan, allowed for observations that would otherwise be completely impossible and promises with time to establish significant constraints on lightning activity on Venus.|$|E

40|$|Since its <b>insertion</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> about Mercury in March 2011, the MESSENGER {{spacecraft}} has imaged most previously unseen {{regions of}} the planet in unprecedented detail, revealing extensive regions of contiguous smooth plains at high northern latitudes and surrounding the Caloris basin. These smooth plains, thought to be emplaced by flood volcanism, are populated with several hundred ghost craters and basins, nearly to completely buried impact features having rims for which the surface expressions are now primarily rings of deformational landforms. Associated with some ghost craters are interior groups of graben displaying mostly polygonal patterns. The origin of these graben is not yet fully understood, but comparison with numerical models suggests {{that the majority of}} such features are the result of stresses from local thermal contraction. In this paper, we highlight a previously unreported category of ghost craters, quantify extensional strains across graben-bearing ghost craters, and make use of graben geometries to gain insights into the subsurface geology of smooth plains areas. In particular, the style and mechanisms of graben development imply that flooding of impact craters and basins led to substantial pooling of lavas, to thicknesses of ∼ 1. 5 km. In addition, surface strains derived from groups of graben are generally in agreement with theoretically and numerically derived strains for thermal contraction...|$|E
40|$|Field-aligned {{beams of}} suprathermal electrons, known as strahl, are a {{frequently}} observed constituent of solar wind plasma. However, {{the formation and}} interplanetary evolution of the strahl electron populations {{has yet to be}} fully understood. As strahl electrons travel away from the Sun, they move into regions of decreasing magnetic field strength and thus are subject to adiabatic focusing. However, the widths of strahl pitch angle distributions observed at 1 AU are significantly broader than expected. Previous investigations have found that the average observed strahl pitch angle width actually increases with heliocentric radial distance. This implies that strahl electrons must be subjected to some form of pitch angle scattering process or processes, details of which as of yet remain elusive. In this paper, we use Cassini electron measurements to examine strahl beams across a distance range of approximately 8 AU, from its Earth Flyby in 1999 until its <b>insertion</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> around Saturn in 2004. We find that, in general, there is a relatively constant rate of broadening of strahl pitch angle distributions with distance between similar to 1 and 5. 5 AU. Our results from beyond this distance indicate that the strahl population is likely to be completely scattered, presumably to form part of the halo. We find multiple energy dependences at different radial distances implying that there are multiple strahl scattering mechanisms in operation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the interaction of Io, Jupiter's innermost Galilean satellite, with the Io plasma torus. The interaction of Io with the plasma surrounding {{it has been a}} subject of interest for almost 30 years, dating from the discovery by Bigg (1964) that radio emissions from the Jovian magnetosphere are controlled by Io's position. Since that time, both ground-based and spacecraft observations have shown that Io is a unique satellite that influences the Jovian magnetosphere in important ways. In particular, material from Io is a major source of plasma for the magnetosphere, and the energy that this plasma harnesses from Jupiter's co-rotating magnetic field is an important power source for the magnetosphere. It is apparent that the local interaction of the torus plasma with Io {{plays a key role in}} the formation, composition, and energetics of the Io torus; the interaction is also highly nonlinear. We have modeled this interaction using time-dependent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. During this past year, we have used NASA support to develop a new MHD code to study the interaction. As part of the Galileo spacecraft's recent successful <b>insertion</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbit</b> around Jupiter, the spacecraft passed within 900 km of Io's surface.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric yaw steering law {{which has been}} used to provide closed-loop yaw guidance for the launch of the HEAO (High Energy Astronomy Observatory) satellite mission using the Atlas/Centaur launch vehicle. This bilinear tangent steering law provides near optimal yaw steering for maneuvers requiring <b>insertion</b> <b>into</b> <b>orbits</b> with a specified inclination and node. Bilinear tangent steering is shown to be optimal in both the pitch and yaw planes when a uniform gravitational field is assumed. The conditions under which the general bilinear tangent laws degenerate into linear tangent and constant attitude laws are presented. The flight computer implementation of these laws in a rotating coordinate system using real-time integration of the equations of motion is detailed. Explicit solution of the parametric guidance equations requires the inflight solution of (2 x 2) two-point boundary value problems in the pitch and yaw planes.
