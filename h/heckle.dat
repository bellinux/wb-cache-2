The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for.

5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she spoke and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to <b>heckle</b> her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

Yōichi Masuzoe, the Governor of Tokyo Metropolis, and other member of the assembly were drawn in by the <b>heckling</b> and scornfully laughed. The public pay attentions to who made the <b>heckling.</b> Hecklings are variable; sometime a <b>heckling</b> encourage the speaker and another time it injures speaker just like this matter. There has been a thinking that <b>heckling</b> can give humor and make discussion smooth since past World War II. Thus, some people think of <b>heckling</b> as good. According to Morita Minoru, Japanese political commentator, points out that though <b>heckling</b> has been since past, political leaders get bad at <b>heckling</b> other members, and the number of vulgar <b>heckles</b> has increased (2014). There are various arguments on {{whether or not this is}} sexism. For example, Tabojin Toshio, who run for the latest Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election, said that he did not understand why this is sexism (2014).|$|R
40|$|Two {{factors are}} {{important}} in understanding <b>heckling.</b> First, <b>heckling</b> is a negative comment on the speaker. This negative feedback tends to lower speaker effectiveness. Second, the relationship be'ween the heckler and the audience member is important. If th) audience member sees himself as more closely aligned to the speaker, <b>heckling</b> will increase speaker credibility. If he sees himself as more similar to the heckler, <b>heckling</b> will decrease speaker credibility. Two experiments are reported.

500|$|In {{the third}} debate, held in Hopkinsville, Hardin countered Bradley's {{offensive}} against {{him on the}} money issue by charging that {{the election of a}} Republican would lead to [...] "Negro domination" [...] of the state. This put Bradley in a dilemma. If he refused to acknowledge blacks' influence on the party, he would lose their votes; if he acknowledged it, he would lose many white voters. Bradley attempted to ignore the racial question in Hopkinsville and during the next two debates, instead intensifying his criticism of Hardin on the money question and his association with Tate. In the sixth joint debate, held August 30 at Eminence, some members of the audience began to <b>heckle</b> Bradley, who was hoarse from previous debates. After attempting to restart his opening statement four times, Bradley left the platform, and the next day announced he would not participate in any further joint debates {{as a result of the}} incident. Many believed Bradley was looking for a reason to end the debates in order to dodge the racial question, and the incident at Eminence gave him the opportunity. Some black Republicans resented Bradley's attempt to dodge the racial question and encouraged fellow blacks not to support Bradley but vote for Populist Thomas S. Pettit instead.|$|E
500|$|On December 5, Chiang Kai-shek paid a {{visit to}} a {{defensive}} encampment near Jurong to <b>heckle</b> his men to keep up the fight, but he was forced to beat a hasty retreat when the Japanese Army burst onto the battlefield guns blazing. On that day the rapidly moving forward contingents of the SEA occupied Jurong and then arrived at Chunhuazhen, a key point of Nanking's outer line of defense which would put Japanese artillery in range of the city. Here China's 51st Division flung its main force into the fighting and repeatedly repulsed Japanese attacks before cracking on December 8 when the main force of the SEA arrived. The SEA also took the fortress at Zhenjiang and the spa town of Tangshuizhen on that day. Meanwhile, {{on the south side of}} the same defense line, armored vehicles of Japan's 10th Army charged the Chinese position at Jiangjunshan and Niushoushan defended by China's 58th Division.

500|$|Watts Morgan was {{a socialist}} and trade unionist, {{but he was}} also a strong anti-communist and opposed [...] "the local men of Moscow", trade unionists who had embraced {{communism}} and whom he saw as extremists. In the 1929 election his main rival was well-known local Liberal Dr. R. D. Chalke, but the biggest interest came from the first communist challenger in the Rhondda, Arthur Horner. Although Watts Morgan had been unwell for {{the first few months of}} the year, he roused himself to attend the Ferndale May Day demonstration. When he discovered he was sharing the platform with Communist Party of Great Britain members, Horner, A. J. Cook and Dai Lloyd Davies, he left the stage and joined the crowd so he could <b>heckle</b> Horner's speech from the floor. Watts Morgan described Horner as [...] "the emissary of the blood-stained Comintern of Russia... working to break down the democratic Government and Trades Union organization of this country." [...] He had little cause for concern, and was re-elected to Rhondda East by a majority of almost 9,000. A smaller turnout in the 1931 election and the absence of a Liberal candidate may have led to Horner making a considerable advance against Watts Morgan in the number of votes polled, but Watts Morgans' majority remained substantial. Watts Morgan's death in 1933 forced a by-election, which was won by William Mainwaring.|$|E
50|$|On June 18, 2014, an assemblywoman Ayaka Shiomura was <b>heckled</b> in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly meeting.

Many people against the <b>heckling</b> asked for people who make <b>heckling</b> to be identified. Media overseas, CNN, BBC, and so on, also criticized the <b>heckling,</b> and reported on the endemic sexism that made such a thing possible, while the Japanese media tended to present it as a one-time case of sexual harassment. On June 23, assembly member Akihiro Suzuki came forward, saying {{he was one of}} the people who <b>heckled</b> her and he made a formal, public apology. The fact that a member of the LDP ruling party apologized publicly (bowing deeply) was seen as very big deal. Other hecklers never came forward.

5000|$|Dressing is {{the broad}} term {{referring}} to removing the fibers from the straw and cleaning {{it enough to}} be spun. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching and <b>heckling.</b> After breaking, some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, then the fiber is pulled through various sized <b>heckling</b> combs, or hackles. Different sized <b>heckling</b> combs are used, progressing from coarser combs {{with only a few}} prongs or nails per inch, to finer combs. Generally three <b>heckling</b> combs are used; however, many more can be used. The finer the final <b>heckling</b> comb, the finer the yarn spun from that flax can be. An example of a progression of five combs is first using a <b>heckling</b> comb with four nails per square inch, then one with 12 per inch, then 25, next 48, and finally 80 nails per inch. The first three remove the straw, and the last two split and polish the fibers.|$|R

After the match the fans rallied behind Volador Jr., giving him the crowd support that made CMLL return him to the tecnico side. Conversely the fans began to boo and <b>heckle</b> La Sombra, the supposed tecnico, leading to a change in how La Sombra was booked and presented by CMLL. La Sombra formed a partnership with Rush and effectively began working as a rudo, though the two refused to acknowledge themselves as such, instead referring to themselves as [...] "técnicos diferentes" [...] ("a different kind of good guy"). On June 6, La Sombra defeated Volador Jr. with help from Rush and La Máscara to win the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship in a match, where La Sombra's Historic Middleweight Championship was also on the line. The trio of Sombra, Rush and La Máscara was eventually named Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernables"). On August 1 at El Juicio Final, La Sombra lost the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship back to Volador Jr. Later in August, La Sombra made it to the finals of the 2014 Universal Championship tournament, before losing to Último Guerrero.

500|$|While {{still at}} Stanford, Simon's first job was a {{newspaper}} sports cartoonist for The San Francisco Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner. After graduating, {{he worked as}} a television storyboard artist, and later a writer, at Filmation Studios. There he worked on several animated shows, including The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and <b>Heckle</b> & Jeckle and Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (1979). Simon recalls Filmation approving of his work because he was [...] "self-taught and unschooled," [...] but Simon felt the majority of what the studio produced was [...] "awful". On the suggestion of Filmation producer Lou Scheimer who was impressed by Simon's writing ability, Simon submitted a spec script for the series Taxi which was produced and aired in 1981 during its third season. Simon was hired as a writer, quickly becoming showrunner for its fifth and final season in 1983. Simon next worked as a writer and producer on Cheers from seasons one to three (1982–1985), writing five episodes: [...] "Endless Slumper", [...] "Battle of the Ex's", [...] "Fairytales Can Come True", [...] "Cheerio Cheers" [...] and [...] "The Bartender's Tale". Simon created, wrote and produced the short-lived sitcom Shaping Up in 1984, alongside Ken Estin; the show starred Leslie Nielsen as a gym owner and ran for five episodes on ABC. Simon also wrote and produced for Best of the West (1981), Barney Miller (1982) and It's Garry Shandling's Show (1987–1988), and wrote the 1991 film The Super.|$|E

Angered, Brian decides to move out and become roommates with a reluctant Limbaugh. Brian begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion.

Deciding to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, Brian attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, causing Limbaugh to become frustrated and throw him out. Deciding to prove his devotion to the conservative cause, Brian attempts to waterboard Pelosi before being apprehended and arrested. After being bailed out by Limbaugh later that day, Brian continues to assert his conservatism. Limbaugh attempts to convince Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He tells Brian that a child was executed in Texas and Brian is visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Rush leaves the jail, making a Grapes of Wrath-like pledge to [...] "be around" [...] wherever conservative causes need help.

500|$|During {{the writing}} process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, {{but they made}} their final {{decision}} with newly created character Judge Doom. Doom {{was supposed to have}} an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons. Doom's five-man [...] "Weasel Gang" [...] (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy and Dopey) who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). There were originally seven weasels to mimic the dwarf's complement, but eventually two of them, Slimey and Slezey, were written out of the script. Further references included The [...] "Ink and Paint Club" [...] resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of [...] "The Dip" [...] to eliminate all the Toons as Hitler's Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who [...] killed Bambi's Mother, but Disney objected to the idea. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a Taxicab.

However, the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film's title, working titles included Murder in Toontown, Toons, Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills, The Toontown Trial, Trouble in Toontown, and Eddie Goes to Toontown.|$|E

40|$|The present paper aims {{to model}} the {{interactional}} operation of <b>heckling,</b> which has received little attention in impoliteness and interaction studies, {{despite the fact that}} studying this phenomenon has various advantages for the analyst. In order to fill this knowledge gap, I approach <b>heckling</b> by combining Turner’s (1982) anthropological framework with my interaction-based relational ritual theory (e. g. Kádár 2012, 2013; Kádár and Bax 2013). Following Turner, I define <b>heckling</b> as a ‘social drama’, which is evaluated by its watchers as ‘judges’. In accordance with my relational ritual framework I argue that <b>heckling</b> is a mimetic ritualistic mini-performance, which is inherently interactional as it operates in the adjacent action pair of the heckler’s performance and the public speaker/performer’s counter-performance. Adopting Turner’s terminology, <b>heckling</b> is a ritualistic performance of ‘anti-structure’, i. e. it upsets the regular social — and consequently interactional — structure of a setting. Successful counter-performance is a ritual of ‘structure’, which restores the normal social structure of the event, as the public speaker/performer regains control over the interaction. Through the social actions of performance and counter-performance the <b>heckled</b> and the heckler aim to affiliate themselves with the audience, who are ‘metaparticipants’ of the ritualistic interaction, and with the watchers/listeners in the case of video/audio-recorded interactions, who can be defined as ‘lay observers’ (cf. Kádár and Haugh 2013). Approaching <b>heckling</b> as a theatrical type of relational ritual helps us capture various complexities of this phenomenon, such as its relationship with certain interactional settings and metaparticipant expectations/evaluations, and its interface with related phenomena such as impolitenes...|$|R
