40|$|Processes of transnationalization of {{industrial}} relations have been redrawing {{and increasing the}} complexity of the industrial relations map, adding new levels, actors and institutions, and creating new horizontal and vertical relationships and interdependencies. To capture these changes, we propose a multi-governance perspective enriched by due attention to power relations. We then apply this perspective to analyse the evolution of European social dialogue (ESD), showing that the conventional reading of ESD moving from dependency to autonomy is a false one: negotiated regulation emanating from the ESD rests on two-directional relations, between the European and national levels involving autonomy and dependency at the same time. It also involves differing forms of horizontal interdependency between private actors and the public authorities. To show its wider applicability, we also briefly relate this approach to International Framework <b>Agreements</b> and European <b>Works</b> <b>Council</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R

For {{the first time in}} many years the [...] "real money" [...] (inflation adjusted) wage levels in the IG Metall industry sectors went backwards. It was little consolation that across the economy as a whole wages actually fell by 1.6% in 1967 and by 1.0% in 1968. At the same time, within the North Württemberg / North Baden region, large numbers of employees achieved reclassifications of their jobs which compensated for the disappointing level of the headline increase. The parties also agreed in principal to guarantee the basic levels in the Stuttgart region.

40|$|A {{model by}} Huebler and Jirjahn (2003) {{suggests}} that rent-seeking activities of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> are more limited in establishments covered by collective bargaining. The model predicts that <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> {{should have a}} stronger productivity effect and a weaker wage effect in covered than in uncovered establishments. While empirical studies have provided supporting evidence for the predicted productivity effects, the results on the wage effects of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in covered and uncovered establishments are very mixed. This article extends Huebler and Jirjahn's model to reconcile the empirical findings. The extended model takes into account that collective bargaining coverage not only limits the opportunities for rent-seeking activities but also strengthens the effectiveness of performance-enhancing work practices negotiated between <b>employers</b> and <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> The latter influence of collective bargaining coverage {{can result in a}} higher wage effect of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in covered establishments...|$|R
40|$|First {{fissures}} in the West German industrial order {{were observed}} in the 1980 s when unions divided over {{how to respond to}} persistend unemployment. Opposing the reduction od weekly working hours pursued by the left wind of the union movement, the Kohl government invited <b>employers,</b> <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and dissenting unions to rely on the social security system for reducing the supply of labour. Simultaneously it took steps to curtail union power. For a short time, unification restored tripartite co-operation as government, business and labour worked hand in hand to transfer West German institutions to the new Länder of the east. The ensuing economic crisis, which was exacerbated by the accelerated internationalisation of European economies, drove a wedge in the employers' camp, caused a mismatch between institutionalised union strength and economic conditions, and forced the government to do something about rising social security expenditures and public debt. When in 1996 government attempts at consensual labour market and social security reform failed - mainly due to opposition in the government camp demanding more aggressive intervention - a solution was sought by unilateral legislation. Causing unprecedented union protest while falling short of business demands, it contributed to Kohl's defeat two years later. " (excerpt...|$|R

30|$|The {{question}} on unions and investment returns {{us to the}} German research literature. As Metcalf correctly anticipated in his survey, this literature on unions and firm performance {{is in a state}} of flux because of the ongoing decentralization of collective bargaining. But it is also an issue of emphasis. Until very recently, the research literature focused on either unions or works councils—more typically the latter. Yet, as is widely known, German industrial relations conform to a dual system, with collective agreements traditionally being negotiated at the industry level between trade unions and <b>employer</b> associations, while <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> operate at the plant level. <b>Works</b> <b>councils,</b> though formally independent of unions, oversee the implementation and coordination of collective agreements at the workplace level and have important information, consultation, and codetermination rights under law. The two institutions need to be considered in tandem.|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of enterprises is engaged in international markets. In order {{to be successful in}} these markets, enterprises are forced to base their personnel policy on stronger internationally orientated considerations. One instrument useful to realise this goal is to send employees to an establishment abroad. However, several problems might arise due to diverging interests and goals of employer and employees concerning the entry in the foreign enterprise. The study analyses how these problems are solved, i. e. whether individual contracts or collective agreements concluded between <b>employer</b> and <b>works</b> <b>council</b> are applied. The analysis is based on theoretical considerations {{as well as on the}} results of several case studies that have been conducted in enterprises in Rhineland-Palatinate. The analysis leads to the result that collective agreements are but exceptional cases. Existing regulations in this area nomally contain regulations concerning the selection, arrangements to prepare the stay abroad and the remuneration. The assistance abroad and the reintegration in the enterprises sending employees abroad are aspects being regulated less often. The results seem to indicate a correlation between the existence of such collective agreements and the number of employees, the number of establishrnents abroad, as well as the proportion of export. However, the existence of a <b>works</b> <b>council</b> seems to have no influence on the conclusion of regulations in this area. These results, as well as a discussion with experts have led to the following conlusion: the lack of information and knowledge on aspects to be negotiated between <b>works</b> <b>council</b> and <b>employer</b> results in only a few collective agreements being concluded in this area. In order to close this gap, an examplary agreement has been elaborated. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} popular {{wisdom that}} economic globalization uniformly increases working time in industrialized countries. International investment and trade, they argue, have uneven effects for workplace bargaining over standard hours and over work-time flexibility, such as use of temporary or fixed work contracts. The authors explain how such globalization {{will tend to}} more substantially decrease standard hours than it does work-time flexibility. And they explain how <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> and union-led collective bargaining alter the way globalization affects both aspects of working time. The analysis of German enterprise data supports these expectations. Measures of globalization diminish standard working hours but yield more temporary work, fixed-contract work, and flexible working arrangements. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> and collective bargaining, however, mediate these effects in contrasting ways. Among enterprises without <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> or collective <b>agreements</b> globalization triggers more standard hours, but among firms with such representation globalization triggers fewer hours. With respect to flexibility, however, globalization increases use of temporary or fixed-term contracts more strongly where <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> or collective bargaining are present than when they are not. In short, economic openness has uneven consequences for working time, and firm-level labor representation channels those consequences in ways that highlight political agency in how people respond to globalization...|$|R

Whether the challenges lie in mastering technological advances, responding to sluggish economic performance, or coping with the pressures of deregulation, workers’ rights – {{and in particular the}} processes of involvement and social dialogue – are an essential part of managing the present and shaping the future. This chapter opens with a summary and update of the impact and progression of the Commission’s REFIT programme, particularly in the area of collective rights to information and consultation, or individual rights in employment contracts, for example, as well as in relation to a suite of occupational health and safety protection legislation. Turning to the contribution of the social partners, we highlight the results achieved to date, in the social dialogue at both cross-sectoral and sectoral levels, with regard to managing technological changes.

30|$|Lack of {{articulation}} {{has been}} a recurrent theme {{in the literature on}} collective bargaining in Spain, Portugal, Greece and France. Costa (2012 : 405) notes juridification, excessive competition among unions, lack of self-regulation and recurrent state intervention as impediments to collective bargaining in Portugal. Xavier (2004 : 194 – 5) finds collective bargaining incoherent “because these forms of bargaining (i.e. interprofessional, sectoral, regional or company, auth.) are not articulated”. According to Barreto (1992 : 471), “the tension between an over-regulated and highly legalistic framework and voluntary collective bargaining may help explain why formal company bargaining is so rare in the private sector, and why industry bargaining has so little impact on working conditions and terms of employment in leading or even average enterprises.” He sees this as a legacy of the state-corporatist regime, which compensated the repression of unions and limitations on collective bargaining by legalistic rules of protection. The legal reform of 2009 introduced the possibility that in firms of 500 and more staff, the <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> negotiate enterprise <b>agreements</b> that override the standards set in sector agreements. In the Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika, signed in 2011, the threshold was lowered to 250 and in the Labour Code of 2012 to 150. The suggestion of the Troika to strike the unions’ veto from the law was not taken up and <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> can only sign agreements when unions allow it. The 2012 reform specifies that provisions of enterprise agreements take priority over those contained in sector agreement unless employers and trade unions insert a clause to the contrary in sectoral agreements. Note that according to the European Company Survey of 2009, Portugal, along with Greece and some countries in CEE, had the weakest and least diffused system of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> in the EU.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} gain more {{insights}} into <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness in two ways: 1. studying the influence of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence on organizational outcomes; and, 2. studying the determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness. We found that productivity increases {{with the presence of}} a <b>works</b> <b>council.</b> <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> in smaller organizations (less than 50 employees), have a positive effect in reorganizations without layoffs. Creating acceptance for reorganizations, can lead to understanding among employees. In reorganizations with layoffs, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence is negatively related to productivity in small organizations. Layoffs may signal to employees that the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> did not do its best to prevent bad consequences for the employees, and that it is siding with management. Our study of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effects on labor turnover revealed that in good times, <b>works</b> <b>council</b> presence does not affect voluntary quits, and is associated with more hires and layoffs. In bad times, in organizations with a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> more voluntary quits are reported, hires are not affected, and less involuntary quits occur. <b>Works</b> <b>councils</b> might thus place the organizational interests above employee interests in good economic times, and the other way around in bad economic times. We employed an experimental design {{to gain more}} insights into the fundamental processes underlying <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advice. Managers had to choose to set a low or high price for their products. Part of the managers received an advice from a <b>works</b> <b>council,</b> advising high or low. Managers only follow the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advice when it is in line with playing Nash (choosing “low”). This reflects the conflict of interests that exists between management and works councils; if the goals are more aligned, cooperation is more likely to occur. Furthermore, prosocial managers tended to follow the advice of <b>works</b> <b>councils</b> more often. They even chose a high price when the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> advised to play a low price. These results support earlier research, suggesting that a favorable attitude towards the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> often leads to more effective <b>works</b> <b>councils.</b> We found that the position in the organizational social network did not show positive effects for the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> members. Influence tactics used by the works councilors were more important, and mostly regarding influence towards management. These influence tactics for example include behaving rationally, and searching for support from persons higher in the organization. To come to a more integrative model of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> effectiveness, combining determinants and outcomes, we conducted case study research. We found support for some of our earlier findings, and we identified new important determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Management attitude was again identified as one of the crucial elements affecting <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Further, influence tactics are important. Relations with management, as well as relations with employees and internally, are important determinants of <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence. Also, a well understood and well performed dual task of the <b>works</b> <b>council</b> was expected to lead to higher <b>works</b> <b>council</b> influence...|$|R
