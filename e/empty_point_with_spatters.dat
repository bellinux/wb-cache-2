It is in fact a groupoid (a category such that every morphism is invertible) whose 13 objects are the 13 points, and whose morphisms from x to y are the operations taking the <b>empty</b> <b>point</b> from x to y. The morphisms fixing the <b>empty</b> <b>point</b> form a group isomorphic to the Mathieu group M12 with 12×11×10×9×8 elements.|$|R

Guards cannot jump a captain. Jumps are mandatory, including multiple successive jumps, if possible. A multi-jump can consist of jumps in different directions. If more than one guard can jump, the player can choose which guard to jump with.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} three-dimensional (3 -D) cytomorphology in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). STUDY DESIGN: FNAB {{was performed}} on tumors from five patients with MTC. The aspirate was stained and observed under a light microscope (LM). The aspirate was also fixed, dehydrated, critical <b>point</b> dried, <b>spattered</b> <b>with</b> gold ions and observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the specimen was fixed, dehydrated, embedded in an Epon mixture, cut with an ultramicrotome, mounted on copper grids, electron doubly stained with uranium acetate and lead citrate, and observed with TEM. Findings under SEM were correlated with those under LM and TEM. RESULTS: Under SEM, 3 -D cytomorphology of MTC displayed a disorganized cellular arrangement with indistinct cell borders in three cases. The cell surface was uneven and had granular protrusions that corresponded to secretory granules observed under TEM. In one case with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIB, there were abundant granules on the cell surface. In one case of sporadic MTC with multinucleated tumor giant cells and small cells, granular protrusions also were noted on the cell surface. CONCLUSION: Granular protrusion was a characteristic finding in FNAB of MTC under SEM and might be helpful in the differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} three-dimensional (3 -D) cytomorphology and {{its relationship}} with clinical stage in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). STUDY DESIGN: FNAB was performed in tumors from 34 patients with PTC. The aspirate was stained and observed under a light microscope (LM). The aspirate was also fixed, dehydrated, critical <b>point</b> dried, <b>spattered</b> <b>with</b> gold ions and observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Findings under SEM were correlated with the presentation under LM and also with clinical stage. As a control, FNAB was also performed on {{a normal part of}} the thyroid in six patients. RESULTS: Under SEM, normal thyroid cells appeared as round, scattered cells or sheets with a uniform honeycomb cellular arrangement. In PTC, cell sheets with uniform nuclear morphology under LM usually showed a uniform cell arrangement and with distinct cell borders under SEM. Cell sheets with nuclear pleomorphism under LM usually showed a more-disorganized arrangement and with indistinct cell borders under SEM. PTC at advanced clinical stages usually presented with a disorganized cell arrangement, indistinct cell borders and loss of microvilli. CONCLUSION: 3 -D cytomorphology in FNAB of PTC was related to clinical stage and might be a prognostic factor for PTC...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} three-dimensional (3 -D) cytomorphology in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of parathyroid lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Ultrasound- guided FNAB {{was performed}} on parathyroid lesions from 10 patients with hyperparathyroidism. The aspirates were stained and observed under a light microscope (LM). The aspirates were also fixed, dehydrated, critical <b>point</b> dried, <b>spattered</b> <b>with</b> gold ions and observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Findings under SEM were correlated with the appearances under LM {{as well as with}} serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations. RESULTS: Under LM, nine cases displayed isokaryosis and one case, anisokaryosis. These appearances corresponded to isocytosis or anisocytosis under SEM. Under SEM, 3 -D cytomorphology of parathyroid lesions displayed isocytotic, scattered cells in five cases, uniform cellular arrangements in four cases and anisocytotic, scattered cells in one case. The cell surface was rather smooth in five cases. The other five cases had significant granules on the cell surfaces; these all had serum PTH concentrations = 3 D 268 pg/mL. CONCLUSION: 3 -D cytomorphology in FNAB of parathyroid lesions was a rather smooth cell surface in cases with low serum PTH and a granular cell surface in cases with significantly increased serum PTH. These characteristics and the absence of microvilli might be helpful in the differential diagnosis between parathyroid and follicular thyroid lesions...|$|R
