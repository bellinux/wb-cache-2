2500|$|The {{surrounding}} City Hall Plaza {{has experienced}} a similar change in assessment over time.

[...] On the other hand, in 2009, The Cultural Landscape Foundation included City Hall Plaza as one of thirteen national [...] "Marvels of Modernism" [...] in its exhibition and publication. [...] Several rounds of efforts to liven up City Hall Plaza have yielded only minimal changes, with the challenge being, in part, the numerous approvals required at the city, state and federal level.|$|R
