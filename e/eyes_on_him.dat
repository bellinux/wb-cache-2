When the Australians toured in 1966–67, he scored 107 in 160 minutes for a strong South African XI against them before the First Test, but despite several failures by the top-order batsmen in the Test series, he was unable to break into the national side.|$|E

2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo. It marked his third appearance in the show, after the pilot, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and the season three episode [...] "Clear". Gimple explained {{in an interview with}} The Hollywood Reporter that Morgan's appearance was the [...] "beginning of something" [...] for the character, but would not state further; he instead said, [...] "Looking at him, how he's dressed, how he's acting — it's not a 42-minute episode there — but you get some hints about where he's at. I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last time we saw him. He looks pretty well put together. You know, he’s not talking to himself. I would say that, just laying <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E
