40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that confined laminar diffusion flames established in an <b>inverted</b> <b>burner</b> are very stable and emit soot when the global equivalence ratio exceeds a critical value. An inverted diffusion flame {{can be used as a}} stable source of soot particles for development and intercomparison of various particle sizing techniques. Unlike normal coflow diffusion flames fired upward, inverted diffusion flames fired downward experience a negative gravity, the resultant flow fields are very different, and the residence time is significantly prolonged. The different flow fields in normal and inverted diffusion flames mean that the flame structure and soot formation characteristics are significantly different. This study makes a first attempt to numerically investigate the flame properties and soot formation in confined laminar coflow CH 4 /air diffusion flames established in an inverted axisymmetric burner at atmospheric pressure. A fairly detailed reaction mechanism, GRI Mech 3. 0, was used to model combustion chemistry. Soot formation was modeled using a semi-empirical, acetylene-based, two-equation soot model. Radiation heat transfer was calculated using the discrete-ordinates method and a wide-band non-gray gas model. Numerical calculations were conducted over a relatively narrow range of global equivalence ratio of 0. 54 - 0. 67 based on a recent experimental study. The heat transfer boundary condition was found to be important to the prediction of soot emission and the velocity distribution. Using measured temperature distribution along the quartz tube, the numerical model successfully predicted the emission of soot under the conditions investigated and revealed the flow, temperature, and species concentration distributions in the inverted coflow diffusion flames for the first time. However, the predicted primary soot particle diameters are significantly smaller than those reported in the literature based on TEM images analysis of sampled soot. The discrepancies between the numerical results and experimental data can be attributed to the deficiency of the simple soot model and the approximate treatment of the heat transfer boundary conditions at the quartz tube.

40|$|We {{developed}} an <b>inverted,</b> co-flow, methane/air/nitrogen <b>burner</b> that generates {{a wide range}} of soot particles sizes and concentrations. By adjusting the flow rates of air, methane, and nitrogen in the fuel, the mean electric mobility diameter and number concentration are varied. Additional dilution downstream of the flame allows us to generate particle concentrations spanning those produced by spark-ignited and diesel engines: particles with mean diameters between 50 and 250 nm and number concentrations from 4. 7 {center_dot} 10 {sup 4 } to 10 {sup 7 } cm{sup - 3 }. The range of achievable number concentrations, and therefore volume concentrations, can be increased by a factor of 30 by reducing the dilution ratio. These operating conditions make this burner valuable for developing and calibrating diagnostics as well as for other studies involving soot particles...|$|R
50|$|Like most {{gasoline}} stoves, the Svea 123 uses an <b>inverted</b> bell-shaped <b>burner</b> {{topped with}} a flame spreader (sometimes called a “target burner” or “plate burner” design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes {{the bottom of the}} flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by Bernoulli effect entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone). As a result, this design works best at high fuel output levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the fuel output is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased. At very low fuel output levels, the fuel will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the flame spreader and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.|$|R
