40|$|Summary. In {{frequent}} subgraph mining one {{tries to}} find all subgraphs that occur with a user-specified minimum frequency in a given graph database. The basic approach is to grow subgraphs, adding an edge and maybe a node in each step, to {{count the number of}} database graphs containing them, and to eliminate infrequent subgraphs. The predominant method to avoid redundant search (the same subgraph can be grown in several ways) is to define a canonical form that uniquely identifies a graph up to automorphisms. The obvious alternative, a repository of processed subgraphs, has received fairly little attention yet. However, if the repository is laid out as a hash table with a carefully designed hash function, this approach is competitive with canonical <b>form</b> <b>pruning.</b> In experiments we conducted, the repository-based approach could sometimes outperform canonical <b>form</b> <b>pruning</b> by 15 %. ...|$|E
40|$|Small {{volumes of}} timber {{are now being}} {{produced}} from Acacia mangium plantations in Indonesia. These trees require pruning and thinning to increase the strength and appearance of the wood. However, cut surfaces from pruning are potential infection courts for the entry of decay-causing fungi like heart rot. This study investigated the effects of pruning on stem form and the incidence of heart rot in an 18 -month-old plantation of Acacia mangium in South Sumatra. The objectives were to assess whether pruning is associated {{with an increase in}} the incidence of heart rot and whether <b>form</b> <b>pruning</b> compared to lift pruning reduced the incidence of heart rot and improved stem form. <b>Form</b> <b>pruning</b> removed 25 % of leaf area by removing large branches and those subtending a narrow angle with the stem up to 3 m height, and lift pruning removed 25 % of crown length from below. Trees in these treatments were singled before pruning. The third treatment, a control, was not singled and was used to assess base levels of heart rot. No significant difference in diameter increment between the two pruning treatments was found. There was strong evidence that <b>form</b> <b>pruning</b> was associated with better form 18 months after treatment. Trees in this treatment had a reduced number of branches > 30 mm diameter and improved stem straightness (reduced kink). Lift pruning reduced average branch size but did not improve stem straightness. No heart rot was detected in any treatment. The results showed that <b>form</b> <b>pruning</b> is likely to have positive benefits on stem straightness and is likely to be effective to any selected pruning height. However a subsequent lift pruning is still considered a requirement. While wounds created from pruning and singling are assumed to have a large impact on the incidence of heart rot, this may not be an issue unless there is a sufficient source of fungi present in the environment to invade the wound...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{common problem}} in {{frequent}} graph mining {{is the size}} of the output, which can easily exceed the size of the database to analyze. In the application area of molecular fragment mining a promising approach to tackle this problem is to treat certain substructures as a unit. Among such structures, rings are most prominent, and by requiring that either a ring is present as a whole in a fragment, or not at all, the size of the output can be reduced considerably. In this paper I present two ways to combine such ring mining with canonical <b>form</b> <b>pruning.</b> ...|$|E

50|$|Pruning {{can help}} to control fruit size, plant size, harvest date and to simplify the {{harvesting}} of fruits. Cutting the tip of young plants leads to the desired branch height. Once the tree shape has been <b>formed,</b> <b>pruning</b> is reduced to the removal of old or dead wood and previously fruited branches, since branches that have already carried fruits will produce smaller fruits with lower quality the next time. Light pruning leads to medium-sized, heavy pruning to large sized fruits. Basal shoots should be removed. When plants are grown in greenhouses, pruning prevents excessive vegetative growth.|$|R

40|$|Every year, countless urban {{trees are}} {{affected}} by storms, causing property damage, electric outages, human injuries, and fatalities. Factors such as tree <b>form,</b> size, species, <b>pruning,</b> and wood material properties impact tree resistance to storm damage. There is little empirical data examining the impact of branch reduction on tree dynamic properties, and no apparent data on the strength and failure patterns of sizable dominant limbs subjected to reduction cuts, a common practice for improving form and reducing risk. This dissertation is comprised of three studies that examined how branch breaking strength is affected by orientation and pruning, and how crown <b>form</b> and <b>pruning</b> affect the dynamic response of young shade trees. An examination {{of the effect of}} branch reorientation on breaking strength indicated that breaking stress for horizontally reoriented branches was double that of vertically reoriented branches. Horizontal branches usually failed near the branch base, whereas vertical branches tended to fail beyond the first lateral branch. The study testing the effects of crown <b>form</b> and <b>pruning</b> on dynamic response indicated that excurrent trees had a higher natural frequency than decurrent trees, and pruning in summer increased the frequency of excurrent trees more than decurrent trees. Tree <b>form</b> and <b>pruning</b> had little effect on damping ratio. Percent branch mass in {{the top half of the}} crown was greater for decurrent trees than excurrent trees, which could result in larger wind induced stress and increase the risk of failure.   Breaking strength of branches 8 years after codominant stem removal showed an inverse relationship between breaking stress and diameter of pruning cuts. There was no relationship between decay and wound wood cross-sectional area, but there was a strong inverse relationship between decayed wood and wound wood moment of inertia (I),indicating that wound wood growing near the periphery of stem cross sections had a greater effect on breaking strength than loss of strength from decay 8 years after pruning. Breaking stress of pruned branch sections was less than control branch sections. However, percent loss in Ifor pruned branch sections was below the threshold for action recommended in the literature for strength loss in tree trunks...|$|R

Our model breaks the traditional symmetry of rational zero-sum games where players have exactly opposed goals (min vs. max), is more widely applicable than min-max and also supports a <b>form</b> of <b>pruning,</b> despite it being less effective than alpha-beta. Actually, min-max games {{may be seen}} as particular cases where both the game and its dual are tropical: when the dual of a tropical game is also tropical, the power of alpha-beta is completely recovered. We formally develop the model and prove that the tropical pruning strategy is correct, then conclude by showing how the problem of approximated parsing can be modeled as a tropical game, profiting from pruning.

40|$|Evaluation metrics for rule {{learning}} typically, {{in one way}} or another, {{trade off}} consistency and coverage. In this work, we investigate this tradeoff for three different families of rule learning heuristics, all of them featuring a parameter that implements this trade-off in different guises. These heuristics are the m-estimate, the F-measure, and the Klösgen measures. The main goals of this work are to extend our understanding of these heuristics by visualizing their behavior via isometrics in coverage space, and to determine optimal parameter settings for them. Interestingly, even though the heuristics use quite different ways for implementing this trade-off, their optimal settings realize quite similar evaluation functions. Our empirical results on a large number of datasets demonstrate that, even though we do not use any <b>form</b> of <b>pruning,</b> the quality of the rules learned with these settings outperforms standard rule learning heuristics and approaches the performance of Ripper, a state-of-the-art rule learning system that uses extensive pruning and optimization phases. ...|$|R

Interestingly, these spatial and temporal expression patterns coincide with the expression of prune binding partners, the NM 23 family members. Overexpression of prune in retinal precur- sor cells significantly increases the ratio of Müller glial cells as observed by modulation of NM 23 activity (Mochizuki et al., 2009).

In addition, multiple lines of genetic evidence demonstrate an intrinsic role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in axon pruning; for example, loss-of-function mutations of the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E 1) or proteasome subunits in MB neurons block axon pruning.
