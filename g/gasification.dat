5|$|To {{increase}} the EROEI, several combined technologies were proposed. These include {{the usage of}} process waste heat, e.g. <b>gasification</b> or combustion of the residual carbon (char), and the usage of waste heat from other industrial processes, such as coal <b>gasification</b> and nuclear power generation.|$|E
5|$|Gas Works Park {{features}} the preserved superstructure of a coal <b>gasification</b> plant closed in 1956. Located across Lake Union from downtown, the park provides panoramic {{views of the}} Seattle skyline.|$|E
5|$|RTI {{scientists}} helped identify {{toxic chemicals}} in the Love Canal in the 1970s. In 1978, RTI researched the possibility of improving solar cells for the US Department of Energy and coal <b>gasification</b> for the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. It trained Chinese government employees on using computer models to forecast pollution patterns before the 2007 Olympics in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Third-generation {{renewable}} energy technologies {{are still under}} development and include advanced biomass <b>gasification,</b> biorefinery technologies, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and ocean energy. Third-generation technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other {{renewable energy}} technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research and development funding.|$|E
5|$|Third-generation {{technologies}} {{are still under}} development and include advanced biomass <b>gasification,</b> biorefinery technologies, concentrating solar thermal power, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and ocean energy. Advances in nanotechnology may also play a major role". First-generation {{technologies are}} well established, second-generation technologies are entering markets, and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long-term research and development commitments, where the public sector has a role to play.|$|E
5|$|During the 1974 {{legislative}} session, Ford {{proposed a}} six-year study of coal liquefaction and <b>gasification</b> {{in response to}} the 1973 oil crisis. He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal <b>gasification</b> and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal <b>gasification</b> plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E
25|$|Incineration {{with energy}} {{recovery}} {{is one of}} several waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies such as <b>gasification,</b> pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion. While incineration and <b>gasification</b> technologies are similar in principle, the energy product from incineration is high-temperature heat whereas combustible gas is often the main energy product from <b>gasification.</b> Incineration and <b>gasification</b> may also be implemented without energy and materials recovery.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the final}} fuel form, <b>gasification</b> itself and {{subsequent}} processing neither directly emits nor traps greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Power consumption in the <b>gasification</b> and syngas conversion processes may be significant though, and may indirectly cause CO2 emissions; in slagging and plasma <b>gasification,</b> the electricity consumption may even exceed any power production from the syngas.|$|E
25|$|In principle, <b>gasification</b> {{can proceed}} from {{just about any}} organic material, {{including}} biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it {{may be used for}} power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischerâ€“Tropsch process. In many <b>gasification</b> processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some <b>gasification</b> processes (slagging <b>gasification)</b> this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging <b>gasification</b> is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E
25|$|Ash {{is formed}} in <b>gasification</b> from {{inorganic}} impurities in the coal. Some of these impurities {{react to form}} microscopic solids which can be suspended in the syngas produced by <b>gasification.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the <b>Gasification</b> and Syngas Technologies Council, a trade association, {{there are}} {{globally}} 272operating <b>gasification</b> plants with 686gasifiers and 74plants with 238gasifiers under construction. Most of them use coal as feedstock.|$|E
25|$|ILs, {{especially}} imidazolium-based ILs {{have been}} found effective in pretreatment of coal before use in applications such as pyrolysis and <b>gasification.</b> Pretreatment with ionic liquids causes 'swelling' of the coal structure, allowing better <b>gasification.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the <b>gasification</b> of fine, undensified biomass such as rice hulls, it is {{necessary}} to blow air into the reactor by means of a fan. This creates very high <b>gasification</b> temperature, as high as 1000 C. Above the <b>gasification</b> zone, a bed of fine and hot char is formed, and as the gas is blow forced through this bed, most complex hydrocarbons are broken down into simple components of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.|$|E
25|$|Combustion of syngas or derived fuels emits {{exactly the}} same amount of carbon dioxide as would have been emitted from direct {{combustion}} of the initial fuel. Biomass <b>gasification</b> and combustion could {{play a significant role in}} a renewable energy economy, because biomass production removes {{the same amount of}} CO2 from the atmosphere as is emitted from <b>gasification</b> and combustion. While other biofuel technologies such as biogas and biodiesel are carbon neutral, <b>gasification</b> in principle may run on a wider variety of input materials and can be used to produce a wider variety of output fuels.|$|E
25|$|Currently Industrial-scale <b>gasification</b> is {{primarily}} {{used to produce}} electricity from fossil fuels such as coal, where the syngas is burned in a gas turbine. <b>Gasification</b> is also used industrially {{in the production of}} electricity, ammonia and liquid fuels (oil) using Integrated <b>Gasification</b> Combined Cycles (IGCC), with the possibility of producing methane and hydrogen for fuel cells. IGCC is also a more efficient method of CO2 capture as compared to conventional technologies. IGCC demonstration plants have been operating since the early 1970s and some of the plants constructed in the 1990s are now entering commercial service.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant is}} called {{integrated}} because (1) the syngas {{produced in the}} <b>gasification</b> section is used as fuel for the gas turbine in the combined cycle and (2) the steam produced by the syngas coolers in the <b>gasification</b> section {{is used by the}} steam turbine in the combined cycle.|$|E
25|$|Chemrec has {{developed}} a process for <b>gasification</b> of black liquor.|$|E
25|$|Some fuels have ashes {{with very}} high ash fusion temperatures. In this case mostly {{limestone}} {{is mixed with}} the fuel prior to <b>gasification.</b> Addition of a little limestone will usually suffice for the lowering the fusion temperatures. The fuel particles must be much smaller than for other types of gasifiers. This means the fuel must be pulverized, which requires somewhat more energy than for the other types of gasifiers. By far the most energy consumption related to entrained flow <b>gasification</b> is not the milling of the fuel but the production of oxygen used for the <b>gasification.</b>|$|E
25|$|Only found where {{crude oil}} {{was used as}} <b>gasification</b> feedstock.|$|E
25|$|Pre-combustion capture â€“ This {{involves}} <b>gasification</b> of a feedstock (such as coal) to form synthesis gas, {{which may}} be shifted to produce a H2 and CO2-rich gas mixture, from which the CO2 can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered, This technology is usually associated with Integrated <b>Gasification</b> Combined Cycle process configurations.|$|E
25|$|Underground coal <b>gasification</b> is an {{industrial}} <b>gasification</b> process, which {{is carried out}} in non-mined coal seams using injection of a gaseous oxidizing agent, usually oxygen or air, and bringing the resulting product gas to surface through production wells drilled from the surface. The product gas could {{to be used as}} a chemical feedstock or as fuel for power generation. The technique can be applied to resources that are otherwise not economical to extract and also offers an alternative to conventional coal mining methods for some resources. Compared to traditional coal mining and <b>gasification,</b> UCG has less environmental and social impact, though some concerns including potential for aquifer contamination are known.|$|E
25|$|Another E+Co {{investment}} is SME-RE, which sells biomass <b>gasification</b> systems to industrial clients in rural Cambodia {{that want to}} reduce their usage of diesel for heat and electricity generation. Biomass <b>gasification</b> involves the efficient combustion of dry organic matter, such as rice husks and other industrial waste to generate power. E+Co has {{made a series of}} debt investments in SME-RE since 2004.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{production}} of chemicals from coal {{has been used}} since the 1950s and has become established in the market. According to the 2010 Worldwide <b>Gasification</b> Database, a survey of current and planned gasifiers, from 2004 to 2007 chemical production increased its <b>gasification</b> product share from 37% to 45%. From 2008 to 2010, 22% of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production.|$|E
25|$|Lower-temperature <b>gasification</b> is {{desirable}} when co-producing biochar, but results in syngas polluted with tar.|$|E
25|$|Fischerâ€“Tropsch plants {{associated}} with coal or related solid feedstocks (sources of carbon) must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants, i.e., CO, H2, and alkanes. This conversion is called <b>gasification</b> {{and the product}} is called synthesis gas ("syngas"). Synthesis gas obtained from coal <b>gasification</b> tends to have a H2:CO ratio of ~0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of ~2. This ratio is adjusted via the water-gas shift reaction. Coal-based Fischerâ€“Tropsch plants produce varying amounts of CO2, depending upon the energy source of the <b>gasification</b> process. However, most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply all the energy requirements of the Fischerâ€“Tropsch process.|$|E
25|$|Recovery boilers {{have been}} the {{preferred}} mode of Kraft mill chemical recovery since the 1930s and {{the process has been}} improved considerably since the first generation. There have been attempts to replace the Tomlinson recovery boiler with recovery systems yielding higher efficiency. The most promising candidate appears to be <b>gasification,</b> where Chemrec's technology for entrained flow <b>gasification</b> of black liquor could prove to be a strong contender.|$|E
25|$|Coal <b>gasification</b> {{can be used}} {{to produce}} syngas, a mixture of carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) and hydrogen (H2) gas. Often syngas is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity, but the versatility of syngas also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, through the Fischer-Tropsch process; alternatively, syngas can be converted into methanol, which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process. <b>Gasification</b> combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology is currently used by the Sasol chemical company of South Africa to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from <b>gasification</b> can be used for various purposes, such as powering a hydrogen economy, making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|During both world wars, {{especially}} the World War II, {{the need for}} fuel produced by <b>gasification</b> reemerged due to the shortage of petroleum. Wood gas generators, called Gasogene or GazogÃ¨ne, were used to power motor vehicles in Europe. By 1945 there were trucks, buses and agricultural machines that were powered by <b>gasification.</b> It is estimated that there were close to 9,000,000 vehicles running on producer gas all over the world.|$|E
25|$|Bio-energy, {{based on}} the {{combustion}} of crops and crop residues, or their <b>gasification</b> followed by combustion of the gas.|$|E
25|$|Biomass <b>gasification</b> (BG) and Fischerâ€“Tropsch (FT) {{synthesis}} can {{in principle}} be combined to produce renewable transportation fuels (biofuels).|$|E
25|$|Calcined {{dolomite}} is {{also used}} {{as a catalyst for}} destruction of tar in the <b>gasification</b> of biomass at high temperature.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical {{water can}} be used to {{decompose}} biomass via supercritical water <b>gasification</b> of biomass. This type of biomass <b>gasification</b> {{can be used to}} produce hydrocarbon fuels for use in an efficient combustion device or to produce hydrogen for use in a fuel cell. In the latter case, hydrogen yield can be much higher than the hydrogen content of the biomass due to steam reforming where water is a hydrogen-providing participant in the overall reaction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gasification</b> {{process can}} produce syngas {{from a wide}} variety of carbon-containing feedstocks, such as high-sulfur coal, heavy {{petroleum}} residues, and biomass.|$|E
25|$|Chemrec's {{pilot plant}} in PiteÃ¥ that has {{produced}} 3MW of clean syngas since 2006, generated from entrained flow <b>gasification</b> of black liquor.|$|E
