40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{hydraulic}} conductivity of hydrated and partially hydrated geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) {{with respect to}} Jet <b>Fuel</b> A- <b>1</b> (Arctic diesel) is examined at 208 C, 58 C, 58 C, and 208 C. Methods developed to hydrate GCLs to specific water contents (60 %, 90 %, 120 %) and subject them to subzero temperatures without the additional uptake of water are described. Results indicate {{that there are two}} main mechanisms that affect the {{hydraulic conductivity}} of Jet <b>Fuel</b> A- <b>1.</b> For a constant bulk void ratio, as the water content increases, the hydraulic conductivity with respect to Jet <b>Fuel</b> A- <b>1</b> decreases. Similarly, for a constant water content, as bulk void ratio decreases, the hydraulic conductivity with respect to Jet <b>Fuel</b> A- <b>1</b> decreases. GCLs at positive temperatures with an initial degree of saturation (Sr) greater then 0. 77 had a hydraulic conductivity with respect to Jet <b>Fuel</b> A- <b>1</b> of less than 109 m/s, whereas GCLs at subzero temperatures with Sr. 0 : 70 had a hydraulic conductivity with respect to Jet <b>Fuel</b> A- <b>1</b> of less than 2 : 53 1010 m=s.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a global model of climate policy, {{focusing on the}} choice between tax and cap-and-trade solutions. We assume that {{the world can be}} split into two regions, with two fuels that both lead to carbon emissions. Region A consumes all fuels, and is responsible for defining and implementing climate policy. Region B produces all of <b>fuel</b> <b>1</b> (oil), while fuel 2 (interpreted as either coal; natural gas; or renewables) is both produced and consumed in region A. We study three model variants. All involve full policy coordination within each country block, but no coordination across blocks; and all involve an optimal producer tax on <b>fuel</b> <b>1</b> by region B. In model 1, region A sets two fuel consumption taxes, one for each fuel. The optimal region A tax on <b>fuel</b> <b>1</b> then exceeds the Pigou level as defined by the region; while the tax set on fuel 2 is Pigouvian. Presence of a second fuel in region A reduces region B’s optimal tax on <b>fuel</b> <b>1.</b> In model 2, region A sets a common carbon tax, which is lower (higher) for <b>fuel</b> <b>1</b> (2) than in model 1. In model 3, region A sets a carbon emissions cap. This enhances region B’s strategic position via the trade-off between fuels 1 and 2 in region A, following from the cap. In realistic cases, this leaves region A strategically weaker under a cap policy than under a tax policy, more so the less carbon-intensive the local fuel (2) is. In conclusion, a fuel-consuming and-importing region that determines a climate policy, will typically prefer to set a carbon tax, instead of setting a carbon emissions cap. The main reason is that a tax is more efficient than a cap at extracting rent from fuel (oil) exporters. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceParticle {{emissions}} from ship engines and their atmospheric {{transformation in the}} marine boundary layer (MBL) were investigated in engine test bed studies and in airborne measurements of expanding ship plumes. During the test rig studies, detailed aerosol microphysical and chemical properties were measured in the exhaust gas of a serial MAN B&W seven-cylinder four-stroke marine diesel engine under various load conditions. The emission studies were complemented by airborne aerosol transformation studies in the plume of a large container ship in the English Channel using the DLR aircraft Falcon 20 E- 5. Observations from emission studies and plume studies combined with a Gaussian plume dispersion model yield a consistent picture of particle transformation processes from emission to atmospheric processing during plume expansion. Particulate matter emission indices obtained from plume measurements are 8. 8 ± 1. 0 × 10 15 (kg <b>fuel)</b> ? <b>1</b> by number for non-volatile particles and 174 ± 43 mg (kg <b>fuel)</b> ? <b>1</b> by mass for Black Carbon (BC). Values determined for test rig conditions between 85 and 110 % engine load are of similar magnitude. For the total particle number including volatile compounds no emission index can be derived since the volatile aerosol fraction is subject to rapid transformation processes in the plume. Ship exhaust particles occur in the size range D p D p ? 0. 02 ?m. From the decay of ship exhaust particle number concentrations in an expanding plume, a maximum plume life time of approx. 24 h is estimated for a well-mixed marine boundary layer...|$|E
