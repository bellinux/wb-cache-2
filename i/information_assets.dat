5|$|Queen's University Libraries include six campus {{libraries}} and an archives in six facilities housing 2.2 million physical items and 400,000 electronic resources, including e-books, serial titles and databases. The library's budget in 2007–2008 was $18.1 million, with $9.8 million dedicated to acquisitions. The libraries are Bracken Health Sciences Library, Education Library, Lederman Law Library, Stauffer Humanities and Social Sciences Library and Engineering & Science Library. The W.D. Jordan Rare Books and Special Collections Library notably harbors early-dated books from 1475 to 1700. The Engineering & Science Library and the W.D. Jordan Rare Books and Special Collections Library share facilities, known as Douglas Library. Since 1981, the Queen's University archives {{is housed in}} Kathleen Ryan Hall. The archive manages, preserves, conserves, and makes accessible the <b>information</b> <b>assets</b> and historical record of the University. In addition to the University's archive, Kathleen Ryan Hall also houses the City of Kingston's archives.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} assurance process typically {{begins with the}} enumeration and classification of the <b>information</b> <b>assets</b> to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform a risk assessment for those assets. Vulnerabilities in the <b>information</b> <b>assets</b> are determined in order to enumerate the threats capable of exploiting the assets. The assessment then considers both the probability and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability in an asset, with impact usually {{measured in terms of}} cost to the asset's stakeholders. The sum of the products of the threats' impact and the probability of their occurring is the total risk to the information asset.|$|E

ISO/IEC 27001:2005 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System {{within the context of the}} organization's overall business risks. It specifies requirements for the implementation of security controls customized to the needs of individual organizations or parts thereof. ISO/IEC 27001:2005 is designed to ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security controls that protect <b>information</b> <b>assets</b> and give confidence to interested parties." ...|$|E
40|$|Conducting an <b>information</b> <b>asset</b> audit, {{along with}} the {{creation}} of an <b>information</b> <b>asset</b> register (IAR), is a key step in understanding the information management needs of an organisation. The benefits of establishing and maintaining an IAR are well documented, specifically IAR use in the identification of a single source of truth for each <b>information</b> <b>asset,</b> and the allocation of responsibilities for each <b>information</b> <b>asset.</b> However, an IAR is also a rich dataset that can be tapped to make good business decisions and grow information management knowledge within an organisation. This case study discusses how the IAR established at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) has been used not only as a key tool in understanding the current information landscape, but also to enhance a number of other initiatives and projects throughout the University. The case study outlines a methodology for conducting an <b>information</b> <b>asset</b> audit and establishing an IAR in an Australian university environment, and presents various uses for IAR analytics both within the information management sphere and beyond...|$|R

2500|$|American historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, {{with former}} KGB officer Alexander Vassiliev, have {{credited}} Lore with the recruitment and handling of David A. Salmon (code-named [...] "Willi"), one of Soviet intelligence's most important <b>information</b> <b>assets</b> in the US government. Citing Soviet archival evidence, the historians charge that from 1934 until early 1937 Lore paid Salmon, {{chief of the}} U.S. Department of State's communication and archives division, a stipend of $500 per month in exchange for classified diplomatic communications — information then passed along to the Soviets. While {{it is not clear}} whether Salmon was aware he was providing information to a foreign government or merely leaking information for a fee to a prominent New York Post journalist, or even whether Salmon was [...] "Willi" [...] at all, the fact remains that for several years Soviet intelligence had unparalleled access to the secret communications of prominent diplomatic and military decision-makers through Lore's connection.|$|E
