30|$|<b>In</b> {{ordinary}} <b>classroom</b> discourse, students’ responses may {{be rejected}} until the desired response is proposed and affirmed. This is one {{factor in the}} inequality of participation <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> exchanges, as the pattern starts from {{the first days of}} school, and continues year after year. Inequality of participation is a critical factor {{in the construction of the}} hierarchy of inclusion and exclusion <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> learning. For this reason it is crucial to include this feature <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> discourse analysis. It is also essential in analysing peer discussions in group work. To my knowledge it has rarely been adequately considered <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> research, partly because non-participating students are not apparent <b>in</b> transcripts of <b>classroom</b> discourse.|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of multimedia <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> teaching has brought education into one step higher {{from the traditional}} technique or better known as “chalk and talk” teaching method to a more interactive and interesting teaching and learning process. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the extent to which multimedia is incorporated <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> teaching among TESL teacher-trainees during the practical teaching. A total of 50 respondents consisting of third and fourth year TESL teacher-trainees from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia participated. This study also aims to find out whether or not the TESL teacher-trainees integrate multimedia <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> teaching and if they do, the study aims to identify the multimedia elements they frequently use and if not, the study wants to find out the reasons for not integrating multimedia <b>in</b> their <b>classroom</b> teaching. Based on the result, it was reported that even among those who integrate multimedia, there are limitations to incorporate it <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> teaching and this study has identified these limitations. Besides that, the benefits resulting from the {{integration of}} multimedia have also been identified. The result of the data analysis revealed four major findings namely the forms of multimedia incorporated <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> teaching by TESL teacher-trainees,the benefits of the integrating multimedia <b>in</b> the <b>classroom,</b> the limitations, as well as the reasons for not integrating multimedia <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> teaching during the practical teaching.

According to Chip Wood, co-founder of the Northeast Foundation for Children, fourth through sixth grade children will typically be between the ages of 9 and 12 years old. The program is provided at no cost to the children and their families. To date, over 15,000 children have participated in the educational program.

5|$|Two minor controversies marked Beshear's {{tenure as}} {{attorney}} general. The {{first came in}} the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham. The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the federal constitution. State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the request for clarification. Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{relationship}} between social acceptance <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> and social acceptance on Facebook. In this study social acceptance was operationalized as social preference and as sociometric status. First, we examined whether intensity of Facebook usage, time spent on Facebook, and social preference <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> predict social preference on Facebook. Second, we examined the relationship between sociometric status <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> and sociometric status on Facebook. We used Facebook intensity scale (FBI) and two versions of sociometric test (with regard to peer relations <b>in</b> the <b>classroom</b> and on Facebook). The participants were 188 high school students, 117 females (57. 4 %) and 71 males (34. 8 %), between 16 and 19 years of age. The results have shown that social preference <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> significantly predicts social preference on Facebook and that there is a positive moderate correlation between sociometric status <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> and sociometric status on Facebook. These results are important for implementation of preventive strategies for students, who are rejected and are victims of bullying...|$|R

25|$|Multimodality <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> {{has brought}} {{about the need for}} a new {{definition}} of literacy. According to Gunther Kress, a popular theorist of multimodality, literacy, when defined, usually refers to the combination of letters and words to make messages and meaning and can often be attached to other words in order to express knowledge of the separate fields, such as visual- or computer-literacy. However, as multimodality becomes more common, not only <b>in</b> <b>classrooms,</b> but in work and social environments, the definition of literacy extends. Instead of referring only to reading and alphabetic writing, or being extended to other fields, literacy and its definition now encompass multiple modes. It has become more than just reading and writing, and now includes visual, technological, and social uses among others.|$|E
