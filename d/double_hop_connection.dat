The simulator is capable of studying all the possible combinations of types and modes of calls through the use of five communication scenarios: single <b>hop</b> systems; <b>double</b> <b>hop,</b> signal gateway system; <b>double</b> <b>hop,</b> <b>double</b> gateway system; mobile to wireline system; and wireline to mobile system.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spectral {{properties of the}} two-orbital Hubbard model, including the <b>double</b> <b>hopping</b> term, {{by means of the}} dynamical mean field method. This Hamiltonian describes materials in which ferromagnetism is realized by the double exchange mechanism, like for instance manganites, nickelates or diluted magnetic semiconductors. The spectral function of the unoccupied states is characterized by a specific equidistant three peak structure. We emphasize the importance of the <b>double</b> <b>hopping</b> term on the spectral properties. We show the existence of a ferromagnetic phase due to electron doping near n= 1 by the double exchange mechanism. A quasi-particle excitation at the Fermi energy is found that we attribute to what we will call an orbital polaron. We derive an effective spin-pseudospin Hamiltonian for the two-orbital double exchange model at n= 1 filling to explain the existence and dynamics of this quasi-particle.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the effect of single leg <b>hop</b> progression and <b>double</b> legs <b>hop</b> progression exercise to increase speed and explosive power of leg muscles. Plyometric is one of the training methods that can increase explosive power. There are many models of plyometric training including single leg <b>hop</b> progression and <b>double</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression. This research was experimental using match subject design techniques. The subjects of this study were 39 students who joined basketball school club. There were 3 groups in this study: Group 1 were 13 students who given sin¬gle leg hop progression exercise, Group 2 were 13 students who given <b>double</b> legs <b>hop</b> progression exercise, Group 3 were 13 students who given conventional exercise. The data was collected during pre test and post test by testing 30 m speed running and vertical jump. The data was analyzed using Analysis of Varians (Anova). It was found that there were significantly increased on speed and explosive power of leg muscles of Group 1 and Group 2. It can be stated that single leg hop progression exercise was more effective than <b>double</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression exercise. The recent findings supported the hypothesis that single leg <b>hop</b> progression and <b>double</b> legs <b>hop</b> progression exercise can increase speed and explosive power of leg muscles. These finding were supported by some previous studies (Singh, et al, 2011; Shallaby, H. K., 2010). The single leg hop progression is more effective than <b>double</b> legs <b>hop</b> progression. This finding was consistent with some previous evidences (McCurdy, et al, 2005; Makaruk et al, 2011) ...|$|R
