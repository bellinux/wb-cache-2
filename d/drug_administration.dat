We sent an online survey to corresponding authors who had published an article about a neglected tropical disease from 2007 to 2011. Of 825 unique authors who were invited to complete the survey, 365 (44. 2 %) responded, including 234 (28. 4 %) who answered questions regarding one of {{the five most}} prevalent neglected tropical diseases. Respondents had varying opinions about the goals of programmatic activities for their chosen neglected tropical disease, with elimination or eradication identified as the most important goal by 87 % of lymphatic filariasis respondents, 66 % of onchocerciasis respondents, 55 % of trachoma respondents, 24 % of schistosomiasis respondents, and 21 % of soil-transmitted helminth respondents. Mass <b>drug</b> <b>administrations,</b> other non-medication health measures, and education were generally thought to be more important for elimination than vector control, development of a new tool, or the presence of a secular trend. Drug resistance was thought to be a major limitation of mass <b>drug</b> <b>administrations</b> for all five neglected tropical diseases. Over half of respondents for lymphatic filariasis and trachoma thought that repeated mass <b>drug</b> <b>administrations</b> could eliminate infection within ten years of the initiation of mass treatments. Respondents for lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma were more enthusiastic about the prospects of elimination and eradication than were respondents for schistosomiasis or soil-transmitted helminths.
