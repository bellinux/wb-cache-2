5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. The <b>Directory</b> for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The <b>Directory,</b> accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The <b>Directory</b> consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E

50|$|The {{performance}} of a file system is dependent on many things; one of the crucial factors is just how that filesystem lays out files on the disk. In general, {{it is best to}} keep related items together. The Linux ext2 and ext3 filesystems, for instance, have tried to spread <b>directories</b> on the cylinders of the disk. Imagine setting up a system with users' home <b>directories</b> in /home: if all the first-level <b>directories</b> within /home (i.e. the home <b>directories</b> for numerous users) are placed next to each other, there may be no space left for the contents of those <b>directories.</b> User files thus end up being placed far from the <b>directories</b> that contain them, and performance suffers.|$|R

5|$|The Italian Peninsula was not {{the only}} region from which Napoleon took art. Under the <b>Directory</b> {{government}} of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist {{effort on the part of}} the government, but the <b>Directory</b> had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. The <b>Directory</b> wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.|$|E
