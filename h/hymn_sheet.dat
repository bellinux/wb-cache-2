50|$|There was the {{impression}} of friendship between McQuaid and Éamon de Valera, founder of Fianna Fáil and frequent head of government from the 1930s to the late 1950s. Historian Dermot Keogh believes {{that there has been}} a tendency to view the relationship between the two men as being static and not subject to change or development. Dr Keogh thinks it was quite the reverse. The men were friends and the relationship was less complicated in the 1930s when McQuaid was not archbishop. But after his consecration, McQuaid represented in a formal fashion the interests of the Church and he defended those interests even when it brought him into conflict with the leader of the state who also happened to be his friend. That friendship never clouded both men's concepts of their duties on behalf of church and state. It is all too facile to hold, a priori, that de Valera and McQuaid sang consistently from the same <b>hymn</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E

The two-page child protection report, unearthed by police in the archives of the diocese of Manchester, was proof, at last, that a former cathedral choirboy [...] alleging years of sexual abuse by one of Britain's most senior clergyman [...] was not alone. There was another boy. Also a solo soprano, {{on the other side of}} the world, who was singing from the same <b>hymn</b> <b>sheet</b> about The Very Reverend Robert Waddington. "There had been a previous referral about sexual impropriety some time ago from Australia, where RW had been the headmaster at a school. An ex-pupil had made a complaint to the Bishop of (north) Queensland who had relayed it to the Archbishop (of York)," the 2003 report says. Eli Ward's family had prompted the secret report when they told church officials, without Ward's knowledge, of the alleged abuse he suffered in the mid- 1980 s...|$|E

40|$|It {{has become}} {{something}} of a truism in the academic literature to speak of Britain's uncomfortable relationship with the European Union (EU). Against this, however, it should be noted that the (limited) literature on British EU policy making is, in general, far more positive in tone. Both observers and participants emphasise the efficacy of British policy making, and in particular its ability to produce clear, consistent and coherent negotiating positions for British represen-tatives in Brussels. British representatives 'sing from the same <b>hymn</b> <b>sheet</b> ' when dealing with their European partners. This presents us with something of a paradox concerning the relationship between an (apparently) highly efficient system of EU policy making and outcomes which are (allegedly) markedly sub-optimal. Public policy and policy making are inextricably linked. Intuitively, we would expect that effective policy making enhances policy outcomes and influence over these outcomes at the European level. We would also assume that the adoption of policies at the EU level which are congruent with choices made in the member states reduce...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHermeneutics {{refers to}} {{interpretation}} and translation of text (typically ancient scriptures) but {{also applies to}} verbal and non-verbal communication. In a psychological setting it nicely frames the problem of inferring the intended content of a communication. In this paper, we offer {{a solution to the}} problem of neural hermeneutics based upon active inference. In active inference, action fulfils predictions about how we will behave (e. g., predicting we will speak). Crucially, these predictions can be used to predict both self and others – during speaking and listening respectively. Active inference mandates the suppression of prediction errors by updating an internal model that generates predictions – both at fast timescales (through perceptual inference) and slower timescales (through perceptual learning). If two agents adopt the same model, then – in principle – they can predict each other and minimise their mutual prediction errors. Heuristically, this ensures they are singing from the same <b>hymn</b> <b>sheet.</b> This paper builds upon recent work on active inference and communication to illustrate perceptual learning using simulated birdsongs. Our focus here is the neural hermeneutics implicit in learning, where communication facilitates long-term changes in generative models that are trying to predict each other. In other words, communication induces perceptual learning and enables others to (literally) change our minds and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} {{as part of a}} panel titled 'Singing from the same <b>hymn</b> <b>sheet?</b> The role of choirs, collective singing and affective belonging' organized by Rebecca Bramall and Emily Falconer (LSBU). In the popular BBC television show The Choir: Sing While You Work (2012, 2013) choirmaster Gareth Malone initiates ensemble singing in diverse workplaces. During the course of the show’s two series, the value and benefits of singing are confidently articulated. The Choir reflects and perpetuates the ‘rise of the choir’ in the context of economic austerity, a discourse in which choral singing has been celebrated as an activity that enables the ‘time-strapped’ and ‘stress-ridden’ to ‘pull back some balance into their lives’ (Stylist, 2013). In this paper I draw on theories of affective labour, and of the relationship between music and capitalism, to explore the relationship between the popularity of choral singing and new economic contexts, specifically of employment and work. Commentators on the ‘rise of the choir’ have tended to focus their critical attentions on debating the transformative effects of ensemble singing. I suggest that in The Choir and the wider discursive context, the pleasures and imputed benefits of choral singing simultaneously illuminate and neutralize a critique of the negative effects of the neoliberal workplace. Choirs and singing are identified as that which the workplace lacks, yet once these ensembles and practices are established their benefits are shown to enhance neoliberal logics of efficiency and competitiveness. In conclusion, I consider the opportunities that this national-popular interest in ensemble singing might nonetheless afford for developing a more radical critique of the neoliberal workplace, focusing on the collectivities that workplace choirs originate...|$|E
40|$|In a {{presentation}} {{to a meeting}} in May 2003 of officials and ambassadors from the Eastern and Southern African region on developing an EPA negotiating mandate for the region, the ACP Secretariat argued that the Cotonou Agreement required that negotiations on EPAs should : be undertaken with ACP countries which consider themselves {{in a position to}} do so, at the level they consider appropriate, and in accordance with the procedures agreed by the ACP Group in the light of regional-integration processes in the ACP; be aimed at promoting economic development, the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty and the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy; build on regional integration initiatives and 'not undermine the regional integration processes and efforts'. The presentation further noted that the ACP Group had 'agreed that the first phase could extend from September 2002 through 2003 when a review could take place. The negotiations in the second phase could start in September 2003 '. The uncertainties facing the ACP were highlighted in this presentation particularly with regard to: the future WTO framework for ACP-EU trade relations; the impact of CAP enlargement; the impact of CAP reform; the alternative GSP scheme which would be in place. It was felt that these uncertainties required the development of 'a concerted, coherent and a joint approach not only to the negotiations of EPAs but to regional policy formulation as well'. It also requires close co-ordination between ACP capitals, and their representations in Geneva and Brussels, in order to ensure that everyone is singing from the same <b>hymn</b> <b>sheet.</b> The presentation set out the reasons for the current two-phased approach to the negotiations and the progress to date, noting the areas of convergence and divergence. The greatest convergence was on general principles, namely that EPAs should take full account of local circumstances, fully support regional-integration processes and be built on the wider objectives of the Cotonou Agreement. The highlighted divergences included: disagreement on whether a reform of WTO rules was required to allow the necessary flexibility in the EPA negotiations; the nature of the first, all-ACP phase and its outcome; the need for additional resources. In contrast to the EU's upbeat reporting on the outcome of the May Joint Council of Ministers meeting the ACP Secretariat presentation noted that ACP ministers 'expressed concern over the slow progress in achieving the objectives of the phase 1 of the negotiations'. With regard to the specific regional dimension of EPA negotiations the ACP paper noted that 'the EU is still wedded to its idea of REPAs', but that on the ACP side many issues still needed to be clarified, most notably: the regional configuration for the second-phase negotiations; whether it will it be regional secretariats or member-states governments backed up by the regional secretariats who will negotiate; whether such negotiations would take place in Brussels or the headquarters of the regional secretariats; the role of the Brussels ambassadors and Brussels structures; the definition of 'sensitive products' under liberalisation processes; the extent of transitional periods before full reciprocity is introduced; the impact of reciprocity on fiscal revenues; how the problem of revenue losses can be addressed; the measures which can be adopted to protect vulnerable sectors and industries. Comment: The most striking feature of this ACP presentation was the emphasis placed on the permissive nature of the commitments that ACP governments had made under the Cotonou Agreement rather than the statutory, binding nature of these commitments. This suggests an unease within the ACP over the progress of first-phase negotiations and the possibility of deferring the commencement of second-phase negotiations until further progress has been made in addressing the issues put on the table by the ACP in the first phase of the negotiations.
