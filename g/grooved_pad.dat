40|$|In recent years, CMP (Chemical and Mechanical Polishing) greatly {{has taken}} its role as {{technology}} of planarizations to produce multi-level inter-connections. While slurry is flowing on a polishing pad in CMP, the polishing pad is {{in contact with the}} wafer to polish the wafer surface. Grooves are expected to supply slurry evenly, and to remove wasted particles. Our study aims at developing the design of the best patterns of grooves. By predicting slurry flows between wafers and polishing pads in CMP using CFD, the influence of the slurry flow by the <b>grooved</b> <b>pad</b> can be analyzed. In this paper simulations were carried out for cases without groove, with circular grooves and radial grooves. With analysis of the flow field, how grooves affect the velocity distributions are studied. We also simulated the replacement of old slurry to new slurry, and the roles of the grooves are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies related to the study and control of slurry flow, process temperature, and aggressive diamonds in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP). The purpose of these studies is to better understand the fundamentals of CMP and to explore solutions to some of CMP’s greatest challenges. Within-wafer removal rate non-uniformity (WIWRRNU) is a critical parameter to determine film thickness planarity on a wafer-scale level and it grossly impacts yield. Resolving this issue continues to be an area of intense focus in the industry. The first study in this dissertation shows the feasibility of adopting a new method to improve WIWRRNU during copper CMP that is solely based on intentional local temperature manipulation of the pad. A pad surface thermal management system is developed to locally change pad surface temperature. This system consists of one or more thermal transfer modules contacting the pad surface. In this study, the system is employed to adjust the "center-fast" copper removal rate profile to illustrate its effect during the process. Results shows that, when two thermal transfer modules are employed, local removal rates in the wafer center region decrease significantly while maintaining the removal rates near the wafer edge thereby significantly improving WIWRRNU. Another contribution of this dissertation is the investigation of the effect of pad groove design on slurry injection scheme during interlayer dielectric CMP. A novel slurry injector with multiple slurry outlets is designed, which provides optional slurry injection schemes (i. e. one injection point scheme and multi-injection point scheme). These schemes are compared with the standard slurry application method on a concentrically <b>grooved</b> <b>pad</b> and an xy-groove pad, respectively. On the concentrically <b>grooved</b> <b>pad,</b> the one injection point scheme generates significantly higher oxide removal rates (ranging from 22 to 35 percent) compared to the standard slurry application method at different slurry flow rates. On the xy-groove pad, the one injection point scheme still results in higher removal rates (ranging from 3 to 9 percent), however, its removal rate enhancement is not as high as that of the concentrically <b>grooved</b> <b>pad.</b> In order to further improve slurry availability on the xy-groove pad, the multi-injection point scheme is tested. Results show that the multi-injection point scheme results in significantly higher removal rates (ranging from 17 to 20 percent) compared to the standard slurry application method. This work underscores the importance of optimum slurry injection schemes for accommodating particular groove designs. The last contribution of this dissertation involves a study regarding aggressive diamond characterization and wear analysis during CMP. A 3 M A 3700 diamond disk is used to condition a Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (CMC) D 100 pad for 30 hours. The top 20 aggressive diamonds for two perpendicular disk orientations are identified before the polishing, as well as after 15 - and 30 -hour polishing. The furrow surface area generated by these top 20 aggressive diamonds and their evolution are analyzed and compared. Results show that the original top 20 aggressive diamonds identified before polishing are subjected to wear after the first 15 -hour polishing as the furrow surface area that they generate decreases dramatically (by 47 %). As these original aggressive diamonds are worn, seven new aggressive diamonds are "born" and join the new top 20 list for both disk orientations. After the second 15 -hour wafer polishing, the furrow surface area of these new top 20 aggressive diamonds do not change significantly. The furrow surface area created by all the active diamonds exhibits the same trend as the top 20 aggressive diamonds, confirming that most pad conditioning work is performed by these aggressive diamonds and that the disk loses its aggressiveness in the first 15 hours of polishing and then maintains its aggressiveness during the second 15 hours, albeit to a lesser extent...|$|E
40|$|The {{positioning}} system called PSG (Pad System for Georadar) {{was developed for}} “true” 3 D acquisitions over small areas. The system allows the easy and fast acquisition of a geo-referred, regular and dense matrix of GPR traces that satisfies the Nyquist theory for both in-line and cross-line directions. The GPR antenna passes over a soft pad (size varies) which can be rolled up for transport purposes, and which is adaptable to the different distances used in surveys. The pad has parallel grooved tracks incorporated in its surface, {{and there is a}} matching <b>grooved</b> <b>pad</b> {{on the bottom of the}} antenna. The survey is done by dragging the GPR antenna along the grooved tracks of the pad, allowing the rapid acquisition of parallel and regularly spaced profiles. The material of the PSG pad is soft enough to adapt to the irregularity of the soil surface, so the antenna slides smoothly across the pad, while the friction between the bottom of the pad and the soil surface prevents any movement of the PSG device. The PSG can simultaneously ensure position accuracy, constant antenna orientation, and full coverage of a regular point-measurement grid without the same point being investigated twice...|$|E

A cube of PPUF having the size of 21 mm was transformed into a roundshape using a vertical wheel grinding with the circular <b>groove</b> <b>pad</b> developed. The grinding speed (Vs) of the wheel wasvaried between 1. 41 and 5. 18 m/s. The cross head speed of the circular <b>groove</b> <b>pad</b> (f) was controlled at 1, 3, 5 mm/min.

The experimental data were statistically analyzed. The study found that (1) the grinding speed could remarkably affect the circularity error, finished diameter, and grinding forces,(2) the grinding speed ranged between 2. 83 and 3. 77 m/s could contribute to sphere shape specimens, and (3) the grinding speed of 3. 30 m/s, cross head speed of 1 mm/min, and abrasive grit size of 20 μm provided the least circularity error...|$|R

40|$|Diamond pad conditioners can {{determine}} the efficiency of CMP processes {{and the quality of}} polished wafers. The polishing rate of a wafer is dependent on the amplitude (height) of pad asperities. The polishing uniformity is controlled by the frequency (density) of such asperities. Current diamond pad conditioners cannot dress the pad to produce microns sized asperities at high density. This is because the tips of diamond grits cannot be leveled to the same height so the <b>grooved</b> <b>pad</b> top is uneven with excessive asperities that may ruin the wafer and under sized asperities that is easily glazed. New designs of diamond pad conditioners have markedly improved the leveling of diamond tips. Organic diamond disks (ODD) are manufactured by reverse casting of polymers. Due to the uniform spacing of diamond grits and their controlled tip heights, none of the diamond grits will be overly stressed. Moreover, all diamond grits are sharing the dressing work. Consequently, the number of working grits of ODD is significantly higher than conventional designs. Moreover, because no diamond will cut pad unnecessarily, the pad life is greatly lengthened. Furthermore, due to the uniform distribution of pad asperities, the slurry will be held efficiently so the run off is avoided. As a result, the slurry usage is reduced. ODD is therefore a significant savor of CMP consumables for semiconductor manufacture...|$|E
40|$|Aero-static thrust {{bearings}} offer some distinct advantages {{in comparison with}} contact bearings {{as there is no}} contact between the moving and stationary parts, thus there is no wear, limited heat generation and long life can be achieved. Moreover, linear positioning control is not affected by the highly nonlinear friction forces, and high precision positioning or high speed can be achieved. The main drawbacks of aerostatic bearings are low stiffness and load capacity and sometimes poor damping in comparison to contact bearings, so that their application in some sectors, e. g. machine tools, is less popular. Active compensation methods {{can be used as a}} solution for this problem. Electronic control with piezo actuators give generally good results in both static and dynamic conditions but they are expensive do to use of many sensors and piezo actuators for each pad. In addition in this type of methods, special design is necessary for each air bearing and normal commercial air bearings cannot be used. Pure pneumatic control is an interesting alternative solution in terms of performances and cost. This thesis presents designing, modelling and test of pneumatic valve which is an upstream restrictor and can control the air flow to improve the stiffness of any commercial thrust bearing. The static experiments show that the active system can improve the static stiffness significantly but it was in cost of losing the load carrying capacity. Different improvement have been made to improve the valve design in order to improve the load carrying capacity. In the final design it is possible to use the active system instead of wide range of commercial thrust air bearing with higher load carrying capacity and stiffness. In this study the numerical simulation of grooved feeding thrust air bearings is done for the first time. These type of bearing was selected as a passive commercial pad due to high stiffness of these type of air pads in compare with other feeding methods. The lumped numerical model is used to simulate the active system. The experimental results show that the proposed model can adequately describe the performance of <b>grooved</b> <b>pad</b> and pneumatic valve. Two different type of dynamic experiment is performed in order to identify the dynamic characteristics of the system like damping and dynamic stiffness in order to find the stability range which is important especially for pneumatic control...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{model is}} described for the generation, transport and exchange of thermal energy in rotary CMP tools. Frictional energy generated due to abrasion of the wafer by the pad and slurry particles is partitioned between the pad and the rotating wafer, {{with the majority}} going to the latter. The slurry {{at the same time}} provides a major cooling mechanism, drawing heat away while it is entrained under the wafer and then redistributing it over the pad by radial convection. The slurry flow component of the theory includes thermal effects due the presence of concentric grooves. The model accounts for the time and radial dependence of pad temperature measurements performed on flat and concentrically <b>grooved</b> <b>pads</b> at the leading and trailing edges of the wafer, at the pad center and pad margins, and on the wafer carrier. It suggests that the temperature increase on the wafer may be approximately twice the increase measured on the pad...|$|R

These are also evaluated with the purpose of minimizing environmental and cost of ownership impacts. In order to study diamond micro-wear and substrate wear during planarization processes, {{a series of}} static etch tests and wear tests were performed using different types of diamond discs and subjected to various treatments. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Membrane Spectroscopy (ICPMS) were used to estimate the extent of diamond micro-wear and substrate wear. Next, the impact of various factors (type of slurry abrasive, pH, abrasive content and abrasive concentration) on pad wear rate during planarization process was studied. Another study in this dissertation focuses on the development of a novel technique of using coefficient of friction (COF) data to distinguish between good and bad diamond discs. This study made use of the innovative tool diamond disc dragging device (DDD- 100) designed and developed {{for the purpose of this}} study. It is known that the performance of chemical mechanical planarization depends significantly on the polishing <b>pad</b> <b>grooving</b> type and the kinematics involved in the process. Variations in <b>pad</b> <b>grooving</b> type as well as pressure and sliding velocity can affect polishing performance. One study in this dissertation investigates the effect of pressure and sliding velocity on the polishing performance. The study is conducted on multiple pressure and sliding velocity variations to understand the characteristic of each condition. A subsequent study focuses on the impact of <b>pad</b> <b>grooving</b> type on polishing performance. The greatest contribution of this dissertation involves development of the novel slurry injector to optimize the utilization of slurry during planarization processes. Slurry is a critical component in chemical mechanical planarization processes and accounts for approximately 50 percent of the cost of ownership (CoO). The novel injector apart from reducing the consumption of slurry, also contributed in addressing problems associated with foaming, reduced the number of defects and achieved better within wafer non-uniformity (WIWNU) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies related to the slurry mean residence time analysis and the pad-wafer contact characterization in Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP). The purpose of these studies is to further understand the fundamentals of CMP and to explore solutions to some of CMP's challenges. Mean residence time (MRT) is a widely used term that is mostly seen in classical chemical engineering reactor analysis. In a CMP process, the wafer-pad interface can be treated as a closed system reactor, and classical reactor theory {{can be applied to the}} slurry flow through the region. Slurry MRT represents the average time it takes for fresh incoming slurry to replace the existing slurry in the region bound between the pad and the wafer. Understanding the parameters that have an impact on MRT, and therefore removal rate, is critical to maintain tight specifications in the CMP process. In this dissertation, we proposed a novel slurry injection system (SIS) which efficiently introduced fresh slurry into the pad-wafer interface to reduce MRT. Results indicated that SIS exhibited lower slurry MRT and dispersion numbers but higher removal rates than the standard pad center slurry application by blocking the spent slurry and residual rinse water from re-entering the pad-wafer interface during polishing. Another study in this dissertation dealt with the effect of <b>pad</b> <b>groove</b> width on slurry MRT in the pad-wafer interface as well as slurry utilization efficiency (η). Three concentrically <b>grooved</b> <b>pads</b> with different <b>groove</b> widths were tested at different polishing pressures to experimentally determine the corresponding MRT using the residence time distribution (RTD) technique. Results showed that MRT and η increased significantly when the groove width increased from 300 to 600 μm. On the other hand, when the groove width increased further to 900 μm, MRT continued to increase while n remained constant. Results also indicated that MRT was reduced at a higher polishing pressure while η did not change significantly with pressure for all three pads. In the last study of this dissertation, the effect of pad surface micro-texture on removal rate during tungsten CMP was investigated. Two different conditioner discs ("Disc A" and "Disc B") were employed to generate different pad surface micro-textures during polishing. Results showed that "Disc B" generated consistently lower removal rates and coefficients of friction than "Disc A". To fundamentally elucidate the cause(s) of such differences, pad surface contact area and topography were analyzed using laser confocal microscopy. The comparison of the pad surface micro-texture analysis on pad surfaces conditioned by both discs indicated that "Disc A" generated a surface having a smaller abruptness (λ) and more solid contact area which resulted in a higher removal rate. In contrast, "Disc B" generated many large near-contact areas as a result of fractured and collapsed pore walls...|$|R
40|$|Copper {{polishing}} performance depends significantly on {{the properties}} of pads, slurries, conditioning, pressure, sliding velocity, slurry flow rate and temperature. A slight variance {{in each of these}} parameters will cause significant change in polising results. Various investigations are performed during this study to understand the effect of consumables and other main operating parameters on copper polishing in terms of removal rate, lubrication mechanism, and temperature transients. A modified two-step Langmuir-Hinshelwood removal rate model and a flash heating thermal model are developed to describe the removal mechanism. Results indicate that grain size plays an important role during copper polishing. Smaller grain size may enhance the chemical rate by providing a higher density of favorable reaction sites. However, denser grain boundaries due to smaller grain size may reduce the mechanical rate by increasing the probability of disruption of three body sliding contact. It is found that removal rate increases as slurry flow increases from 60 to 80 cc/min because higher slurry flow rate can provide more reactants to the system. Then removal rate decreases as slurry flow rate is further increased to 140 cc/min, which is due to synergic effects of the wafer temperature, slurry flow and slurry residence time under the wafer. The observed removal rate drop is thought to be due to the change of the wafer temperature at high sliding velocity. Experimental results from eight slurry formulations with various abrasize size and content show {{that in the case of}} 13 -nm abrasives, the dominant tribological mechanism is that of partial lubrication, while in the case of 35 -nm abrasives, the dominant tribological mechanism is that of boundary lubrication. COF values of the slurry with surfactant are generally lower that those of the slurry without surfactant. Logarithmic spiral positive <b>pad,</b> whose spiral <b>groove</b> is at a slight angle to the pad rotation direction, shows the highest average COF. The radial pad results in the smallest average COF. For all types of the <b>grooved</b> <b>pads</b> investigated, CMP is mechanically limited at low pV, and chemically limited at high pV. Non-Prestonian behavior is thought to be due to variations of COF and substrate temperatures. Dual Emission UV Light Enhanced Fluorescence results indicate that during polishing the wafer is tilted towards the center of the pad and that the extent of wafer tilt is a strong function of diamond disc pressure. Increasing the oscillation frequency of the diamond disc or the rotation rate decreases slurry film thickness. Slurry film thickness increases with the slurry flow rate. Also slurry film thickness strongly depends on diamond disc design...|$|R

The first study is performed to obtain the real-time substrate temperature during the polishing process and is specifically intended to understand the temperature distribution across the polishing wafer during the chemical mechanical planarization process. Later, this technique is implemented to study the effect of slurry injection position for optimum slurry usage. It is known that the performance of chemical mechanical planarization depends significantly on the polishing pad and the kinematics involved in the process. Variations in pad material and <b>pad</b> <b>grooving</b> type as well as pressure and sliding velocity can affect polishing performance.

The study is conducted on multiple pressure and sliding velocity variations to understand the characteristic of each pad. The analysis method elaborated in this study can be applied generically. A subsequent study focuses in a slurry characterization technique. Slurry, a critical component in chemical mechanical planarization, is typically a water-based dispersion of fine abrasive particles with various additives to control material removal rate and microscratches.

A novelIPL-FMC 200 -mm polisher, in which friction force could be obtained in two directions, was introduced and compared to lab-scale (IPL 100 -mm) polisher during ILD CMP. Results showed that scaling the ILD process from 100 to 200 mm caused a transition from a mechanically-limited regime, {{in which it was}} still possible to detect thermal effects, to a higher degree of mechanical limitation where it was no longer possible to detect thermal effects. Other studies in this dissertation were related to the evaluation and modeling of novel groove designs for copper CMP optimization. Novel groove designs were divided into two groups: (1) Logarithmic-Spiral and (2) Concentric Slanted. These novel groove designs were evaluated under several operating conditions, such as wafer load, sliding velocity and slurry flow rate. This work resulted in the identification of one novel groove design from each group, which resulted in high Copper RR. The observed RR behavior was attributed to two possible scenarios. Firstly, it was believed that these novel groove designs produced a more effective control of the transport of slurry into, and the discharge of spent slurry and debris out of, the pad-wafer interface. Secondly, the variations in slurry film thickness at the pad-wafer interface generated by the different groove designs evaluated, appeared to affect the degree of contact between the pad and the wafer; hence the mechanical (pad asperities-wafer contact) and chemical(rise in temperature) contributions of the system.

Results showed that the HPMJ pad conditioning system had the potential of removing slurry residues and polish by-products inside <b>pad</b> <b>grooves</b> and pores on the pad surface, thus leading to improved pad life and reduced wafer-level defects. In addition, a proposed conditioning scheme, namely a combination of diamond and HPMJ pad conditioning, allowed for stable polish results in terms of removal rate and coefficient of friction (COF). The theoretical and experimental investigation of conventional diamond disc pad conditioning was performed to explore the effects of conditioner design factors on removal rate and COF in copper CMP. In this study, conditioning affected pad surface topography and was also capable of modifying the removal rate of copper by changing the COF and the reaction temperature. Both theory and experimental results showed that friction and removal rate should both decrease as the conditioned surface became less abrupt. Ammonium dodecyl sulfate (ADS), an environmentally friendly surfactant, was evaluated as an alternative inhibitor to benzotriazole (BTA) in copper CMP. Results demonstrated that the inhibition efficiency of ADS was superior to that of BTA in terms of coefficient of friction (COF), removal rate and temperature. Spectral analysis of shear force showed the extent of the pre-existing stick-slip phenomena caused by the kinematics of the process and collision event between pad asperities with the wafer. The characterization of experimental and numerical formation of pad staining was investigated. Pad staining was a result of material removal and it increased with polishing pressure, wafer rotation rate and polishing time. Experimental results also indicated that pad staining had no significant effect on removal rate. The experimental and simulated pad staining images demonstrated that polish by-products were advected downstream with the slurry flow, and deposited on the pad surface...|$|R
