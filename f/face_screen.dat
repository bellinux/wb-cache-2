40|$|Eye-tracking {{studies on}} {{exploration}} of faces and objects in autism provided important knowledge {{but only in}} a constraint condition (chin rest, total time looking at screen not reported), without studying potential differences between subjects with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and controls in spontaneous visual attention toward a screen presenting these stimuli. This study used eye tracking to compare spontaneous visual attention to a screen displaying a face or an object between children with autism and controls in a nonconstraint condition and to investigate the relationship with clinical characteristics in autism group. Time exploring screen was measured during passive viewing of static images of faces or objects. Autistic behaviors were assessed by the CARS and the BSE-R in autism group. In autism group, time exploring <b>face</b> <b>screen</b> and time exploring object screen were lower than in controls and {{were not correlated with}} degree of distractibility. There was no interaction between group and type of image on time spent exploring screen. Only time exploring <b>face</b> <b>screen</b> was correlated with autism severity and gaze impairment. Results highlight particularities of spontaneous visual attention toward a screen displaying faces or objects in autism, which should be taken into account in future eye-tracking studies on face exploration...|$|E

40|$|Sometimes {{simulator}} {{designers are}} so {{enamored of the}} technology to create detailed road scenes that they {{lose sight of the}} goals that guide simulator design, with usability and usefulness suffering as a result. The third generation UMTRI Driving Simulator was designed with 4 goals in mind: (1) facilitate running experiments, (2) support demonstrations, (3) facilitate configuration verification and troubleshooting, and (4) provide high quality audio and video signals. The time spent on demonstrations (to sponsors, the public, and the media) can equal the time testing subjects and the impact of those demonstrations can be significant. Further, the time spent troubleshooting equipment, especially the cameras, cables, amplifiers, etc. associated with the audiovisual system can far exceed the time spent on demonstrations and testing subjects. This paper lists 30 recommendations for designing a simulator audiovisual system. For many recommendations, specific model numbers or web sites are provided. Noteworthy recommendations in support of the testing and demonstration goals (1 and 2) concern (a) the camera locations to consider (<b>face,</b> <b>screen,</b> interior, feet), (b) hiding cameras (yes, using lipstick cameras), (c) monitoring of the experiment (the operator should see everything), (d) audio and video switching (use a one, not multiple mixers for each input and output modality), (e) assuring visitors can see and hear everything subjects see and hear, (f) accommodating TV crews, (g) light control (use blac...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} enable the {{variable}} linear vibration screen with ideal movement behavior of screen surface and efficient screening capacity, five-freedom dynamic model and stability equations of the variable linear vibration screen were established based on power balance method and Hamilton principle. The motion behaviour of <b>screen</b> <b>face</b> was investigated, and − 0. 10 m ≤ xf ≤ − 0. 04 m was confirmed as the best range of exciting position.

40|$|Current face {{identification}} approaches require {{computer systems}} to search through large quantity of face feature sets {{in the database}} and pick the ones that best match the features of an unknown input face. In this paper, a fast screening method for large face database searching is proposed. The method utilizes dominant points instead of edge maps as features for similarity measurement. A new formulation of Hausdorff distance is designed for merit-based dominant point matching. The screening experiments demonstrated that the proposed <b>face</b> <b>screening</b> method significantly improves the computational speed and the storage economy. It provides a very efficient way for large face databases searching and screening. 1...|$|R
