5000|$|The {{distillery}} {{features a}} 0.5 tonne mash tun and eight 2,500 litre washbacks. The distillation {{takes place in}} two copper pot stills supplied by Forsyths of Rothes, Scotland. [...] The wash still is a 2600-litre still, and the spirit still is a 1600-litre still. The main casks used for maturation of the core expressions are STR casks, (reconditioned ex-red wine casks) and American oak ex-bourbon casks. The distillery has also filled madeira, moscatel, rum, sherry and apple brandy casks. In April 2016, the distillery had so far filled 620 casks, with plans to produce around 300,000 bottles of single malt whisky per annum. Severn Trent water sources are used, and the distillery uses a carbon filter and <b>deionisation</b> process to filter the water before using it in the production and dilution processes. Unusually, {{the operation of the}} distillery is completely manual, with no automation. 123 valves are manipulated by hand to direct the movement of liquid around the distillery and to run the distillation processes. Several heat-exchange systems are used to recycle heat energy produced during distillation and the site also features 80 solar PV panels.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, cation {{exchange}} poly(arylene ether sulfone) copolymers for capacitive <b>deionisation</b> applications were studied, with {{the focus of}} enhancing the performance of activated carbon electrodes. Activated carbon has been studied extensively as an electrode material for capacitive <b>deionisation,</b> but faces {{a number of significant}} drawbacks, including the requirement of a polymeric binder, unfavourable pore distribution and low conductivity. Poly(arylene ether sulfone) random and multiblock copolymers were synthesised from 2, 5 - diphenylhydroquinone and diphenylsulfone monomers. The 2, 5 -diphenylhydroquinone monomer was found to impart conductivity and ion exchange properties, while the diphenylsulfone increased the stability of the polymers when cast as membranes. Sulfonation of pendant phenyl rings using post- sulfonation resulted in a high degree of sulfonation. The synthesis of copolymers with different monomer ratios was used {{to examine the effects of}} side-chain sulfonation, monomer ratio and copolymer structure on fundamental membrane properties for capacitive <b>deionisation.</b> Membranes prepared from poly(arylene ether sulfone) random and multiblock copolymers were found to have favourable properties, especially ion-exchange capacity, water uptake and transport number. Importantly, their conductivities were found to be similar to commercially available membranes used for capacitive <b>deionisation.</b> The use of activated carbon as an electrode material and the effects of graphite as a conductive filler were examined. The graphite content, while not greatly affecting electrode wettability, was found to greatly vary electrochemical performance. Samples with too low a graphite content were observed to have poor conductivity and low mesoporous and microporous capacitance. Increased graphite content resulted in only modest capacitance increases, highlighting the need for both an appropriate conductive filler and a carbon material with a favourable pore size distribution. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and equivalent circuit modelling, slow double layer formation in these electrodes was found to be caused by poor wettability and large resistance to electrolyte diffusion. When {{cation exchange}} copolymers were applied as coatings to activated carbon electrodes, the additional resistance was found to not significantly hinder the rate of double layer formation. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that a greater micropore capacitance could be achieved over a wide range of potentials due to the selective transport properties of polymers. The penetration of polymer into the carbon substrate during casting was also observed to improve electrode capacitance and kinetics. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results identified that both conductivity and water uptake are important properties that affect charging resistance and capacitance, and that optimal polymer design for membrane capacitive <b>deionisation</b> applications will require a high ion-exchange capacity without compromising polymer mechanical stability. To further improve the properties of activated carbon electrodes, random copolymers were used as novel binder materials. With a high enough concentration, good adhesion of particles comparable to commonly used hydrophobic binders was achieved. The wettability of the electrodes was greatly increased, however electrode capacitance was reduced due to polymer swelling and a loss of particle conductivity. Nonetheless, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed lower charging resistances compared to electrodes prepared with hydrophobic binders, suggesting there is potential to improve the performance of activated carbon electrodes with optimised hydrophilic binders...|$|E

40|$|The electrosorptive <b>deionisation</b> {{process has}} been {{investigated}} to develop the technology into a system for desalination. Experiments have been conducted in a reactor system {{and it has been}} found that the activated carbon has some <b>deionisation</b> capacity due to its very high adsorption capacity and conductivity, so it can be used as an alternative electrode material. Surface modifications have been made to the activated carbon material, including alkaline treatment and loading of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The specific surface areas (BET), average pore size and total pore volume were analysed by surface area and porosity analyzer. The modified electrode material demonstrated enhanced electrosorption capacity and reduced physical sorption at the pores, so desorption is more efficient. An innovative approach for desorption of the saturated activated carbon electrodes has been tried using ultrasonic vibration and increased temperature, the results of regeneration in water, aided by ultrasonic at 20 °C and 50 °C are presented as well. Cyclic voltammetry experiments at various scan rates were conducted using a potentiostat to analyse the electrical double-layer capacitance of the activated carbon materials. This preliminary study demonstrated that activated carbon granules have the potential to be cost-effective electrode materials for desalting brackish water. The improvement of the electrosorption efficiency can be achieved by surface modification by chemicals and metal oxide nanoparticles such as TiO 2...|$|E

40|$|Between 1968 and 1980 {{fractures}} {{occurred in}} 56 of 284 patients treated by home haemodialysis in the Sheffield area {{for longer than}} one year. Patients sustained {{four times as many}} fractures while using dialysate prepared with water containing more than 1. 0 mumol aluminium per 1 (2. 7 micrograms/ 100 ml) than while using water containing a smaller concentration. When aluminium was removed from water by <b>deionisation</b> the incidence of fractures diminished during the next year and no patient developed dialysis encephalopathy. These findings show that 1. 0 mumol/l is a safe maximum concentration of aluminium in water for use in home haemodialysis. It can be detected by the colorimetric aluminium analyses used by many water authorities. When financial resources are limited it is expedient to reserve aluminium analyses by electrothermal atomic absorption for plasma from patients receiving regular haemodialysis.

40|$|Chemically-doped graphenes are {{promising}} electrode materials for energy storage and electrosorption applications. Here, an affordable electrochemical green process is introduced to dope graphene with nitrogen. The process {{is based on}} reversing the polarity of two identical graphene oxide (GO) electrodes in molten KCl-LiCl-Li 3 N. During the cathodic step, the oxygen functional groups on the GO surface are removed through direct electro-deoxidation reactions or a reaction with the deposited lithium. In the anodic step, nitrogen is adsorbed {{onto the surface of}} graphene and subsequently reacts to form nitrogen-doped graphene. The doping process is controllable, and graphene with up to 7. 4 at% nitrogen can be produced.

The effects of pore arrangement pattern (ordered and random), and pore size distribution (mesoporous and microporous) on the desalination performance were investigated by comparing mesoporous carbons with activated carbons (ACs). It is found that the mesoporous carbons prepared by addition of nickel salts demonstrated higher specific capacitances than mesoporous carbons without nickel salts and the activated carbon electrodes.

40|$|Electrosorptive <b>deionisation</b> is an {{alternative}} process to remove salt ions from the brackish water. The porous carbon materials are used as electrodes. When charged in low voltage electric fields, they possess a highly charged surface that induces adsorption of salt ions on the surface. This process is reversible, so the adsorbed salt ions can be desorbed and the electrode can be reused. In the study, an ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) electrode was developed for electrosorptive desalination. The effects of pore arrangement pattern (ordered and random) and pore size distribution (mesopores and micropores) on the desalination performance was investigated by comparing OMC and activated carbon (AC). It were revealed from X-ray diffraction and N 2 sorption measurements that AC has both micropores and mesopores, whereas ordered mesopores are dominant in OMC. Their performance as potential electrodes to remove salt was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests at a range of electrolyte concentrations and sweep rates. It is deduced that under the same electrochemical condition the specific capacitance values of OMC electrode (i. e. 133 F/g obtained from CVat a sweep rate of 1 mV/s in 0. 1 M NaCl solution) are larger than those of AC electrode (107 F/g), suggesting that the former has a higher desalting capacity than the latter. Furthermore, the OMC electrode shows a better rate capacity than the AC electrode. In addition, the desalination capacities were quantified by the batch-mode experiment at low voltage of 1. 2 V in 25 ppm NaCl solution (50 ms/cm conductivity). It {{was found that the}} adsorbed ion amounts of OMC and AC electrodes were 11. 6 and 4. 3 mmol/g, respectively. The excellent electrosorptive desalination performance of OMC electrode might be not only due to the suitable pore size (average of 3. 3 nm) for the propagation of the salt ions, but also due to the ordered mesoporous structure that facilitates desorption of the salt. Based on the results, {{it was found that the}} development of an ordered mesoporous structure and the control of the number of micropores are two important strategies for optimising electrode material properties for electrosorptive <b>deionisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|With the {{exponentially}} {{growth of}} world {{population and the}} fast industrial development, the demand for clean and accessible fresh water increased dramatically {{and is expected to}} grow continually. Capacitive <b>deionisation</b> (CDI) technology is a novel low energy-consuming, low-cost and green desalination approach, therefore, has attracted numerous attentions and is regarded as a promising water purification technology for the future. This thesis aims to find cost-effective and high performance electrode materials for the CDI process, therefore, nanostructure porous carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and its composites, such as manganese oxide (MnO 2) /porous carbons and functionalised CNTs were synthesised, and applied in the CDI process. Nanoporous carbons and CNTs are promising electrode materials because of their high surface area, excellent electrochemical properties, suitable pore arrangement, mesoporosity, and suitable electrical conductivity. In the MnO 2 /carbon composites, MnO 2 contributed to the additional adsorption and insertion of cations, thus enhanced the CDI performance. On the other hand, CNTs functionalised by ion-selective groups showed advanced CDI behaviours owing to that the co-ion effects are minimised by surface charged groups. ...|$|E
