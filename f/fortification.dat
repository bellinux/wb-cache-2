5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had {{undermined}} the castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I {{announced that he}} would repair the <b>fortification</b> but instead the ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new <b>fortification,</b> Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at low tide.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the 1st and 2nd centuries, the 3rd and 4th centuries saw {{much greater}} <b>fortification</b> activity, with many new forts built. Later Roman fortifications, both new and {{upgraded}} old ones, contained much stronger defensive features than their earlier counterparts. In addition, the late 3rd/4th centuries saw the <b>fortification</b> of many {{towns and cities}} including the City of Rome itself and its eastern sister, Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The FIC {{includes}} information guides on the <b>fortifications</b> of Malta, {{going back}} to the first <b>fortifications</b> at Borġ in-Nadur and focusing especially on those built by the Order and the British.

25|$|Despite this, the <b>fortifications</b> {{had several}} shortcomings, mainly {{since they were}} still {{incomplete}} when they were captured by the Ottomans. The bastions have no piazza-bassa or cavaliers, and the curtain walls are quite low {{when compared to other}} contemporary city walls such as the <b>fortifications</b> of Heraklion and the <b>fortifications</b> of Valletta. The <b>fortifications</b> also lacked outworks.|$|R

5|$|Fort Wright was {{the first}} Confederate Army <b>fortification</b> built at Randolph. On January 20, 1861, the Memphis Appeal {{published}} a pro-secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis. In April 1861, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered to establish a camp and complete the <b>fortification</b> at Randolph. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task. By June 1861, fifty cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{its status}} as a {{first-class}} <b>fortification,</b> Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice. Work was even done to strengthen the defenses, as a stockade was added in the summer of 1865, and the parapets of the fort were re-sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve the look of the <b>fortification.</b>|$|E

50|$|Bermuda's {{seasonal}} {{occupants of}} the Turks Islands also raised militias there, as their lucrative salt trade invited attacks from enemies, foreign (France and Spain) and domestic (the Bahamas). The <b>fortifications</b> built in Bermuda by the militia (including the Castle Islands <b>Fortifications),</b> starting in 1612, remain the oldest English new world structures, {{as well as the}} first stone <b>fortifications,</b> the first coastal artillery, and the oldest surviving <b>fortifications</b> built by the English in the New World. The Militia manned these <b>fortifications</b> with standing bodies of artillerymen 'til the <b>fortifications</b> were taken over by the regular British Army following the American War of Independence, with some, like Fort St. Catherine's, used well into the 20th Century.|$|R

5|$|The next {{proposal}} {{to build a}} <b>fortification</b> on the island {{was made by the}} Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. He proposed a roughly hexagonal fort with a hornwork, in the Dutch style of <b>fortification.</b> The proposal was criticized by the Order's engineers, and a third proposal was drawn up by the Flemish military engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh in 1687. Grunenburgh's proposal consisted of a fort with four bastions and a ravelin, surrounded by a ditch, covertway and faussebraye.|$|E

50|$|Jersey is {{a heavily}} {{fortified}} island with coastal <b>fortifications</b> that date from different periods {{such as the}} English Civil War, the Napoleonic Wars, and Nazi Germany's occupation of the Channel Islands. The <b>fortifications</b> include castles, forts, towers, Martello towers, artillery batteries, and seawalls. Not infrequently, <b>fortifications</b> from one period are built {{on the site of}} earlier <b>fortifications,</b> or very near them, geography having remained the same even when firepower increased.|$|R
25|$|The first {{plans to}} restore the <b>fortifications</b> of Birgu were made in 2006, {{as part of a}} project that would also involve {{restoration}} of the <b>fortifications</b> of Valletta, Mdina and the Cittadella.

5|$|Between 1010 and 1020, {{the hill}} was reoccupied {{for use as}} a {{temporary}} Saxon mint, standing in for that at Ilchester. Some small-scale <b>fortification</b> of the site may also have occurred in the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Conisbrough Castle is {{a medieval}} <b>fortification</b> in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, England. The castle was {{initially}} {{built in the}} 11th century by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Hamelin Plantagenet, the illegitimate, parvenu son of Henry II, acquired the property by marriage in the late 12th century. Hamelin and his son William rebuilt the castle in stone, including its prominent -high keep. The castle remained in the family line into the 14th century, despite being seized several times by the Crown. The <b>fortification</b> was then given to Edmund of Langley, passing back into royal ownership in 1461.|$|E
5|$|Cowes Castle, {{also known}} as West Cowes Castle, is a Device Fort in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Originally built by Henry VIII in 1539 to protect England against the threat of {{invasion}} from France and the Holy Roman Empire, it comprised a circular bastion, flanking wings and a keep, and in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of artillery. With its companion <b>fortification</b> at East Cowes, the castle overlooked {{the entrance to the}} River Medina, an important anchorage. The invasion threat passed but the <b>fortification</b> continued in use until the middle of the 19th century, very briefly seeing action in 1642 during the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that <b>fortification</b> actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider <b>fortification</b> programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E

2500|$|To protect Krepost Sveaborg and {{the naval}} base in {{particular}} from a German attack from land the <b>fortifications</b> were built {{to protect the}} fortress. The first <b>fortifications</b> were hastily built in 1914 to block access to the Helsinki peninsula and to guard the eastern flank of Laajasalo and Santahamina by a scarce line of <b>fortifications</b> at Ruskeasuo-Pasila-Käpylä-Koskela-Viikki-Herttoniemi-Roihuvuori. Lauttasaari, Meilahti and Laajasalo were also fortified to some extent. It was also planned to fortify Kulosaari and Vartiosaari.
