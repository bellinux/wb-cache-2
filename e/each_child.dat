5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between <b>each</b> <b>child</b> (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that those with the syndrome {{who are capable of}} having children seek genetic counseling before deciding to have children.

As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with <b>each</b> <b>child</b> that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E

5|$|Life on Brook Farm {{was based}} on {{balancing}} labor and leisure while working together {{for the benefit of}} the greater community. Each member could choose to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and <b>each</b> <b>child</b> was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.|$|E

5|$|Maribor's Academy is {{responsible}} for youth development at the club, {{with the goal of}} developing young players for the future. The academy is composed of eleven youth selections, ranging from U7 to U19. Totally, there are over 210 youth players in the system who are trained by professional staff within the club. The vision of the club and its youth system is not only to produce new players but also to prepare young children for the future and life without football. Therefore, <b>each</b> <b>child</b> {{who wants to be a}} member of the academy must also be successful not only on the football field, but also in the field of education.

5|$|Quintilian {{provides}} the most extensive theory of primary education in Latin literature. According to Quintilian, <b>each</b> <b>child</b> has in-born ingenium, a talent for learning or linguistic intelligence that {{is ready to be}} cultivated and sharpened, as evidenced by the young child's ability to memorize and imitate. The child incapable of learning was rare. To Quintilian, ingenium represented a potential best realized in the social setting of school, and he argued against homeschooling. He also recognized the importance of play in child development, and disapproved of corporal punishment because it discouraged love of learning—in contrast to the practice in most Roman primary schools of routinely striking children with a cane (ferula) or birch rod for being slow or disruptive.|$|E

5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For <b>each</b> <b>child</b> to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places were hard to find.|$|E

5|$|The Family Edition, {{like the}} prior version, {{includes}} parental controls {{and the information}} filtering feature. Parental controls come {{with a list of}} objectionable sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated every two weeks by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A parental controls profile can be set up for <b>each</b> <b>child,</b> and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time.|$|E

5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for <b>each</b> <b>child.</b> Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E
5|$|Cooke {{was a more}} {{hands-on}} owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations. He personally financed {{construction of}} the Forum in 1967 {{at a cost of}} $16.5million. He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67million. Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce. Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate. Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998, and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well. Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988. In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league. Fast food chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor, the company gives all fans in attendance at home games a coupon for two free tacos if the Lakers hold their opponent under 100 points and win. The company also sponsors the team's halftime shows on KCAL-TV and Fox Sports West. In 2013, Buss {{died at the age of}} 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer. His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with <b>each</b> <b>child</b> receiving an equal vote.
