This much is not in dispute. What is being keenly debated, however, are the ways in which this experience should be analysed and what lessons should be drawn. Is it a case of understandable ‘teething problems’ which will be overcome as the qualification ‘beds in’ or are there deeper and more fundamental problems of the purpose and design of the <b>Key</b> Skills <b>Qualification</b> for advanced level students? In order to address these questions, this article examines the <b>Key</b> Skills <b>Qualification</b> within its historical and policy context as well as bringing together a range of quantitative and qualitative evidence gathered as part of an Institute of Education (IOE) /Nuffield Foundation Research Project. The research suggests that while there is support for the concept of <b>key</b> skills, the <b>Qualification</b> has been met with considerable student and professional resistance due to its narrow skills focus and assessment regime within the context of increased study programmes at advanced level. We conclude that the Government's aim of 'key skills for all' at advanced level is unlikely to be achieved unless it takes a fundamentally different approach to policy in this area...|$|R

The LDS Church abandoned the practice beginning in 1890 and now teaches that only a single celestial marriage is required for exaltation.|$|E

The paper presents parts of an empirical research of the development and shaping of verbal politeness in critical incidents investigating the way German and Turkish students of the German language deal with criticism and complimenting. The findings show that Turkish students of German as a foreign language avoid direct criticism and prefer manners considered to be polite in German. Complimenting {{is an expression of}} their own positive feelings and acts as “messages about oneself”, whereas the German students prefer “meritorious praise” referring to merits. The discriminating effects of migration within the Turkish students are smaller than expected perhaps because of the increase of transcultural knowledge.

40|$|The thesis aims at {{establishing}} {{what teachers}} of programme specific subjects {{state is the}} foundation for their assessment at the Hotel and Restaurant Programme (HR-programme). The theoretical framework of the thesis is based on social constructionism. The respondents were practising teachers of programme specific subjects at HR-programme. The empirical data based on interviews and video interviews was analyzed with: types of knowledge, <b>key</b> <b>qualifications,</b> specific vocational knowledge and skill and levels of expertise. Seven <b>key</b> <b>qualifications</b> have been discerned: independence, planning skills, problem solving skills, co-operation, customer contact, communication and power of initiative. These can be divided in three dimensions: personal, cognitive, and social/interactive. For the student, the most important to focus on for getting a higher grade is independence. Five categories of programme specific subjects have been identified: understanding the vocational area, skills in working techniques and methods, hygiene and handling work tools, as well {{the ability to see}} the whole and to act simultaneously. Differences in qualifications between levels of expertise can be identified in skills, speed and comprehensive thinking which appear to be valued more by the respondents. <b>Key</b> <b>qualifications</b> include all types of knowledge, theoretical knowledge, practical mastery and appropriate action but also a keen mind for reflection over ones actions. Appropriate action in general is assessed on the level of overall focus, the highest level of expertise, and theoretical knowledge the lowest level of expertise. There’s concordance between respondents on assessment of knowledge and skills. Students have to have a great part of specific vocational knowledge and skills to achieve the degree of Pass. The respondents’ descriptions and appraisements of what is assessed reflect their vocational culture where experience has a master role which could be the main reason why an inexperienced student cannot achieve higher grade levels...|$|E

40|$|Dominic Busch skizziert in seinem Artikel die Debatte um den Beitrag interkultureller Studiengänge zur {{employability}} ihrer Absolventen aus diskurstheoretischer Perspektive. Employers {{from the}} fields of private economy sometimes accuse universities for not providing their students with capabilities making them employable after finishing their studies. Especially subjects in the humanities very often are accused to neglect the mediation of practical and applicable knowledge and abilities. Intercultural Communication {{on the one hand}} is fre-quently considered as being an important key competence, {{but on the other hand}} many employers think that having covered this as a subject of university studies may not count as having acquired academic expertise in a specialised field. This article will present different perspectives and different understandings of the term employability from different societal groups. It will then propose to consider employability as a result of social discourse and as discursive construction representing different societal interests. On this behalf, employability as a discursive term shares considerable parallels with the terms of intercultural competence and intercultural communication. A deeper understanding of the role these terms play in social discourse may also contribute to a more constructive and synergetic debate about employability. Study programs from the field of intercultural communication may provide a basis for students to acquire the necessary skills. Holding a degree from a subject of the field of intercultural communication, graduates will not only be experts IN a <b>key</b> <b>qualification,</b> but they will also be experts FOR this <b>key</b> <b>qualification,</b> i. e. they will be able to analyse, explain, communicate, mediate and teach about the role intercultural communication and culture may play in respective situations.
