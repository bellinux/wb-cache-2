5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} <b>damping</b> produces {{its effects}} {{independent of the}} cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion <b>damping,</b> scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by <b>damping</b> effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion <b>damping.</b> This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} semi-active control for power harvesting using an electromechanical energy harvester. Two semi-active control strategies are proposed {{in the form of}} a time-periodic <b>damper</b> and a nonlinear cubic <b>damper.</b> For the periodic time-varying <b>damper</b> the average harvested power and the throw are obtained based on the Fourier series. The semi-active periodic time-varying <b>damper</b> is optimised to maximise the harvested power. The performance of the optimum semi-active periodic <b>damper</b> is compared with the optimum passive and semi-active on-off model at a particular frequency. It is demonstrated that the periodic time-varying <b>damper</b> can significantly increase the harvested power at all frequencies of interest. For the nonlinear <b>damper,</b> the harvested power and the throw are derived using the concept of the describing function. The results are compared with the linear <b>damper.</b> It is demonstrated that the nonlinear <b>damper</b> can significantly increase the absorbed power despite having much lower displacement compared to the linear <b>damper.</b> This makes the semi-active nonlinear <b>damper</b> very attractive for mechanical energy harvesters...|$|R
5|$|The {{strength}} of diffusion <b>damping</b> is calculated by a mathematical expression for the <b>damping</b> factor, which figures into the Boltzmann equation, an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB. The {{strength of}} the diffusion <b>damping</b> is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The primary effects on the diffusion length are from {{the properties of the}} plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion <b>damping.</b> The evolution of a plasma may also affect the <b>damping</b> process. The scale on which diffusion <b>damping</b> works is called the Silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the Silk mass and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} <b>damping</b> can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk <b>damping</b> {{applies only to}} <b>damping</b> of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk <b>damping</b> is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less <b>damping.</b> Photon diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} <b>damping,</b> {{also called}} photon diffusion <b>damping,</b> {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a <b>damping</b> by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E

The <b>damper</b> pressure loss characteristics and the interactions between the <b>damper</b> blade and shaft have been studied at various <b>damper</b> width ratios {{to take account of}} the <b>damper</b> leakage effects. At <b>damper</b> angles > 10 °, the <b>damper</b> pressure loss characteristics determined for <b>damper</b> -width ratios of 0. 5 to 1. 414 are found to be independent of the shaft sizes for typical rectangular and circular shafts with blockage area ratios ≤ 0. 16.
