40|$|Dry {{cleaning}} facilities using tetrachloroethene, {{also known}} as perchloroethylene (PCE) produce a solid <b>waste</b> consisting <b>of</b> spent filtering powder, mainly calcined diatomaceous earth, benthonites or other absorbent materials. These powders are normally used during dry washing for the organic solvent filtration and discoloration prior to its recovery by distillation and condensation with refrigerating fluid. Therefore spent filtering powder contains high concentrations of PCE, together with dyes and non-volatile residues. PCE is a compound belonging to the class of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons suspected of being carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans. For this reason spent filtering powders from dry cleaning are considered as hazardous waste, whose disposal in landfill is not allowed and for whom incineration represents the only viable alternative. Owing to the great concern that has been raised about potential emission of dioxins in the combustion of organic material {{in the presence of}} chlorine, alternative treatments should be considered. The objectives of this research were the characterization <b>of</b> a solid <b>waste</b> from dry cleaning activities, the evaluation of the organic solvent removal and recovery by means of different heat treatments with the aim of a reduction <b>of</b> the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> this <b>waste</b> for a possible landfill disposal as an alternative to combustion.

40|$|Abstract Background In Sweden NRT-products and Snus, {{are easily}} {{available}} {{and used as}} smoking cessation aids. However, most quit attempts are made without any cessation aids. The limited use of these products as cessation aids {{may be influenced by}} the way smokers perceive the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> NRT-products and Snus compared to smoking. The present study examines these perceptions and their association with perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> nicotine itself. Methods The study is based on the Swedish part of a two-nation web-based survey of daily smokers in Sweden (n = 1016) and Norway (n = 1000). Questionnaire items addressed perceptions of NRT-products' and Snus' harmfulness and nicotine's part of the health risks of smoking. Data analyses included cross-tabulations and logistic regressions. Results A majority, 59 % of the answers to the question about <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> NRT-products, and 75 % of the answers about <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> Snus, were inconsistent with the scientific evidence by demonstrating exaggerated perceptions <b>of</b> <b>harmfulness.</b> The strongest predictor of consistent answers was the perception <b>of</b> the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> nicotine. There were also significant associations with own experience of successful use of the products in question. Overall the perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> nicotine were considerably exaggerated. This pattern was more pronounced among women than men. Prevailing misperceptions {{may be related to the}} way that different tobacco and nicotine products are presented in the media and other publicly available information sources. Conclusions Public information about smoking and health should be expanded to include objective and unambiguous information regarding nicotine's part in the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> smoking and the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> different nicotine-containing products compared to smoking. This is essential in order to preclude that misperceptions regarding these matters could discourage smokers from adopting effective cessation practices with use of nicotine-containing aids. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{explored}} {{the value of}} providing information in a Fact Sheet to correct misperceptions about the relative <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> nicotine replacement products (NRT) and smokeless tobacco (ST), when compared to cigarette smoking. Methods Four convenience samples from different countries (Australia, UK, Sweden and USA) were surveyed concerning their beliefs about the relative <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> smokeless tobacco and NRT. Study participants were given the Fact Sheet that explained that nicotine, as used by consumers, is not particularly harmful and explained why. They were resurveyed one week later regarding their beliefs about the relative <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> smokeless tobacco and NRT and future intentions to use the products. Results In all four samples knowledge increased by similar amounts and beliefs regarding the lower <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> smokeless tobacco increased. However, misconceptions remained common and responses to belief measures were not always consistent. Likelihood of use of ST increased in all four samples after exposure to the Fact Sheet, but interest in NRT use only increased in the US sample. Conclusions A Fact Sheet {{such as this one}} can help address misconceptions about NRT and smokeless tobacco, {{at least in the short}} term. However, as is true of most educational interventions, exposure to a single educational session is not sufficient to overcome misperceptions that smokers have about the relative <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> oral versus combustible forms of nicotine delivery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive-behavioral {{models of}} chronic {{low back pain}} (CLBP) predict that {{dysfunctional}} assumptions about the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> activities may maintain pain-related fear and disability levels. The Photograph Series of Daily Activities (PHODA) is an instrument to determine the perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> daily activities in patients with CLBP. This study examined {{the psychometric properties of}} a short electronic version of the PHODA (PHODA-SeV). The results show that the PHODA-SeV measures a single factor and has a high internal consistency. The test-retest reliability and stability of the PHODA-SeV over a 2 -week time interval are good, with discrepancies between 2 measurements over 20 points suggesting true change. The construct validity is supported by the finding that both self-reported pain severity and fear of movement/(re) injury were uniquely related to the PHODA-SeV. Validity is further corroborated by the finding that patients who have received exposure in vivo, that aimed to systematically reduce the perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> activities, had significantly lower PHODA-SeV scores after treatment than patients receiving graded activity that did not address these assumptions. The findings support the PHODA-SeV as a valid and reliable measure <b>of</b> the perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> activities in patients with CLBP. Preliminary normative data of the PHODA-SeV are presented. PERSPECTIVE: This article describes a pictorial measurement tool (PHODA-SeV) for the assessment <b>of</b> the perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> activities in patients with chronic low back pain. The PHODA-SeV has good psychometric properties and can be used to elaborate on the contribution of beliefs about harmful consequences of activities to pain and disability. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> {{substances}} {{is a key}} {{concept of}} behavioural theories {{that have been used}} to explain substance use behaviours. However, perceptions of risk associated with substance use have rarely been examined among people with psychotic disorders. This study examined the relationship between perceived harm and patterns of substance use among people with and without psychotic disorders. It also aimed to identify the factors that may be associated with perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use among these populations. Methods: Participants were recruited via first year psychology courses, research databases and the social networking service ‘Facebook’. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire either online or on paper which assessed substance use, perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> substance use, history of mental illness, current psychological distress, and exposure to and acceptance of anti-substance use campaigns. A series of linear regressions were conducted to examine key predictors <b>of</b> the perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use. Results: 1046 participants were recruited. Participants were aged 18 to 86 years and 53. 2 % were female. For tobacco and cannabis, substance use was found to be inversely and significantly related to perceived harm of these substances. In addition, higher risk perceptions for tobacco and cannabis were associated with: being female, perceived effectiveness of anti-substance use campaigns, and less hazardous substance use. Increased age and negative psychosis status were also associated with higher risk perceptions for tobacco, while positive psychosis status was associated with higher risk perceptions for cannabis. Only perceived effectiveness of anti-drinking campaigns was found to be significantly related to perceived <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> alcohol. Conclusions: These results suggest that demographic, substance use, mental health and public health campaign variables are associated with perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> tobacco, cannabis, {{and to a lesser extent}} alcohol, among people with and without mental disorders. While messages regarding the negative consequences associated with cannabis use among people with psychotic disorders may be accepted, there is a continued need to highlight the negative consequences of smoking among people with psychotic disorders...|$|R

40|$|Replacing {{fossil fuels}} by logging-residue-based {{bioenergy}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a way to}} mitigate climate change. If residues are combusted for energy, their carbon content is released immediately. Residues, that are not combusted, decompose and emit carbon gradually. The relative <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> bioenergy emissions therefore depends on how strongly we prefer the slow release of carbon to an immediate one. Two factors affect this judgment: (1) our time preference and (2) our expectations regarding the relative <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> future carbon emissions. Neither aspect is included in established biomass emission factors. The Effective Emission Factor (EEF), outlined in this study, includes both aspects in a transparent and tractable way. We demonstrate the concept by deriving the EEFs for the logging residues of three Nordic tree species: Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and silver birch (Betula pendula). We also examine the sensitivity of the results to variation in time preference and damage expectations. The derived factors can be used to compare the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> carbon emissions from residue-based bioenergy and fossil fuel combustion and to organize bioenergy carbon taxation consistently with the taxation of fossil fuels...|$|R

40|$|Maintenance is {{the phase}} of the {{software}} lifecycle that comprises any modification after the delivery of an application. Modifications during this phase include correcting faults, improving internal attributes, as well as adapting the application to different environments. As application knowledge and architectural integrity degrade over time, so does the facility with which changes to the application are introduced. Thus, eliminating source code that presents characteristics that hamper maintenance becomes necessary if the application is to evolve. We group these characteristics under the term Source Code Issues. Even though there is support for detecting Source Code Issues, the extent <b>of</b> their <b>harmfulness</b> for maintenance remains unknown. One of the most studied Source Code Issue is cloning. Clones are duplicated code, usually created as programmers copy, paste, and customize existing source code. However, {{there is no agreement}} on the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> clones. This thesis proposes and follows a novel methodology to assess the effect of clones on the changeability of methods. Changeability is the ease with which a source code entity is modified. It is assessed through metrics calculated from the history of changes of the methods. The impact of clones on the changeability of methods is measured by comparing the metrics of methods that contain clones to those that do not. Source code characteristics are then tested to establish whether they are endemic of methods whose changeability decay increase when cloned. In addition to findings on the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> cloning, this thesis contributes a methodology that can be applied to assess the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> other Source Code Issues. The contributions of this thesis are twofold. First, the findings answer the question about the <b>harmfulness</b> <b>of</b> clones on changeability by showing that cloned methods are more likely to change, and that some cloned methods have significantly higher changeability decay when cloned. Furthermore, it offers a characterization of such harmful clones. Second, the methodology provides a guide to analyze the effect of Source Code Characteristics in changeability; and therefore, can be adapted for other Source Code Issues.
