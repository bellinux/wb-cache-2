5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica {{has long}} been a rare disease. Today, it appears in only 2% of {{individuals}} diagnosed with primary <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> which accounts for 90% of instances of the disease. Primary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> is three times as common in individuals with diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|Renal {{disease may}} lead to <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b> When too much calcium is lost, there is a {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b> If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{hospitalization}} {{rate for}} <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> in the United States in 1999 was 8.0 out of 100,000. The disease has a definite tendency to affect younger individuals, typically appearing {{before the age}} of 40, with a study in 1922 reporting that 70% of cases display symptoms {{before the age of}} 20, and 85% before 35. Primary hyperparathyoidism, as well as OFC, is more common in Asiatic countries. Before treatment for <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> improved in the 1950s, half of those diagnosed with <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> saw it progress into OFC.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of cases of <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> {{are the result of}} the random formation of benign, but metabolically active, parathyroid adenoma swellings. These instances comprise approximately 80–85% of all documented cases of <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hyperparathyroidism</b> and hypoparathyroidism, {{characterized}} by alterations {{in the blood}} calcium levels and bone metabolism, are states of surplus or insufficient parathyroid function,.|$|E
5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, which results in an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected {{through a combination of}} blood testing, X-rays, and tissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid {{carcinoma}} (cancer of the parathyroid gland) is {{the rarest}} cause of OFC, accounting for about 0.5% {{of all cases}} of <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b> OFC onset by parathyroid carcinoma is difficult to diagnose.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid {{disease is}} {{conventionally}} divided into {{states where the}} parathyroid is overactive (<b>hyperparathyroidism),</b> and states where the parathyroid is under- or hypoactive (hypoparathyroidism). Both states are characterised by their symptoms, which relate to the excess or deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood.|$|E
5|$|In {{especially}} {{severe cases}} of OFC, parathyroidectomy, or the full {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands, is the chosen route of treatment. Parathyroidectomy {{has been shown to}} result in the reversal of bone resorption and the complete regression of brown tumors. In situations where parathyroid carcinoma is present, surgery to remove the tumors has also led to the regression of <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> as well as the symptoms of OFC.|$|E
5|$|Most stones form {{due to a}} {{combination}} of genetics and environmental factors. Risk factors include high urine calcium levels, obesity, certain foods, some medications, calcium supplements, <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> gout and not drinking enough fluids. Stones form in the kidney when minerals in urine are at high concentration. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms, urine testing, and medical imaging. Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, cystine).|$|E
5|$|The other 10% {{of cases}} are {{primarily}} caused by primary hyperplasia, or {{an increase of}} the number of cells. Parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases, occurring most frequently in individuals around 50 years of age (in stark contrast to OFC as a result of primary <b>hyperparathyroidism)</b> and showing no gender preference. Approximately 95% of hyperparatyhroidism caused by genetic factors is attributed to MEN type 1. This mutation also tends to affect younger individuals.|$|E
25|$|Endocrine {{disorders}} {{that can}} induce bone loss include Cushing's syndrome, <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, acromegaly, and adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
25|$|Hypercalcemia (usually {{defined as}} a calcium level above the {{reference}} range) is mostly caused by either primary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> or malignancy, and therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} include these in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases are}} due to primary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> or cancer. Other causes include sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, Paget disease, {{multiple}} endocrine neoplasia (MEN), vitamin D toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, and certain medications such as lithium and hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
25|$|The uses of bisphosphonates {{include the}} {{prevention}} and treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, bone metastasis (with or without hypercalcaemia), multiple myeloma, primary <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> osteogenesis imperfecta, fibrous dysplasia, and other conditions that exhibit bone fragility.|$|E
25|$|Using {{for example}} {{epidemiology}} and the individual's risk factors, let's {{say that the}} probability that the hypercalcemia would have been caused by primary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> in the first place is estimated to be 0.00125 (or 0.125%), the equivalent probability for cancer is 0.0002, and 0.0005 for other conditions. With a probability given as less than 0.025 of no disease, this corresponds to a probability that the hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place of up to 0.02695. However, the hypercalcemia has occurred with a probability of 100%, resulting adjusted probabilities of at least 4.6% that primary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> has caused the hypercalcemia, at least 0.7% for cancer, at least 1.9% for other conditions and up to 92.8% for that there is no disease and the hypercalcemia is caused by random variability.|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> due to {{inadequate}} {{absorption of}} calcium may occur for GBP patients. Calcium is primarily {{absorbed in the}} duodenum, which is bypassed by the surgery. Most patients can achieve adequate calcium absorption by supplementation with vitamin D and calcium citrate (carbonate may not be absorbed—it requires an acidic stomach, which is bypassed).|$|E
25|$|Using {{the same}} probabilities that the hypercalcemia would have {{occurred}} in the first place by the other canditate conditions, the probability that hypercalcemia {{would have occurred}} in the first place is 0.00335, and given the fact that hypercalcemia has occurred gives adjusted probabilities of 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9% and 41.8%, respectively, for primary <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> cancer, other conditions and no disease.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{radiography}} is useful, both {{by itself}} and {{in conjunction with}} CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires {{a substantial amount of}} bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.|$|E
25|$|The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) {{provides}} {{standards that}} guides many commercial pet food companies, {{a level of}} supervision that does not occur with homemade food. One study analyzed the nutritional content of three homemade diets (BARF, Ultimate and Volhard) and two commercial raw food diets (Steve's Real Food and Sojourner Farms) and compared it to the AAFCO standards, showing nutritional imbalances in the homemade diets. Three of the diets had abnormal calcium-to-phosphorus ratios {{which can lead to}} <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> and fibrous osteodystrophy in puppies.|$|E
25|$|Oral dryness {{may also}} be caused by mouth breathing, usually caused by partial {{obstruction}} of the upper respiratory tract. Examples include hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Irradiation of the salivary glands often causes profound hyposalivation. Alcohol {{may be involved in}} the cause of salivary gland disease, liver disease, or dehydration. Smoking is another possible cause. Other recreational drugs such as methamphetamine, cannabis, hallucinogens, or heroin, may be implicated. Rarer causes include diabetes (dehydration), <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> cholinergic dysfunction (either congenital or autoimmune), salivary gland aplasia or atresia, sarcoidosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection (due to antiretroviral therapy, but also possibly diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome), graft-versus-host disease, renal failure, hepatitis C virus infection, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET proto-oncogene, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated receptor tyrosine kinase protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> and pheochromocytoma. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology. Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas.|$|E
500|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica {{is defined}} as the classic {{skeletal}} manifestation of advanced <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b> [...] Under the ICD-10 classification system, established by the World Health Organization, OFC is listed under category E21.0, primary <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{advent of}} the {{multichannel}} autoanalyzer in the 1960s and 70s led {{to an increase in}} early diagnosis of primary <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b> [...] This increase led to a sharp decline in the prolonged manifestation of the disease, leading to a drop in the number of cases of OFC due to the early detection of <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b> Before this invention, the diagnosis of primary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> was generally prolonged until the emergence of severe manifestations, such as OFC.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hyper{{parathyroid}}ism</b> is {{the state}} {{in which there is}} excess parathyroid hormone circulating. This may cause bone pain and tenderness, due to increased bone resorption. Due to increased circulating calcium, there may be other symptoms associated with hypercalcemia, most commonly dehydration. [...] <b>Hyperparathyroidism</b> is most commonly caused by a benign proliferation of chief cells in single gland, and rarely MEN syndrome. This is known as primary <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> which is generally managed by surgical removal of the abnormal parathyroid gland.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 1 in 10 {{documented}} {{cases of}} <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> {{are a result}} of hereditary factors. Disorders such as familial <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN Type 1) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome can, if left unchecked, result in OFC. MEN Type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder and the most common hereditary form of <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> affecting about 95% of genetic cases of OFC, and also tends to affect younger patients than other forms. Major mutations which can lead to <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> generally involve the parathyroid hormone receptor, G proteins, or adenylate cyclase. [...] Certain genetic mutations have been linked to a higher rate of parathyroid carcinoma occurrence, specifically mutations to the gene HRPT2, which codes for the protein parafibromin.|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} major causes of primary <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> {{that result in}} OFC: ...|$|E
500|$|Rates of OFC {{increase}} alongside {{cases of}} unchecked primary <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b> [...] In developing countries, such as India, rates of disease {{as well as}} case reports often mirror those published in past decades in the developed world.|$|E
500|$|The major {{symptoms}} of OFC are bone pain or tenderness, bone fractures, and skeletal deformities such as bowing of the bones. [...] The underlying <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> may cause kidney stones, nausea, constipation, fatigue and weakness. X-rays may indicate thin bones, fractures, bowing, and cysts. Fractures are most commonly localized in the arms, legs, or spine.|$|E
500|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica ( [...] ), is a {{skeletal}} disorder {{resulting in}} a loss of bone mass, a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known as osteitis fibrosa, osteodystrophia fibrosa, and von Recklinghausen's disease of bone (not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease, neurofibromatosis type I), is caused by <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over-active parathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.|$|E
500|$|OFC may be {{diagnosed}} {{using a variety}} of techniques. [...] Muscles in patients afflicted with OFC can either appear unaffected or [...] "bulked up." [...] If muscular symptoms appear upon the onset of <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> they are generally sluggish contraction and relaxation of the muscles. Deviation of the trachea (a condition in which the trachea shifts from its position at the midline of the neck), [...] in conjunction with other known symptoms of OFC can point to a diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma.|$|E
500|$|The {{condition}} was first described by Gerhard Engel in 1864 and Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1890, though William Hunter, {{who died in}} 1783, is credited with finding the first example of the disease. [...] "von Recklinghausen's disease" [...] (without the qualification [...] "of bone") is a completely unrelated disorder, nowadays termed neurofibromatosis. In 1884, Davies Colley delivered a presentation to the Pathological Society of London that detailed the manifestation of <b>hyperparathyroidism</b> into a brown tumor of the mandible, {{as well as the}} histological makeup of the tumor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mnemonic}} GETSMASHED {{is often}} used to remember the common causes of pancreatitis: G—gall stones, E—ethanol, T—trauma, S—steroids, M—mumps, A—autoimmune pancreatitis, S—scorpion sting, H—hyperlipidemia, hypothermia, <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> E—endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, D—drugs (commonly azathioprine, valproic acid, liraglutide) ...|$|E
2500|$|Calcium oxalate stones form in an acidic to neutral urine. [...] Two types {{naturally}} occur, {{calcium oxalate}} monohydrate, or whewellite (CaC2O4·H2O), and calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite (CaC2O4·2H2O). [...] Their appearance can be rough, smooth, spiculated (needle-like), or jackstone. [...] Calcium oxalate stones form more readily in animals with hypercalcaemia, which can caused by Addison's disease or {{certain types of}} cancer. [...] Hypercalcaemia results in hypercalciuria, which can also be caused by Cushing's syndrome or <b>hyperparathyroidism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hypocalcemia, due to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 {{deficiency}} (caused by {{stimulation of}} FGF-23 and reduction of renal mass), {{and resistance to}} the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone. Osteocytes {{are responsible for the}} increased production of FGF-23, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3). Later, this progresses to secondary <b>hyperparathyroidism,</b> renal osteodystrophy, and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function. An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis.|$|E
