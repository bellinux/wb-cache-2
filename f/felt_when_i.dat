500|$|After {{the start}} of the 21st century, Buckles {{continued}} living near Charles Town, West Virginia, and was still driving a tractor on his farm at age 103. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency". He has also stated that, [...] "If your country needs you, you should be right there, that is the way I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young, and that's the way I feel today." ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{explained}} that the song's theme was [...] "complete loneliness," [...] going on to state: [...] "It {{was important to me}} that that there'd be something searingly poetic about it, in a lyrical sense, and yet jubilant at the same time." [...] Goddard described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "a bleak proclamation of doomed happiness [...] a shattering left-hook of self-loathing, loss and desperation". Years later Morrissey considered the song to be the group's [...] "most special." [...] The singer said he was particularly proud of the song's second verse, which included the lines [...] "Though we may be hidden by rags/We have something they'll never have." [...] Morrissey {{explained that}} the verse described [...] "how I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> couldn't afford clothes and used to dress in rags but I didn't really feel mentally impoverished." ...|$|E

6000|$|His wife {{remained}} serious. [...] "It was a {{very fine}} point,--a very little thing to reject a man for. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first read her letter about it." ...|$|R
500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{picked him}} for the first Test, and on the very first {{occasion}} he touched a ball in Test rugby he found himself opposed one-on-one by Stu Wilson, then widely rated the number-one winger in the world, in the middle of Lancaster Park. Campese stood Wilson up and ran around him so easily that he might have been playing Test Rugby for years. He did it once or twice again before the match was over and on one occasion scored a try. I was enthused, and so was the media. They wrote of him in glowing terms next day... I don't believe I have ever lost the sense of wonder at his ability which I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw him run around Stu Wilson on Lancaster Park." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another storyline Nancy became romantically {{involved}} with both Kris Fisher and Ravi Roy, who also begin a relationship unbeknownst to Nancy. Fox {{said that when}} series producer Bryan Kirkwood told her of the storyline she was initially pleased as she had always felt that Kris and Nancy [...] "would go well together" [...] but when he revealed the full details, that Nancy would also be {{involved with}} Ravi {{at the same time}} she was [...] "quite shocked". She expanded on this, saying: [...] "Nancy's never cheated on anyone in her life because that's not who she is. But Bryan said to me 'we're going to have a lot of fun with this and I want it to be like a Carry on with loads of door-shutting and times when you don't know who's going to get caught'. So that's what we went for in the end". Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would [...] "be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts". She added that Nancy is [...] "speechless" [...] which is different for her as [...] "she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything". Fox said that Nancy has [...] "no right" [...] to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: [...] "No words could describe how I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read it for the first time!" [...] The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with [...] "someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she wants that security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long".|$|E
6000|$|She added after a pause--"There {{has been}} a time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> could {{understand}} him. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> knew what was in his mind better than he knew it himself. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> him. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> held him. [...] . And now he has escaped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel bright," [...] said Jim. [...] "For one thing, I've got up, {{and then}} you have been here some time. You brace one. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was very sick." ...|$|R
60|$|Those words {{seemed to}} awaken in her {{something}} of the hope which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> uttered them. She replied to my questions with more than docility--she exerted her intelligence; she willingly opened her whole mind to me.|$|R
60|$|With these {{pleasant}} anticipations, I {{opened the}} letter. Judge what I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found {{what it really}} contained.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not till}} after dinner {{that the story}} was told about Crocker. [...] "Think what I must have <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was told that a clerk from the Post Office wanted to see me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The passion <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> Martin, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{dared not}} do this,' he said, 'was in the blow I struck just now. Why did we ever part! How could we ever part! How could you ever fly {{from me to}} him!' ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} missing. <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was speaking. To me my voice {{had had no}} ring of conviction. And then I saw what it was. There was no mystery. We knew each other too well. Friendship kills love.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>felt</b> misgivings <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw Nana going out; but {{it would}} have come to the same thing, in the end, for if Scindia's whole army, villainous as is the treachery, had {{advanced}} against the town, Nana could have gathered no force to oppose them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Supposing--I {{only say}} supposing--I felt now, as I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{traveled}} to London with Armadale; and when I saw {{my way to}} his life as plainly as I saw the man himself all through the journey...? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. Wasn't it extraordinary? I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw my cloak in Scotland Yard: There, I KNEW I should recover you. And I always feel, as I say, {{that there}} is some higher power which helps me. Do you feel the same?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{very bad}} poetry, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrote it, one day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was very lonely, {{and had a}} good cry on a rag bag. I {{never thought it would}} go where it could tell tales," [...] said Jo, tearing up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.|$|R
2500|$|He {{was also}} {{influenced}} by the Great American Songbook and popular country singers like Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams.

[...] I felt something different." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zieselman {{discovered}} her medical records at age 41, including {{a statement that}} she and her parents had consented after full disclosure of a diagnosis. Discovery was disorientating, challenging her identity and that of her husband, but Zieselman has also described how [...] "I <b>felt</b> free <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found out".|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little bit}} excited about it, aren't you?" [...] he smilingly said. [...] "I {{remember}} how I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went to Chicago the first time. I suppose {{this seems like}} Chicago to you. How did you leave {{the people in the}} coulé, all well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you ought}} to break {{yourself}} in at once. Just break the ice and you'll have no further trouble. I remember just how bad I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first came to New York to look for work. But I'm over it now, thank goodness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Father John, av {{you could}} feel all I <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first knew the man was dead--when my own sisther spurned me--and when {{my father told me}} I was a murdherer, you wouldn't wonder at my flying, av it were only for an hour." ...|$|E
60|$|She ceased abruptly, {{and grew}} pale, while <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> ashamed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw {{the cause of}} it.

"You {{can imagine}} what agony <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>when,</b> as <b>I</b> entered the open space, I saw a surging mass of Sepoys, and no sign of any of you; and how I cursed my own folly, and what delight I felt, as on cutting our way through we found that you were still on your feet." ...|$|R
5000|$|Drew {{explained}} his stage name during {{an appearance on}} USA Today in 2007, stating, [...] "The whole reason for calling myself Plan B was that I was doing this sweet-boy Justin Timberlake shit, but <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> comfortable... <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started rapping, {{it was easier for}} me to feel comfortable." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That was it, you know,' {{interposed}} {{the same}} small quiet voice that had spoken once before.

60|$|All the {{particulars}} of the fatal duel which I had gleaned from the French newspaper in Monkton's room at Naples recurred vividly to my memory.
