5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core {{is thought to be}} electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is missing {{because of a lack of}} convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may <b>have</b> <b>shut</b> down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust.|$|E

25|$|Cape Breton Island {{is notable}} for its mining industry. When explorers and {{settlers}} arrived {{here in the}} 17th and 18th centuries, they were focused on the coal, which was discovered in rocks and cliffs. Coal was used to heat houses and factories, used by blacksmiths to mold iron, and for the steam engines of trains. Coal was extracted principally in the Sydney–Glace Bay area of Cape Breton Island, until the mines were closed in 2001. Many mines <b>have</b> <b>shut</b> down as coal becomes a less popular fuel. Despite this, Nova Scotia still gets most of its electricity from coal, most of which is now imported. Some of Cape Breton's mines have been turned into tourist attractions and museums, and retired miners take people on tours of old mines.|$|E

25|$|On January 3, 2008, Landmark Communications put The Weather Channel and {{its assets}} up for sale.

The sale was finalized on September 12, 2008. NBC Universal also owned NBC Weather Plus, a rival service which was carried by and featured content from the NBC television network's local network affiliates; that service announced its discontinuation three months later. Over-the-air digital subchannels carrying Weather Plus have since switched to the similarly formatted The Local AccuWeather Channel, kept the Weather Plus engine, or switched affiliations to other networks such as This TV or the Retro Television Network; some <b>have</b> <b>shut</b> down entirely.|$|E
25|$|Canadian refineries, {{outside of}} the major oil {{producing}} provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built {{on the assumption that}} light and medium crude oil would continue to be cheap in the long term, and that imported oil would be cheaper than oil sands production. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces, and British Columbia where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast <b>have</b> <b>shut</b> down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{institution}} of federal regulations limiting media cross-ownership after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV (now WNYW-TV) and four other stations from Metromedia to launch the Fox Broadcasting Company, Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow, a real-estate magnate with no news experience. When Kalikow declared bankruptcy in 1993, the paper was temporarily managed by Steven Hoffenberg, a financier who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud; and, for two weeks, by Abe Hirschfeld, who made his fortune building parking garages. After a staff revolt against the Hoffenberg-Hirschfeld partnership—which included publication of an issue whose front page featured the iconic masthead photo of founder Alexander Hamilton with a single tear drop running down his cheek—Post was again purchased in 1993 by Murdoch's News Corporation. This came about after numerous political officials, including Democratic governor of New York Mario Cuomo, persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the cross-ownership rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier. Without that FCC ruling, the paper would <b>have</b> <b>shut</b> down. Under Murdoch's renewed direction, the paper continued its conservative editorial viewpoint.|$|E

25|$|Unit 2 was {{operating}} {{at the time}} of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units. As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system main pump and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power. The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen. The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to <b>have</b> <b>shut</b> down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March. The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant. A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases. The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.|$|E

500|$|Potemkin {{argued with}} Suvorov and Catherine herself, who were both anxious to assault Ochakov, which the Turks twice managed to supply by sea. Finally, on 6 December, the assault began and {{four hours later}} the city was taken, a coup for Potemkin. Nearly ten {{thousand}} Turks had been killed {{at a cost of}} (only) two-and-a-half thousand Russians. Catherine wrote that [...] "you [...] <b>have</b> <b>shut</b> the mouths of everyone... show magnanimity to your blind and empty-headed critics". Potemkin then visited the naval yard at Vitovka, founded Nikolayev, and traveled on to St. Petersburg, arriving in February 1789. In May he left once more for the front, having agreed contingency plans with Catherine should Russia be forced into war with either Prussia or the upstart Poland, which had recently successfully demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory. (Catherine herself was just about to change favorites for the final time, replacing Dmitriev-Mamonov with Platon Zubov.) Back on the Turkish front, Potemkin advanced towards the fortress of Bender on the Dniester river.|$|E
