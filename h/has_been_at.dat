5|$|The valley {{includes}} several Sites of Special Scientific Interest including Westhay Moor, Shapwick Heath and Shapwick Moor. Much {{of the area}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> the centre of peat extraction on the Somerset Levels. Large areas of peat were laid down on the Somerset Levels, particularly in the River Brue Valley, during the Quaternary period after the ice sheets melted. The extraction of peat from the Moors {{is known to have}} taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. Peat extraction on the Somerset Moors continues today, although much reduced.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> {{least one}} report of {{deliberate}} vandalism to the structure, but the primary concern relating to {{visitors to the}} site {{is the possibility of}} damage caused through tread wear. The site is not heavily trafficked and any wear to the structure since the 1980s would likely be mitigated by the protection from the natural re-establishment of plant growth over its surface. Updates by the North York Moors National Park authority and English Heritage suggest that natural weathering and grazing sheep represent greater erosion risks to the structure than do human agents.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the club}} was founded, there have been 30 managers. The honours won by the club under each manager's {{stewardship}} are also detailed. As of {{the start of the}} 2017 season, 28 men have held the post of Malmö FF manager, the most successful of whom in terms of trophies won is Bob Houghton, who, as manager between 1974 and 1980, led the club to three Swedish league championships and four Svenska Cupen wins.

Although Roy Hodgson led Malmö FF to the Allsvenskan crown five times in a row between 1985 and 1989, the national championship was decided by a championship play-off during this time, and Malmö FF only won this in 1986 and 1988. Houghton is the club's longest-serving manager, having occupied the position between 1990 and 1992 in addition to the aforementioned period, giving him a total of 10 years in charge.
