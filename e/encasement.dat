McDuffie during his death at the 1991 Budweiser at The Glen racing event. A single-car crash with rookie Parker Kligerman caused Nemechek's car to struggle until it was driven to the garage on lap 310 of 500. Nemechek's constant start and park performances has caused him to beat McDuffie's old record in 655 races. In April 2014, Nemechek {{announced that he would}} be driving the No. 86 Deware Racing Group Chevrolet Camaro with sponsorship from Bubba Burger. In the 2014 Aarons 312, Nemechek was running towards the front during the entire race. With 3 laps remaining, Nemechek was running in the top 10 and finished 6th, his 126th top ten in the Nationwide Series. For the Coke Zero 400, Nemechek entered with the No. 29 RAB Racing Toyota with sponsorship from Toyota Care, but failed to qualify. Nemechek joined Randy Humphrey Racing for the Oral-B USA 500, qualifying 34th and finishing 37th. He returned to RAB Racing's No. 29 at the 2014 GEICO 500, and initially qualified 24th. However, his car failed post-race inspection for an improperly sealed oil tank <b>encasement,</b> leaving him as one of the race's 3 DNQs. This was the first time Nemechek did not race on a superspeedway in his 22 years of Sprint Cup competition.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a case study representing, in an {{evolving}} design repository, the design essence of new <b>encasements</b> for the United States Charters of Freedom (CoF) —namely the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Specifically redesigned {{for the purpose of}} housing and preserving our national documents, the nine <b>encasements</b> each consist of three principal systems—a sealing system, a placement system and a safeguarding system. The <b>encasements</b> were needed to replace the ones manufactured in the early 1950 s, because of glass deterioration; these newer <b>encasements</b> are designed to last 100 years. To populate the design repository, we represent engineering geometry, function and associated behavior. We model geometry with digital photographs and Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) models of actual Computer-Aided Design (CAD) drawings, and represent function with linked textual descriptions. Design rationale is represented explicitly. Through an evolving user interface, this representation serves to capture the more than 50 parts and systems of the <b>encasements</b> {{in such a way that}} the information relating to form, function, behavior and rationale is accessible and browsable to interested parties via the Internet. We conclude that such a representation, or ones similar to it, can provide the basis for a generic design repository, in which specific information—including design rationale—can be readily accessed by interested parties...|$|R
500|$|In 1885, {{a hidden}} {{structure}} under the base was accidentally discovered. The [...] "hidden footing" [...] contains reliefs, 160 {{of which are}} narratives describing the real Kāmadhātu. The remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors, illustrating the scenes to be carved. The real base is hidden by an <b>encasement</b> base, the purpose of which remains a mystery. It was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill. There is another theory that the <b>encasement</b> base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed, according to Vastu Shastra, the Indian ancient book about architecture and town planning. Regardless of why it was commissioned, the <b>encasement</b> base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration.|$|E

The dirt and grime were then cleaned from the parchments, though original intentional marks were left alone. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were then humidified and dried under tension to flatten the parchments. The Declaration of Independence, which has been damaged by frequent handling and exposure, was not humidified because of its increased moisture sensitivity. All the parchments were then installed into new titanium and aluminum <b>encasements,</b> developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which are filled with inert argon gas.

Roush Fenway Racing chief engineer Chris Andrews took over Osborne's role at the next race weekend. Edwards and car owner Jack Roush incurred the loss of 100 driver and owner points. In the event that Edwards qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup, he would not receive ten bonus points awarded to him for winning the race which was used to determine the seeding order.

2500|$|Conventional {{ballasted}} tunnel-track {{was ruled}} out {{owing to the}} difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. [...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean <b>encasement</b> concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|E

60|$|Variation.--In some {{specimens}} in the British Museum, {{collected by}} Sir J. Ross, in the Southern ocean, {{and in another}} older set from an unknown source, several parts of the outer tunic of the animal's body presented the remarkable fact of being calcified, but to a variable degree; whereas in several specimens from California, there was no vestige of this <b>encasement.</b> Considering it most improbable that the calcification of the integuments should be a variable character, I most carefully compared the above-mentioned sets of specimens, valve by valve, trophi by trophi, and cirri by cirri, and found no other difference of any kind; therefore I cannot hesitate to consider both {{to be the same}} species. The first Southern specimen which I examined presented the following characters: on the prosoma there was a central longitudinal band, formed of a thin, brittle, brown-coloured calcified layer, which became irregularly rather narrow towards the thorax; on each side it sent out six or seven irregular rectangular plates, which surrounded and supported the bases of the two rows of filamentary appendages; and outside these, some of the papilliform projections also had their bases surrounded by small, calcified, separate rings. The thoracic segments corresponding with the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth cirri had, on each side, an elongated calcified plate; on the ventral surface of the thorax, {{between the first and second}} cirri, there were two minute plates. In all the cirri, excepting the first pair, the segments of the rami, and in the three posterior pairs, the segments of the pedicels, had their dorsal surfaces strengthened by oblong, quadrilateral, calcified shields, the upper margins of which are notched for the dorsal tufts of spine, and the two lateral margins are also slightly hollowed out; these are represented in figure 27. The lower segments of the pedicels of some of the cirri, had an additional calcified plate on the antero-lateral face.|$|E

Septated and branched intercellular hyphae of the pycnial stage occurred mostly in the cortex but also in phloem and xylem. The haustoria, separated from their mother cells by septa, were elongated and sometimes coiled. In a few cases a papilla-shaped collar was observed at the penetration site. Cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum and organelles of the host cell were frequently observed accumulated around the haustoria. The haustorial sheath bordered by the invaginated host plasmalemma varied in thickness and structure. In young haustoria it was thin and filled with homogeneous material of moderate electron density. The sheath membrane was smooth. Those haustorial sheaths that probably represented later stages were thick and contained a lot of electron-dense grains. The associated sheath membranes were convoluted. Some haustoria were trapped in <b>encasements,</b> possibly originating from deposition of macromolecules in the sheath. These <b>encasements</b> could attain a considerable thickness and sometimes several zones of varying appearance were discernible. The encased haustoria were often more or less degenerated. The high frequency of necrotic host cells observed might indicate another type of defence reaction. Sometimes they contained dead haustoria...|$|R
