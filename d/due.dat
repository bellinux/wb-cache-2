5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, <b>due</b> to his crossing ability {{with his left}} foot, as well as <b>due</b> to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield <b>due</b> to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man <b>due</b> to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E

2500|$|To {{cover the}} cost of the higher {{payments}} to the AFT, Condell sought a large <b>dues</b> increase from PEF members. [...] Condell proposed raising <b>dues</b> on a sliding scale, with its lowest-paid members incurring a 14 percent <b>dues</b> increase while its highest-paid members saw a 55 percent <b>dues</b> increase. The <b>dues</b> hikes would be the first since the last year of Kraemer's presidency. Although Condell expected easy passage of the <b>dues</b> hike, the proposal did not win the 60 percent majority needed at the PEF convention in October 1986. [...] Condell immediately resubmitted the <b>dues</b> proposal to members two days later, and it easily passed (leading to an average increase of $4.08 per member per month, giving the union about $2.8 million more each year). The extra <b>dues</b> allowed PEF to build a new headquarters in Latham, New York.|$|R

5|$|Black's view on <b>due</b> process {{drew from}} his reading of British history; to him, <b>due</b> process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of <b>due</b> process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive <b>due</b> process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural <b>due</b> process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E

The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some <b>due</b> to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported <b>due</b> to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E

50|$|The AFL-CIO {{constitution}} permits international {{unions to}} pay state federation and CLC <b>dues</b> directly, {{rather than have}} each local or state federation pay them. This relieves each union's state and local affiliates of the administrative duty of assessing, collecting and paying the <b>dues.</b> International unions assess the AFL-CIO <b>dues</b> themselves, and collect them {{on top of their}} own dues-generating mechanisms or simply pay them out of the <b>dues</b> the international collects. But not all international unions pay their required state federation and CLC <b>dues.</b>|$|R

One of the problems with the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance <b>due</b> to limited bandwidth between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP.

50|$|Education Minnesota — {{which was}} {{affiliated}} {{with both the}} AFT and NEA — remained unaffected by the failed national merger. Judy Schaubach, president of MEA, and Sandra Peterson, president of MFT, were elected as co-presidents. But the lack of pre-merger ground rules came back to haunt the merged union. Disagreement between the two parent unions broke out over payment of per capita <b>dues.</b> Each parent union insisted that it receive its full <b>dues,</b> which would have doubled the <b>dues</b> of Education Minnesota members. The issue remained unresolved for two years, until an agreement was reached that established a new <b>dues</b> level. Back <b>dues</b> to NEA were paid down, while AFT forgave its anticipated <b>dues.</b>|$|R
