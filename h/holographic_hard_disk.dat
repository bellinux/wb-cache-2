The program formatted the <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> 8 megabytes at a time (CP/M's limit for a logical disk drive) until it had successfully finished four partitions and quit, or suddenly ran out of <b>hard</b> <b>disk.</b> Thus a 10 MB <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> had an 8 MB partition and a 2 MB partition; a 20 MB <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> had two 8 MB partitions and one 4 MB partition; and a 32 MB <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> had four 8 MB partitions.

The initial research has uncovered a range of issues and factors that affect the speed of erasure of <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract — A hybrid <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> {{employs the}} {{advantages}} of both a <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> and a NAND flash memory, thus making it a cost-effective fast secondary storage device. In this paper, we improve its I/O performance by combining an intelligent data pinning policy for the flash memory with a caching technique which is aware of access patterns for the flash memory and DRAM. Our proposed techniques reduce the system boot time and application launching time while reducing energy consumption, which is vital in the mobile devices. We built SimHybrid, a flexible trace-driven hybrid <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> evaluation environment, {{and used it to}} demonstrate how a hybrid <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> can achieve significantly better I/O performance than a traditional <b>hard</b> <b>disk</b> while using much less energy 1.
