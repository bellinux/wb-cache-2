60|$|But {{although}} {{the experience in}} question is common, it is not wholly easy to give a theoretical account of it. How {{do we know that}} the sensation resembles the previous image? Does the image persist in presence of the sensation, so that we can compare the two? And even if SOME image does persist, {{how do we know that}} it is the previous image unchanged? It does not seem as if this line of inquiry offered much hope of a successful issue. It is better, I think, to take a more external and causal view of the relation of expectation to expected occurrence. If the occurrence, when it comes, gives us the feeling of <b>expectedness,</b> and if the expectation, beforehand, enabled us to act in a way which proves appropriate to the occurrence, that must be held to constitute the maximum of verification. We have first an expectation, then a sensation with the feeling of <b>expectedness</b> related to memory of the expectation. This whole experience, when it occurs, may be defined as verification, and as constituting the truth of the expectation. Appropriate action, during the period of expectation, may be regarded as additional verification, but is not essential. The whole process may be illustrated by looking up a familiar quotation, finding it in the expected words, and in the expected part of the book. In this case we can strengthen the verification by writing down beforehand the words which we expect to find.|$|E

[...] She went on to {{celebrate}} Maxwell's achievement till he was quite out of countenance, for he knew that she was doing it mainly to rub his greatness into her father, and he had so much of the old grudge left that he would not suffer himself to care whether Hilary thought him great or not. It was a relief when Mrs. Hilary came in. Louise became less defiant in her joy then, or else the effect of it was lost in Mrs. Hilary's assumption of an entire <b>expectedness</b> in the event. Her world was indeed so remote from the world of art that she could value success in it only as it related itself to her family, and it seemed altogether natural to her that her daughter's husband should take its honors. She was by no means a stupid woman; for a woman born and married to wealth, with all the advantages that go with it, she was uncommonly intelligent; but she could not help looking upon æsthetic honors of any sort as in questionable taste. She would have preferred position in a son-in-law to any distinction appreciable to the general, but wanting that it was fit he should be distinguished in the way he chose. In her feeling it went far to redeem the drama that it should be related to the Hilarys by marriage, and if she had put her feeling into words, which always oversay the feelings, they would have been to the effect that the drama had behaved very well indeed, and deserved praise. This is what Mrs. Hilary's instinct would have said, but, of course, her reason would have said something quite different, and it was her reason that spoke to Maxwell, and expressed a pleasure in his success that was very gratifying to him. He got on with her better than with Hilary, partly because she was a woman and he was a man, and partly because, though she had opposed his marriage with Louise more steadily than her husband, there had been no open offence between them. He did not easily forgive a hurt to his pride, and Hilary, with all his good will since, and his quick repentance at the time, had never made it quite right with Maxwell for treating him rudely once, when he came to him so helplessly in the line of his newspaper work. They were always civil to each other, and they would always be what is called good friends; they had even an air of mutual understanding, as regarded Louise and her exuberances. Still, she was so like her father in these, and so unlike her mother, that it is probable the understanding between Hilary and Maxwell concerning her was only the understanding of men, and that Maxwell was really more in sympathy with Mrs. Hilary, even about Louise, even about the world. He might have liked it as much as she, if he had been as much of it, and he thought so well of it as a world that he meant to conquer one of the chief places in it. In the meantime he would have been very willing to revenge himself upon it, to satirize it, to hurt it, to humble it--but for his own pleasure, not the world's good.|$|E

50|$|Correspondent inferences {{state that}} people make inferences about a person when their actions are freely chosen, are unexpected, and result in {{a small number of}} {{desirable}} effects. According to Edward E. Jones and Keith Davis' correspondent inference theory, people make correspondent inferences by reviewing the context of behavior. It describes how people try to find out individual's personal characteristics from the behavioral evidence. People make inferences on the basis of three factors; degree of choice, <b>expectedness</b> of behavior, and effects of someone's behaviors. For example, we believe we can make stronger assumptions about a man who gives half of his money to charity, than we can about one who gives $5 to charity. An average person would not want to donate as much as the first man because they would lose a lot of money. By donating half of his money, it is easier for someone {{to figure out what the}} first man's personality is like. The second factor, that affects correspondence of action and inferred characteristic, is the number of differences between the choices made and the previous alternatives. If there aren't many differences, the assumption made will match the action because it is easy to guess the important aspect between each choice.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} {{theoretical}} sampling is best described by Glaser and Strauss in the 1960s. It is a memo from their research for “Awareness of Dying”. It explains how {{the search of}} data is active throughout the research process as the researcher keeps probing into other relevant theoretical questions-“Visits to the various medical services were scheduled as follows: I wished first to look at services that minimized patient awareness (and so first looked at premature baby service and then a neurosurgical service where patients were frequently comatose). I wished next to look at dying {{in a situation where}} expectancy of the staff was great and dying was quick, so I observed on an Intensive Care Unit. Then I wished to observe on a service where staff expectations of terminality were great but where patients might or might not be, and where dying tended to be slow. So I looked next at a cancer service. I wished then to look at conditions where death was unexpected and rapid, and so looked at an emergency service. While we were looking at some different types of services, we also observed the above types of serviced at other types of hospitals. So, our scheduling of types of services was directed by a general conceptual scheme- which included hypotheses about awareness, <b>expectedness</b> and rate of dying- as well as by a developing conceptual structure including matters not at first envisioned. Sometimes we returned to services after the initial two or three or four weeks of continuous observation, in order to check upon items which needed checking or had been missed in the initial period." ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{auditory}} expectation {{have focused on}} the <b>expectedness</b> perceived by listeners retrospectively in response to events. In contrast, this research examines predictive uncertainty - a property of listeners’ prospective state of expectation prior to the onset of an event. We examine the information-theoretic concept of Shannon entropy as a model of predictive uncertainty in music cognition. This is motivated by the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, which proposes that schematic expectations reflect probabilistic relationships between sensory events learned implicitly through exposure. Using probability estimates from an unsupervised, variable-order Markov model, 12 melodic contexts high in entropy and 12 melodic contexts low in entropy were selected from two musical repertoires differing in structural complexity (simple and complex). Musicians and non-musicians listened to the stimuli and provided explicit judgments of perceived uncertainty (explicit uncertainty). We also examined an indirect measure of uncertainty computed as the entropy of <b>expectedness</b> distributions obtained using a classical probe-tone paradigm where listeners rated the perceived <b>expectedness</b> of the final note in a melodic sequence (inferred uncertainty). Finally, we simulate listeners’ perception of <b>expectedness</b> and uncertainty using computational models of auditory expectation. A detailed model comparison indicates which model parameters maximize fit to the data and how they compare to existing models in the literature. The results show that listeners experience greater uncertainty in high-entropy musical contexts than low-entropy contexts. This effect is particularly apparent for inferred uncertainty and is stronger in musicians than non-musicians. Consistent with the Statistical Learning Hypothesis, the results suggest that increased domain-relevant training is associated with an increasingly accurate cognitive model of probabilistic structure in music...|$|E

We manually analyze how source text connectives are translated, and where connectives in target texts come from.

40|$|The buildup {{and release}} {{of a sense of}} tension {{is one of the most}} {{essential}} aspects of the process of listening to music. A veridical computational model of perceived musical tension would be an important ingredient for many music informatics applications. The present paper presents a new approach to modelling harmonic tension based on a distributed representation of chords. The starting hypothesis is that harmonic tension as perceived by human listeners is related, among other things, to the <b>expectedness</b> of harmonic units (chords) in their local harmonic context. We train a word 2 vec-type neural network to learn a vector space that captures contextual similarity and <b>expectedness,</b> and define a quantitative measure of harmonic tension on top of this. To assess the veridicality of the model, we compare its outputs on a number of well-defined chord classes and cadential contexts to results from pertinent empirical studies in music psychology. Statistical analysis shows that the model's predictions conform very well with empirical evidence obtained from human listeners. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Musical {{expertise}} entails meticulous stylistic specialisation and enculturation. Even so, {{research on}} musical training effects {{has focused on}} generalised comparisons between musicians and non-musicians, and cross-cultural work addressing specialised expertise has traded cultural specificity and sensitivity for other methodological limitations. This study aimed to experimentally dissociate the effects of specialised stylistic training and general musical expertise on the perception of melodies. Non-musicians and professional musicians specialising in classical music or jazz listened to sampled renditions of saxophone solos improvised by Charlie Parker in the bebop style. Ratings of explicit uncertainty and <b>expectedness</b> for different continuations of each melodic excerpt were collected. An information-theoretic model of expectation enabled selection of stimuli affording highly certain continuations in the bebop style, but highly uncertain continuations {{in the context of}} general tonal expectations, and vice versa. The results showed that expert musicians have acquired probabilistic characteristics of music influencing their experience of <b>expectedness</b> and predictive uncertainty. While classical musicians had internalised key aspects of the bebop style implicitly, only jazz musicians' explicit uncertainty ratings reflected the computational estimates, and jazz-specific expertise modulated the relationship between explicit and inferred uncertainty data. In spite of this, {{there was no evidence that}} non-musicians and classical musicians used a stylistically irrelevant cognitive model of general tonal music providing support for the theory of cognitive firewalls between stylistic models in predictive processing of music...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{anticipate}} forthcoming events has clear evolutionary advantages, and predictive successes or failures often entail significant psychological and physiological consequences. In music perception, the confirmation and violation of expectations {{are critical to}} the communication of emotion and aesthetic effects of a composition. Neuroscientific research on musical expectations has focused on harmony. Although harmony is important in Western tonal styles, other musical traditions, emphasizing pitch and melody, have been rather neglected. In this study, we investigated melodic pitch expectations elicited by ecologically valid musical stimuli by drawing together computational, behavioural, and electrophysiological evidence. Unlike rule-based models, our computational model acquires knowledge through unsupervised statistical learning of sequential structure in music and uses this knowledge to estimate the conditional probability (and information content) of musical notes. Unlike previous behavioural paradigms that interrupt a stimulus, we devised a new paradigm for studying auditory expectation without compromising ecological validity. A strong negative correlation {{was found between the}} probability of notes predicted by our model and the subjectively perceived degree of <b>expectedness.</b> Our electrophysiological results showed that low-probability notes, as compared to high-probability notes, elicited a larger (i) negative ERP component at a late time period (400 - 450 ms), (ii) beta band (14 - 30 Hz) oscillation over the parietal lobe, and (iii) long-range phase synchronization between multiple brain regions. Altogether, the study demonstrated that statistical learning produces information-theoretic descriptions of musical notes that are proportional to their perceived <b>expectedness</b> and are associated with characteristic patterns of neural activity...|$|E

Subjects and methods: A retrospective observational study of ADRs was performed. Drugs causing ADRs were grouped according to the ATC drug classification, and subsequently entered into a database. Data were analyzed in respect of total number, gender, age, type, seriousness, <b>expectedness,</b> outcome, system organ class, suspected drug and reporter. Results: The findings showed that 15 % of all reported ADRs were caused by drugs from the ATC group N. 60 % of these were caused by drugs belonging to the ATC subgroups N 05 (psycholeptics) and N 06 A (antidepressants). A significant increase in the percentage of serious ADRs in the examined groups of medicinal products was observed. Analysis of <b>expectedness</b> showed that the share of unexpected ADRs is very high. Conclusion: The distribution of reporters is not satisfactory. The Agency, as regulatory authority, cannot undertake certain measures to improve the safe use of medicinal products without having reports.

40|$|Several {{population}} pharmacokinetic (PPK) {{analyses of}} the anticancer drug imatinib have been performed to investigate different patient populations and covariate effects. The present analysis offers a systematic qualitative and quantitative summary and comparison of those. Its primary objective was to provide useful information for evaluating the <b>expectedness</b> of imatinib plasma concentration measurements {{in the frame of}} therapeutic drug monitoring. The secondary objective was to review clinically important concentration-effect relationships to provide help in evaluating the potential suitability of plasma concentration values. Nine PPK models describing total imatinib plasma concentration were identified. Parameter estimates were standardized to common covariate values whenever possible. Predicted median exposure (Cmin) was derived by simulations and ranged between models from 555 to 1388 ng/mL (grand median: 870 ng/mL and interquartile "reference" range: 520 - 1390 ng/mL). Covariates of potential clinical importance (up to 30 % change in pharmacokinetic predicted by at least 1 model) included body weight, albumin, α 1 acid glycoprotein, and white blood cell count. Various other covariates were included but were statistically not significant or seemed clinically less important or physiologically controversial. Concentration-response relationships had more importance below the average reference range and concentration-toxicity relationships above. Therapeutic drug monitoring-guided dosage adjustment seems justified for imatinib, but a formal predictive therapeutic range remains difficult to propose in the absence of prospective target concentration intervention trials. To evaluate the <b>expectedness</b> of a drug concentration measurement in practice, this review allows comparison of the measurement either to the average reference range or to a specific range accounting for individual patient characteristics.

The pathogenesis may be induced and maintained by different bioactive substances, of which, the upregulation matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{play a vital}} role. Inhibition of the MMPs, therefore, may be a prospective mode of therapy for such lesions. Materials and Methods: A number of patients with lung lesions of different morphologies and presentations were treated empirically with long-term oral doxycycline (100 mg BID) upon exclusion of malignancy and infection in an open, single-arm, prospective, observational pilot study. The effect of the treatment was recorded on serial x-rays/computed tomography (CT) scans {{and the impact of}} treatment was measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) or a Likert-like scale. Furthermore, six independent pulmonologists′ opinion (expressed on a ′ 0 ′ to ′ 100 ′ scale) were pooled with regard to the significance and the <b>expectedness</b> of such a change. Results: Twenty-six patients (mean age 49. 33 years and male: female ratio = 10 : 3) with different types of pulmonary parenchymal/pleural lesions were treated with long-term oral doxycycline for a mean duration of 386. 88 days related to the available radiological comparison. They showed a mean improvement of 3. 99 on the Likert-like scale and 78 % on the VAS scale. The mean significance of the change was 83. 33 %, with a mean <b>expectedness</b> of 18 % as per the pooled opinion of the pulmonologists.

A condition known as congenital amusia {{is characterized by}} musical difficulties, notably in the detection of gross musical violations. However, there has been increasing evidence that individuals with the disorder show preserved musical ability when probed using implicit methods. To further characterize {{the degree to which}} amusic individuals show evidence of latent sensitivity to musical structure, particularly in the context of stimuli that are ecologically valid, electrophysiological recordings were taken from a sample of amusic and control participants as they listened to real melodies. To encourage them {{to pay attention to the}} music, participants were asked to detect occasional notes in a different timbre. Using a computational model of auditory expectation to identify points of varying levels of <b>expectedness</b> in these melodies (in units of information content (IC), a measure which has an inverse relationship with probability), ERP analysis investigated the extent to which the amusic brain differs from that of controls when processing notes of high IC (low probability) as compared to low IC ones (high probability). The data revealed a novel effect that was highly comparable in both groups: Notes with high IC reliably elicited a delayed P 2 component relative to notes with low IC, suggesting that amusic individuals, like controls, found these notes more difficult to evaluate. However, notes with high IC were also characterized by an early frontal negativity in controls that was attenuated in amusic individuals. A correlation of this early negative effect with the ability to make accurate note <b>expectedness</b> judgments (previous data collected from a subset of the current sample) was shown to be present in typical individuals but compromised in individuals with amusia: a finding in line with evidence of a close relationship between the amplitude of such a response and explicit knowledge of musical deviance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{can cause}} increased morbidity and mortality, and therefore information {{needs to be}} studied systematically. Little {{is known about the}} adverse drug reactions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapy. The goal {{of this study is to}} assess the <b>expectedness,</b> seriousness and severity of adverse drug reactions during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapy based on their reporting in the national pharmacovigilance system. Methods: This was a prospective, observational, 1 -year, real-life study about the pharmacotherapy of a sample of 390 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Prescribed medicines were systematized and national pharmacovigilance databases were searched for reported adverse drug reactions. The <b>expectedness</b> was evaluated through the review of the summary of product characteristics, the seriousness was evaluated by the clinicians based on the life threatening nature of the adverse drug reactions, and the severity was evaluated through Hartwig’s Severity Assessment Scale. Descriptive statistics of the reported adverse drug reactions was performed and the relative risk of developing an adverse drug reaction with all international non-proprietary names included in the analysis was calculated. Results: Results confirm that the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a disease with high appearance of adverse drug reactions, and causes many additional costs to the healthcare system. Unexpected and severe adverse drug reactions are frequent. A total of 4. 8 % of adverse drug reactions were evaluated as life threatening. Majority of adverse drug reactions are classified in Levels 1 (32. 6 %), 2 (26. 4 %) and 3 (19 %) according to Hartwig’s Severity Assessment Scale. Approximately 22 % of reported adverse drug reactions affect people’s everyday life to a greater extent and require additional therapy which might further increase the risk. The relative risk of developing an adverse drug reaction was highest for novphyllin (relative risk[*]=[*] 0. 65), followed by aclidinium bromide (relative risk[*]=[*] 0. 09). Both indacaterol and salbutamol are with a relative risk of 0. 07. Conclusion: In conclusion, the medicines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cause many serious adverse drug reactions, most of them were unexpected, lacking in the short product characteristics. Appropriate reporting of adverse drug reactions is necessary to decrease the risk of patients and healthcare system...|$|E

Commonly, date initiation is a behavior in which men take control; however, more women are attempting this task. Women initiating dates is a deviation from cultural norms or what society views as expected behavior. The deviation in behavior could have negative repercussions for women, which was investigated for the current study. College-aged participants (n = 232) completed an online survey regarding their perceptions of two hypothetical women who initiated dates. Informed by Expectancy Violations Theory, the <b>expectedness</b> and valence of the date-initiation behavior and mode of follow-up communication was examined in order to gain insight into the perceptions of this dating issue. The majority of the participants reported positive perceptions of women who initiated dates. Men had slightly more positive perceptions than women.

Analysis indicated that test anxiety acted as a moderator between test expectancy and prose memory performance, even after controlling for differences in general intelligence.

The KST states that when learning is produced by information in an environment through either schema enhancement or schema modification, that information will be perceived as interesting. Two experiments involving 152 undergraduates and 206 undergraduates, respectively, provide evidence for the predictions of the KST regarding the direct effect of learning on interest. Across both experiments, interest varied in the expected direction as a function of both <b>expectedness</b> of outcomes and type of information. Interest was higher for passages containing unexpected outcomes than for those containing expected outcomes, as the KST predicted. Both experiments support the idea that degree of learning resulting from either schema enhancement or modification predicts the degree of interest for an informational environment. Two appendixes contain the target passages used in both experiments. (Contains 7 figures and 35 references.)

40|$|A salient and under-researched {{aspect of}} un/fair {{treatment}} in organizations {{can be the}} source of justice, in terms of a specific justice agent. We propose a model of agent bias to describe how and when characteristics of the agent enacting justice are important to justice reasoning. The agent bias is defined as the effect on overall event justice perceptions of specific agent characteristics, over and above the effect via distributive, procedural, and interactional justice. For justice recipients to focus on agent characteristics rather than on the event being evaluated in terms of fairness is an unexplored bias in justice judgments. Agent warmth, competence, and past justice track record (entity justice) are identified as agent characteristics that influence justice judgments. Agent characteristics can influence overall event justice perceptions positively or negatively, depending on the ambiguity in terms of justice of the event and on its <b>expectedness</b> from a particular justice agent. Finally, we propose that agent bias is stronger when justice recipients use intuitive versus analytic information processing of event information. Our model of agent bias has important theoretical implications for theories of organizational justice and for other literatures, as well as important practical implications for organizations and managers...|$|E
40|$|Coherence {{relations}} {{can be made}} linguistically explicit {{by means}} of connectives (e. g., but, because) or cue phrases (e. g., on the other hand, which is why), but can also be left implicit and conveyed through the juxtaposition of two clauses or sentences. However, it seems that not all relations are equally easy to reconstruct when they are implicit. In this paper, we explore which features of coherence relations make them more, or less, likely to be conveyed implicitly. We adopt the assumption that expected relations are more often implicit than relations that are not expected, and propose to determine a relation's <b>expectedness</b> using the notion of cognitive complexity. We test our hypotheses {{by means of a}} parallel corpus study, in which we analyze the translations of explicit English coherence relations from the Europarl Direct corpus into four target languages: Dutch, German, French, and Spanish. We find that cognitive complexity indeed influences the linguistic marking of coherence relations, and that this does not vary between the languages in our corpus. In addition, we find that a relation's relational and syntactic dependency also influences its linguistic marking, but that these measures are not completely independent of relation type...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 This {{research}} {{explored the}} shock construct in Lee and Mitchell's (1994) unfolding model of turnover. The first {{study consisted of}} qualitative interviews conducted with professionals in the high-technology industry. Based {{on the results of}} this study, a model of shocks was created using sensemaking (Weick, 1995) theory. The model proposes that a shock occurs when an (1) event leads to a (2) cognitive adjustment of the employee's employment situation and results in (3) subsequent thoughts of quitting. The model hypothesizes that cognitive adjustment mediates the relationship between event dimensions (desirability, <b>expectedness,</b> and controllability) and thoughts of quitting. Attitudes (job satisfaction and organization commitment) and organization turnover are hypothesized to interact with cognitive adjustment to predict thoughts of quitting. The second study was an experimental vignette design developed to test the sensemaking model of shocks. The results of the study revealed partial support for the model: Cognitive adjustment mediated the relationship between desirability and the interaction between desirability and expectations on thoughts of quitting. The interaction between organization turnover and cognitive adjustment significantly predicted thoughts of quitting. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the unfolding model of turnover and directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacovigilance (PV) {{has grown}} {{significantly}} in India {{in the last}} couple of decades. The etymological roots for the word “pharmacovigilance” are “Pharmakon” (Greek for drug) and “Vigilare” (Latin for to keep watch). It relies on information gathered from the collection of individual case safety reports and other pharmacoepidemiological data. The PV data processing cycle starts with data collection in computerized systems followed by complete data entry which includes adverse event coding, drug coding, causality and <b>expectedness</b> assessment, narrative writing, quality control, and report submissions followed by data storage and maintenance. A case processor plays an important role in conducting these various tasks. The case processor should also manage drug safety information, possess updated knowledge about global drug safety regulations, summarize clinical safety data, participate in meetings, write narratives with medical input from a physician, report serious adverse events to the regulatory authorities, participate in the training of operational staff on drug safety issues, quality control work of other staff in the department, and take on any other task as assigned by the manager or medical director within the capabilities of the drug safety associate. There can be challenges while handling all these tasks at a time, hence the associate will have to maintain a balance to overcome them and keep on updating their knowledge on drug safety regulations, which in turn, would help in increasing their learning curve...|$|E
40|$|Limited {{research}} so far {{has examined}} coping processes that mediate between risk factors and bereavement outcome. Knowledge of these pathways is important, since it helps establish why some bereaved persons are more vulnerable than others and suggests possibilities for intervention. In this international longitudinal study, three potentially critical mediators, namely rumination, threatening grief interpretations and deliberate grief avoidance, were examined in relationship to previously established risk factors (e. g., <b>expectedness</b> of the death, attachment style) and four major outcome variables (grief, depressive symptoms, emotional loneliness and positive mood). Individuals who were recently bereaved (maximum 3 years) filled in questionnaires at three points in time. Results showed that rumination and - to a somewhat lesser extent - threatening grief interpretations {{played an important role}} in mediating the effects of various risk factors on outcomes. However, the contribution of these two mediators was dependent on the specific risk factor and outcome measure under consideration. For example, whereas the effect of neuroticism on grief was mediated by both processes (to the extent of 73 %), the effect of neuroticism on positive mood was only mediated by rumination and to a smaller extent (23 %). A few risk factors, such as current financial situation and spirituality, were not mediated by either coping strategy. Implications of these findings are discussed.

40|$|The present {{research}} focused on bereaved parents' perceived grief similarity, and aimed {{to investigate the}} concurrent and longitudinal effects of the perceptions that the partner has less, equal, or more grief intensity than oneself on relationship satisfaction. Participants of our longitudinal study were 229 heterosexual bereaved Dutch couples who completed questionnaires 6, 13, and 20 months after {{the loss of their}} child. Average age of participants was 40. 7 (SD = 9. 5). Across 3 study waves, participants' perceived grief similarity and relationship satisfaction were assessed. To control for their effects, own grief level, child's gender, <b>expectedness</b> of loss, parent's age, parent's gender, and time were also included in the analyses. Consistent with the hypotheses, cross-sectional results revealed that bereaved parents who perceived dissimilar levels of grief (less or more grief) had lower relationship satisfaction than bereaved parents who perceived similar levels of grief. This effect remained significant controlling for the effects of possible confounding variables and actual similarity in grief between partners. We also found that perceived grief similarity at the first study wave was related to the highest level of relationship satisfaction at the second study wave. Moreover, results showed that perceived grief similarity was associated with a higher level in partner's relationship satisfaction. Results are discussed considering the comparison and similarity in grief across bereaved partners after child loss...|$|E
