Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. <b>Honey</b> <b>fungus</b> is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and broadleaved woodland, mainly oak, sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, <b>honey</b> <b>fungus</b> and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|E

40|$|This paper makes a {{desk review}} of the role of non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFPs) in the rural economy of Cameroon either as a safety net or as a subsector that can propel sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation. NTFPs are materials derived from forests, excluding timber and related wood products but including bark, roots, tubers, corms, leaves, flowers, seeds, fruits, sap, resins, <b>honey,</b> <b>fungi,</b> and animal products. They are collected {{from a wide range of}} ecotypes such as high forest, farm fallow, otherwise disturbed forest, and farmland for use as food, medicine, and trade. In some cases, they are the only means for local forest dwellers to participate in the cash economy (Sunderland et al, 2002 : 1), especially with the collapse of the market prices of Cameroon’s primary export commodities such as cocoa and coffee. Recently, some NTFPs have emerged as non-conventional export commodities from Cameroon and the Central African region at large. Examples of such products include “Gnetum spp. ”, “Irvingia spp. ”, “Ricinodendron heudelotti”, and “Dacryodes edulis”. These products had a total import value of 8, 648, 000 FF (US$ 1, 729, 600) to Paris (France) alone in 1999 (Tabuna, 2000 : 163). This paper explores the importance and potentials of NTFPs in poverty alleviation in the humid forest zone of Cameroon as well as highlights policy, technological, research and institutional weaknesses that may be strengthened for maximum benefits in rural areas. These development interventions may propel local economic growth that can be geared at strengthening rural communities’ capacity to better contribute to the millennium development goal of poverty alleviation...|$|R

500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina, {{commonly}} known as the Australian <b>honey</b> <b>fungus,</b> is a species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. [...] Widely distributed in southern Australia, the fungus is responsible for a disease known as Armillaria root rot, a primary cause of Eucalyptus tree death and forest dieback. It is the most pathogenic and widespread of the six Armillaria species found in Australia. The fungus has also been collected in Argentina and Chile. Fruit bodies have cream- to tan-coloured caps that grow up to [...] in diameter and stems that measure up to [...] long by [...] thick. The fruit bodies, which appear at the base of infected trees and other woody plants in autumn (March–April), are edible, but require cooking to remove the bitter taste. The fungus is dispersed through spores produced on gills {{on the underside of the}} caps, and also by growing vegetatively through the root systems of host trees. The ability of the fungus to spread vegetatively is facilitated by an aerating system that allows it to efficiently diffuse oxygen through rhizomorphs—rootlike structures made of dense masses of hyphae.|$|E
500|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{has been}} {{recorded}} in southeastern Australia, from the southeastern corner of Queensland through eastern New South Wales and across Victoria into southeastern South Australia. It also occurs in Tasmania and southwestern Western Australia. Those of the karri forests (consisting largely of the species E.diversicolor) of the southwest have paler and yellower caps {{than those in the}} jarrah forests (which contain predominantly Eucalyptus marginata) further north. The fruit bodies arise on wood, especially on stumps or around the base of trees, and often in huge numbers. They usually appear between April and July, although most production occurs {{in the second half of}} May. Abundant in woodlands, it can invade gardens and orchards, where it can attack many woody plants. The <b>honey</b> <b>fungus</b> infected and killed many plants near tuart trees (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) which had been cut down near Kings Park in suburban Perth. Armillaria luteobubalina is commonly found in eucalyptus forests in Australia, and is thought to be the most pathogenic and most widespread Armillaria species in the major western Australian forest types. The mushroom has also been reported from southern South America, in Argentina and Chile. A 2003 study of the molecular phylogenetics and pattern of its distribution in South America and Australia indicate that A.luteobubalina is an ancient species, originating before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana. Genetic differences between isolates in the South American and Australian populations indicate a long period of geographical separation, and the authors suggest that they [...] "later might be regarded as independent taxa".|$|E

40|$|During {{the process}} of nutrition, thus in that of their growth, {{microorganisms}} {{are subject to the}} influences of certain environmental factors that condition the microbial activity determining either the growth and reproduction, or the inhibition of activity and the inactivation of microorganisms. A well known means of expressing the H+ ions concentration in a certain environment is the pH, an important chemical factor that is closely observed when growing ascomycetes, for any alteration of its value entails conformational alterations of their enzymes, the characteristics of the substrate, such that they can no longer interact with the active site of the enzyme or be subject to catalysis.

40|$|Fungicide {{sensitivity}} of <b>honey</b> bee associated <b>fungi</b> Abstract - <b>Honey</b> bees {{are exposed to}} a wide range of pesticides while pollinating agricultural crops. These pesticides residues are found in beeswax, nectar and pollen in the hive. Some of the pesticides found are fungicides which are not generally considered harmful to insects. However, these fungicides may negatively impact mutualistic <b>fungi</b> associated with <b>honey</b> bees causing indirect harm to colony health. Fungi are implicated for helping break down complex protein molecules and therefore allowing the honey bees to attain more nutrients from the food source. The objective of this experiment was to identify if <b>honey</b> bee associated <b>fungi</b> were affected by fungicides that honey bees are exposed to. In order to achieve this objective, a number of fungi were isolated from bee bread and the honey bee digestive tract. Five of these isolates were genetically identified by sequencing of the internal transcriber spacer regions 1 and 4 and selected for fungicide sensitivity testing. Each fungal isolate was subject to five treatments with replications. With the exception of Mucor hiemalis, all fungal species growth was significantly reduced (p ≤ 0. 05) by the fungicides chlorothalonil, iprodione, and boscalid at day 2 of exposure. This research suggests that while fungicides may not directly affect the honey, they may disrupt the normal balance of fungal associates in the hive. This imbalance may result in decreased nutritional attainment from bee bread thus indirectly affecting the health or behavior of the honey bee. More research is needed to identify the functional roles of <b>fungi</b> in <b>honey</b> bees. Tylosin & Fumagillin - Impacts on honey bee midgut bacterial symbionts Abstract- Concern for the managed honey bee population has been developing after drastic losses in the past decade. Suspected causes include new pests, pathogens, pesticides, migratory beekeeping, and nutritional deficiencies from a monoculture diet. To avoid the increasing threat of microbial pathogens, some beekeepers treat hives annually with tylosin and fumagillin, antibiotic compounds. Emerging research has identified the honey bee microbiome as an important aspect of colony health. It is unclear whether annual prophylactic treatments of tylosin and fumagillin applications deplete symbiotic microorganisms in the honey bee digestive tract. The purpose of this research was to gain an initial understanding if tylosin and fumagillin treatments significantly alter composition of Lactobacillus species in the honey bee midgut microbiome. Using a laboratory based, in vitro well-diffusion test and a caged in vivo experiment, four treatment groups consisting of 1) tylosin application, 2) fumagillin application, 3) tylosin with fumagillin application and 4) no chemical application as the control, were each replicated four times. Honey bees were sampled before treatment application, 5 days after treatment and 12 days after treatment. Midgut contents were then homogenized and concentration of Lactobacilli spp. in each midgut was assessed with a plate dilation series on MRS selective media. Colony Formation Units (CFU) were counted after plate inoculation and 72 hours of incubation. Proportions of high, medium and low CFU data were compared between treatment groups. Results suggest a need to further investigate the impact of annual antibiotic treatments and for a better understanding of the honey bee microbiome...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{physico-chemical properties}} and antimicrobial potential of indigenous honey samples against different reference strains including Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Salmonella typhi ATCC 14028, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 13883, Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, Rhizopus oligosporus PCSIR 1, Candida albicans ATCC 14053 and Candida utilis ATCC 9950. Methods: By using standard methods samples were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties including additive effect of starch and non-peroxidase activity, antioxidative properties (phenol contents, flavonoid contents, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity). Prior to this evaluation, complete physico-chemical properties including pH, color, ash contents, protein contents, moisture contents, hydroxymethyl furfural contents, total sugar contents, reducing sugar and non-reducing sugar contents were analyzed. Results: Relatively higher ash contents {{were found in}} the Siddar honey i. e. (0. 590 0 ± 0. 033 6) % and small honey showed relatively higher protein contents i. e. (777. 598 ± 9. 880) mg/kg. The moisture contents of tested honey samples ranged between 13. 8 %- 16. 6 %, total sugar contents from 61. 672 %- 72. 420 % and non-reducing sugar contents from 1. 95 %- 3. 93 %. Presences of phenolic contents indicate higher antioxidant potential of these honey samples. All bacteria showed clear inhibition zones in response to tested <b>honey</b> samples whereas <b>fungi</b> and yeast showed inhibition at higher concentrations of these honey samples. For Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeroginosa and Aspergillus niger, overall the small honey showed the higher activity than other honey samples. Conclusion: Physico-chemical analysis of honey samples confirmed good quality of honey according to the standards set by European Union Commission and Codex Alimentarius Commission. Evaluation of these honey samples confirms antimicrobial potential of particular types of honeys indigenous to Pakistan...|$|R
