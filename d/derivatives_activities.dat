50|$|Although OTC {{derivatives}} {{were subject}} to criticism in the 1990s and bills were introduced in Congress to regulate aspects of the market, the 1993 exemptions remained in place. Bank regulators issued guidelines and requirements for bank OTC <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> that responded {{to many of the}} concerns raised by Congress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and others. Securities firms agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC to establish a Derivatives Policy Group through which six large securities firms conducting the great majority of securities firm OTC <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> reported to the CFTC and SEC about their activities and adopted voluntary principles similar to those applicable to banks. Insurance companies, which represented a much smaller part of the market, remained outside any federal oversight of their OTC <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The true {{proportion}} of derivatives contracts used for hedging purposes is unknown (and perhaps unknowable), {{but it appears}} to be relatively small. Also, derivatives contracts account for only 3-6% of the median firms' total currency and interest rate exposure. [...] Nonetheless, we know that many firms' <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> have at least some speculative component for a variety of reasons.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} whether {{the level of}} <b>derivative</b> <b>activities</b> of Asia-Pacific banks {{is associated with the}} market 2 ̆ 7 s perception of their interest rate and exchange rate risks. The results suggest that the level of <b>derivative</b> <b>activities</b> (especially interest rate derivatives) is positively associated with long-term interest rate exposure (LTIR) but negatively associated with short-term interest rate exposure (STIR). Further investigations reveal that the positive LTIR exposures are driven by banks with extensive <b>derivative</b> <b>activities.</b> We do not find any significant association between banks 2 ̆ 7 <b>derivative</b> <b>activities</b> and exchange rate exposure. The significant positive association between the level of <b>derivative</b> <b>activities</b> and LTIR suggests the need for better management of banks 2 ̆ 7 internal control systems and/or greater derivative disclosure requirements to bring stronger market discipline to banks, particularly for banks with extensive <b>derivative</b> <b>activities.</b> © 2007 Elsevier B.

50|$|In 1997, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission {{ruled that}} public {{corporations}} must disclose quantitative {{information about their}} <b>derivatives</b> <b>activity.</b> Major banks and dealers chose to implement the rule by including VaR information in the notes to their financial statements.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the ensuing}} Congressional hearings, the {{three members of}} the PWG dissenting from the CFTC's [...] "unilateral" [...] actions argued the CFTC was not the proper body, and the CEA was not the proper statute, to {{regulate}} OTC <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities.</b> Banks and securities firms dominated the OTC derivatives market. Their regulators needed to be involved in any regulation of the market. Bank regulators and the SEC already monitored and regulated bank and broker-dealer OTC <b>Derivatives</b> <b>activities.</b> The dissenting PWG members explained that any effort to regulate those activities through the CEA would only lead to the activities moving outside the United States. In the 1980s banks had used offshore branches to book transactions potentially covered by the CEA. Securities firms were still using London and other foreign offices to book at least securities related derivatives transactions. Any change in regulation of OTC derivatives should only occur after a full study of the issue by the entire PWG.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial banks {{entered into}} swaps that {{replicated}} part {{or all of}} the economics of actual securities. Regulators eventually ruled banks could even buy and sell equity securities to “hedge” this activity. Jan Kregel argues the OCC’s approval of bank <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> under bank “incidental powers” constituted a “complete reversal of the original intention of preventing banks from dealing in securities on their own account.” ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{legislators and}} {{committees}} responsible for financial reform related to derivatives in the United States and elsewhere, distinguishing between hedging and speculative <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> {{has been a}} nontrivial challenge. The distinction is critical because regulation should help to isolate and curtail speculation with derivatives, especially for [...] "systemically significant" [...] institutions whose default could {{be large enough to}} threaten the entire financial system. At the same time, the legislation should allow for responsible parties to hedge risk without unduly tying up working capital as collateral that firms may better employ elsewhere in their operations and investment. [...] In this regard, it is important to distinguish between financial (e.g. banks) and non-financial end-users of derivatives (e.g. real estate development companies) because these firms' derivatives usage is inherently different. More importantly, the reasonable collateral that secures these different counterparties can be very different. The distinction between these firms is not always straight forward (e.g. hedge funds or even some private equity firms do not neatly fit either category). Finally, even financial users must be differentiated, as 'large' banks may classified as [...] "systemically significant" [...] whose <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> must be more tightly monitored and restricted than those of smaller, local and regional banks.|$|E

5000|$|In their 2000 {{paper by}} Schinasi et al. {{published}} by the International Monetary Fund in 2001, the authors observed {{that the increase in}} OTC derivatives transactions would have been impossible [...] "without the dramatic advances in information and computer technologies" [...] that occurred from 1980 to 2000. During that time, major internationally active financial institutions significantly increased the share of their earnings from <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities.</b> These institutions manage portfolios of derivatives involving tens of thousands of positions and aggregate global turnover over $1 trillion. At that time prior to the financial crisis of 2008, the OTC market was an informal network of bilateral counterparty relationships and dynamic, time-varying credit exposures whose size and distribution tied to important asset markets. International financial institutions increasingly nurtured the ability to profit from OTC <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> and financial markets participants benefitted from them. In 2000 the authors acknowledged that the growth in OTC transactions [...] "in many ways made possible, the modernization of commercial and investment banking and the globalization of finance." [...] However, in September, an IMF team led by Mathieson and Schinasi cautioned that [...] "episodes of turbulence" [...] in the late 1990s [...] "revealed the risks posed to market stability originated in features of OTC derivatives instruments and markets.|$|E
5000|$|The 1999 GAO Report that {{analyzed}} the LTCM experience criticized federal regulators for not coordinating their oversight of LTCM's activities with banks and securities firms. The Report also recommended [...] "consideration of" [...] legislation {{to grant the}} SEC and CFTC consolidated supervision authority for securities and commodities firms in order to supervise the OTC <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> of those consolidated entities {{in a manner similar}} to the Federal Reserve's authority over bank holding companies. The GAO Report did not consider, and did not recommend, CFTC regulation of OTC derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997 and 1998 a {{conflict}} developed between the CFTC and the SEC over an SEC proposal to ease its broker-dealer regulations for securities firm affiliates that engaged in OTC <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities.</b> The SEC {{had long been}} frustrated that those activities were conducted outside the regulated broker-dealer affiliates of securities firms, often outside the United States in London or elsewhere. To bring the activities into broker-dealer supervision, the SEC proposed relaxed net capital and other rules (known as [...] "Broker-Dealer Lite") for OTC derivatives dealers. The CFTC objected that some activities that would be authorized by this proposal were not permitted under the CEA. The CFTC also issued a [...] "concept release" [...] requesting comments on whether the OTC derivatives market was properly regulated under the existing CEA exemptions and on whether market developments required regulatory changes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Derivatives</b> <b>activity,</b> {{motivated}} by risk-sharing, can breed risk taking. Bad {{news about the}} risk of the asset underlying the derivative increases the expected liability of a protection seller and undermines her risk prevention incentives. This limits risk-sharing, and may create endogenous counterparty risk and contagion from news about the hedged risk to the balance sheet of protection sellers. Margin calls after bad news can improve protection sellers incentives and enhance the ability to share risk. Central clearing can provide insurance against counterparty risk but must be designed to preserve risk-prevention incentives...|$|R

40|$|Since 1983, the Bank of Canada has {{conducted}} a triennial survey {{of foreign exchange}} market activity in Canada.

This {{was the first time}} that markets for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives were surveyed by central banks in a systematic and comprehensive fashion. The average daily turnover in the Canadian foreign exchange market, including foreign exchange derivatives, has continued to grow rapidly (by approximately 36 per cent to about U.

40|$|Derivatives {{have become}} an {{essential}} instrument for hedging risks, yet moral hazard can lead to their misuse by problem banks. Given {{that the absence of}} comprehensive data on bank <b>derivatives</b> <b>activities</b> prevents an accurate assessment of bank risk-taking, banks have an opportunity to take unmonitored second bets. Thus, troubled banks have the motive to increase risk, and derivatives provide the means to do so. The role of bank supervisors should be to limit the opportunity through more comprehensive data reporting requirements and closer supervisory scrutiny of derivatives activity at problem banks. Because a relatively large number of banks active in the derivatives market have low capital ratios and are considered institutions with a significant risk of failure by bank supervisors, the possible misuse of derivatives by troubled banks should be of concern to regulators. However, we find no evidence that the volume of derivatives activity at troubled banks affects the probability of formal regulatory intervention or even a downgrade in supervisory rating. ...|$|E
