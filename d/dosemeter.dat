The maximum applicable ranges of the mixed field can have photons with unknown energy from 20 keV to 2 MeV, betas with unknown energy from 147 Pm to “Sr-Y, and neutrons of known energy from thermal to 15 MeV. This proposed <b>dosemeter</b> (a combination of Harshaw beta-gamma TLD and albedo neutron TLD) has an advantage of using a minimum number of TLD elements (therefore, less costly) to measure the dose equivalents in a mixed field of neutron, photon and beta.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach in}} the field of personal radio-frequency (RF) dosimetry is the use of a body worn electromagnetic probe (i. e. personal RF body worn <b>dosemeter)</b> to record personal exposure to RF fields. Using such a <b>dosemeter</b> mounted on the body, an individual&# 039;s exposure could be recorded at the time and place that it occurs. This would fulfil an important criterion for epidemiological and other studies into the relationship between RF exposures and health effects in humans. The relationship between a <b>dosemeter</b> measurement and quantities that characterise human exposure to RF fields, such as the spatially averaged exposure field and the whole body average specific absorption rate (SAR), is not well understood nor been rigorously quantified. This thesis tackled the problem of determining the relationship by employing computational modelling and statistical simulations to generate distributions of the fields close to the surface of realistic human body models. These fields are proxies for measurements made with an ideal, isotropic responding, body worn personal RF <b>dosemeter</b> (or simply <b>dosemeter).</b> It focussed on exposures occurring remote (in the far-field) from microwave antennas such as those associated with mobile and wireless base-stations, TV and other typically fixed radio transmitters. Exposures from RF transmitters worn on or in close proximity to the body were not the subject of this study. Initial computational modelling using single plane waves with arbitrary incident angles and polarisation revealed the extent and nature of the distribution of electromagnetic fields close to the surface of a body. Results indicated that a <b>dosemeter</b> measurement could lead to an over or under-estimation of the exposure field. Other factors affecting the close fields were also investigated to quantify their impact. Additional plane wave modelling found that <b>dosemeter</b> measurements could be used to estimate the exposure field or the whole body averaged SAR with similar levels of uncertainty. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to provide statistical information concerning the relationship between <b>dosemeter</b> measurement of the field close to the body and the exposure field and whole body averaged SAR. Exposures to RF fields were modelled using statistics that describe radio wave propagation in outdoor and indoor multipath environments at 450, 900 and 2100 MHz. Correction factors and associated standard deviations derived from the output of simulations can be applied to measurements made with actual, physical dosemeters to determine estimates of both exposure field and whole body averaged SAR...|$|E

Methods: Organ and effective dose measurements were performed using 40 TLD and 20 MOSFET <b>dosemeters</b> that were alternately placed in 20 different locations in 1 anthropomorphic RANDO® head phantom (the Phantom Laboratory, Salem, NY). The phantom was exposed to four different CBCT default maxillofacial protocols using small (4 [*]×[*] 5 [*]cm) to full face (20 [*]×[*] 17 [*]cm) fields of view (FOVs).

The results obtained were compared to those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations using the MCNPX code in order to improve, the sensitivity of the PADC response. The detector configuration can be adapted to neutron spectra in different practical situations. It would be able to provide dose equivalent response in a large range of energies...|$|E
40|$|The HTR-method, {{developed}} for determination of absorbed dose and average LET of mixed radiation fields in space, was applied during several space missions on space station MIR, space shuttles and satellites. The method utilizes the changes of peak height ratios in the glowcurves in {{dependence on the}} linear energy transfer LET. Due to {{the small size of}} the <b>dosemeters</b> the evaluation of the variation of absorbed dose and average LET in dependence on the position of the <b>dosemeters</b> inside the space station is possible. The dose- and LET-distribution was determined during the experiment ADLET where <b>dosemeters</b> were exposed in two positions with different shielding conditions and during two following experiments (MIR- 95, MIR- 96) using six positions inside the space station. The results were compared with the shielding conditions of the positions. Calculations of the absorbed dose were carried out for comparision. Results have shown that the average LET increases with increasing absorbing thickness while the absorbed dose decreases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test the {{appropriateness}} of OSL and electronic <b>dosemeters</b> to estimate eye lens doses at interven-tional cardiology environment. Using TLD as reference detectors, personal dose equivalent was measured in phantoms and during clinical procedures. For phantom measurements, OSL dose values resulted in an average difference of 215 % vs. TLD. Tests carried out with other electronic <b>dosemeters</b> revealed differences up to + 20 % versus TLD. With <b>dosemeters</b> positioned outside the goggles and when TLD doses were> 20 mSv, the average difference OSL vs. TLD was 29 %. Eye lens doses of almost 700 mSv per procedure were measured in two cases out of a sample of 33 measurements in individual clinical procedures, thus showing the risk of high exposure to the lenses of the eye when protection rules are not followed. The differences found between OSL and TLD are acceptable for the purpose and range of doses measured in the survey...|$|R
40|$|The Atominstitute of the Austrian Universities {{developed}} the HTR-method for determination of absorbed dose and “averaged ” {{linear energy transfer}} (LET) in mixed radiation fields. The method was applied with great success during several space missions (e. g. STS- 60, STS- 63, BION- 10 and BION- 11) and on space station MIR in the past 10 years. It utilises the changes of peak height ratios in LiF thermoluminescent glowcurves in dependence on the LET. Due to {{the small size of}} these <b>dosemeters</b> the HTR-method can be used also for measurements inside tissue equivalent phantoms. A water filled phantom with a diameter of 35 cm containing four channels where <b>dosemeters</b> can be exposed in different depths was developed by the Institute for Biomedical Problems. This opens the possibility to measure the depth distribution of the average LET and the dose equivalent simultaneously. During phase 1 <b>dosemeters</b> were exposed for 271 days (05. 1997 - 02. 1998) in 6 different depths inside the phantom, which was positioned in the commander cabin. In phase 2 <b>dosemeters</b> were exposed in 2 channels in 6 different depths for 102 days (05. 1998 - 08. 1998) in the board engineer cabin, following an exposure in different channels in 3 different depths for 199 days (08. 1998 - 02. 1999) in the Modul KWANT 2...|$|R
