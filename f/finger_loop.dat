30|$|In all {{six members}} of TRPV channel subfamily, there is an ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) in their {{intracellular}} Ntermini. Ankyrin (ANK) repeat, a common motif with typically 33 residues in each repeat, is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions. Despite the sequence similarity among the ARDs of TRPV channels, the structure of TRPV 3 -ARD, however, remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of TRPV 3 -ARD solved at 1.95 Å resolution, which reveals six-ankyrin repeats. While overall structure of TRPV 3 -ARD is similar to ARDs from other members of TRPV subfamily; it, however, features a noticeable <b>finger</b> 3 <b>loop</b> that bends over and is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic packing, instead of being flexible as seen in known TRPV-ARD structures.

They {{are involved in}} pain sensation, the expression of fear, and in neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke. Our study investigates the role of extracellular subunit interactions in ASIC 1 a function. We identified two regions involved in critical intersubunit interactions. First, formation of an engineered disulfide bond between the palm and thumb domains leads to partial channel closure. Second, linking Glu- 235 of a <b>finger</b> <b>loop</b> to either one of two different residues of the knuckle of a neighboring subunit opens the channel at physiological pH or disrupts its activity. This suggests that one finger-knuckle disulfide bond (E 235 C/K 393 C) sets the channel in an open state, whereas the other (E 235 C/Y 389 C) switches the channel to a non-conducting state. Voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments indicate that both the <b>finger</b> <b>loop</b> and the knuckle {{move away from the}} β-ball residue Trp- 233 during acidification and subsequent desensitization. Together, these observations reveal that ASIC 1 a opening is accompanied by a distance increase between adjacent thumb and palm domains as well as a movement of Glu- 235 relative to the knuckle helix.

30|$|Earlier {{findings}} that deletions in the inter-domain hinge impede the receptor binding (Vishnivetskiy et al., 2002; Hanson et al., 2007) suggested that long hinge {{is needed for}} the two arrestin domains to “grab” the receptor like a pincer (Gurevich and Gurevich, 2004). However, DEER studies of arrestin- 1 (Kim et al., 2012) and both non-visual subtypes (Zhuo et al., 2014) ruled out such “clam-like” movement of the domains. In an alternative model, the receptor binding is enabled by the two domains rotating relative to each other by ~ 20 ° (Modzelewska et al., 2006). Two crystal structures of presumably “active” arrestin- 1 and arrestin- 2 are consistent with this model. Pre-activated arrestin- 2 with C-terminal deletion (Kovoor et al., 1999) was co-crystallized with multi-phosphorylated C-terminus of vasopressin V 2 receptor and conformationally selective antibody fragment (Shukla et al., 2013). This structure revealed a large movement of the 139 -loop homologue (called “middle loop” in this study), similar to that detected in arrestin- 1 by DEER (Kim et al., 2012), rearrangement of the <b>finger</b> <b>loop,</b> and the rotation of N- and C-domains by ~ 20 o (Shukla et al., 2013). The short splice variant of arrestin- 1 lacking the C-tail, p 44, expressed in some mammalian species, was also shown to be “pre-activated” and bind unphosphorylated Rh* (Pulvermuller et al., 1997). In one crystal structure, this protein looked similar to FL arrestin- 1 (Granzin et al., 2012), but the second structure revealed a very different conformation, with characteristic rearrangement of the <b>finger</b> <b>loop,</b> movement of the 139 -loop, and ~ 21 ° rotation of the two domains (Kim et al., 2013).|$|E
40|$|The signal {{recognition}} particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex whose components are highly conserved throughout all three domains of life, where it functions to target proteins to extracytoplasmic locations. In Escherichia coli, the SRP {{is comprised of}} a single essential protein (Ffh) in complex with a 4. 5 S RNA species. To better understand how the structure of Ffh contributes to its function, we have used genetic approaches to isolate and characterize new ffh mutants altered in two distinct domains of the protein. Both domains of interest have been implicated as being important for binding to hydrophobic signal peptides of membrane proteins. These studies include using a random sequence approach to identify amino acids important for activity of the <b>finger</b> <b>loop</b> domain. The <b>finger</b> <b>loop</b> was identified from structural analysis as a ∼ 20 amino acid domain with the unusual properties of being both hydrophobic and exposed near the surface of Ffh. Approximately 1 % of the random sequences were able to replace the FL domain of Ffh. Bioinformatic analysis of the random sequences revealed {{that all of the}} complementing sequences followed a trend of high hydrophobicity at the amino-terminus that decreased towards the carboxy end. These observations were validated by observing that mutants that deviated from this trend rendered Ffh nonfunctional. Mutants were characterized by growth rates that allowed the sequences to be grouped into three functional classes. Secondary and tertiary structure predictions suggested that the products of the random sequences lack extensive secondary structure, which is consistent with the role of the <b>finger</b> <b>loop</b> in binding a variety of ligands. To address the importance of the conserved methionine residues at the carboxy-terminal region (M-domain) in SRP function, we combined phylogenetic comparisons with functional studies, including replacing methionine residues within the M-domain with other residues that varied in hydrophobicity, side chain flexibility and charge. These studies revealed that, in E. coli, the M-domain of Ffh was able to tolerate substitutions of five different hydrophobic amino acids including valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and isoleucine for the conserved methionine residues found in helix αM 4 and the extreme C-terminus. Phylogenetic comparisons of microorganisms with varying optimal growth temperatures revealed methionine residues were substituted with amino acids containing less flexible side chains. Interestingly, we observed that mutants containing less flexible residues were able to support cell viability at higher growth temperatures better than at lower temperatures. Phylogenetic comparisons also revealed three positions where methionine is highly conserved. We show that replacing all of the methionine residues, except these three highly conserved residues, with valine yielded a functional SRP. In contrast to predicted results, these studies reveal that the M-domain of Ffh is highly flexible in content and that methionines are not absolutely required for SRP function. Collectively, these efforts have contributed to our understanding of SRP function by identifying key features essential for the function of the signal sequence binding domain of the Ffh protein component of SRP...|$|E

In Escherichia coli, the SRP and its receptor FtsY bind to ribosome–nascent chain complexes with signal sequences and undergo a series of distinct conformational changes, which ensures accurate timing and fidelity of protein targeting. Initial recruitment of the SRP receptor FtsY to the SRP–RNC complex results in GTP-independent binding of the SRP–FtsY GTPases at the SRP RNA tetraloop. In the presence of GTP, a closed state is adopted by the SRP–FtsY complex. The cryo-EM structure of the closed state reveals an ordered SRP RNA and SRP M domain with a signal sequence-bound.
