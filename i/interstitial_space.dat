5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an <b>interstitial</b> <b>space,</b> with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, the Architect of the Capitol {{announced}} a four-year, $10 million project to repair and conserve the Capitol Dome's exterior and the Capitol rotunda. The proposal {{would require the}} stripping of lead paint from {{the interior of the}} dome, repair to the ironwork, repainting of the interior of the dome, rehabilitation of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space</b> between the dome and rotunda, and installation of new lighting in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space</b> and the rotunda. The dome and rotunda, which were last conserved in 1960, are showing significant signs of rust and disrepair. There is a danger that decorative ironwork could fall from the rotunda to the space below, and that weather-related problems could damage the artwork in the rotunda. Without immediate repair, safety netting will be installed (blocking the rotunda's artwork from view).|$|E
25|$|The blood-testis barrier, {{maintained}} by the tight junctions between the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules, prevents communication between the forming spermatozoa in the testis and the blood vessels (and immune cells circulating within them) within the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space.</b> This prevents them from eliciting an immune response. The blood-testis barrier is also important in preventing toxic substances from disrupting spermatogenesis.|$|E

25|$|In the kidney, {{blood is}} {{filtered}} into the lumen, or open space, of the nephron tubule. Whatever {{remains in the}} tubule will travel to the bladder as urine and eventually be excreted. The cells lining the tubule modify the fluid inside, absorbing some material and excreting others. One side of the cell (the apical side) faces the lumen; the opposite side (the basolateral side) faces the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space</b> near blood vessels. The other sides are tightly joined to neighboring cells.|$|E
25|$|Porous {{absorbers}} {{are most}} commonly made from fiberglass, mineral wool or {{open cell foam}} that resists the passage of air molecules through the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space.</b> Porous absorbers often incorporate a foil or paper facing to reflect frequencies above 500Hz. Facing also improves low bass absorption by translating the physical compression of air at the facing into physical compression of the fibers that are {{in contact with the}} facing while also maintaining the resistive loss of air as it is driven through the bulk of the fiber by the facing.|$|E
25|$|Non-silicate {{minerals}} are {{subdivided into}} several other classes by their dominant chemistry, which included native elements, sulfides, halides, oxides and hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and organic compounds. Most non-silicate mineral species are rare (constituting in total 8% of the Earth's crust), although some are relatively common, such as calcite, pyrite, magnetite, and hematite. There {{are two major}} structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra. The close-packed structures, which {{is a way to}} densely pack atoms while minimizing <b>interstitial</b> <b>space.</b> Hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same ("ababab"), whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers ("abcabcabc"). Analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include SO4 (sulfate), PO4 (phosphate), AsO4 (arsenate), and VO4 (vanadate). The non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.|$|E

50|$|Biofilms {{consist of}} {{microorganisms}} and their self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). A fully developed biofilm contains many layers including {{a matrix of}} EPS with vertical structures, and a conditioning film. Vertical structures of microorganisms sometimes {{take the form of}} towers or mushrooms, and are separated by <b>interstitial</b> <b>spaces.</b> <b>Interstitial</b> <b>spaces</b> allow the bulk of the biofilm to easily and rapidly take in nutrients from the surrounding liquid and move byproducts away from the biofilm.|$|R
25|$|As {{with other}} regions, tubule {{cells in the}} distal {{convoluted}} tubule possess the ATP-powered sodium-potassium antiporter (Na+/K+-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP to transfer three sodium ions out from the basolateral surface (toward blood vessels) while simultaneously transferring two potassium ions in. The distal convoluted tubule cells also possess a sodium-chloride symporter on the apical side, which passively allows one sodium ion and one chloride ion to diffuse together in from the lumen (where urine is forming) into the cell interior. As sodium is pumped out of the cell by the ATPase, its intracellular concentration falls, and additional sodium begins to diffuse in from the tubule lumen as replacement. The symporter requires chloride to be transported in as well. Water passively follows to maintain isotonicity; excess chloride and potassium passively diffuse out the cell through basolateral channels into the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space,</b> and water accompanies them. The water and chloride, {{as well as the}} sodium pumped out by the ATPase, will be absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
500|$|In contusions, torn {{capillaries}} leak fluid {{into the}} tissues around them. The membrane between alveoli and capillaries is torn; damage to this capillary–alveolar membrane and small blood vessels causes blood and fluids to leak into the alveoli and the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space</b> (the space surrounding cells) of the lung. [...] With more severe trauma, {{there is a}} greater amount of edema, bleeding, and tearing of the alveoli. [...] Pulmonary contusion is characterized by microhemorrhages (tiny bleeds) that occur when the alveoli are traumatically separated from airway structures and blood vessels. Blood initially collects in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space,</b> and then edema occurs by an hour or two after injury. An area of bleeding in the contused lung is commonly surrounded by an area of edema. In normal gas exchange, carbon dioxide diffuses across the endothelium of the capillaries, the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space,</b> and across the alveolar epithelium; oxygen diffuses in the other direction. Fluid accumulation interferes with gas exchange, and can cause the alveoli to fill with proteins and collapse due to edema and bleeding. The larger the area of the injury, the more severe respiratory compromise will be.|$|E
2500|$|Contusion: [...] Simple bruising. [...] In {{this type}} of injury, the {{capillaries}} in the epidermis and dermis are damaged, without breaking the skin. [...] Blood oozes out of these vessels into the spaces between cells or <b>interstitial</b> <b>space,</b> causing swelling and discoloration. [...] Blood loss is generally limited, and not of serious consequence. [...] It may, however, act as a signpost, pointing to more serious injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Tschumi has {{continued}} this design agenda {{in a variety}} of design competitions and built projects since 1983. The 1986 Tokyo National Theater and Opera House project continued the research that Tschumi began in The Manhattan Transcripts, importing notational techniques from experimental dance and musical scores, and using the design process itself to challenge habitual ways of thinking about space, in contrast to earlier static, two dimensional representational techniques which delineated the outline of a building but not the intensity of life within it. [...] At a local scale in his 1990 Video Pavilion at Groningen, transparent walls and tilted floors produce an intense dislocation of the subject in relation to norms like wall, interior and exterior, and horizon. [...] At the urban scale in such projects as the 1992 Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains, in Tourcoing, France, and the 1995 architecture school at Marne la Vallee, France (both completed 1999), larger spaces challenge normative program sequence and accepted use. The Le Fresnoy complex accomplishes this by its use of the space between the roofs of existing buildings and an added, huge umbrella roof above them which creates an interstitial zone of program on ramps and catwalks. [...] This zone is what Tschumi calls the in-between, a negation of pure form or style that had been practiced in the 1989 ZKM Karlsruhe competition project, where a large atrium space punctuated by encapsulated circulation and smaller program episodes developed a more local network of <b>interstitial</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Asbestosis is the {{scarring}} of {{lung tissue}} (beginning around terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts and extending into the alveolar walls) {{resulting from the}} inhalation of asbestos fibers. There {{are two types of}} fibers: amphibole (thin and straight) and serpentine (curly). All forms of asbestos fibers are responsible for human disease as they are able to penetrate deeply into the lungs. [...] When such fibers reach the alveoli (air sacs) in the lung, where oxygen is transferred into the blood, the foreign bodies (asbestos fibers) cause the activation of the lungs' local immune system and provoke an inflammatory reaction dominated by lung macrophages that respond to chemotactic factors activated by the fibers. This inflammatory reaction can be described as chronic rather than acute, with a slow ongoing progression of the immune system attempting to eliminate the foreign fibers. Macrophages phagocytose (ingest) the fibers and stimulate fibroblasts to deposit connective tissue. Due to the asbestos fibers' natural resistance to digestion, some macrophages are killed and others release inflammatory chemical signals, attracting further lung macrophages and fibrolastic cells that synthesize fibrous scar tissue, which eventually becomes diffuse and can progress in heavily exposed individuals. This tissue can be seen microscopically soon after exposure in animal models. [...] Some asbestos fibers become layered by an iron-containing proteinaceous material (ferruginous body) in cases of heavy exposure where about 10% of the fibers become coated. [...] Most inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated. [...] About 20% of the inhaled fibers are transported by cytoskeletal components of the alveolar epithelium to the interstitial compartment of the lung where they interact with macrophages and mesenchymal cells. The cytokines, transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, appear to play major roles in the development of [...] scarring inasmuch as the process can be blocked in animal models by preventing the expression of the growth factors. The result is fibrosis in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>space,</b> thus asbestosis. This fibrotic scarring causes alveolar walls to thicken, which reduces elasticity and gas diffusion, reducing oxygen transfer to the blood as well as the removal of carbon dioxide. [...] This can result in shortness of breath, a common symptom exhibited by individuals with asbestosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of alveolar septae in dogs is investigated {{at times}} ranging from 30 seconds to 60 minutes after intravenous injection of ethchlorvynol (Placidyl). Pulmonary edematous fluid first appears in alveolar spaces 5 minutes after injection and becomes progressively more prominent with increasing time. Alveolar septae are initially somewhat fibrotic, and subsequently, most <b>interstitial</b> <b>spaces</b> become swollen and hydrated. Vesicles in endothelial cells increase with postinjectional time, {{and they seem}} to form channels or pores interconnecting capillaries and <b>interstitial</b> <b>spaces.</b> Similar vesicles in epithelial cells (Type 1) show an increase after 30 minutes, and they also seem to form channels or pores interconnecting <b>interstitial</b> <b>spaces</b> and the alveolus. Vesicles, whether in endothelial or epithelial cells, contain a flocculent filamentous material similar to plasma protein and the filamentous proteinaceous material in edematous fluid in alveolar spaces. Ethchlorvynol injection rapidly induces a non-hemodynamic form of pulmonary edema. Since cell junctions of both endothelial and epithelial cells remained intact, it is proposed that transalveolar transport of edematous proteinaceous fluid is mediated by means of endothelial and epithelial vesicles...|$|R
