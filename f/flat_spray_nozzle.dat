40|$|The {{determination}} of volume distribution for a nozzle spraying at a given set of operating conditions {{is one of the}} most basic methods of spray characterization. This information is often the first order determinant of the preferred operating conditions for a nozzle. The volume distribution of a spray is the best qualitative and quantitative way to evaluate spray coverage for many applications The experimental acquisition of the volume distribution was acquired by a number of methods and techniques. Three of these techniques were directly carried out and compared in a one-to-one comparison for this study. The methods investigated were Mechanical Patternation (MP), Laser Sheet Imaging (Mie scattering), and Phase Doppler Interferometry (Artium and TSI systems). The baseline measurement for this study was the mechanical patternation of a hydraulic, low capacity, <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The direct one-to-one comparison of these three measurement techniques allowed for the development of a direct comparison techniques. The volume and area weighted volume distributions resulted in good agreement over spray plume area once proper weighted and collapsing methods were implemented...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{control of}} Alopecurus myosuroides (ALOMY) {{depends on the}} application date, the product selection and the dose rate and is also influenced by the correct application technology. Small and large plot trials were conducted at locations with heavy ALOMY infestation in the years 2004 - 2010. Atlantis WG (mesosulfuron & iodosulfuron) with different water dose rates, nozzle types and {{at different times of}} day was applied to control ALOMY in winter wheat. The droplet size as well as the water rate had the strongest impact on ALOMY control, while the application speed played a rather subordinated role. The applications with very coarse droplets (90 % drift-reducing potential) lead to efficacy reductions. This becomes particularly visible with applications in the early growth stages of ALOMY. Coarse drops roll off faster. On the other hand, applications with fine or medium droplets tend to result in a better control but they can lead to drift at high wind velocities and evaporation at high air temperatures and therefore cause lower efficacy. There was no visible difference between the types of the tested nozzle tips like standard flat jet, compact injector nozzle and double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The herbicidal efficacy was clearly affected by the moisture of the weed leaves. With moist leaf surfaces, the risk of run-off effects exists. This was more expressed with high spray volumes (250 l/ha) and has to be considered at early day or night applications. In situations of moist leaves, the spray volumes can be reduced to 100 - 150 l/ha. It is recommended to use the 90 % drift reducing nozzles only in the sensitive field bark area and to secure the efficacy of Atlantis WG against ALOMY by adjusting the pressure, the driving speed or by changing the nozzles outside of this sensitive area. From these test results, the following nozzle recommendation is concluded: Compact injector nozzles like AIXR, Air-mix, IDK should be used with a caliber of 03 or 04 at about 3 bar. Hereby the registration related buffer zone distances have to be considered...|$|E
40|$|According to EU Directive 2009 / 128 /EC {{pesticide}} application equipment must function reliably and be {{used properly}} for its intended purpose ensuring that pesticides can be accurately dosed and distributed. The transverse distribution of the spray mixture in the target area must be even, where relevant. Spray jets of double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> are angled forward and backward. Depending {{on the design of}} the sprayer and boom height, parts of the equipment get splashed by the angled spray jet. Problems arise with lift masts which are fitted very close to the frame of the sprayer. Solutions might be technical modifications of the boom and tube. If technical changes are not possible, the use of <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> on the boom is recommended in the critical area in combination with double <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Results from sprayer inspection are shown with regard to cross distribution.

50|$|Nozzle {{type and}} capacity: Full cone nozzles {{have the largest}} drop size, {{followed}} by <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Hollow cone nozzles produce the smallest drop size. Spraying pressure: Drop size increases with lower spraying pressure and decreases with higher pressure. Flow rate: Flow rate has a direct effect on drop size. An increase in flow rate will increase the pressure drop and decrease the drop size, while a decrease in flow rate will decrease the pressure drop and increase the drop size.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the spray pattern {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the pattern sprays out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the spray pattern is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of <b>flat</b> <b>spray,</b> tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the <b>spray</b> pattern. <b>Flat</b> <b>spray</b> patterns with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles.</b> This <b>spray</b> pattern is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire <b>sprayed</b> surface. Non-tapered <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform spray pattern without any overlap in spray area.|$|R

40|$|The size of subcooled liquified {{nitrogen}} droplets {{are measured}} with a 5 mW He-Ne laser {{as a function of}} pressure difference (delta P) across <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> and full cone pressure atomizing nozzles. For delta P's of 3 to 30 psid, the spray sauter mean diameter (SMD) ranged between 250 to 50 microns. The pressure range tested is representative of those expected during cryogenic fluid transfer operations in space. The droplet sizes from the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> were greater than those from the full cone nozzle. A power function of the form, SMD varies as delta P(exp a), describes the spray SMD {{as a function of the}} delta P very well. The values of a were - 0. 36 for the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> and - 0. 87 for the full cone. The reduced dependence of the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> SMD on the delta P was probably because of: (1) the absence of a swirler that generates a turbulence within the nozzle to enhance atomization, and (2) a possible increase in shearing stress resulting from the delayed atomization due to the absence of turbulence. The nitrogen quality, up to 1. 5 percent is based on isenthalpic expansion, did not have a distinct and measurable effect on the spray SMD. Both bimodal and monomodal droplet size population distributions were measured. In the bimodal distribution, the frequency of the first mode was much greater than the frequency of the second mode. Also, the frequency of the second mode was low enough such that a monomodal approximation probably would give reasonable results...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{atomization}} is {{a largely}} widespread unit operation. The disintegration of a liquid into droplets {{depends on the}} nature of the nozzle, on the process parameters as well as physicochemical characteristics of the fluid. The aim of this work is to study the contribution of the process (liquid outlet speed and air pressure) and physicochemical (viscosity and surface tension) factors on the size distribution of droplets generated by single- and two-fluid <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The obtained droplet median diameters which range between 77 and 594 mu m for the single-fluid nozzle and between 11 and 599 mu m for the two-fluid nozzle, are discussed in relation with operating conditions of atomization process. Dimensional analysis was performed as a modeling approach. Despite energy input for the droplet formation is known to be influenced by different origins according to single and two-fluid nozzles, it is shown that a unique correlation, with specific values of parameters for each nozzle type, gathers all the parameters affecting droplet size. In the range of process and formulation parameters tested, this correlation is validated and gives satisfactory agreement for the single- and two-fluid nozzles...|$|R
40|$|A {{majority}} of continuous mining machines employ a {{water spray system}} and a machine mounted flooded-bed scrubber to suppress and capture dust during coal mining. These machine mounted dust control systems must be designed to function within the localized face ventilation system at the mining section to control both dust and methane. Spray systems can impede or improve the scrubber effectiveness in controlling dust or methane at the mining face. Laboratory experiments were conducted to {{examine the effect of}} spray type, spray pressure, machine body blocking sprays, and scrubber airflow on dust and gas levels while using a 12. 2 m (40 ft) exhaust ventilation curtain setback from the face. These experiments were conducted with the mining machine positioned {{at the end of a}} simulated 6. 1 m (20 ft) sump and slab cut. Results indicate that the hollow cone <b>nozzles</b> with blocking <b>sprays</b> best complemented the flooded-bed scrubber performance in an exhaust ventilation system. This external spray system notably reduced dust and gas levels on the off-curtain side of the mining machine for both the sump and slab cut as compared to the <b>flat</b> <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Higher scrubber airflows reduced dust and gas levels on the curtain side and in the return of the continuous mining machine.

40|$|The {{high demand}} of {{pesticides}} {{in the production}} systems makes the application technology {{one of the main}} alternatives to optimize the products efficiency. In this context, the study aimed to evaluate the effects of <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> and <b>spray</b> volumes on spraying deposits, armyworm control and crop corn performance in narrow row sowing system. The experiment was carried out at experimental area of Sao Paulo State University, Campus of Botucatu/SP, Brazil, during the 2009 / 2010 agricultural season, in randomized blocks with factorial scheme (2 x 2 + 1) and four replications. It was tested two <b>flat</b> fan <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> (with and without air induction) combined with two spray volumes (100 and 200 L ha- 1) plus a control treatment. There was no influence of <b>spray</b> <b>nozzles</b> (without air induction) in the spray deposits levels on plants. However, the flat fan nozzle with air induction was more effective on fall armyworm, with 100 % of control against 47. 84 % from other at 15 days after spraying. The increase in the spray volume promoted high spray deposits (415. 4 and 388. 6 μL g- 1 dry mass for flat fan nozzle with and without air induction, respectively at V 10 growth stage) and consequently, the highest spray volume (200 L- 1) was more efficient in the fall armyworm suppression, with 100 % of control. All the technologies tested showed lower plant injury from fall armyworm. The insecticide sprayed with different technologies did not affect the parameters of plant height and leaf area index. The corn productivity was directly related with control efficiency of fall armyworm. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic impact {{behaviour}} {{of water}} droplets on plant surfaces was investigated {{based on a}} multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The study was conducted using the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) approach. The static contact angle of water droplets on leaf surfaces of different plants (apple, pear, leek and cabbage) was measured and found to vary between 54. 9 and 138. 2 °. Impact experiments were conducted by monitoring the flow and impact characteristics of water droplets on leaves in still air with a high speed camera. Droplets were generated by an agricultural <b>flat</b> fan <b>spray</b> <b>nozzle</b> moving across the leaf at constant speed. The nozzle produced droplets with diameters ranging from 20. 6 up to 550. 8 μm, and droplet velocity values near the impact between 0. 03 and 13. 2 m s(- 1). The CFD model was capable of predicting the observed dynamic impact behaviour of droplets on the plant surfaces. The fate of the droplets after the impact process for adhesion, bouncing or splashing was accurately predicted for Weber numbers (We) {{in the range of}} 0. 007 to 1096 and droplet Reynolds numbers (Re) between 5 to 8000. The process was highly dependent on the surface and droplet flow characteristics during the impact.
