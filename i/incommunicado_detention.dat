25|$|Police often {{arbitrarily}} {{arrested and}} detained persons without filing charges, often to extort money from family members. Authorities rarely pressed charges {{in a timely}} manner and often created contrived or overly vague charges. No functioning bail system existed, and detainees had little access to legal counsel if unable to pay. <b>Incommunicado</b> <b>detention</b> was common; security forces regularly held suspects before acknowledging their detention or allowing them contact with family or counsel.|$|E
25|$|According to Human Rights Watch {{annual report}} 2016, Emirates {{authorities}} forcibly disappeared and detained people who criticized {{the government or}} its allies. February 2015, Human Rights Watch documented {{a case in which}} three Emirati sisters, Asma, Mariam, and Al Yazzyah al-Suweidi, were forcibly disappeared by Emirates authorities. They released them without charge after spending 3 months in <b>incommunicado</b> <b>detention.</b> The three sisters had arrested after posting comments criticizing government for arresting their brother Dr. Issa al-Suweidi. In August 2015, Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith was arrested after posting some comments on social media in which he criticized the mass killing of Rab'a protesters in Cairo in 2013. Bin Ghaith's fate still unknown at time of writing.|$|E

Amnesty International stated its belief that his arrest was {{connected}} with his investigations into government corruption, and designated him a prisoner of conscience. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists also sent a protest letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, noting the organization's dismay [...] "that the state continues its persecution of independent journalists", and World Bank president James Wolfensohn called Sharif to urge Sethi's release.|$|R
25|$|According to GlobalSecurity, police {{impunity}} {{and corruption}} are serious problems. In 2008 President Assad issued {{a law that}} mandates that only the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces may issue an arrest warrant {{in the case of}} a crime committed by a military officer, member of the internal security forces, or customs police officer in the pursuit of his normal duties, and that such cases must be tried in military courts. Arbitrary and false arrests are also problems, and detainees had no legal redress. According to the accusations, the authorities use the Emergency Law to detain persons critical of the government and charge them with a wide range of political crimes, including treason. <b>Incommunicado</b> <b>detention</b> was a severe problem. Many persons who disappeared were believed to be either in long-term detention without charge or possibly to have died while detained. Many detainees brought to trial were held incommunicado for years, and their trials were often marked by irregularities and lack of due process. A shortage of available courts and lack of legal provisions for a speedy trial or plea bargaining led to lengthy pretrial detentions.|$|E

Harvard Professor Zechariah Chafee criticized the raids and attempts at deportations {{and the lack}} of legal process in his 1920 volume Freedom of Speech.

2500|$|Once Palmer's {{warnings}} of a May Day attempt {{to overthrow the}} government proved false, the anti-Bolshevik hysteria wound down quickly. In testimony before Congress on May 7–8, Louis Freeland Post defended his release of hundreds seized in Palmer's raids so successfully that attempts to impeach or censure him ended. Later in the month, a dozen prominent lawyers including Felix Frankfurter and Roscoe Pound endorsed a report that condemned Palmer's Justice Department for the [...] "utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws" [...] including entrapment, police brutality, prolonged <b>incommunicado</b> <b>detention,</b> and violations of due process in court.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to another}} {{report by the}} UN OHCHR, over 3 million people {{continued}} {{to live in the}} Donbass conflict zone as of March 2016.

In addition, the Ukrainian government was said to have registered a total of 1.6 million internally displaced people within Ukraine who had fled the conflict. Over 1 million were reported to have sought asylum elsewhere, with most having gone to Russia. The report also said that people that lived in separatist-controlled areas were experiencing [...] "complete absence of rule of law, reports of arbitrary detention, torture and <b>incommunicado</b> <b>detention,</b> and no access to real redress mechanisms".|$|E
2500|$|Frankfurter's {{activities}} {{continued to}} attract attention for their alleged radicalism. In November 1919, he chaired a meeting in support of American recognition of the newly created Soviet Union. In 1920, Frankfurter helped to found the American Civil Liberties Union. Following the arrest of suspected communist radicals in 1919 and 1920 during the Palmer raids, Frankfurter, together with other prominent lawyers including Zechariah Chafee, signed an ACLU report which condemned the [...] "utterly illegal acts committed by those charged with the highest duty of enforcing the laws" [...] and noted they had committed entrapment, police brutality, prolonged <b>incommunicado</b> <b>detention,</b> and violations of due process in court. Frankfurter and Chafee also submitted briefs to a habeas corpus application to the Massachusetts Federal District Court. Judge George Anderson ordered the discharge of twenty aliens, and his denunciation of the raids effectively ended them.|$|E

2500|$|Blacklists were {{compiled}} of suspected guerilla collaborators {{and those with}} communist leanings, as troops and paramilitaries moved through Zacapa systematically arresting suspected insurgents and collaborators; prisoners were either killed on the spot or [...] "disappeared" [...] after being taken to secret detention sites. In villages which the military identified as supportive of the FAR, the Army would publicly execute peasant leaders, threatening to execute more if the villagers did not collaborate with the authorities Among the numerous clandestine sites used by the army for <b>incommunicado</b> <b>detention</b> and torture of suspects, was the army headquarters in the hamlet of La Palma near Rio Hondo, Zacapa, where hundreds of persons suspected {{of belonging to the}} FAR were tortured and executed under G-2 bureau chief Hernán Ovidio Morales Páiz in 1966 and 1967. Government forces often dumped the bodies of victims publicly to foment terror; the press regularly contained reports of unrecognizable corpses found floating in the Motagua River, mutilated by torture. Fishermen in the municipality of Gualan reportedly stopped fishing the Motagua on account of the large number of mutilated bodies found in nets.|$|E
