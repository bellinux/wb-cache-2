40|$|Background: Maintenance of {{motorcycle}} {{is undertaken}} bymechanics of authorized and conventional garages. Mechanics of authorized garage use standing position(standard working position), mechanics of conventional garageuse squating position. Either standing or squating position arestatic working position {{that does not}} meet the requirement ofhealthy work. Objective: The study aimed to improve static <b>position</b> andsitting-standing <b>position</b> (<b>dynamic</b> <b>position)</b> using bike lift ofmotorcycle with device for sitting. Method: The study was experiment that used pretest-posttestEquivalent Group Design. Location of the study wasconventional garage at Jalan Hercules No. 2 Tanggul Hitam ofPadang Municipality. Subject of the experiment consisted of 16 mechanics of conventional garage (16 people) and subject ofcontrol consisted of 16 people of Honda Main Dealer (C. V. Hayati) at Jalan Pemuda 35 Padang. The dependent variableswere weight assessed using Digital Camry Scale, strength ofhand muscles assessed using Dynamometer, workload withpulse indicator assessed using Personal ECG Recorder EP- 200 ©, fatigue with indicator of blood lactate acid assessedusing Accutrend® Lactate. Statistical analysis to identify thedifference used covariance analysis and t-paired test to identifythe difference. Result: 1) There was significant difference in weight betweendynamic position and standard position (p< 0. 05). Decrease ofweight in <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> was less than in standard position, 2) there was significant difference in strength of hand musclebetween <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> and standard position (p< 0. 05). Decrease of strength of hand muscle in dynamic positive wasless than in standard position, 3) there was significantdifference in pulse between <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> and standardposition (p< 0. 05). Increase of pulse in <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> waslower than in standard position, 4) there was significantdifference in muscle fatigue between <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> andstandard position (p< 0. 05). Increase of muscle fatigue indynamic position was less than in standard <b>position.</b> Conclusion: <b>Dynamic</b> <b>position,</b> viewed from changes invariable of weight, strength of hand muscle, workload, andmuscle fatigue, was better than standard position. Thereforeit was suggested to use <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> while working. Forthe government recommended: a).

40|$|Background: Comfort during {{colonoscopy}} is {{a universal}} concern, but when the patient is drugged and unable to change position, this can prejudice the accuracy of colonoscopy. Aim: To assess whether position changes during the colonoscope withdrawal phase decrease the sensation of abdominal fullness. Methods: This study involved 150 patients, none of whom received intravenous sedation. After colonoscopy to the cecum in the supine position, the examinations were completed with the following <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> changes (cecum to transverse colon, supine; splenic flexure and descending colon, right lateral; sigmoid colon, supine; and rectum, left lateral) or minimal position changes (cecum to sigmoid colon, supine; and rectum, left lateral). Patients graded the sensation of abdominal fullness as follows: Grade 1 : no abdominal fullness; Grade 2 : mild fullness; Grade 3 : moderate fullness; Grade 4 : marked fullness; and Grade 5 : painful fullness. Results: The following scores were reported with <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> changes: Grade 1, 86. 7 %; Grade 2, 12. 0 %; Grade 3, 1. 3 % and with minimal position changes Grade 1, 53. 3 %; Grade 2, 44. 0 %; Grade 3, 2. 7 %. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>position</b> changes significantly decreased patient-assessed abdominal fullness grades compared with minimal position changes (P< 0. 05) according to the Mann-Whitney U test.

25|$|Botnica {{was one of}} {{the first}} icebreakers to be {{equipped}} with Azipod propulsion, ABB's brand of electric azimuth thrusters developed in Finland. The two 5 MW Azipod VI1600A units considerably improve the maneuverability of the icebreaker — the tactical diameter of the turning circle in open water is less than the overall length of the ship. This is especially useful during escort and assistance operations in difficult ice conditions when the icebreaker has to operate at close proximity to other vessels at low speeds. Together with three 1,150-kW Brunvoll FU-80-LTC-2000 variable-pitch bow thrusters the azimuth thrusters also allow <b>dynamic</b> <b>positioning</b> during offshore operations.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} whether <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> sense at the ankle [...] or sense of position and velocity during movement [...] shows a similar decline {{as a result}} of aging as previously described for static position sense and movement detection threshold. Additionally, the involvement of muscle spindle afferents in the possible age-related decline was studied. To assess <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> sense, blindfolded subjects had to open the hand briskly when the right ankle was rotating passively through a prescribed target angle. To assess the involvement of muscle spindles, the effect of tibialis anterior vibration was studied. The results showed that aging lead to a significant increase in deviation from the target angle at hand opening as well as in variability of performance. Vibration resulted in larger undershoot errors in the elderly compared to the young adults, suggesting that the age-related decline in performance on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>position</b> sense task is not (solely) due to muscle spindle function changes. Alternatively, this degeneration might be due to altered input from other sources of proprioceptive input, such as skin receptors.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga {{with the intention}} of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and <b>dynamic</b> <b>positioning</b> systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While caisson-retained islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.|$|E
