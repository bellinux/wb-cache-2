5|$|By contrast, French {{observers}} remarked favorably on the industriousness and <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> {{the people}} of Rurutu, {{as well as the}} success of Teuruarii in increasing revenues through maritime trade with neighboring islands. In 1899, Rurutu's annual exports were valued at 59,881 French francs, of which 37,919 were exported to the Tahitian port of Papeete - exceptionally high trade volumes in light of the relatively small size of the island and its population.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, holding {{a score of}} 89 out of 100 at review aggregate website Metacritic.

5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, {{it tends to be}} highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs.|$|E
5|$|Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog {{has high}} energy levels, an active mind, and {{a level of}} independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} most {{intelligent}} dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.|$|E
5|$|More {{contentious}} {{than the}} lower house was {{the question of the}} upper house. Few agreed with Madison that its members should be elected by {{the lower house}}. James Wilson suggested election by popular vote versus election by state legislature, but his proposal was shot down 10â€“1 by the delegates. Most delegates didn't question the <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> the voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Seeds of Evil {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from critics and {{sold more than}} one million copies in the United States. Critics generally praised the game for its detailed graphics, deep and long levels, and advanced artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> enemies. However, the game's inconsistent frame rate and intense distance fog were common subjects of criticism. A remastered version of the game developed by Night Dive Studios was released for Microsoft Windows in 2017. A sequel, , was released in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> the game's enemies, the Aliens, {{was regarded}} as lacking, and one reviewer noted that their blood was not acidic, a defining characteristic of the creatures from the films. Several reviewers did praise the game's representation of the Predator, however, especially in the early levels.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics and {{was described as}} another entry {{in a long line}} of poorly developed movie tie-ins. Reviewers enjoyed the opportunity to play as a Predator, but complained that the game was too easy and not rewarding, particularly the simple artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> enemies. The visuals and audio of the game were also considered of poor quality.|$|E

5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates.

The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|An {{original}} non-canon story {{set in the}} legendarium {{created by}} J. R. R. Tolkien, the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The player controls Talion, a Ranger who bonds with the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, as the two set out to avenge {{the deaths of the}}ir loved ones. Players can engage in melee combat, and use wraith abilities to fight and manipulate enemies. The game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> non-playable characters to remember the deaths of the game's protagonist and react accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> rebel activities.|$|E

50|$|The {{focus on}} systems integration, {{especially}} with regard to modular approaches, derive from the fact that most <b>intelligences</b> <b>of</b> significant scales are composed of a multitude of processes and/or utilize multi-modal input and output. For example, a humanoid-type <b>of</b> <b>intelligence</b> would preferably {{have to be able to}} talk using speech synthesis, hear using speech recognition, understand using a logical (or some other undefined) mechanism, and so forth. In order to produce artificially intelligent software <b>of</b> broader <b>intelligence,</b> integration <b>of</b> these modalities is necessary.|$|R
5|$|On 10 November the 57th Independent Battalion {{advanced}} {{against the}} TO in Veliki Miletinac (east {{of the area}} captured in Operation Swath-10), capturing the village the same day. The neighbouring Mali Miletinac was captured by the HV the following day, and on 12 November the HV captured the villages of Bastajski BrÄ‘ani and RekiÄ‡i. Two days later the TO counterattacked, killing nine HV troops and wounding about ten more, but the HV defence held. Another effort to recapture Bastajski BrÄ‘ani {{was made by the}} TO, reinforced with 50 paramilitary White Eagles. It failed (despite being well prepared and supported by artillery) because the defending HV force was alerted by signals <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> the attack and reinforced. The White Eagles lost 46 killed in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Soult rapidly {{gathered}} a new army from the French forces in Andalusia and, joining {{with the troops}} retreating before Beresford, he marched to relieve the siege. With <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> another approaching forceâ€”a Spanish army under Gen. JoaquÃ­n Blakeâ€”he planned to turn Beresford's flank and interpose his army between the two. However, Soult was again acting on outdated information; unknown to the Marshal, the Spaniards had already linked up with the Anglo-Portuguese corps, and his 24,000 troops now faced a combined Allied army 35,000 strong.|$|E
5|$|The Combine are {{frequently}} shown as harsh rulers over {{the citizens of}} Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using invasive surgery to transform humans into either soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles with transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that {{are the product of}} Combine technology. The atmosphere generated by the dystopian Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> the transhuman Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in Half-Life 2. In addition to their role within the Half-Life series, the Combine have been adapted for machinima productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.|$|E
