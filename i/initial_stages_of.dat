The training they provided to Nationalist force proved as valuable, if not more so, than direct actions. Approximately 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> naval base development.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Parkinson's rank was made substantive and was later seconded to the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). He was given command of the 4th Field Artillery Regiment and embarked with the First Echelon of the 2NZEF in early 1940. After serving in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the Western Desert Campaign, for which he was mentioned in despatches, he led the regiment well during the Battle of Greece. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), gazetted on 14 April 1942, due in part to his service during the battle.|$|E
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year. Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued {{in other parts of}} the enclave, including Lachin, Khojavend, and Aghdara. However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand in the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia and Seattle both {{play in the}} {{top tier}} of American soccer, Major League Soccer(MLS), and {{bypassed}} the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the tournament with entries into the fourth round of play. The Sounders {{were in the midst}} of a Supporters' Shield-winning regular season, while the Union's start was so poor that their coach was replaced a week prior to their first game in the competition. Philadelphia secured its berth in the final by defeating the Harrisburg City Islanders, the New York Cosmos, the New England Revolution, and FC Dallas. Seattle's road to the final included victories over PSA Elite, the San Jose Earthquakes, the Portland Timbers, and the Chicago Fire.|$|E

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 119. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of}} the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones, including the unnamed storm as well as the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> Florence, Leslie, and Michael, are excluded from the total.|$|E
5|$|After her audience's {{demand to}} {{continue}} performing similar songs, Gočeva decided {{to record a}} second album in the same musical direction. Makedonsko Devojče 2 is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in the vein of Macedonian folklore. The plans to record the album were revealed by Gočeva during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine Naš Svet, confirming that she had already begun with the song selection process for the track listing of the second edition of the project Makedonsko Devojče. In the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the album's development, Makedonsko Devojče 2 served only as a working title and later became its official title in order {{to emphasize that the}} musical style is {{the same as that of}} Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum {{is an extension of}} the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E

5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
5|$|Grenade {{was then}} {{transferred}} to the English Channel and collided with the anti-submarine trawler Clayton Wyke on 14 May in heavy fog. Her repairs were completed at Sheerness Dockyard on 25 May. During the <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the evacuation from Dunkirk the ship provided cover {{in the northern part}} of the Channel to the evacuation forces and took part in the rescue of 33 survivors on 28 May from the coaster , which had been torpedoed by an E-boat. She made one trip to Dunkirk during the night of 28/29 May and was caught in Dunkirk harbour by German Stukas during the following day. Grenade was hit by two bombs which set her afire and killed 14 sailors and mortally wounded another four men. The ship was cast off from her berth, in case she sank there, and then drifted into the harbour channel. The trawler John Cattling towed Grenade over to the west side of the outer harbour where her magazines exploded later that evening.|$|E
5|$|In late-May {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist roughly 650km (400mi) west of Manila, Philippines in the South China Sea. Late on May23, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the area for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis. Over {{the next few days}} the disturbance began to consolidate towards a common low pressure center, resulting in a burst in convective activity. At 0000UTC on May25, the JTWC classified the resulting system as a tropical depression west of Luzon; six hours later both the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) began to monitor the newly formed tropical cyclone, though the latter classified it as a tropical storm. During these <b>initial</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> development the tropical cyclone slowly intensified as it slowly tracked in a clockwise loop throughout the course of the day. At 1800UTC, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status while the JMA followed suit six hours later, thus designating the cyclone with the name Linfa.|$|E
