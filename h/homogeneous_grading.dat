40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} f binary aluminum-manganese alloys from chloroaluminate {{molten salts}} is reported. The man-ganese {{content of the}} electrodeposit varies from 7 to 30 w/o and is dependent upon deposition potential and the relative concentrations of A 12 C 17 and Mn++ in the melt. At small cathodic overpotentials the deposition process, with respect o alloy composition, is kinetically controlled. At larger cathodic overpotentials, it becomes mass transport limited in Mn +§ and then A 12 C 17 -. The most uniform and brightest deposits are obtained at a constant potential of- 0. 3 V with respect to an aluminum wire in the same electrolyte.

40|$|Ca 2 +-activated aequorin {{luminescence}} {{and tension}} were measured in dog Purkinje fibres during twitches {{and during the}} increase in resting force produced by exposure of the fibres to a low-Na+ solution after 3 min without external K+. Over the restricted range which could be examined, the relation between tension and 'mean' aequorin luminescence (luminescence filtered at 0. 2 Hz) was approximately linear during the development and maintenance of contracture. For a given level of force, the mean aequorin luminescence during contracture was up to 20 {{times greater than the}} peak luminescence during the twitch. Noise analysis of aequorin luminescence and tension during contracture indicated the presence of periodic fluctuations, with a predominant frequency in the range 1 - 4 Hz. Ryanodine (1 microM) or caffeine (10 mM) abolished the fluctuations in luminescence and tension and made the relation between tension and mean aequorin luminescence much steeper. A mathematical model, the key feature of which is periodicity in the asynchronous occurrence of spatially localized regions of relatively high [Ca 2 +], reproduces the experimental data derived from contractures. From the model analysis, we infer that tonic tension is produced by recruitment of increasing numbers of regions of high [Ca 2 +], rather than by <b>homogeneous</b> <b>graded</b> activation. These results indicate that during contracture or 'tonic tension', intracellular [Ca 2 +] is not at steady state, but rather undergoes large, asynchronous spatio-temporal fluctuations.

40|$|Inducible {{switching}} between phenotypes is {{a common}} strategy of bacteria to adapt to fluctuating environments. Here, we analyze the switching kinetics of a paradigmatic inducible system, the arabinose utilization system in E. coli. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of microcolonies in a microfluidic chamber, which permits sudden up- and down-shifts in the inducer arabinose, we characterize the single-cell gene expression dynamics of the araBAD operon responsible for arabinose degradation. While there is significant, inducer-dependent cell-to-cell variation in {{the timing of the}} on-switching, the off-switching triggered by sudden removal of arabinose is homogeneous and rapid. We find that rapid off-switching does not depend on internal arabinose degradation. Because the system is regulated via the internal arabinose level sensed by AraC, internal arabinose must be rapidly depleted by leakage or export from the cell, or by degradation via a non-canonical pathway. We explored whether the poorly characterized membrane protein AraJ, {{which is part of the}} arabinose regulon and has been annotated as a possible arabinose efflux protein, is responsible for rapid depletion. However, we find that AraJ is not essential for rapid switching to the off-state. We develop a mathematical model for the arabinose system, which quantitatively describes both the heterogeneous on-switching and the homogeneous off-switching. The model also predicts that mutations which disrupt the positive feedback of internal arabinose on the production of arabinose uptake proteins change the heterogeneous on-switching behavior into a <b>homogeneous,</b> <b>graded</b> response. We construct such a mutant and confirm the graded response experimentally. Taken together, our results indicate that the physiological switching behavior of this sugar utilization system is asymmetric, such that off-switching is always rapid and homogeneous, while on-switching is slow and heterogeneously timed at sub-saturating inducer levels...|$|R
