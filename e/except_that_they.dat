5|$|Courageous and Glorious were {{generally}} similar <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> carried {{a total of}} 48 aircraft. They commonly flew {{the same types of}} aircraft as Furious, although they are also known to have flown the Fairey Seal, the Blackburn Shark, and the Blackburn Ripon.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a quarter}} of an hour before the detectives came back, and then they had very little to say, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would report the {{particulars}} at headquarters and endeavor to run down the criminal.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} some {{distance}} from the old boathouse when he discovered two persons running across an open field which lined the roadway. He could not make out anything <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were either men or big boys.|$|R
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have some vertical development, which implies {{that they can}} grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} {{fundamental}} rules of natural justice {{embodied in the}} concept of law in constitutional provisions such as Articles 9(1) and 12(1) are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in administrative law, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> operate at different levels of the legal order. The former invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality and can only be altered by amending the Constitution, while the latter invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles and can be abrogated or disapplied by ordinary legislation.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} townspeople and the worm is inserted into her body. Eventually, Doggett finds Scully, cuts the worm out of her, and shoots the creature dead. Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{took the}} road to Beechwood," [...] and the girl student pointed out the highway mentioned, one that ran through the big woods back of the seminary. It led {{to the village of}} Beechwood, which was several miles beyond.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are often}} seen, before the {{outburst}} of a severe tempest. Of course, {{they look like}} balls of phosphorus; but in reality they are electric, and are {{a sign that the}} whole atmosphere is charged with electricity. Sailors have all sorts of superstitions about them but, of course, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are signs of the condition of the air, they are perfectly harmless." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} were on the way again. They had telephoned to Peter Marley, so that the farmer would know the cause of the delay. Sam did the driving and now the machine went along well, and almost before they knew it they were at Rayville and asking the way to the Marley farm. This was on a back road, but the way was good and they reached the farm without trouble, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had to slow down to let a herd of cows pass them.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, spiders' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
25|$|Guarijío: A small tribe linguistically {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other tribes of the state. Little is known about these indigenous tribes <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> live near the small villages of Chínipas and Uruachi.|$|E
25|$|European earwig nymphs {{look very}} similar to their adult {{counterparts}} <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are a lighter color. The young go through four nymphal stages and do not leave the nest until after the first moult.|$|E
5|$|At trial Hayer confessed, {{but refused}} to {{identify}} the other assailants <b>except</b> to assert <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not Butler and Johnson.|$|R
30|$|The well storage {{concept in}} Fig.  7 b and the basin {{configuration}} in Fig.  7 c {{operate in a}} largely similar manner, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> since <b>they</b> are less deep for practical constructional reasons the recharging and discharging of the piston chamber can be implemented less expensively by employing a natural or artificial reservoir.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the news was {{circulating}} that the Wadsworth jewelry works had been robbed, and many persons {{spent the rest of}} the night looking for the two young men who were supposed to be guilty of the crime. Oliver Wadsworth and an officer remained at the offices, guarding the wrecked place and looking for clews of the evildoers. But nothing in the way of evidence against the robbers was brought to light, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had used several drills and some dynamite on the two old safes, probably blowing them up simultaneously. They had taken the tool-bag with its contents with them and also another small valise, belonging to one of Mr. Wadsworth’s traveling salesmen.|$|R
25|$|A line {{of unique}} trees similar in {{appearance}} to Telperion, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{did not give}} light. The first of these was Galathilion of Tirion, from which were descended Celeborn of Tol Eressëa, Nimloth of Númenor and the White Trees of Gondor.|$|E
25|$|Duck {{was born}} at Charlton, near Pewsey, in Wiltshire. Little is known about Duck's family, whether from Duck himself or from {{contemporary}} records, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were labourers and very poor. Duck attended a charity school and left {{at the age of}} thirteen to begin working in the fields.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{officers}} wears white helmet or dark {{navy blue}} cap while on duty, a white long sleeve {{shirt with a}} reflective yellow vest, black riding pants with a yellow stripe and riding boots.

50|$|At 20:30 Friday night, 20 November, {{they took}} off in a C-130 bound for Udorn RTAFB. There they boarded CH-53 {{helicopters}} for the mission. Everything about this daring, complex and innovative mission worked, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> when <b>they</b> hit the prison camp the prisoners had already been moved elsewhere. The discussion of why the prisoners were moved continues even today.|$|R
6000|$|Lee's actual {{treatment}} {{was not so}} harsh as had been represented. He was in close confinement it is true, but three rooms had been fitted up for his reception in the Old City Hall of New York, having nothing of {{the look of a}} prison <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were secured by bolts and bars. Congress, in the meantime, had resorted to their threatened measure of retaliation. On the 20th of February <b>they</b> had resolved <b>that</b> the Board of War be directed immediately to order the five Hessian field-officers and Lieutenant-colonel Campbell into safe and close custody, [...] "it being the unalterable resolution of Congress to retaliate on them the same punishment as may be inflicted on the person of General Lee." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} the room in which they were, {{but there was no}} door <b>except</b> <b>that</b> by which <b>they</b> had entered. Then he uttered a startled cry, and {{stepping}} forward fell on his knee.|$|R
25|$|The first bikinis {{appeared}} {{just after}} World War II. Early examples {{were not very}} different from the women's two pieces common since the 1920s, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had a gap below the breast line allowing for a section of bare midriff. They were named after Bikini Atoll, the site of several nuclear weapons tests, for their supposed explosive effect on the viewer.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a quasiregular {{polyhedron}} is a semiregular polyhedron {{that has}} exactly {{two kinds of}} regular faces, which alternate around each vertex. They are edge-transitive and hence {{a step closer to}} regular polyhedra than the semiregular which are merely vertex-transitive. The dual figures is also sometimes considered quasiregular, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are edge-transitive, face-transitive, and alternate between two regular vertex figures.|$|E
25|$|About {{three years}} after Ai's visit, Ricci sent a Chinese Jesuit Lay Brother to visit Kaifeng; he copied the {{beginnings}} and ends of the holy books kept in the synagogue, which allowed Ricci to verify that they indeed were the same texts as the Pentateuch known to Europeans, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not use Hebrew diacritics (which were a comparatively late invention).|$|E
40|$|Nepal is a {{small country}} in the Himalayan Mountains between India and Tibet. Over recent years, {{small-scale}} hydro schemes have been installed to bring electricity to rural villages. Hydro schemes are similar to watermills, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> often <b>they</b> are designed to generate electricity for grinding grain, cooking and lighting. One of the areas where electrification is taking place is in Andhi Khola...|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom {{does not}} permit {{intersex}} people to change sex classification, <b>except</b> by declaring <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are transgender and following relevant medical protocols including a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.|$|R
6000|$|It only {{needs that}} a just man should walk in our streets {{to make it}} appear how pitiful and inartificial a {{contrivance}} is our legislation. The man whose part is taken and who does not wait for society in anything, has a power which society cannot choose but feel. The familiar experiment called the hydrostatic paradox, in which a capillary column of water balances the ocean, is a symbol of the relation of one man to the whole family of men. The wise Dandamis, on hearing the lives of Socrates, Pythagoras and Diogenes read, [...] "judged them to be great men every way, <b>excepting,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were too much subjected to the reverence of the laws, which to second and authorize, true virtue must abate very much of its original vigor." ...|$|R
25|$|The 4 basic vowels /a/ /i/ /u̯a/ /u/ can all occur {{before the}} front finals. In MSB before the -p and -t finals they are {{pronounced}} /æ̆ʔ/ /ĕɪʔ/ /u̯æ̆ʔ~ʊ̆ʔ/ /ŏʊʔ/ respectively. Similarly, before the -m and -n finals, vowels {{use the same}} qualities <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are nasalised and are pronounced long by default thus giving: /æ̃ː/ /ẽɪː/ /u̯æ̃ː~ʊ̃ː/ /õʊː/.|$|E
25|$|In more {{advanced}} treatments, one further distinguishes pseudovector fields and pseudoscalar fields, which are identical to vector fields and scalar fields <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> change sign under an orientation-reversing map: for example, the curl of a vector field is a pseudovector field, {{and if one}} reflects a vector field, the curl points in the opposite direction. This distinction is clarified and elaborated in geometric algebra, as described below.|$|E
25|$|Sun He had {{at least}} four sons – Sun Jun (孫俊), Sun Hao, Sun De (孫德) and Sun Qian (孫謙). Sun Jun was born to Sun He's wife Crown Princess Zhang (a {{daughter}} of Zhang Cheng), while Sun Hao was born to Sun He's concubine Lady He. It is not known who the mothers of Sun De and Sun Qian were, <b>except</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were probably Sun He's concubines.|$|E
60|$|To {{these may}} be added {{dissolved}} sugar and gum, diluted alcohol, and vegetable infusions not containing albumen, for none of these, {{as shown in the}} last chapter, excite inflection. Now, it is a remarkable fact, which affords additional and important evidence, that the ferment of Drosera is closely similar to or identical with pepsin, that none of these same substances are, as far as it is known, digested by the gastric juice of animals, though some of them are acted on by the other secretions of the alimentary canal. Nothing more need be said about some of the above enumerated substances, <b>excepting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were repeatedly tried on the leaves of Drosera, and were not in the least affected by the secretion. About the others it will be advisable to give my experiments.|$|R

60|$|Our marines had {{no other}} than martial duty to perform; <b>excepting</b> <b>that,</b> at sea, <b>they</b> stood watches like the sailors, and now and then lazily {{assisted}} in pulling the ropes. But they never put foot in rigging or hand in tar-bucket.|$|R
