50|$|The Glenn Hall <b>Goatman</b> {{was first}} {{conceived}} for Glenn Hall intramurals in the Fall of 2002. The term <b>Goatman</b> was unofficially applied to any male who lived or {{had lived in}} Glenn Hall. The term was first officially applied to Glenn residents in Fall of 2003 when several Glenn Housing fliers made references to the <b>Goatman.</b> The most famous flier was made before the annual UGA game and it depicted a half-man half-goat sending lightning towards Athens, Georgia. In Fall of 2006 the <b>Goatman</b> adorned Glenn intramural jerseys for the first time. Despite initial discouragement, the <b>Goatman</b> remains the only official mascot for any hall in the Freshman Experience.|$|E
5000|$|According to University of Maryland folklorist Barry Pearson, the <b>goatman</b> legends began [...] "long, long, long" [...] ago {{and were}} further popularized in 1971 when {{the death of}} a dog was blamed on <b>Goatman</b> by local residents. Pearson says [...] "bored teenagers" [...] keep the <b>Goatman</b> legend alive by repeating the story and {{suggesting}} that the creature attacks couples frequenting the local lovers lane, subsequently stirring interest in sites like Fletchertown Road.|$|E
5000|$|The {{creature}} is {{featured in a}} found-footage horror film entitled Jimmy Tupper Vs. The <b>Goatman</b> of Bowie ...|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, the Barons of Hell (called 'Hell Princes' in the book), large minotaur-like <b>goatmen,</b> conjure green flames {{with their}} hands to hurl at the player, while the book {{describes}} them as using wrist-mounted plasma launchers.|$|R
50|$|John Reynolds is an American musician, songwriter, {{and music}} {{producer}} known mostly {{for his work}} with Marty Clarke in the late-1980s band The <b>Goatmen,</b> Every Damn Day, and children's musician Graham Clarke. He also created and manages Clarke's website.|$|R
5000|$|Branching out in 1999, Clarke {{followed}} up with a second album Graham & Cinnamon which featured a much more studio produced sound. Again, he went to John Reynolds for production assistance. Reynolds {{brought him to the}} (now defunct) Nu Bleu Recording Studio in Garfield, NJ run by Andy Halasz. The instrumentation expanded well beyond Clarke and his guitar. Reynolds contributed invaluably to this album by providing arrangements and playing every instrument on the album besides Graham's guitar. Songs like [...] "If I Live to Be 100" [...] and [...] "Grandma Can You Jump?" [...] benefitted greatly from Reynolds instrumentation (including playing the drums, which Reynods had never played before) and the recording experience he brought with him from The <b>Goatmen</b> and Every Damn Day. Clarke started to receive airplay on local radio stations, premiering on WPLJ's [...] "Scott and Todd: The Big Show".|$|R

50|$|According {{to urban}} legend, the <b>Goatman</b> is an axe-wielding half-animal, half-man {{creature}} {{that was once}} a scientist {{who worked in the}} Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. The tale holds that he was experimenting on goats until one experiment backfired, and he was mutated, becoming goat-like himself. He then began attacking cars with an axe, roaming the back roads of Beltsville, Maryland. A variation of the legend tells of the <b>Goatman</b> as an old hermit who lives in the woods, seen walking alone at night along Fletchertown Road.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996 Clarke {{approached}} John Reynolds, whom he {{knew from}} his brother Marty's late-1980s band The <b>Goatmen,</b> to help him make his first album, Graham & Delores. Recorded at Arrigoni Center, a former Episcopal church, at Iona College on a TASCAM 4-track portastudio (borrowed from noted Thomas Merton scholar Kathleen Deignan), the album featured a very basic, live acoustic sound featuring only Clarke and his guitar with no over-dubbing. It was released in 1997 selling out the original run of over 1000 units strictly at his local shows by 1998. Graham & Delores has garnered Clarke worldwide fame and eventually {{found its way to}} Argentina, and later to Japan, Venezuela, and South Korea, {{to be used as a}} way to teach English in primary schools. The album's [...] "Apples and Bananas" [...] and [...] "Graham's Dinosaur Song" [...] continue to be live show favorites.|$|R
5000|$|The arc {{picks up}} {{following}} {{from the story}} of [...] "Predators and Prey", with Slayers on the run in the new pro-vampire society. The issue begins with Willow transporting Buffy to their new base, using heavy amounts of magic; a glamour makes the base invisible, and makes Buffy and Willow appear like a fish and a seagull, while layers of magical force fields and protections surround the base. At the base, flushed out from their regular bases, are Slayers {{from around the world}} such as Satsu and Kennedy. Meanwhile, Faith and Giles are forced from their underground bunker in Berlin by demonic assault, and vow to make their way to Buffy and co. Similarly, Andrew and his Slayers are hiding out underground when they encounter Warren, who attempts to distract Andrew while Amy has summoned <b>goatmen</b> demons. They too, vow to escape to Buffy's base.|$|R
50|$|Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman, via {{his blog}} Cryptomundo and book Weird Virginia, {{in a section}} on the Bunny Man, wrote about a direct {{association}} between the legend of Bunny Man {{and that of the}} <b>Goatman</b> of nearby Maryland.|$|E
50|$|One {{variation}} of the story {{has it that the}} <b>Goatman</b> {{was the result of a}} (very early) DNA experiment conducted by a scientist named Stephen Fletcher, though other variations suggest a more supernatural origin involving the Devil.|$|E
5000|$|There is a purported [...] "Crybaby Bridge" [...] off Beaver Dam Road in Beltsville, {{near the}} Department of Agriculture's Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. It is {{in or near}} the areas where the legendary <b>goatman</b> has {{reported}} to have been seen.|$|E

5000|$|With vehicle traffic removed, {{the bridge}} became an {{important}} link connecting the Elm Fork and Pilot Knoll Hiking and Equestrian Trails. Today it is a popular location for nature enthusiasts and photographers. Old Alton Bridge {{was included in the}} National Register of Historic Places, July 8, 1988. The <b>goatman</b> was latter shot by the police ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Bowser would direct {{his first}} solo feature film Jimmy Tupper Vs. The <b>Goatman</b> of Bowie. The film was a [...] "found footage" [...] style horror film that {{followed}} a young man's perceived {{encounter with the}} titular cryptid and his ensuing quest to track and capture the beast. Based around the urban legend from Bowser's home town, the film would premiere at the 2010 South By Southwest film festival.|$|E
50|$|Locals {{warn that}} if you crossed the bridge at night without headlights, you will be met {{on the other side}} by the <b>Goatman.</b> Ghostly figures and strange lights are said to appear in the {{surrounding}} woods, as well as reports of visitors being touched, grabbed and having rocks thrown at them. This legend results in the area around Old Alton Bridge being popular with paranormal societies and Halloween activities, most notably with the Ghost Adventures crew.|$|E
50|$|In Weird Maryland: Your Travel Guide to Maryland's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets, authors Matt Lake, Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman {{include three}} first-person {{narratives}} of crybaby bridge experiences in Maryland. The locations mentioned are the Governor's Bridge Road bridge discussed above, one on Lottsford Vista Road {{and a third}} unspecified, but possibly described the Lottsford Vista Road bridge as well. The latter narratives make mention of purported Satanic churches near the bridge and appearance of the <b>Goatman.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, legend {{tells of}} a black goat farmer who moved his family to a {{residence}} {{just north of the}} bridge. A few years later, Oscar Washburn was known as a dependable and honest businessman. North Texans endearingly began to call him the <b>Goatman.</b> But the success of a black man was still unwelcome to many, and Klansmen in the local government turned to violence after he displayed a sign on Alton Bridge: [...] "this way to the Goatman's".|$|E
50|$|Many {{of these}} are {{available}} at a University of Maryland exhibit named Mysterious Maryland. Here you can see life-size images of - and newspaper clippings about - the Dwayyo, a coyote/hyena-like legend from Frederick County; the Bunny Man, a hatchet-wielding man who dresses in a pink bunny suit and torments people in the DC/Metro area; and the infamous Maryland <b>Goatman,</b> a half man, half goat creature who has been spotted around Prince George's County, Maryland since the 1950s, and who some believe may actually be the devil himself.|$|E
40|$|Proliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy {{is the most}} advanced stage of {{diabetic retinopathy}}, and is classified by the growth of new blood vessels. These blood vessels are abnormal and fragile, and are susceptible to leaking blood and fluid onto the retina, which can cause severe vision loss. This paper proposes a method by combining prior works of Keith A. <b>Goatman</b> et al. (2011) and Gopal Datt Joshi et al (2011) {{for the detection of}} proliferative diabetic retinopathy. First, vessel-like patterns are segmented by using Ridge Strength Measurement and Watershed lines. The second step is measuring the vessel pattern obtained. Many features that are extracted from the blood vessels such as shape, position, orientation, brightness, contrast and line density have been used to quantitate patterns in retinal vasculature. Based on the features extracted, the segment is classified as normal or abnormal by using Support Vector Machine Classifier. The obtained accuracy may be sufficient to reduce the workload of an ophthalmologist and to prioritize the patient grading queues...|$|E
