40|$|Miller [1977. Risk, uncertainty, and {{divergence}} of opinion. Journal of Finance 32, 1151 - 1168] hypothesizes {{that prices}} of stocks subject to high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion and short-sales constraints are biased upward. We expect earnings announcements to reduce <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion, {{we find that}} high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion stocks. In addition, the returns on high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts' forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements. <b>Differences</b> <b>of</b> opinion Earnings announcements Institutional ownership Limits to arbitrage Market efficiency Short-sales constraints...|$|R
5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E

40|$|We {{focus on}} {{nonlinearity}} for images and propose a new method which can preserve curve edges in image smoothing using nonlinear anisotropic diffusion (NAD).

That is, not only the <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> the spatial variants should be estimated by the nearby spatial points but also the <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> the time variants should be approximated by the weighted time <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> nearby points, according to the <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> gray levels {{between them and the}} consideration point. Since the time <b>differences</b> <b>of</b> nearby points using NAD can find more points with similar gray levels which form a curve belt for the center pixel on a curve edge, TSNAD can provide satisfied smoothing results while preserving curve edges. The experiments for digital images also show us the ability of TSNAD to preserve curve edges...|$|R
