Methods: This is a prospective, single-blinded, and split-face study on patients who underwent bilateral upper eyelid blepharoplasty. Two weeks after surgery, one eye of each subject was randomized to receive Lumière Bio-Restorative <b>Eye</b> <b>Cream</b> on one eyelid incision for 12 weeks and no treatment on the other eyelid. Subjects returned at the postoperative weeks 6, 10, and 14. At each visit, patients and the investigator (who was blinded to the treated eyelid) evaluated the scar through specified questionnaires. Results: A total of 20 subjects {{with a mean age}} of 66. 3 ± 9. 2 years completed the study. Minor side effects were noted in three subjects. At all-time points, all subjects thought eyelids treated with Lumière had a better scar and overall appearance than fellow eyelids (P< 0. 5); and 60 % of patients strongly encouraged others to use the product. The investigator assessment of erythema and pigmentation revealed less erythema and pigmentation in treated eyes at the weeks 6 and 10, although the difference was statistically insignificant. Investigator assessment also revealed a better scar appearance at week 10 in treated eyes (P= 0. 04). All evaluation parameters were similar in both eyes at the last visit.

5000|$|Moisturizers are creams or lotions that hydrate {{the skin}} and help it to retain moisture; they may contain {{essential}} oils, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain {{a small amount of}} foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes.

40|$|Introduction:In Avon’s Australian “Summer Beauty” {{catalogue}} for 2004, {{the following}} sentence {{is used to}} describe Anew Pure 02 Oxygenating Cream: “Rejuvi-cell Complex makes surface skin cells appear to act younger. ” Another advertisement in the same catalogue describes a product – Hydrofirming Bio 6 <b>Eye</b> <b>Cream</b> – using language that gives rise to similar questions: “’Smart-sensing’ technology re-programmes the skin and trains it to moisturise itself. ” This paper proceeds from {{an analysis of the}} rhetoric of these advertisements, to a discussion of the wider cultural implications of such rhetoric. Bernadette Wegenstein argues, in Getting Under the Skin, that recent representations of the face in advertising media have shifted their emphasis from the face as locus of identity and over-coding, to the skin and organs, which take over from the face as “windows to the soul. ” For Wegenstein, any organ or body part can now act as surface, and can give access to an imagined interior. While it would appear that Avon’s advertisements could fit within this model, a number of questions remain: What does it mean that the face is superseded by the skin, which is then deemed to be programmable and artificial? How does this technologization of the face and skin relate to notions of the cyborg and post-human “subject,” and to post-structuralist celebrations of fluid and changing “identities”? And, crucially, what is the interest of capitalist enterprise in producing such a subject? [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) is a leguminous crop {{that many}} {{around the world}} rely on to meet their basic {{nutritional}} needs through the consumption of the protein and fiber rich grain and vegetative matter. Water and soil fertility stress affect this crop like many other crops; by reducing biomass and grain yield. Genotypes of cowpea have been identified that possess genes that confer tolerance to drought and resistance to interveinal chlorosis (IC) due to micronutrient deficiency. In order to map the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits, a recombinant inbred line population (RIL) was created from the parental genotypes ?IT 98 K- 476 - 8 ? and ?Golden <b>Eye</b> <b>Cream?</b> (GEC). This population was phenotyped for vegetative and yield traits and leaf chlorosis. The vegetative and yield data was used to calculate a drought susceptibility index (DSI) {{that was used in}} QTL mapping. The population was genotyped by restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and a linkage map spanning 1, 084 cM was constructed from 4, 154 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Mapping for additive QTL identified 78 QTL that met a LOD threshold of three and 13 QTL that met the permuted LOD threshold for various traits and one DSI. Epistatic mapping resulted in 95 QTL involved in digenic interactions. From correlative statistics and co-localizations of QTL, it can be concluded that many of the traits mapped here are regulated by the same genes and that there are pleiotropic tradeoffs between some traits...|$|E

Understanding the likelihood of bacterial survival in eye creams begins with sensitive and accurate methods {{for the detection of}} bacterial contamination; therefore, we investigated optimal culture conditions, including neutralizers, dilution broths, and selective media for the detection of Bacillus in <b>eye</b> <b>cream.</b> Samples of three different brands of eye creams were first mixed with Tween 80, Tween 20, or a blend of Tween 60 and Span 80, then neutralized and non-neutralized samples were individually inoculated with B. cereus strains, B. mycoides, a mislabeled B. megaterium, B. subtilis or B. thuringiensis at a final concentration of 5 log CFU/g. The inoculated samples, with and without neutralizers, were spiral-plated and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h to 48 h. Presumptive colonies of Bacillus were enumerated on U. S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA-BAM) referenced agars Bacillus cereus rapid agar (BACARA) and mannitol-egg yolk-polymixin agar (MYP). Our results show significant differences among the neutralizers, plates, and products. The combination of Tryptone- Azolectin-Tween and Tween 80 (TAT and T 80) produced higher levels of Bacillus, estimated at 4. 18 log CFU/g compared to growth on Modified letheen broth and Tween 80, which produced 3. 97 log CFU/g (P < 0. 05). Colony counts of B. cereus cells on MYP agar were significantly higher, than those on BACARA agar, showing an average of 4. 25 log CFU/g versus 3. 84 log CFU/g, respectively (P < 0. 05).

This study investigates the effects of an antiaging skin care system containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) in conjunction with vitamins B 3, C, and E on the biomechanical parameters of facial skin. Methods: Fifty two volunteers followed an antiaging skin care regimen comprising of cleanser, <b>eye</b> <b>cream,</b> day moisturizer, and night moisturizer for 21 days. Wrinkle depth (Ry) and skin roughness (Ra) were measured by skin surface profilometry of the crow&# 39;s feet area, and skin elasticity parameters R 2 (gross elasticity), R 5 (net elasticity), R 6 (viscoelastic portion), and R 7 (recovery after deformation) were determined for facial skin by cutometer, preapplication and after 7, 14, and 21 days. Volunteers also completed a self-assessment questionnaire. Results: Compared to baseline, Ry and Ra significantly improved by 32. 5 % (P< 0. 0001) and 42. 9 % (P< 0. 0001), respectively, after 21 days of antiaging skin care treatment. These results were observed by the volunteers with 9 out of 10 discerning an improvement in skin texture and smoothness. Compared to baseline, R 2 and R 5 significantly increased by 15. 2 % (P< 0. 0001) and 12. 5 % (P= 0. 0449), respectively, while R 6 significantly decreased by 17. 7 % (P< 0. 0001) after 21 days.

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) {{is a major}} food legume across Sub- Saharan West Africa {{where its}} leaves, pods and seeds are {{consumed}} as food and its residues are fed to livestock as protein rich fodder. However, soils of West Africa are poor in phosphorus (P), a soil macro-nutrient all crops need for growth. Fertilizer with P is not readily available and is too expensive for West African farmers. This research was therefore, undertaken to identify cowpea lines that inherently grow well in P-deficient soils {{and use them to}} breed improved cowpea varieties that require less phosphorus fertilization. A hydroponic phenotypic screening method with silica sand was used to identify cowpea varieties that have tolerance to low soil P as measured by shoot dry biomass production. Both tolerant and susceptible varieties from the screen were further analyzed for root biomass, internal shoot P content, and internal root P content. Seed P, particularly the effect of cotyledon P, and total root production were investigated as physiological sources of tolerance. Tolerant cowpea varieties were crossed with susceptible varieties, and the resulting F_(1), F_(2) and BC_(1) seeds were screened to determine the inheritance and genetic control of tolerance. A Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population of a tolerant by susceptible cross was mapped using SSR markers to identify linkage groups or QTL for tolerance to low soil P. Phenotypic screening results identified four cowpea varieties to have P-deficiency tolerance (Big John, IT 97 K- 1069 - 6, IT 98 K- 476 - 8, and TX 2028 - 1 - 3 - 1) and three cowpea varieties (Big John, CB- 46, and Golden <b>Eye</b> <b>Cream)</b> to have partial P-deficiency tolerance via high seed P content. All varieties experienced increases in root production under low P treatments relative to normal P treatments. Phenotyping of F_(1), F_(2), and BC_(1) populations showed that low P tolerance is a heritable trait in cowpea with significant additive effects and narrow-sense heritability. Estimates of gene number suggested the tolerance to be a single-gene trait. Mapping linkage groups or QTL for low P tolerance identified QTL in which three SSR markers ? CLM 0269, 221 / 222, and CLM 0298 ? were significantly associated with tolerance and are potential candidates for marker-assisted selection (MAS) ...|$|E
