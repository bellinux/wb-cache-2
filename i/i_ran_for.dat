2500|$|Davidson {{joined the}} Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1934 after meeting J.S. Woodsworth. She remarked about him, [...] "He had a burning fire {{of love for}} people.

She ran for the CCF in the 1953 federal election in the riding of York East coming third behind Robert McGregor. She also ran provincially in the 1955 Ontario election against Hollis Beckett, again with a poor showing. In 1971 she recalled this period of involvement with the CCF. She said, [...] "I'm not a partisan politician at all... <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> the CCF 15 or 16 {{years ago when the}} CCF had fallen on very stony places. I don't know why I ran. I had no thought of winning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sharpton has run unsuccessfully for {{elected office}} on {{multiple}} occasions. Of his unsuccessful runs, {{he said that}} winning office {{may not have been}} his goal, saying in an interview: [...] "Much of the media criticism of me assumes their goals and they impose them on me. Well, those might not be my goals. So they will say, 'Well, Sharpton has not won a political office.' But that might not be my goal! Maybe <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> political office to change the debate, or to raise the social justice question." [...] Sharpton ran for a United States Senate seat from New York in 1988, 1992, and 1994. In 1997, he ran for Mayor of New York City. During his 1992 bid, he and his wife lived in a home in Englewood, New Jersey, though he said his residence was an apartment in Brooklyn.|$|E

2500|$|On November 22, President Barack Obama was {{interrupted}} at {{a speech in}} New Hampshire {{by a group of}} Occupy Wall Street protesters who attempted to chant slogans during the speech; the protesters later delivered a paper message to the press, which read, [...] "Mr. President: Over 4,000 peaceful protesters have been arrested while bankers continue to destroy the economy. You must stop the assault on our First Amendment rights. Your silence sends a message that police brutality is acceptable. Banks got bailed out. We got sold out." [...] The crowd quickly drowned the protesters out with chants of “Obama!” Obama then responded, [...] "I appreciate you guys making your point. Let me go ahead and make mine." [...] Later in the speech, Obama said, “Families like yours, young people like the ones here today— including the ones who were just chanting at me— you’re the reason that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> office in the first place.” ...|$|E

"Once," [...] {{said the}} Major, {{from behind the}} morning paper, [...] "I was in politics, meself. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> coroner an' got two whole votes--me own an' the undertaker's.

6000|$|... "I {{gave one}} desperate {{bound to the}} right, and, my lame leg notwithstanding, I believe that few men {{could have made a}} better jump.

6000|$|... "Reddy, I {{wish the}} bullet that hit Shane to-day had hit me instead.... You needn't look like that. I mean it.

6000|$|... "Stop here," [...] said I; [...] "you {{are safe}} here"; and I started off at once for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the {{landlord}} had {{a horse and}} dog cart. <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> <b>for</b> I perceived {{that in a moment}} everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware {{of what was going on}} behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{closed the}} yard door. Then I locked the other door, {{and put the}} key in my pocket. After that I roused the servant, and {{sent him to the}} constable--who lived near to us--while <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> the doctor, whose house was {{at the other end of}} our village. The doctor sent his groom, on horseback, to the police-office in the town.

60|$|Five {{seconds later}} {{we were in}} the yard and locking and barring the door behind us. Then, {{snatching}} the saddle-bags of ammunition from the horses, we left them standing there, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> the back entrance of the house, bidding Hans rouse the natives, who slept in the outbuildings, and follow with them. If any one of them showed signs of treachery he was to shoot him at once. I remember that as I went I tore the spear out of the stallion's flank and brought it away with me.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was that}} very night, too, I sat with Cowan, who had duty {{in one of}} the sentry boxes, and we heard a voice calling softly under us. Fearing treachery, Cowan cried out for a sign.

Cowan let the man in, while <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> the captain, and in five minutes it seemed as if every man and woman and child in the fort were awake and {{crowding}} around the man by the gates, their eager faces reddened by the smoking pine knots. Where was Clark? What had he been doing? Had he deserted them? ...|$|E

He's not been at home, ma'am, since you--you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am, I telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came--I hope I didn't do wrong--and he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am. So I didn't know what to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's {{exactly what}} I can't tell. He {{took her out}} to the fountain; she was quite like a dead thing. Water wouldn't make her come to, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> some salts; I wouldn't call anybody, for it was too romantic a {{condition}} to have Owen discovered in, with a fainting maiden in his arms. Such a rummage as I had. My own things are all jumbled up, I don't know how, and Rashe keeps nothing bigger than globules, only fit for fainting lady-birds, so I went to Lolly's, but her bottles have all gold heads, and are full of uncanny-looking compounds, and I made a raid at last on Sweet Honey's rational old dressing-case, poked out her keys from her pocket, and got in; wasting interminable time. Well, when I got back to my fainting damsel, non est inventus.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know--back to that cave, I suppose. We {{were out}} looking for some trace of--ahem--of Tom and Sam, when I became {{separated}} from the others. Then, in trying to find {{my way back to}} the cave, I fell in with a big black bear. The ugly creature came after me, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> my life, through the brushwood and the snow, until I came to a cliff. I fell over this, landed on an icy slope, and rolled and rolled until I struck the river. Then I got up and tried {{to get back to the}} cave, but it was out of the question. I found an opening in the cliff, on going back, and remained there until morning, when that bear, or another like him, roused me and caused me another roll down to the river." ...|$|E
5000|$|On July 25, 2011, Ross {{announced}} that he would retire from Congress at the end of 2012.

But I do know if I was re-elected to the U.S. Congress next year, my term in the Congress would overlap with the Governor's race.
