40|$|To {{be certain}} that a {{candidate}} sensor system will perform as expected during missions, we have developed a field test system and have executed test flights with a <b>helicopter-mounted</b> <b>sensor</b> platform over desert terrains, which simulate Lunar features. A key advantage to {{this approach is that}} different sensors can be tested and characterized in an environment relevant to the flight needs prior to flight. Testing the various sensors required the development of a field test system, including an instrument to validate the truth of the sensor system under test. The field test system was designed to be flexible enough to cover the test needs of many sensors (lidar, radar, cameras) that require an aerial test platform, including helicopters, airplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or balloons. To validate the performance of the sensor under test, the dynamics of the test platform must be known with sufficient accuracy to provide accurate models for input into algorithm development. The test system provides support equipment to measure the dynamics of the field test sensor platform, and allow computation of the truth position, velocity, attitude, and time...|$|E
