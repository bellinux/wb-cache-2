I did {{grow up in a}} small town, I wanted to get out, I felt like there was something... not better for me, but something different for me. I didn't feel like <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> in at school. Whether you are a DJ, or if you work with computers, or if you're a teacher, everyone has that point where they feel, 'I'm bored and this isn't what I wanted to do with my life.' ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Jim DeRogatis {{describes}} Vedder's vocals as a [...] "Jim Morrison-like vocal growl." [...] Greg Prato of AllMusic said, [...] "With his hard-hitting {{and often}} confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also {{became one of}} the most copied lead singers in all of rock." [...] Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", [...] "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", [...] "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, [...] "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> into all that." ...|$|E
500|$|Walker {{released}} his self-titled debut album in 1993 under Stroud's production. Its first single was [...] "What's It to You;" [...] written by Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright, this song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its followup [...] "Live Until I Die" [...] (which Walker wrote), was released {{late in the}} year and became his second consecutive No. 1 in early 1994. After those two singles came the number 11 [...] "Where Do <b>I</b> <b>Fit</b> in the Picture", which was originally the B-side of [...] "What's It to You." [...] The album accounted for a third No. 1 hit in [...] "Dreaming with My Eyes Open", a song that was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1994 film The Thing Called Love. An additional cut from the album, [...] "White Palace," [...] charted at number 67 on the country charts without being released as a single.|$|E

She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E
500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> my skin, I knew what I was here to do", Strickland said.|$|E
2500|$|Gossard {{is known}} for his hard rhythm style of playing, and his sense of beat and groove. His major {{influences}} are said to be Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Jimi Hendrix, and Van Halen, as well as funk and rap. Gossard is known to use a Fender Telecaster, a Fender Stratocaster and a Gibson Les Paul. He once said of himself: [...] "I like rhythmic things that butt up against each other in a cool kind of way." [...] Vedder has been quoted as saying that it is extremely difficult to collaborate with Gossard, as he outright refuses to work on anything remotely like anything he's done before. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, [...] "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> into all that." ...|$|E

2500|$|When she was 15, {{her parents}} separated, and her mother, {{supportive}} of her daughter's desire to act, moved {{with her to}} Los Angeles, where they lived out of their car until Swank's mother saved enough money to rent an apartment. Swank has called her mother the inspiration for her acting career and her life. In California, Swank enrolled in South Pasadena High School, later dropping out because of her ADHD and lack of interest. She described her time at South Pasadena High School, [...] "I felt like such an outsider. I didn't feel like <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> in. I didn't belong in any way. I didn't even feel like the teachers wanted me there. I just felt like I wasn't seen or understood." [...] She explained that she became an actor because she felt an outsider, [...] "As a kid I felt that I belonged only when I read a book or saw a movie, and could get involved with a character. It was natural that I became an actor because I longed {{so much to be}} those other people, or at least to play them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{best known}} as a vocalist, Vedder also plays guitar on many Pearl Jam songs, {{beginning}} with the Vs. songs [...] "Rearviewmirror" [...] and [...] "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town". When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, [...] "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> into all that." [...] Vedder's guitar playing helped the band's sound progress toward a more stripped-down style; the songs [...] "Rearviewmirror" [...] and [...] "Corduroy" [...] (from Vitalogy) feature Vedder's raw, punk-influenced guitar playing. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, [...] "I felt that with more popularity, {{we were going to be}} crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes." [...] He has also contributed performances on the ukulele, harmonica, accordion, and electric sitar to various Pearl Jam recordings. In 2012 his black Fender Telecaster was featured in a painting by modern artist Karl Haglund.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say <b>I</b> <b>fit</b> in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E
