Yet this quaint dandified little man who, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to see, now limped badly, {{had been in his}} time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was born}} Rose August Wenger in Cleveland, Ohio, {{one of five}} girls to Swiss-German parents, Fred and Annie Wegner. [...] Her father had wanted a son, and {{encouraged}} {{her to be a}} tomboy. Helen saw her first Wild West show in Cleveland in the summer of 1909 and answered a Miller Brothers 101 Ranch ad for girl riders in Billboard magazine. They taught her to ride, and she performed in her first 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show in St. Louis in April 1910. [...] Said Helen: [...] "(I) was already practicing picking up a handkerchief from the ground at full gallop. When veteran riders told me I could get kicked in the head, I paid no heed. Such things might happen to others, but could never happen to me, I believed. We barnstormed all over the US and the season ended all too soon. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> when I had to go home, and could hardly wait to open in Boston in the spring of 1911." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term 'Objectivist' {{developed}} because Harriet Monroe {{insisted on}} a group name for the February 1931 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, which Monroe had allowed Zukofsky to guest edit, at Pound's urging. [...] Zukofsky recounts the occasion with Monroe in Prepositions: [...] "Harriet Monroe at the time insisted, we'd better have a title for it, call it something. I said, I don't want to. She insisted; so, I said, alright, if I can define it in an essay, and I used two words, sincerity and objectification, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> immediately. But it's gone down into the history books; they forgot the founder, thank heavens, and kept the terms, and, of course, I said objectivist, and they said objectivism and that makes all the difference. Well, that was pretty bad, so then I spent the next thirty years {{trying to make it}} simple." [...] It also seems that the core group did not see themselves as a coherent movement but rather as a group of individual poets with some shared approach to their art. As well as the matters covered in Zukofsky's essays, the elements of this approach included: a respect for Imagist achievement in the areas of vers libre and highly concentrated language and imagery; a rejection of the Imagists' interest in classicism and mythology; for Reznikoff, Zukofsky, Rakosi and Oppen, a shared Jewish heritage (which, for all but Oppen included an early childhood in which English was not their first language); generally left-wing, and, in the cases of Zukofsky, Rakosi, and Oppen at least, Marxist politics.|$|E
