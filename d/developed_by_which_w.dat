The trade was fairly small until the camel was introduced, with Mediterranean goods being found in pits {{as far south as}} Northern Nigeria. A profitable trade had <b>developed</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>West</b> Africans exported gold, cotton cloth, metal ornaments, and leather goods north across the trans-Saharan trade routes, in exchange for copper, horses, salt, textiles, and beads. Later, ivory, slaves, and kola nuts were also traded.|$|R

Judges who have received a minimum of training are asked to determine, by way of tactile and visual evaluations, whether each side of a shaved face is smooth or rough. By comparing the frequency of the smooth response as a function of time after the shaving process was completed, the duration of the smoothness perception and, thence, the shaving closeness provided by two shaving products can be compared. A statistical model has been <b>developed</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> these data can be analyzed...|$|R
