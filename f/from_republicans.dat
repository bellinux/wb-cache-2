5|$|In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a {{landslide}} victory for his party, securing another term {{as president and}} taking 36 seats <b>from</b> <b>Republicans</b> in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford {{to see if he}} would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful. The {{election}} {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters that April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government <b>from</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E
5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain <b>from</b> <b>Republicans.</b> As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the Republicans had to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} {{so early in the}} primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism <b>from</b> <b>Republicans,</b> as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E

25|$|Determined {{to control}} {{politics}} in the state, reduce competition <b>from</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Populists, and close blacks out of politics, in 1901 the Democrat-dominated state legislature passed a poll tax as a requirement for voting.

25|$|A plan {{developed}} in September 1862 would have relocated refugees en masse to Massachusetts and other northern states. This plan—initiated by John A. Dix {{and supported by}} Captain Wilder and Secretary of War Stanton—drew negative reactions <b>from</b> <b>Republicans</b> who wanted to avoid connecting northward black migration with the newly announced Emancipation Proclamation. Fear of competition by black workers, as well as generalized racial prejudice, made the prospect of black refugees unpalatable for Massachusetts politicians.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 {{campaign}} also {{marked the}} entry of Ralph Nader into presidential politics as a candidate.

As a result, several thousand Democrats and Republicans wrote-in Nader's name. Despite supporting mostly liberal legislation during his career as a consumer advocate, Nader received more votes <b>from</b> <b>Republicans</b> than Democrats.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000s, {{the royal}} house {{had little to}} fear <b>from</b> <b>republicans,</b> who {{generally}} limited themselves to ludic activism and writing opinion pieces. Several more republican initiatives emerged, including ProRepublica, the New Republican Fellowship, the Republican Socialists and the Republican Platform. It is unclear if these are still active. The Republican People's Party (1994–2003) partook in the 2002 general election, but failed to gain any seats. There {{has also been a}} Republican Modern Party (RmP) since 2000, though it lacks the required number of members to run in elections.|$|E
25|$|The race in Ohio's 15th {{district}} gained significant {{national attention}} {{as one of}} a handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain <b>from</b> <b>Republicans.</b> In mid-October 2006, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to Pryce's high-ranking post in the Republican leadership as well as the strong anti-Republican mood in Ohio. The 15th had long been considered the more Republican of the two districts that divide Columbus, but had become slightly less Republican as a result of the 2000 round of redistricting.|$|E

25|$|This {{legislation}} {{received more}} Congressional opposition than the 1982 amendments did, {{most of it}} <b>from</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Proponents argued {{that the lack of}} bilingual assistance hindered recently naturalized citizens from exercising their voting rights and that the country had a history of acceptance toward linguistic pluralism. Opponents argued that the Voting Rights Act was never meant to protect language minorities and that the bilingual assistance provision was a costly unfunded mandate. Opponents proposed several amendments to weaken the legislation, including limiting the extension to 5 years, requiring the federal government to pay for the bilingual voting materials, and completely removing the bilingual provisions. These amendments failed, and Congress passed the legislation with mostly Democratic support; the House passed it by a 237-125 vote, and the Senate passed it by a 75-20 vote. President George H. W. Bush signed the legislation on August 26, 1992.|$|E
25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him <b>from</b> <b>Republicans</b> and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|While much of {{the debate}} focused on the law's precise language, there was {{considerable}} opposition in the Senate, almost entirely <b>from</b> <b>Republicans</b> like Henry Cabot Lodge and Hiram Johnson, the former speaking in defense of free speech and the latter assailing the administration for failing to use the laws already in place. Former President Theodore Roosevelt voiced opposition as well. President Wilson and his Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory viewed the bill as a political compromise. They hoped to avoid hearings that would embarrass the administration for its failure to prosecute offensive speech. They also feared other proposals that would have withdrawn prosecutorial authority from the Justice Department {{and placed it in}} the War Department, creating a sort of civilian court-martial process of questionable constitutionality. The final vote for passage was 48 to 26 in the Senate and 293 to 1 in the House of Representatives, with the sole dissenting vote in the House cast by Meyer London of New York.|$|E
