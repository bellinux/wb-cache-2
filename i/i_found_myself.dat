25|$|Soon <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> on {{the main}} bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|The {{morning that}} his {{resignation}} took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said {{farewell to the}} White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, “As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> thinking not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?” At Andrews, {{he and his family}} boarded Air Force One to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.|$|E

25|$|But in 1951 <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{in serious}} difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

Even so, I had never wanted Emmett to be a martyr. I only wanted him to be a good son. Although I realized all the great things that had been accomplished largely because of the sacrifices made by so many people, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> wishing that somehow we could have done it another way." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] a nicely worked-out story and strong, integrated gags. He added [...] "it's a particularly well-crafted entry." [...] C. S. Strowbridge of The Numbers said [...] "There {{are a number}} of funny gags on this double-length short, but it feels padded. It's also heavy-handed. I do like that they have a message to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where my boys just burst out laughing. Even <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> laughing at times." ...|$|E

500|$|In April, Diplo told The Huffington Post that he {{had reached}} an {{agreement}} to clear the samples. However, in an August interview with Pitchfork, Baauer {{said that he has}} not made any money from the song, despite Diplo's reported agreement: [...] "I'm meeting with my lawyer ... so I'm gonna find that out. I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my fucking bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up , I didn’t even know who it was who did that I knew the Jayson Musson [...] So <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> in that fucking pickle. Legal letters and shit. Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "City of Angels" [...] is a synthrock {{song with}} {{influences}} and elements from experimental music. It opens with an instrumental section and [...] "gently burbling" [...] synthesizers. It follows {{with the sounds}} of drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, [...] "Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> in the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming [...] "I am home". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited [...] "City of Angels" [...] as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a [...] "pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop".|$|E
500|$|Hosseini {{disclosed}} {{that in some}} ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly because when he penned The Kite Runner, [...] "no one was waiting for it." [...] He also found his second novel to be more [...] "ambitious" [...] than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, [...] "As I began to write, as the story picked up pace and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> immersed {{in the world of}} Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and enabled me to tune out the background noise and get on with the business of inhabiting the world I was creating." [...] The characters [...] "took on a life of their own" [...] at this point and [...] "became very real for [...] ".|$|E

500|$|ComputerAndVideoGames.com was {{enthusiastic}} {{over the}} graphics, calling them [...] "gorgeous". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, however. GamePro {{felt that the}} graphics were only [...] "a fair bit prettier" [...] {{than those of the}} Game Boy color games; GameZone said that the games [...] "still [...] the simple animations and basic character designs that were created for the original, color-less Game Boy". IGN and 1UP.com noted that the graphics had received only a minor upgrade, and Eurogamer felt that the graphics had been upgraded to a [...] "functional level at best". The audio was generally well-received: GameZone and GameSpot both felt the audio was catchy; GameZone gave the audio an 8 out of 10 score, saying that while the music [...] "was annoying at times, [...] it's also very good. [...] <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> humming the music when I wasn't playing". Other complaints included the removal of the time system of Gold and Silver and the inability to import Pokémon from the games of previous generations.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles {{broke up}} in 1970, McCartney {{continued}} his musical career {{with his first}} solo release, McCartney, a US number-one album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, McCartney is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram. A UK number one and a US top five, Ram included the co-written US number-one hit single [...] "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney {{had this to say}} on the group's formation: [...] "Wings were always a difficult idea... any group having to follow [...] success would have a hard job... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping." [...] In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.|$|E
500|$|Other Scientology {{accounts}} {{present a}} different perspective. A 1959 biography describes Hubbard as [...] "never noted {{for being in}} class" [...] and says that he [...] "thoroughly detest his subjects." [...] He attributed his choice of course to his father, having [...] "decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics and so <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> obediently studying." [...] In a 1953 lecture, {{he said that he}} was [...] "forced into engineering, mathematics, majoring in nuclear physics– very antipathetic to me, but there was order and there was discipline..." [...] Christiansen comments that the claims made about Hubbard's expertise and scientific knowledge are crucial to Scientology's own self-image and legitimation. Hubbard is presented as [...] "a man with an impressive amount of various theoretical as well as practical personal competences and educational qualifications." [...] Scientology traces its own origins to Hubbard's [...] "scientific" [...] methodology, which he is said to have learned while at university. Although Scientology positions itself as a religious belief, it nonetheless claims to be a true science, a [...] "technology" [...] capable of achieving precise and replicable results.|$|E

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] was {{recorded}} in 2008 at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E
500|$|In early March 2003, {{according}} to the official Nintendo website, F-Zero was delayed by two months. Via a live video conference call from Japan on July 7, 2003, co-producers Shigeru Miyamoto and Toshihiro Nagoshi, and supervisor Takaya Imamura answered questions about the two F-Zero games. There, Miyamoto announced the Japanese version of the game was finished and would soon {{be available to the}} public. Nagoshi mentioned that back at E3 2003, he was hoping that they would have that time to include a local area network (LAN) multiplayer mode, however they chose not to support this mode. The development team focused more on the game's single-player aspects, and a LAN multiplayer mode would distract greatly from it. Imamura commented that even though he worked directly on F-Zero throughout its different incarnations, this time he took a [...] "step back and was involved at kind of a producer level at looking over the game." [...] Imamura added [...] "hav worked on the F-Zero series, and seeing the results of the collaboration with Sega, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> at something of a loss as to how we can take the franchise further past F-Zero GX and AX." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} and enduring success of Cold Comfort Farm dominated {{the rest of}} Gibbons's career. Neville thought that after so singular a success {{at the start of}} her career, the rest was [...] something of an anticlimax, despite her considerable [...] industry and undoubted skills. [...] The 1985 edition of The Oxford Companion to English Literature [...] defines Gibbons solely in terms of Cold Comfort Farm; it mentions none of her other works—while providing her bêtes noires Morgan and Mary Webb with full entries. To Gibbons, Cold Comfort Farm became [...] "That Book" [...] or [...] "You-Know-What", its title never mentioned. Despite her growing irritation and expressed distaste for it, the book continued to be lauded by successive generations of critics, Boston described it as [...] "one of those rare books of comic genius that imprints itself on the brain and can never afterwards be eradicated". A more negative view of the book has been expressed by the literary critic Mary Beard, who considers it [...] "a rather controlling victory of modern order, cleanliness, contraception and medicine [...] over these messy, different, rural types... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> screaming for the rights of these poor country folk NOT to {{fall into the hands of}} people like Flora".|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a great {{pleasure}} to me to meet you. I do not remember anybody with whom <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> in so much sympathy--except one of course. It is strange to think that when we meet again I shall be a married woman." ...|$|R
