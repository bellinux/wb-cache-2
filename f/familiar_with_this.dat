25|$|Upon {{receiving}} clearance, a non-standard terminology {{was used}} by air-traffic control. As {{he did not have}} authorization to use a localizer back-course approach, the captain should have requested a different approach. Instead, the crew opted to conduct a VOR approach without informing air-traffic control. Neither pilot had carried out instrument approach and landing at runway 07R, making them less <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> than their commonly used Runway 25. Another factor was that the SAS aircraft was forced to operate at the lowest-permissible safe speeds while closing in on the Cessna.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the chaos}} caused in the Jewish world, the Rabbinic {{prohibition}} against studying Kabbalah established itself firmly within the Jewish religion. One {{of the conditions}} allowing a man to study and engage himself in the Kabbalah was {{to be at least}} forty years old. This age requirement came about during this period and is not Talmudic in origin but Rabbinic. Many Jews are <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> ruling, but are not aware of its origins. Moreover, the prohibition is not halakhic in nature. According to Moses Cordovero, halakhically, one must be of age twenty to engage in the Kabbalah. Many famous kabbalists, including the ARI, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Yehuda Ashlag, were younger than twenty when they began.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} proposed, {{originally}} in the Druidic journal Aisling that Gardner's New Forest coven was the pagan {{section of the}} Order of Woodcraft Chivalry; this order performed rituals in the New Forest in the early 1920s and its pagan section honoured a moon goddess and a horned god, and believed in ritual nakedness. One of Ronald Hutton's informants reports that Gardner was <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> order at least by the 1950s. A major difficulty with identifying this group with the New Forest coven {{is that it does}} not appear to have met in the New Forest between 1934 and 1945. Gardner records a working by the coven in the New Forest in 1940 against the projected Nazi invasion.|$|E
50|$|The {{system of}} {{academic}} degrees at the University of Oxford can be confusing to those not <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> it. <b>This</b> {{is not merely}} because many degree titles date from the Middle Ages, but also because many changes have been haphazardly introduced in recent years.

25|$|Likewise {{there are}} {{different}} versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by {{a man with a}} double-barreled shotgun, and studied the movements of birds as they were shot. In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at Prouts Neck while his neighbor Will Googins, fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore. However, Homer was already <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted Defiance, a Civil War subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 A Good Shot, Adirondacks, which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of Right and Left.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, fully {{featured}} 3-D digital planetaria have added an extra {{degree of freedom}} to a presenter giving a show because they allow simulation of the view from any point in space, not only the earth-bound view which we are most <b>familiar</b> <b>with.</b> <b>This</b> new virtual reality capability to travel through the universe provides important educational benefits because it vividly conveys that space has depth, helping audiences to leave behind the ancient misconception that the stars are stuck {{on the inside of}} a giant celestial sphere and instead to understand the true layout of the solar system and beyond. For example, a planetarium can now 'fly' the audience towards one of the familiar constellations such as Orion, revealing that the stars which appear to make up a co-ordinated shape from our earth-bound viewpoint are at vastly different distances from Earth and so not connected, except in human imagination and mythology. For especially visual or spatially aware people, this experience can be more educationally beneficial than other demonstrations.|$|E

According to GamesRadar, [...] "Ibuki makes up for her relatively weak damage by having some of the trickiest mobility in the game, letting a skilled player dash circles around their confused opponent." [...] According to Edge, Ultra Street Fighter IVs addition of delayed wakeup, which lets one stay on the floor longer after being knocked down to put an opponent off their rhythm, was [...] "primarily designed to nerf characters like Cammy, Akuma and Ibuki who are at their most effective when an opponent is getting up off the ground." [...] Professional player Sakonoko, whose preferred character in Super Street Fighter IV was Ibuki, said in interview for Famitsu that Ibuki in Street Fighter X Tekken [...] "is ultimately based on her SSFIV Arcade Edition version" [...] and so it is easy for people <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> game [...] "to jump right in."

Barihun and Yedid formulate a contemplative arrangement for this composition, which preserves its original mode. The piano silently accompanies Barihun's sobbing soprano sax, then his singing. Towards the fifth minute Yedid interprets the piece on his piano, to which Barihun joins for a penetrating duet. The composition ends with Barihun's singing, sealed with a sigh.|$|E
