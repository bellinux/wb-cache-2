60|$|The {{faces in}} the window {{look out at the}} great Sansovino--the splendid pile that is now {{occupied}} by the Prefect. I feel decidedly that I don't object as I ought to the palaces of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Their pretensions impose upon me, and the imagination peoples them more freely than it can people the interiors of the prime. Was not moreover this masterpiece of Sansovino once occupied by the Venetian post- office, and thereby intimately connected with an ineffaceable first impression of the author of these remarks? He had arrived, wondering, palpitating, twenty-three years ago, after nightfall, and, the first thing on the morrow, had repaired to the post- office for his letters. They had been waiting a long time and were full of <b>delayed</b> <b>interest,</b> and he returned with them to the gondola and floated slowly down the Canal. The mixture, the rapture, the wonderful temple of the poste restante, the beautiful strangeness, all humanised by good news--the memory of this abides with him still, so that there always proceeds from the splendid waterfront I speak of a certain secret appeal, something that seems to have been uttered first in the sonorous chambers of youth. Of course this association falls to the ground--or rather splashes into the water--if I am the victim of a confusion. Was the edifice in question twenty-three years ago the post-office, which has occupied since, for many a day, very much humbler quarters? I am afraid to take the proper steps for finding out, lest I should learn that during these years I have misdirected my emotion. A better reason for the sentiment, at any rate, is that such a great house has surely, in the high beauty of its tiers, a refinement of its own. They make one think of colosseums and aqueducts and bridges, and they constitute doubtless, in Venice, the most pardonable specimen of the imitative. I have even a timid kindness for the huge Pesaro, far down the Canal, whose main reproach, more even than the coarseness of its forms, is its swaggering size, its want of consideration for the general picture, which the early examples so reverently respect. The Pesaro is as far out of the frame as a modern hotel, and the Cornaro, close to it, oversteps almost equally the modesty of art. One more thing they and their kindred do, I must add, for which, unfortunately, we can patronise them less. They make even the most elaborate material civilisation of the present day seem woefully shrunken and bourgeois, for they simply--I allude to the biggest palaces--can't be lived in as they were intended to be. The modern tenant may take in all the magazines, but he bends not the bow of Achilles. He occupies the place, but he doesn't fill it, and he has guests from the neighbouring inns with ulsters and Baedekers. We are far at the Pesaro, by the way, from our attaching window, and we take advantage of it to go in rather a melancholy mood to the end. The long straight vista from the Foscari to the Rialto, the great middle stretch of the Canal, contains, as the phrase is, a hundred objects of interest, but it contains most the bright oddity of its general Deluge air. In all these centuries it has never got over its resemblance to a flooded city; for some reason or other it is the only part of Venice in which the houses look as if the waters had overtaken them. Everywhere else they reckon with them--have chosen them; here alone the lapping seaway seems to confess itself an accident.|$|E

5000|$|Though the fruitfulness of {{the term}} [...] "junk DNA" [...] has been {{questioned}} {{on the grounds that}} it provokes a strong a priori assumption of total non-functionality and though some have recommended using more neutral terminology such as [...] "noncoding DNA" [...] instead; [...] "junk DNA" [...] remains a label for the portions of a genome sequence for which no discernible function has been identified and that through comparative genomics analysis appear under no functional constraint suggesting that the sequence itself has provided no adaptive advantage. Since the late 70s it has become apparent that the majority of non-coding DNA in large genomes finds its origin in the selfish amplification of transposable elements, of which W. Ford Doolittle and Carmen Sapienza in 1980 wrote in the journal Nature: [...] "When a given DNA, or class of DNAs, of unproven phenotypic function can be shown to have evolved a strategy (such as transposition) which ensures its genomic survival, then no other explanation for its existence is necessary." [...] The amount of junk DNA can be expected to depend on the rate of amplification of these elements and the rate at which non-functional DNA is lost. In the same issue of Nature, Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick wrote that junk DNA has [...] "little specificity and conveys little or no selective advantage to the organism". The term occurs mainly in popular science and in a colloquial way in scientific publications, and it has been suggested that its connotations may have <b>delayed</b> <b>interest</b> in the biological functions of noncoding DNA.|$|E
40|$|The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on March 3, 2016 {{came out}} with master {{directions}} on ‘interest rate on deposits’. These directions over rule all the existing instructions on the subject and applies to all deposits accepted by banks based on the rules prescribed hitherto. In the master directions, for savings deposits, RBI has mandated that banks pay interest at quarterly or shorter intervals. Savings Bank (SB) deposits and Term deposits amount to more than Rs 90 lakh crore at present. In {{the absence of any}} regulation on interest application frequency to such deposits, till now most of the banks were paying interest on the SB deposits, that accounts for {{more than a quarter of}} the total deposit pie, at an interval of six months. Under the prevailing SB interest of 4 % per annum, the new regulation would benefit the SB depositors to the tune of Rs 500 crore or more from the next financial year. Though this is a major step in favour of the depositors, a disparity compared to loans is still left unattended. For loans taken from the banks, the interest is computed at monthly rests. In other words, if a borrower defers payment of interest by two months, the banks charge two months’ interest on the <b>delayed</b> <b>interest.</b> Though RBI has deregulated rates of interest on Term deposits, SB deposits and loan accounts, it still regulates the interest application frequency on such products, disharmoniously. The regulator provides no rationale on why interest application frequencies on deposit accounts (quarterly or shorter intervals) are different from those for loan accounts (monthly intervals), both of which are to the benefit of the banks and detrimental to the interest of the borrowers and, even more so, depositors. RBI has a responsibility to bring in standards and transparency in interest application frequency, in the interests of the depositors. RBI has also left to the banks the method that they may adopt for computing interest. Absence of regulation gives banks the freedom to decide, in a non-transparent fashion, the effective annualised returns on deposits held by them. With this, the depositors are burdened with the problem of shopping among banks for the most attractive methodology used in their interest application and computation procedures. The depositor is neither capable to make such comparisons nor aware that such matters affect his return. And depositors’ ignorance is a big asset for banks. In the annual monetary and credit policy for the year 2002 - 2003, there was a proposal that banks should provide information on deposit interest rates for various maturities along with the effective annualised yield. However, RBI neither came up with any formal directions to implement the proposal nor explained how absence of accounting standards will help the real stake holders, that is, the depositors. Unlike some of the global best practices, lack of basic accounting standards in India gives administrative convenience to banks and the regulator and thrusts responsibilities to the depositors to read between the lines. Is it not too unrealistic for the regulator to expect (i) the depositors to ask the banks to show their method of computing interest, (ii) the banks to have a comprehensive and easy to understand document for the same, and finally, (iii) the depositors to understand the method and then have the ability to compare banks? It needs to be appreciated that this is too much of expectation from depositors since there are ground level limitations. While trying to ensure that the depositors’ earnings are derived in a transparent and comprehensible manner using prudent accounting/computing standards, through this paper we attempt to reiterate the need to address the skew in the present interest computation setup that is disadvantage to the depositors.

Hence, an information model is essential in representing information appropriately to supports meaningful information spreading. As a distinction from the current network practice, the NDN shall concentrate on the content itself, rather than the location of the information itself. One important and common feature of NDN is leveraging through its built-in network caches (temporal store) to improve the communication and efficiency of content dissemination. Thus, caching is well thought-out as one of the most crucial features (especially in PIT) of the NDN. Its efficiency is due to it required feature of producing a flexible strategy in deciding what content to store and replace when the PIT overflows. Thus, PIT management in NDN continues being one of the primary concerns of high-speed forwarding. To address this issue, replacement policies, as one of the key factors for determining the effectiveness of a PIT in line with many researcher's haven to propose numerous replacement policies, i. e.

This examination is placed in relation to important facts concerning the man himself, his aesthetic theory, his literary production in general and the background of Belgium and France.

Attention is concentrated on Maeterlinck's reception by the Scandi nav. i an pub 1 i c and on which of his works were translated and published or introduced by means of the stage. In this connection the motives and principles for staging The Intruder and Pelléas and Mé 1 isande are studied. Up to 1892 Scandinavian critics regarded Maeterlinck's works as being essentially realistic. Later there was a change and the critics then began to regard and interpret him as a symbolist.

Opponents of conventional Swedish stage procedure sometimes used Maeterlinck as a positive argument for change,but on the whole the spiritual climate remained unfavourable for the author.

40|$|Responsible for {{monetary}} policy {{in one of}} the world's largest economic areas, the European Central Bank (ECB) comes under intense public scrutiny. The ECB acts on behalf of all euro area members, who have diverse traditions and differing views about the conduct of {{monetary policy}}. The ECB is accountable to the European Parliament, whose overseeing role in monetary policy is recently acquired. For all these reasons, it is important to provide regular, rigorous, non-partisan and pan-European analysis of monetary policy in the euro area. Monitoring the European Central Bank I (MECB) addresses this need. Written by a team of distinguished academic economists, known internationally for their work in this field, each year MECB produces a spring report and an autumn update. In 2001 the ECB faced a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook, both globally and in the euro area. MECB 4 describes the challenge for monetary policy and assesses the ECB response. Interest rates fell much less in the euro area than in the US. It is often argued that the ECB cut interest rates both too little and too late. Does this stand up to serious scrutiny? Or should we infer instead that the Fed responded too vigorously, or that the extent of the problem was simply larger in the US? The principal conclusion of MECB 4 is that the problem was larger in the US. There is some evidence that the ECB was slow to cut interest rates, but that by late 2001 it had made up lost ground. A Fed-in-Frankfurt would not have cut interest rates more, but might have cut them earlier. Given adverse supply shocks in 2000, the ECB sensibly let inflation exceed its target. When demand projections then declined sharply in 2001, the ECB probably {{had little choice but to}} <b>delay</b> <b>interest</b> rate cuts until actual inflation was seen to have peaked. With a longer track record of success, and greater clarity about how its decisions are made, it may one day be able to act more decisively in advance of events. Two changes would enhance clarity. First, the monetary pillar looks increasingly ridiculous, giving perverse signals that the ECB probably ignores. It needs demolition, not cosmetic improvement. Second, having sometimes, but not usually, coordinated its monetary decisions with other central banks, the ECB should now spell out when coordination is appropriate and when it is not. ...|$|R

Inflation during 1977 to 1981 was 46 percent, according to Canada's Consumer Price index. In addition interest rates were running at 20 percent. Improper choice of equipment and a six-month labour stoppage of electrical workers also yielded some of these costs and delays. Discussion of who is to blame for the costs and subsequent debts associated with Darlington often arise during provincial election campaigns, and are often mentioned in anti-nuclear literature.|$|R
40|$|We present here {{a system}} with {{collection}} of random walks relaying a signal in one dimension {{in the presence of}} <b>delays.</b> We are <b>interested</b> in the time for a signal to travel from one end (start) to the other end (finish) of the lined group of random walkers. The delay is introduced at the point when the signal is transferred from each walker to the next one. It is found that there is an optimal number of walkers for the signal to travel fastest when delays are present. We discuss implications of this model and associated behaviors to physical and biological systems.
