50|$|A {{sighting}} telescope (A-B), {{three or four}} feet long, was mounted along {{one side of the}} instrument. A horizon mirror was fixed at a 45° angle in front of the telescope's objective lens (G). This mirror was small enough to allow the observer to see the image in the mirror on one side and to see directly ahead on the other. The index arm (C-D) held an index mirror (H), also at 45° {{to the edge of the}} index arm. The reflective sides of the two mirrors nominally faced each other, so that the image seen in the first mirror is that reflected from the second.With the two mirrors parallel, the index reads 0°. The view through the telescope sees directly ahead on one side and the view from the mirror G sees the same image reflected from mirror H (see detail drawing to the right). When the index arm is moved from zero to a large value, the index mirror reflects an image that is in a direction away from the direct line of sight. As the index arm movement increases, the line of sight for the index mirror moves toward S (to the right in the <b>detail</b> <b>image).</b> This shows a slight deficiency with this mirror arrangement. The horizon mirror will block the view of the index mirror at angles approaching 90°.|$|E

First, each ear image was decomposed into four sub-images by wavelet transformation,the four sub-images were low frequency image, vertical detail image,horizontal <b>detail</b> <b>image</b> and high frequency image. Then the low frequency image was decomposed into four sub-images, the four-images were weighted by different coefficients, then,the four sub-images were reconstructed into a image. On this basis,the feature was extraction by the BDPCA method,and then we use the k-Nearest Neighbor Classification to recognition.

40|$|In {{progressive}} image transmission (PIT) {{the image is}} transmitted progressively i. e. the low <b>detail</b> <b>image</b> is transmitted as first followed by transmission of detail signals. In our contribution we consider interactivity in the PIT. For example, the observer could specify image regions of highest interest (ROI). In this case, the image transmission should be optimised {{with respect to the}} ROI. The definition of objective criterion for interactive PIT is made in this paper as first. The spatial signal decomposition is derived with respect to this criterion. Wavelet transform of spatial components is used. At the end demonstration of proposed algorithm is made...|$|E
40|$|Tone mapping {{can be used}} to {{compress}} the dynamic range of the image data such that it can be fitted within the range of the reproduction media and human vision. The original infrared images that captured with infrared focal plane arrays (IFPA) are high dynamic images, so tone mapping infrared images is an important component in the infrared imaging systems, and it has become an active topic in recent years. In this paper, we present a tone mapping framework using multi-scale retinex. Firstly, a Conditional Gaussian Filter (CGF) was designed to suppress "halo" effect. Secondly, original infrared image is decomposed into a set of images that represent the mean of the image at different spatial resolutions by applying CGF of different scale. And then, a set of images that represent the multi-scale details of original image is produced by dividing the original image pointwise by the decomposed image. Thirdly, the final <b>detail</b> <b>image</b> is reconstructed by weighted sum of the multi-scale detail images together. Finally, histogram scaling and clipping is adopted to remove outliers and scale the <b>detail</b> <b>image,</b> 0. 1 % of the pixels are clipped at both extremities of the histogram. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently increases the local contrast while preventing "halo" effect and provides a good rendition of visual effect.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose to}} design the {{reduction}} operator of an image pyramid so as to minimize the approximation error in the-sense (not restricted to the usual = 2), where can take noninteger values. The underlying image model is specified using shiftinvariant basis functions, such as B-splines.

40|$|Multispectral IR imaging {{techniques}} are frequently deployed in maritime operations, for instance to detect floating mines or to find small dinghies and swimmers during {{search and rescue}} operations. However, maritime backgrounds usually contain {{a large amount of}} clutter that severely hampers the detection of dim point targets. Here we present a simple algorithm that deploys the correlation between target signatures in two different (3 - 5 and 8 - 12 mum) IR frequency bands {{to reduce the amount of}} clutter. First, both individual IR bands are filtered with a morphological opening top-hat transform to extract small details. Second, the resulting detail images are thresholded to produce binary detail images, representing potential target areas. Third, a fused <b>detail</b> <b>image</b> is obtained by taking the intersection (logical AND) of both binary IR detail images. Details that appear in both IR bands remain in this fused <b>detail</b> <b>image,</b> whereas a large fraction of uncorrelated noise details is filtered out. Remaining noise details can be removed by taking into account the temporal characteristics of the target signatures and by using a priori knowledge of structure of the scene and the size of potential targets. The method is tested on two image sequences showing a maritime scene with three kayaks approaching from far away. The scenario was registered in the 3 - 5 mum and 8 - 12 mum IR frequency bands, and in the visual range. The results show that the proposed multispectral processing technique has the potential to improve the detection of dim point targets in cluttered maritime backgrounds...|$|E
