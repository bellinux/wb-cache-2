5|$|By 1939, it {{was clear}} that war was looming, and the team began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E

Throughout each stage is a number of checkpoints; if the player gets hit by {{obstacles}} too many times, they have to restart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> checkpoint. Each stage ends with Pepsiman being chased by an object, including a giant Pepsi can. In between stages, the player is shown videos of an American man drinking Pepsi and eating chips and pizza while watching television.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish {{locality}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares {{a number of}} unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also.

5|$|The A. sp. is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco {{region in}} the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A study shows that the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, {{although}} a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near {{the coast of the}} Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have distributary channels of sand and terrigenous material.|$|E

The Razorbacks' highest draft {{position}} was second overall in 1954, when Lamar McHan was selected by the Chicago Cardinals. Arkansas' first drafted player in the NFL was Jack Robbins, who was the fifth overall pick by the Chicago Cardinals in 1938. Five former players were selected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> NFL draft: Trey Flowers, Martrell Spaight, Tevin Mitchel, Darius Philon, and A.J. Derby.|$|E
5|$|In England {{he met the}} King {{on several}} {{occasions}} and dined {{with a number of}} influential British politicians, including William Pitt, Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794. Unfortunately, he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> French advance. In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father's policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November. On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz, a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Kaunitz. The marriage was arranged by Metternich's mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the father of the bride, Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive. Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.|$|E

25|$|Both {{specimens}} of Abrictosaurus {{are housed in}} the collection of University College London. The holotype specimen was discovered in Lesotho and consists of a partial skull and skeleton (UCL B54). Paleontologist Richard Thulborn, who first described the specimen in 1974, considered it a new species of Lycorhinus and named it L. consors, using the Latin word consors which means 'companion' or 'spouse'. As UCL B54 lacked the caniniforms which had been found in the type species, Lycorhinus angustidens, Thulborn believed it to be female. Neither the skull nor the skeletons of Abrictosaurus have been fully described in the literature. A tooth <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> Triassic of Switzerland has been assigned to Abrictosaurus sp., but this has not been supported, as the specimen does not have unique characteristics of Abrictosaurus, heterodontosaurids, or ornithischians in general.|$|E

The queen advised him not to return to the upcountry without having first raised a substantial army for much of the country was in revolt, and to avoid the Prome route for she believed Thihathu, the viceroy of Prome, was not trustworthy. The king discarded her advice on both counts. He replied that he would raise an army at Prome with the help of his son Thihathu. The royal family sailed up the Irrawaddy with a small group of guards.|$|E
