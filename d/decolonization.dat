5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{negotiate}} a settlement to the dispute over East Timor's future, the Portuguese <b>Decolonization</b> Commission convened a conference in June 1975 in Macau.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{remained}} uninhabited and undisturbed through World War II and afterwards. It remained under British jurisdiction, repossessed by the British Western Pacific High Commission in 1943 and governed {{as part of}} the Central and Southern Line Islands. In January 1972, the Central and Southern Line Islands, including Caroline, {{were joined}} with the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, which had become autonomous in 1971 as part of British <b>decolonization</b> efforts.|$|E
5|$|East Timor's <b>decolonization</b> due to {{political}} instability in Portugal saw Indonesia posture to annex {{the new state}} in 1975. Just hours before the Indonesian invasion of East Timor (now Timor Leste) on December 7, 1975, Ford and Kissinger had visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta and guaranteed American compliance with the Indonesian operation. Suharto had been a key supporter of American influence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia and Ford did not desire to place pressure on the American-Indonesian relationship.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as <b>decolonization</b> gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} decade, Tzara lent his support to political causes. Pursuing {{his interest in}} primitivism, he became {{a critic of the}} Fourth Republic's colonial policy, and joined his voice to those who supported <b>decolonization.</b> Nevertheless, he was appointed cultural ambassador of the Republic by the Paul Ramadier cabinet. He also participated in the PCF-organized Congress of Writers, but, unlike Éluard and Aragon, again avoided adapting his style to socialist realism.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for <b>Decolonization</b> was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{was drafted}} {{at a conference}} between April–June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the {{conclusion}} of the conference; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread <b>decolonization</b> in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.|$|E
5|$|The {{news agency}} {{was founded in}} 1937, when the country was still a colony in the Dutch Empire, by {{independence}} activists dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} local coverage by the Dutch-owned Aneta news agency. Antara's operation was absorbed into the Dōmei Tsushin news network following invasion by the Japanese in 1942. Its staff {{played a key role in}} the broadcast of Indonesia's proclamation of independence and assumed control of the Dōmei facilities in the region at the end of the war. The agency remained under private management until it was placed under the control of the presidency in the 1960s when the government shifted its focus from <b>decolonization</b> to nation-building. Antara became an institution through which the state could promote its policies.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spread}} of <b>decolonization</b> in the 1960s, the organization's {{membership}} saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa. On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but {{with the support of}} many Third World nations, the mainland, communist People's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization. Third World nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN. In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991, shortly {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E

25|$|There {{was little}} {{resistance}} {{from the international community}} to Indonesia's invasion. Although Portugal was undergoing an energetic <b>decolonization</b> process, Portugal failed to involve the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>decolonization</b> of the Americas was {{the process}} by which the {{countries}} in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. <b>Decolonization</b> began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{developing}} nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations — for example, theories of <b>decolonization,</b> liberation theology, Marxism, anti-imperialism, and political economy.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1950s and the <b>decolonization</b> of West Africa, due to {{the very}} limited travel of native Africans outside their own ethnic group, the djembe was known only in its {{original}} area.|$|E
25|$|Since 1986, the United Nations Committee on <b>Decolonization</b> has {{included}} New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. An independence referendum was held the following year, but independence {{was rejected by}} a large majority.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the <b>decolonization</b> {{movements}} of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented {{in every part of}} Africa. <b>Decolonization</b> during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of white settlers – especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million pieds-noirs in North Africa), Kenya, Congo, Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola. Between 1975 and 1977, over a million colonials returned to Portugal alone. Nevertheless, white Africans remain an important minority in many African states, particularly Zimbabwe, Namibia, Réunion, and the Republic of South Africa. The country with the largest white African population is South Africa. Dutch and British diasporas represent the largest communities of European ancestry on the continent today.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} European {{colonialism}} have consistently drawn academic {{attention in the}} decades since <b>decolonization.</b> New theories continue to emerge. The field of colonial and postcolonial studies has been implemented as a major in multiple universities around the globe.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the United Nations after World War II resulted in the United Nations Special Committee on <b>Decolonization</b> committing to a process of decolonization; as a consequence the British colonies in the Pacific started on a path to self-determination.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian {{sovereignty}} and {{ownership of the}} Canal had been confirmed by the United States and the United Nations. In retirement Eden maintained that the military response to the crisis had prevented a much larger war in the Middle East. Israel had been expecting an Egyptian invasion in either March or April 1957, {{as well as a}} Soviet invasion of Syria. The crisis also arguably hastened the process of <b>decolonization,</b> as many of the remaining colonies of both Britain and France gained independence over the next several years. Some argued that the imposed ending to the Crisis led to over-hasty <b>decolonization</b> in Africa, increasing the chance of civil wars and military dictatorships in newly independent countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Decolonization</b> in Central and South America {{began with}} the {{revolutions}} in the 1820s, with all countries becoming independent then, except Puerto Rico and Cuba in 1898. Leaders were inspired by the American Revolution and the French Revolution of the late 18th century.|$|E
25|$|In a 1982 plebiscite, voters {{indicated}} {{interest in}} seeking commonwealth status. The island has been considering another non-binding plebiscite on <b>decolonization</b> since 1998. Governor Eddie Baza Calvo intended to include one during the island's November 2016 elections {{but it was}} delayed again.|$|E
25|$|His {{administration}} was both socialist and nationalist. Thus it funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system, and promoted a national (and pan-African) culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played {{a leading role}} in African international relations during the <b>decolonization</b> period.|$|E
25|$|She reigned {{for nearly}} 32 years. Her reign saw the <b>decolonization</b> of Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and Suriname and their {{independence}} from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Upon her death {{at the age of}} , she was the longest-lived former reigning monarch in the world.|$|E
25|$|Puerto Rico {{became an}} unincorporated {{territory}} of the United States or an American colony {{as defined by the}} United Nations <b>decolonization</b> committee after Spain ceded the island to the United States. This was in accordance with the Treaty of Paris of 1898 after the Spanish–American War.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{feminism}} is an intersectional {{theory and practice}} of feminism that focuses on <b>decolonization</b> and indigenous sovereignty. The focus is upon empowering indigenous women in the context of indigenous cultural values and priorities, rather than mainstream, white, patriarchal ones. In this cultural perspective, it can be compared to womanism in the African-American communities.|$|E
25|$|After the Carnation Revolution, on April 25, 1974, Portugal {{started its}} <b>decolonization</b> process and withdrew its {{military}} forces from its oversea territories. With {{this change in}} policy and strategy the acquisition of the Mirage III stopped being a priority and the new political regime did not continue the negotiation process.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many of the}} {{remaining}} Italians stayed during the <b>decolonization</b> process after World War II and are actually assimilated to the Eritrean society, a few are stateless today, as {{none of them were}} given citizenship unless through marriage or, more rarely, by having it conferred upon them by the State.|$|E
25|$|The era of European {{colonialism}} {{lasted from}} the 16th to 19th centuries and involved European powers vastly extending their reach {{around the globe}} by establishing colonies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The dismantling of European empires following World War II saw the process of <b>decolonization</b> begin in earnest. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill jointly released the Atlantic Charter, which broadly outlined {{the goals of the}} U.S. and British governments. One of the main clauses of the charter acknowledged the right of all people to choose their own government. The document became the foundation for the United Nations and all of its components were integrated into the UN Charter, giving the organization a mandate to pursue global <b>decolonization.</b> Despite a uniform effort by the United Nations, modern postcolonial states vary widely in terms of political and economic stability.|$|E
25|$|Two World Wars (WW1 & WW2) {{followed}} by the United Nations-mandated <b>decolonization</b> process dramatically reduced the sphere of influence of European colonial powers in the Asia-Pacific region. The Cold War fixated the attention of Europeans to the North Atlantic region, with occasional forays into sub-Saharan Africa undertaken essentially to maintain control over former colonies and protect commercial rights over raw-materials.|$|E
25|$|In healthcare, {{triclosan}} {{is used in}} surgical scrubs {{and hand}} washes. Use in surgical units is effective with a minimum contact time of approximately two minutes. More recently, showering with 2% triclosan has become a recommended regimen in surgical units for the <b>decolonization</b> of patients whose skin carries methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Triclosan is also used in the coatings for some surgical sutures.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the Commission adopted interventionism as its policy. The {{context of}} the decade was of <b>decolonization</b> of Africa and Asia, and many {{countries}} of the continent pressed for a more active UN policy on human rights issues, {{especially in light of}} massive violations in apartheid South Africa. The new policy meant that the Commission would also investigate and produce reports on violations.|$|E
25|$|The {{seemingly}} intractable {{nature of}} Africa's poverty {{has led to}} debate concerning its root causes. Endemic warfare and unrest, widespread corruption, and despotic regimes are both causes and effects of the continued economic problems. The <b>decolonization</b> of Africa was fraught with instability aggravated by cold war conflict. Since the mid-20th century, the Cold War and increased corruption and despotism have also contributed to Africa's poor economy.|$|E
