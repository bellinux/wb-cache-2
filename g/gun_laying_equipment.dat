5000|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>laying</b> {{is a set}} {{of actions}} to align the axis of a gun barrel so that it points in the {{required}} direction. This alignment is in the horizontal and vertical planes. <b>Gun</b> <b>laying</b> may be for direct fire, where the layer sees the target, or indirect fire, where the target may not be visible from the <b>gun.</b> <b>Gun</b> <b>laying</b> has sometimes been called [...] "training the gun".|$|R
50|$|As {{there is}} no {{gyroscopic}} or similar system for independent, automated and autonomous <b>gun</b> <b>laying</b> in the DANA, the gunner of howitzer uses a ZZ-73 panoramic telescope with a PG1-M-D collimator for indirect <b>gun</b> <b>laying.</b> This sight has a horizontal scale used to set the appropriate horizontal laying via aiming at reference points. This means that the DANA is not an autonomous system {{there needs to be}} an additional device to assist in <b>gun</b> <b>laying</b> (in fact, the firing positions of such artillery systems are usually prepared before the guns are positioned there). For direct fire engagements, the gunner uses an OP5-38-D telescopic sight.|$|R

50|$|Ironically, {{the only}} two {{technicians}} with the required experience available were Butement and Pollard. The two quickly began development of two projects, the Mobile Radar Unit (MRU) which was a mobile version of Chain Home, and <b>Gun</b> <b>Laying</b> radar, a much smaller unit designed to provide range measurements against aircraft {{as an aid to}} aiming their anti-aircraft artillery. The teams had made considerable progress on both projects by the summer of 1937, with <b>Gun</b> <b>Laying</b> radar, Mk. I (GL) about to enter initial production, and the MRUs later taken over in 1938 by the RAF AMES Type 9.|$|R

50|$|The SCR-584 (short for Signal Corps Radio # 584) was an automatic-tracking {{microwave}} radar {{developed by the}} MIT Radiation Laboratory during World War II.

50|$|The {{depression}} {{range finder}} {{was a fire}} control device used to calculate firing solutions when <b>gun</b> <b>laying</b> in coastal artillery. It was necessitated {{by the introduction of}} rifled artillery from the mid-19th century onwards, which had much greater ranges than the old smoothbore weapons and were consequently more difficult to aim accurately.|$|R
50|$|In late 1940 the NRC {{received}} {{a request from}} the British Army to develop a magnetron-based <b>gun</b> <b>laying</b> radar. Coordinating with the RadLab, the two groups agreed that the Canadians would develop a simple system as quickly as possible, while the US team would be given the time to develop a more fully developed system some time later. The target dates were set for late 1942 and late 1943, respectively. A formal proposal for a SCR-268 replacement {{was made by the}} Signal Corps in January 1941, by which point the RadLab had already formed what they knew as Project 2 to develop this advanced <b>gun</b> <b>laying</b> radar. MIT proposed an advanced system with automatic search, tracking and the ability to directly aim the guns. This was a field MIT was particularly knowledgeable in due to work in their Servomechanisms Lab.|$|R

25|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>Laying</b> radar, Mark I, or GL Mk. I for short, was {{an early}} radar system {{developed}} by the British Army to provide range information to associated anti-aircraft artillery.

50|$|Even before opening, {{the founders}} {{identified}} {{the first three}} projects for the Rad Lab. In the order of priority, these were (1) a 10-cm detection system (called Airborne Intercept or AI) for fighter aircraft, (2) a 10-cm gun-aiming system (called <b>Gun</b> <b>Laying</b> or GL) for anti-aircraft batteries, and (3) a long-range airborne radio navigation system.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gun</b> <b>laying</b> means {{moving the}} {{axis of the bore}} of the barrel in two planes, {{horizontal}} and vertical. A gun is [...] "traversed" [...] - rotated in a horizontal plane - to align it with the target, and [...] "elevated" [...] - moved in the vertical plane - to range it to the target.|$|R
