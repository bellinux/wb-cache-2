The objective was to evaluate the response of clones C 219, GG 100, I 144, and I 224 of eucalypt (Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla) to glyphosate doses of 0, 18, 36, 72, 180, 360, and 720 g of acid equivalent per hectare. The clones showed different growth patterns with regard to height, leaf number, stem dry weight, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, and relative leaf growth rate. The clones I 144 and GG 100 were more susceptible to glyphosate, showing the doses required to reduce dry weight by 50 % of 113. 4 and 119. 6 g acid equivalent per hectare, respectively. The clones C 219 and I 224 were less susceptible to glyphosate, showing the doses required to reduce dry weight by 50 % of 237. 5 and 313. 5 g acid equivalent per hectare, respectively. Eucalyptus clones respond differently to glyphosate exposure, so that among I 224, C 219, GG 100, and I 144, the susceptibility to the herbicide is increasing...|$|E

Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the selectivity of the saflufenacil herbicide, applied singly and in combination with glyphosate, on coffee and citrus plants grown in a sandy soil. Two experiments were implemented and conducted in completely randomized design with four replications. The chemical treatments consisted of three sequential applications, with <b>directed</b> <b>spraying</b> of saflufenacil at rates of 0. 035, 0. 07 and 0. 105 kg a. i. ha - 1, glyphosate at rate of 2. 160 kg a. e. ha - 1, the two herbicides combined at the same rates, and a control without chemical treatment. The saflufenacil applied singly and in combination with glyphosate was selective for coffee and citrus plants, which presented no visual toxicity symptoms. The sequential application of saflufenacil, singly and in combination with glyphosate did not affect the growth of coffee and citrus plants. The saflufenacil has potential for use, in combination with glyphosate on controlling many weed species in coffee and citrus areas without any interference on the development of these species...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics and {{commercialization of}} {{transgenic}} crops Since 1996 the large-scale cultivation of commercial transgenic (genetically engineered) crops has grown continuously, {{with a total}} of 114 million hectares cultivated in 23 countries in 20071. Most crops are modified with one or both of two main agronomic input traits—herbicide tolerance and insect resistance. Crop tolerance to otherwise phytotoxic herbicides generally improves weed management, reduces the number and strength of herbicide applications, and allows topical application of herbicide to crop and weeds. Topical herbicide application can replace <b>directed</b> <b>spraying</b> between crop rows and mechanical weed removal, without damaging crops. Replacing mechanical treatment not only reduces fuel consumption but also helps conserve soil types vulnerable to erosion and compaction. Transgenic herbicide-tolerant crops also permit more flexibility in the timing of herbicide application. The new “post-emergence ” herbicide treatments for herbicide-tolerant crops may actually replace both “pre-emergence ” and “post-emergence ” sprays with conventional herbicides. Herbicide tolerance is achieved through application of one or both of two strategies: the introduction and expression of a gene that codes for a target enzyme that is insensitive to the herbicide; and/or an enzyme that inactivates the herbicide of interest. Herbicide-tolerant soybeans are widely adopted in both North and South American countries, including th...|$|E

40|$|This {{appendix}} {{describes the}} ecological exposure to diflubenzuron for fly control at livestock operations and estimates aquatic exposure from this use. This is a non-standard exposure scenario and requires more explanation and justification than would typically {{be presented in}} {{the main body of}} the CRLF risk assessment document. There are several very different methods that use diflubenzuron to control fly larvae in manure and other fly-breeding sites around livestock facilities. First, the diflubenzuron can be administered to the livestock through food. In this way the diflubenzuron is incorporated into the livestock manure as the livestock defecate. Similarly a second method uses a “bolus gun ” to directly place a time release formulation (bolus) into the digestive system of the livestock so that diflubenzuron will again be directly incorporated into the manure as the bolus is digested. EFED has little information available concerning the concentration in the manure produced and, therefore, limited ability to assess these uses. A third method is a <b>direct</b> <b>spray</b> on manure (produced by un-treated livestock) and other flybreeding areas.

In the positionally selective treatments, herbicide <b>spray</b> was <b>directed</b> to leave an untreated zone over the crop row at planting. Growth analysis indicated no detectable differences when Italian ryegrass safened by <b>directed</b> <b>spray</b> was compared to Italian ryegrass safened by activated carbon.

The non-safened application superimposed sublethal diuron rates over Italian ryegrass and rattail fescue grown in varying densities and proportiors. Growth analysis of monoculture stands indicated differences due to planted density, species, and herbicide, whereas growth analysis of plants grown as space-planted individuals indicated difference due to species only.

40|$|Synthetic {{pesticides}} are extensively used {{in agriculture}} to control harmful pests and prevent crop yield losses or product damage. Because of high biological activity and, in certain cases, long persistence in the environment, pesticides may cause undesirable effects {{to human health}} and to the environment. Farmers are routinely exposed {{to high levels of}} pesticides, usually much greater than those of consumers. Farmers’ exposure mainly occurs during the preparation and application of the pesticide spray solutions and during the cleaning-up of spraying equipment. Farmers who mix, load, and spray pesticides can be exposed to these chemicals due to spills and splashes, <b>direct</b> <b>spray</b> contact as a result of faulty or missing protective equipment, or even drift. However, farmers can be also exposed to pesticides even when performing activities not directly related to pesticide use.

40|$|The risk {{associated}} with the application and co-occurrence of atrazine and sulfentrazone, two herbicides applied to a corn and soybean rotational field, was evaluated in the current study. Peak field concentrations {{were found in the}} soil matrix, with atrazine and sulfentrazone values of 144 ng/g dry weight (dw), and 318 ng/g dw, respectively; however, due to the physicochemical properties of the compounds, the two herbicides were also transported to field water matrices. The highest mean runoff water concentrations for atrazine and sulfentrazone were 4. 72 µg/L and 10. 3 µg/L, respectively. A <b>direct</b> <b>spray</b> event of atrazine to the runoff water sampler caused concentrations as high as 1. 6 mg/L, effectively becoming a worst case scenario concentration. Individual and mixture laboratory bioassays were also conducted {{to determine the effects of}} atrazine and sulfentrazone on the survival of D. magna, and P. promelas. Sub-lethal effects including germination of L. sativa, and growth of P. promelas, S. capricornutum and L. minor were also evaluated. Results showed that S. capricornutum and L. minor were the most susceptible non-target species tested, and synergistic effects were observed for both species when equipotent mixtures were tested. Margin of safety of 10 % (MOS 10) values were calculated for each species using field concentrations and bioassay benchmark concentrations. Atrazine MOS 10 values, calculated with environmental concentrations not including the <b>direct</b> <b>spray</b> event, were 0. 83 and 0. 10 for S. capricornutum and L. minor, respectively.
