25|$|The {{beauty and}} variety of tone, the {{impeccable}} mechanism, and the noble, architectonic conception were great pianism and great musicianship. It is not customary to compare the work of local artists favorably {{with that of the}} foreign-born great, but I cannot refrain from doing so in this case, because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Kirkpatrick was playing the piano as it is not often played by anybody.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out â€“ the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E
500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E

"I {{believed}} that it was so clear that axiomatisation in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very much concerned with it.

Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{if he was going}} to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Langewiesche, an {{aviation}} journalist, said: [...] "n {{the case of}} the Egyptians, they were following a completely different line of thinking. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they knew very well that their man, Batouti, had done this. They were pursuing a political agenda that was driven by the need to answer to their higher-ups in a very pyramidal, autocratic political structure. The word had been passed down from on high, probably from Mubarak himself, {{that there was no way}} that Batouti, the co-pilot, could have done this. For the accident investigators in Egypt, the game then became not pursuing the truth but backing the official line." ...|$|E

[...] He laughed, and said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless {{it was in this}} same city.

2500|$|Before Wecht's trial, the {{prosecution}} moved to dismiss 43 of the 84 counts without prejudice. The judge rejected the motion and dismissed the 43 charges with prejudice, which permanently bars {{the revival of}} the charges. Wecht's defense counsel argued that his prosecution was politically motivated. The initial indictment was announced in early 2006, before the November 2006 elections. During the trial, the judge barred the defense from arguing that the case was politically motivated. Although discussions about possible political motivations were not allowed during the trial, the jury foreman told reporters after the trial that some jurors began to see {{the prosecution}} as [...] "political"."I don't know if politically motivated or not, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the motivations were certainly less than pure. There was something behind it other than seeking justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dismayed to {{find that}} {{groundbreaking}} work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds {{by means of a}} similar tuning fork [...] "contraption", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: [...] "Without knowing much about the subject, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech." [...] He also later remarked: [...] "I thought that Helmholtz had done it... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} days, {{communal}} meetings {{were limited to}} practical matters, but in the 1920s and 1930s, they became more informal. Instead of meeting in the dining room, the group would sit around a campfire. Rather than reading minutes, the session would begin with a group dance. Remembering her youth on a kibbutz {{on the shores of}} the Kinneret, one woman said: [...] "Oh, how beautiful it was when we all took part in the discussions, [...] nights of searching for one anotherâ€”that is what I call those hallowed nights. During the moments of silence, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> from each heart a spark would burst forth, and the sparks would unite in one great flame penetrating the heavens.... At the center of our camp a fire burns, and {{under the weight of the}} hora the earth groans a rhythmic groan, accompanied by wild songs".|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{initially}} {{became aware}} of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s. Speaking of them in 1995, he said, [...] "I knew they didn't surf.â€¦I felt some resentment about , and I had been a fan of Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones.â€¦Instinctively, I was not a Beach Boy fan. 'Something really dumb about it.'" [...] He added that, [...] "I loved Pet Sounds, you see. I came back to love them, and thought they had done a great job. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they would be fine in fighting spirit to take on this challenge of wresting that trophy {{out of the hands of}} those interlopers." [...] Parks has gone on to call Wilson [...] "the biggest event of that era" [...] but is hesitant to label him a [...] "genius," [...] believing Wilson to be more [...] "a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent and a lot of people collaborating beautifully around him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnsonâ€”who also appeared in Pal Joeyâ€”recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|E
