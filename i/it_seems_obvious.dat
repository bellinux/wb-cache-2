25|$|China brain:What if we {{ask each}} citizen of China to {{simulate}} one neuron, using the telephone system {{to simulate the}} connections between axons and dendrites? In this version, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that no individual would have any {{understanding of what the}} brain might be saying.|$|E
25|$|As for the Hellenes, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> to me {{that ever}} since they came into {{existence}} they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I {{do not think the}} Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that Gerda is the murderer. Henrietta {{steps forward}} {{to take the}} {{revolver}} from her hand, but apparently fumbles and drops it into the swimming pool, destroying the evidence. However, the pistol that Gerda was holding was not the gun used to kill John. None of the witnesses has seen Gerda shoot John. It seems difficult to build a case against {{any of the other}} potential suspects. Lucy was the next suspect, as she kept a pistol concealed in her basket of eggs. However, the pistol was the wrong calibre. Henrietta is the next suspect, having left an unusual doodle in the pavilion around the time John was killed. When the murder weapon turns up in Poirot's hedge, it has fingerprints that match none of the suspects.|$|E
50|$|With the {{enormous}} prestige that Reyes was enjoying after his successful military campaign of 1895 in the North, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that we would}} be nominated by his party to run for president in 1900. But it did not happen. He would have to wait until four year later.|$|R
50|$|While {{at first}} glance <b>it</b> may <b>seem</b> <b>obvious</b> that a Circle is-an Ellipse, {{consider}} the following analogous code.|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> that in {{the second}} instance, the {{instantiation}} ‘shocked’ can be coded in the Insecurity category as it instantiated the negative feeling of Disquiet. However, {{it is not easy}} to do the same with the instantiation ‘surprised’ in the first instance as the co-text suggests that the Surprise feeling in the first instance is associated with the positive feeling of Happiness-Cheer.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins' new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors [...] "couldn't tell by looking" [...] at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments. Although <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> now that a doctor could not announce to an eight-year-old boy and his parents that [...] "we have just discovered that you are 'really' a girl, with female chromosomes, and ovaries and uterus inside, and we recommend that you change your sex to match your chromosomes and internal organs," [...] a few such events occurred around the world as doctors and parents tried to make use of new information.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that one}} cannot both accept the {{hypothesis}} that all P's are Q and also reject the contrapositive, i.e. that all non-Q's are non-P. Yet {{it is easy to}} see that on the Neyman-Pearson theory of testing, a test of [...] "All P's are Q" [...] is not necessarily a test of [...] "All non-Q's are non-P" [...] or vice versa. A test of [...] "All P's are Q" [...] requires reference to some alternative statistical hypothesis of the form [...] of all P's are Q, , whereas a test of [...] "All non-Q's are non-P" [...] requires reference to some statistical alternative of the form [...] of all non-Q's are non-P, [...] But these two sets of possible alternatives are different ... Thus one could have a test of [...] without having a test of its contrapositive.|$|E

50|$|Smathers {{realized}} {{during the}} course of his employment that there was a great need for some method of increasing the speed and decreasing the operator fatigue of typing, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> to him that electric power was the answer. By late 1912 he had produced a working model of his electric typewriter and applied for a patent, which was issued the following year.|$|R
50|$|The Hills {{first met}} Simon on December 14, 1963. Early in their discussions, Simon {{determined}} that the UFO encounter was causing Barney far more worry and anxiety than {{he was willing to}} admit. Though Simon dismissed the popular extraterrestrial hypothesis as impossible, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> to him that the Hills genuinely thought they had witnessed a UFO with human-like occupants. Simon hoped to uncover more about the experience through hypnosis.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that the}} thief {{had come in}} through the side entrance; {{otherwise}} he would have passed Phelps on the stairs at some point, {{and there were no}} hiding places in his office. No footprints were seen in the office despite its being a rainy evening. The only suspect at that point was the commissionaire's wife, who had quickly hurried out of the building at about that same time.|$|R
60|$|It {{is curious}} {{that so much}} {{importance}} should be attached to this supplementary idea. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that {{the theory of the}} origin of species by natural selection necessarily involves the divergence of the forms selected. An individual which varies, ipso facto diverges from the type of its species; and its progeny, in which the variation becomes intensified by selection, must diverge still more, not only from the parent stock, but from any other race of that stock starting from, a variation of a different character. The selective process could not take place unless the selected variety was either better adapted to the conditions than the original stock, or adapted to other conditions than the original stock. In the first case, the original stock would be sooner or later extirpated; in the second, the type, as represented by the original stock and the variety, would occupy more diversified stations than it did before.|$|E
60|$|It {{might be}} {{objected to the}} theory that many things which we {{certainly}} believe do not call for any bodily movements. I believe that Great Britain is an island, that whales are mammals, that Charles I was executed, and so on; and at first sight <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that such beliefs, as a rule, do not call for any action on my part. But when we investigate the matter more closely, it becomes more doubtful. To begin with, we must distinguish belief as a mere DISPOSITION from actual active belief. We speak as if we always believed that Charles I was executed, but that only means that we are always ready to believe it when the subject comes up. The phenomenon we are concerned to analyse is the active belief, not the permanent disposition. Now, what are the occasions when, we actively believe that Charles I was executed? Primarily: examinations, when we perform the bodily movement of writing it down; conversation, when we assert it to display our historical erudition; and political discourses, when we are engaged in showing what Soviet government leads to. In all these cases bodily movements (writing or speaking) result from our belief.|$|E
60|$|Hume’s {{version of}} the {{doctrine}} differed in a slight degree from Mr. Attwood’s. He thought that all commodities would not rise in price simultaneously, and that some persons therefore would obtain a real gain, by getting more money for {{what they had to}} sell, while the things which they wished to buy might not yet have risen. And those who would reap this gain would always be (he seems to think) the first comers. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious,</b> however, that, for every person who thus gains more than usual, there is necessarily some other person who gains less. The loser, if things took place as Hume supposes, would be the seller of the commodities which are slowest to rise; who, by the supposition, parts with his goods at the old prices, to purchasers who have already benefited by the new. This seller has obtained for his commodity only the accustomed quantity of money, while there are already some things of which that money will no longer purchase as much as before. If, therefore, he knows what is going on, he will raise his price, and then the buyer will not have the gain, which is supposed to stimulate his industry. But if, on the contrary, the seller does not know the state of the case, and only discovers it when he finds, in laying his money out, that it does not go so far, he then obtains less than the ordinary remuneration for his labor and capital; and, if the other dealer’s industry is encouraged, it should seem that his must, from the opposite cause, be impaired.|$|E
2500|$|After {{demolishing}} John Parrott in the 1989 World Final, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that the}} new decade would see Davis and rising star Stephen Hendry battling for supremacy. However, the mouthwatering prospect of Davis v Hendry World finals never materialised. As with Ray Reardon and his successor Steve Davis, {{there was to be}} no World Final showdown between once and future kings. Instead, Hendry became the new king, with Jimmy White as his main rival.|$|R
6000|$|To Una and to Mr. Fein <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> that, since {{women have}} {{at least half of}} the family {{decision}} regarding the purchase of suburban homes, women salesmen of suburban property should be at least as successful as men. But Mr. Truax had a number of [...] "good, sound, conservative" [...] reasons why this should not be so, and therefore declined to credit the evidence of Una, Beatrice Joline, and saleswomen of other firms that it really was so.|$|R
50|$|Queen were to {{participate}} in two music festivals (in 1984 and 1986) at Montreux in Switzerland, where they lip-synched a small selection of their latest material. This surprised many onlookers as the band had often spoken out strongly against this style of performance. The concerts were filmed and then broadcast to many millions of people throughout Europe. To their fans, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> that the band, {{as well as some}} members of the audience, were dis-oriented and somewhat confused during these faked performances.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> to Holmes {{that the}} men came to [...] "try" [...] Blessington, and reached a verdict of guilty, and a {{sentence}} of death, which they then proceeded to carry out.|$|E
50|$|Yes, {{large numbers}} of people do enjoy making a {{philosophy}} of general semantics. This saves them the pain of rigorous training so simple and general and limited that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> when said, yet so difficult.|$|E

5000|$|In Blues Review, Bob Putignano wrote, [...] "I’ve {{always felt}} the Saunders brought out and {{extracted}} a different side of Garcia, a side {{that was more}} jazz-oriented. Blues and rhythm and blues surfaced readily, and the deep grooves (especially from Saunders B3) allowed Garcia alternate landscapes to explore. Additionally, within the Deads universe there was far more pressure and egos to deal with. With Merl <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> that the musical state-of-affairs were more casual, yet no intensity is lost." ...|$|R

25|$|Rocket launch {{vehicles}} take-off with a {{great deal}} of flames, noise and drama, and <b>it</b> might <b>seem</b> <b>obvious</b> that they are grievously inefficient. However, while they are far from perfect, their energy efficiency is not as bad as might be supposed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{good portion}} of the plot turns on a romantic {{situation}} involving Genter Latham's daughter, Wealthia. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> to the reader that Wealthia is {{having an affair with a}} dashing canal boat operator, Silverhorn Ramsey. She is also engaged to one Kinsey Hayne.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that whoever}} killed Chalmers also killed Aimee, to silence her. Barlier says he didn't commit either crime, but Monk is sure that {{any man who}} lives in a sewer and eats other people's garbage has to be insane, not to mention guilty. Natalie, however, is charmed into {{accepting}} a dinner date with him.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} {{history of}} the LG 42 is not clear, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that the success of}} the company's 7.5 cm LG 40 during the Battle of Crete in 1941 spurred the Germans to continue development of recoilless guns in larger calibers. Krupp seems to have gotten its 10.5 cm LG 40 into service first, but the Rheinmetall LG 42 was apparently manufactured in larger quantities.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> also <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that {{if these}} defects had been known {{at the time the}} reactor was {{originally}} licensed, this was a condition that would have warranted refusal to grant a license. Exactly one of the criteria for revoking a license.|$|R

40|$|I am so {{old that}} Post-Mortem is a {{well-known}} technique for debugging programs. And so old that when I started teaching as an assistant, pedagogy did not exist - we were just "thrown into the deep {{end of the pool}} and told to swim".

To first dump data about what happened and then analyze that data to find out why it happened and what actions to take to remove the problem...|$|R
5000|$|To this end, PriceSCAN set {{itself up}} as an [...] "unbiased" [...] price {{comparison}} engine. The website's FAQ stated [...] "At PriceSCAN, we believe that consumers {{should have access to}} unbiased reporting on products and prices. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> to us that if a price guide restricts its listings to those vendors who have paid to be included, then its database more accurately reflects the source of its revenue, not necessarily the best products at the lowest price." ...|$|E
5000|$|The nine-dot {{problem is}} a {{well-defined}} problem. It has a clearly stated goal, and all necessary information {{to solve the problem}} is included (connect all of the dots using four straight lines). Furthermore, well-defined problems have a clear ending (you know when you have reached the solution). Although the solution is [...] "outside the box" [...] and not easy to see at first, once it has been found, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious.</b> Other examples of well-defined problems are the Tower of Hanoi and the Rubik's Cube.|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel is}} set in the {{reasonably}} near future. Earth is being devastated by mankind's continued exploitation, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>obvious</b> that the environment will collapse sometime in the near future. Rather than adopt a more eco-friendly approach to life, most people have instead invested in a [...] "claustrosphere", a dome-shaped habitat in which all water, food and air is endlessly recycled in a completely closed environment. A person can therefore survive indefinitely within a claustrosphere no matter what ecological horrors may happen outside.|$|E
50|$|The {{enormous}} {{wealth of}} the mines, soon became irresistible for British imperialists. In 1895, a group of renegades led by Captain Leander Starr Jameson entered the ZAR {{with the intention of}} sparking an uprising on the Witwatersrand and installing a British administration. This incursion became known as the Jameson Raid. The scheme ended in fiasco, but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> to Kruger that it had at least the tacit approval of the Cape Colony government, and that his republic faced danger. He reacted by forming an alliance with Orange Free State.|$|R
50|$|When the Ely Valley Railway was planned, {{the only}} other railway in the {{vicinity}} was the broad gauge South Wales Railway, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> {{at the time to}} make the EVR line on the same gauge. On reflection, however, this posed some serious disadvantages; iron ore bound for the Merthyr and Dowlais smelters had to travel via Neath and the Vale of Neath Railway, and be transhipped {{near the end of the}} journey. Moreover there were limited facilities at Cardiff for supplying ships from broad gauge wagons.|$|R
50|$|With two IRBMs {{of nearly}} {{identical}} capabilities, the Army and Air Force were at loggerheads {{with each other}} as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>obvious</b> that {{only one of the}} two would ultimately achieve operational status. Jupiter's testing program, which began two months after Thor's, proceeded more smoothly and avoided accidents such as the explosion of Thor 103 {{due in large part to}} the employment of the experienced rocket team of Wernher von Braun. The turbopump issues that plagued early Rocketdyne engines were also resolved in Jupiter much earlier than the Air Force's missiles.|$|R
