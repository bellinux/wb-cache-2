40|$|New radio {{observations}} of the counterpart of the ultraluminous X-ray source in NGC 5408 show {{for the first time}} that the radio emission is resolved with an angular size of 1. 5 to 2. 0 arcseconds. This corresponds to a physical size of 35 - 46 pc, and rules out interpretation of the radio emission as beamed emission from a relativistic jet. In addition, the radio spectral index of the counterpart is well determined from three frequencies and found to be alpha=- 0. 8 pm 0. 2. The radio emission is likely to be optically-thin synchrotron emission from a nebula surrounding the X-ray source. The radio luminosity of the counterpart is 3. 8 x 10 ^ 34 erg/s and the minimum energy required to power the nebula is ~ 1 x 10 ^ 49 erg.

Aims: The aim of this work is to investigate the spatial distribution, physical characteristics, and kinematical properties of the molecular gas linked to the <b>galactic</b> <b>nebula</b> RCW 78 to achieve {{a better understanding of}} its interaction with the star and with the ionized gas. Methods: This study was based on 12 CO(1 - 0) fully sampled observations of a region of 0. 45 in size around the star WR 55 and the nebula RCW 78 obtained with the 4 -m NANTEN telescope, radio continuum archival data at 1. 4 and 4. 85 GHz, obtained from SGPS and PMNRAO Southern Radio Survey, respectively, and available infrared MIPSGAL images at 24 microns. Results: A molecular gas component in the velocity range from - 58 to - 45 km s- 1, compatible with the velocity of the ionized gas, was found {{to be associated with the}} optical nebula. Adopting a distance of 5 kpc, the mass of this molecular component is about 3. 4 x 10 ^ 4 Msun. The analysis of the molecular data revealed the presence of a velocity gradient, in agreement with the Halpha line. New radiocontinuum flux density determinations confirm the thermal nature of RCW 78. This indicates that the ionized gas in RCW 78 arises from photoionization of the molecular gas component in the velocity range from - 58 km s- 1 to - 45 km s- 1.

The interaction of the UV radiation with hydrogen results in photo-ionization and photo-excitation leading to a non-equilibrium population of the metastable 2 s 2 S level. This occurs throughout the equatorial region surrounding η Carinae in sufficient quantity to produce strong narrow absorption on top of the broad P Cygni emission profile.
