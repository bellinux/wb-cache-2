It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away.

Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E
500|$|When {{their efforts}} to get the Flood {{manuscript}} published failed, the Earps decided to appeal to Burns, whose own book was near publication. But he was not interested. His book {{was about to be}} published, free of the constraints imposed by a collaboration with Earp. Burns wrote them, [...] "I should not now care to undertake another book which, in part at least, would be upon much the same lines... <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> delighted six months ago to accept your offer but it is too late now. My book has championed Mr. Earp's cause throughout and I believe will vindicate his reputation in Tombstone in a way that he will like." [...] When Burns turned them down, Josephine actively worked to stop the publication of his book, fearful that {{their efforts to}} publish Wyatt's biography would be thwarted as a result.|$|E
500|$|One notable {{citation}} as {{an influence}} was by Kurt Cobain, on influencing Nirvana's [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "I {{was trying to}} write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [...] When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in that band—or {{at least in a}} Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard." [...] Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 In Utero at the request of Cobain.|$|E

500|$|Volk {{was cut by}} the Broncos in August 1976 {{and signed}} by the Miami Dolphins two weeks later. He did not play for the Dolphins in 1976 and was signed mid-season by the New York Giants. [...] Volk played in 8 games for the Giants in 1976 and tallied 2 interceptions and a fumble recovery. Volk was cut by the Giants in early September 1977, shortly {{before the start of}} the regular season. [...] Volk {{recalled}} the disappointment at being cut by the Giants at age 32: [...] "I felt <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in New York, but they went with younger people. [...] I was very disappointed, especially to get cut at the end of training camp. [...] I'd done all the hard training and was ready for the season [...] the fun time." [...] He returned to his home in Baltimore and worked during the fall as a manufacturer's representative.|$|E
500|$|Kim Collins, who has {{competed in}} every Games that Saint Kitts and Nevis has participated in, {{was set to}} run the 100 meter dash. Collins {{was not allowed to}} compete by his Olympic {{committee}} after they found out he stayed with his wife, outside of the Olympic village. Collins required to get permission to stay outside the village for multiple nights in a row, and the committee stated he violated team discipline rules. On the issue of not being allowed to compete, Collins said [...] "I feel that I should stay in a hotel with my wife, with or without their permission, that’s the honest to God truth whether they like it or not." [...] He planned to never race for the country again, stating, [...] "This is how it ends, it ends on a really sad note. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allowed to run. I don’t see what is the big deal, I am a grown man, I’m just about to become a grandfather." [...] Collins would later compete in the 2016 Olympics under the same flag.|$|E
500|$|With Lee's higher rank {{in society}} and wealth, he decided he needed to build a mansion to secure his {{position}} {{as one of the}} Virginia gentry. he chose the [...] "Clifts," [...] which he had owned since the mid-1710s. Lee decided on this site because it was located in Westmoreland County, where he was born, and because it was located on the Potomac River. The land was sufficient for having many construction laborers live there. Hannah had an influential say in the design and planning of the interior of the house. Philip, the couple's eldest son, had said, [...] "See {{what it is to be}} ruled by a woman. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> now living in a house like this ... had not my father been persuaded by his wife to put up this very inferior dwelling, now over my head." [...] The exact construction date of the house is unknown but it is estimated that construction began around 1725-30, as all of Lee's sons were born at Stratford. Workers on the plantation were from all the working class: free people and indentured servants mostly from the British Isles, and African slaves.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{retrospective}} of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the New Statesman, Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel [...] "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed yuppies produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky {{and had not}} the first clue about men [...] Yet her death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, {{a tribute to the}} extent to which we have invested and believed in her." [...] Observer critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high-profile role in Friends made her the [...] "star" [...] of Cold Feet in the first series, but both she and Rachel had been [...] "eclipsed" [...] by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series. Spectator critic Simon Hoggart wrote, [...] "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> It was one of those deaths which makes you think, 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" [...] Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a [...] "fraught, snippy" [...] woman. Matt Greenhalgh, who co-wrote the episode featuring Rachel's death, called killing off the character [...] "a privilege".|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, how do you get through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?" ...|$|E
500|$|Outside the Pacific Northwest, {{a number}} of artists and music scenes {{influenced}} grunge. Noise rock bands such as Scratch Acid and the Butthole Surfers influenced Nirvana. Alternative rock bands from the Northeastern United States, including Sonic Youth, Pixies, Pavement, and Dinosaur Jr., are important influences on the genre. Through their patronage of Seattle bands, Sonic Youth [...] "inadvertently nurtured" [...] the grunge scene, and reinforced the fiercely independent attitudes of its musicians. The influence of Pixies on Nirvana was noted by Kurt Cobain, who commented in a Rolling Stone interview, [...] "I connected with that band so heavily that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard." [...] In August 1997, {{in an interview with}} Guitar World, Dave Grohl said: [...] "From Kurt, Krist [...] and I liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, Beatles and Abba just as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag...You listen to any Pixies record and it's all over there. Or even Black Sabbath's [...] "War Pigs"-it's there: the power of the dynamic. We just sort of abused it with pop songs and got sick with it." ...|$|E

500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
500|$|With {{the ninth}} issue, dated July 1, 1919, Hersey was {{replaced}} by Ronald Oliphant. [...] The reason he was replaced is not clear, though several explanations have been suggested. [...] Murray Leinster claimed that Hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in the magazine; according to Leinster, some of the poetry may have actually been written by Hersey's mother rather than by Hersey himself. [...] Pulp historian Richard Bleiler regards this theory as unlikely, since although up to eighteen of the twenty-five short poems in the first eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey, only two stories in those issues are definitely by him, and there are only four other stories {{which may have been}} Hersey's work published under a pseudonym. [...] Bleiler suggests that at most Street & Smith would have reprimanded Hersey, and that the real reason for his dismissal {{is more likely to be}} that Street & Smith were dissatisfied with The Thrill Book under his editorship. [...] Bleiler also suggests that Hersey may have started the rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material, as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure. [...] Hersey himself claimed that he was not fired, but quit: [...] "I wasn't fired, but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been...</b> I saw the 'handwriting on the wall' ahead of time. [...] I asked to be relieved of my duties... and my request was promptly accepted!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, the {{popularity}} of antihero Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) prompted ABC to market a rag doll of the character, complete with his signature scar. First offered for sale on April 29, 2002, the doll was pulled on May 7, 2002, after a backlash begun when The Jack Myers Report [...] "harshly criticized the network's judgment" [...] on creating and releasing a doll based on Manning, a character who had notably been convicted of rape in 1993. The New York Times later quoted then-ABC President Angela Shapiro stating, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't." ...|$|E

[...] In his obituary, it was stated that, [...] "The flea communicated to Mr. Blake what passed, as related to himself, at the Creation. 'It was first intended,' said he (the flea) 'to make me as big as a bullock; but then when it was considered from my construction, so armed—and so powerful withal, that in proportion to my bulk, (mischievous as I now am) that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a too mighty destroyer; it was determined to make me—no bigger than I am." ...|$|E
