40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out as a {{development}} project at Scana Steel Björneborg with the purpose to study the influential parameters in argon shrouded <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> during the manufacturing of low-alloy steels. In the first stage, a literature study was conducted in order to investigate the theoretical background of the procedure and the importance of protecting the melt during <b>ingot</b> <b>casting.</b> Next, a computer model of the shield was designed using COMSOL Multiphysics® with regard to the process conditions at Scana Steel Björneborg. The effect of various parameters on the process was examined through simulations of the argon gas flow pattern, heat transfer between the gas and the melt stream, and the chemical species transport in the gas around the melt stream. Based on the simulation results, two different shapes of shield were proposed for the argon shrouding operation. A set of implementation tests was executed in order to check the installation and usage conditions of the two new shields. After deciding the proper shape of the shield, a full-scale ingot-casting test was performed with the selected shield to investigate the protection behavior. Moreover, the impact of the new casting-protection shield on the nitrogen and oxygen contents of steel was examined through sampling and analyzing the steel before and after casting. It was found that the use of the new shield during the uphill <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> is an effective way to reduce the final nitrogen and oxygen contents of the <b>casted</b> <b>ingot.</b> Therefore, the new design of the shield {{can be used as a}} developed substitute for the protection of the melt stream in the <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> operation...|$|R

40|$|Scania has {{experienced}} difficulties with large {{variations of the}} slope of the back plane after press quenching of case hardened crown wheels of especially type R 780 Steg supplied from <b>ingot</b> <b>cast</b> material. This leads to {{that a large number of}} crown wheels has to be remeasured and sorted according to back slope which is time consuming for operators. Also, after sorting of the crown wheels, hard machining has to be adjusted according to the different slopes of the back plane of the crown wheels. In some cases, it also leads to scrapping of the crown wheels. This master’s thesis was divided in two parts. The aim of the first part was to confirm that the crown wheel type and casting technique that exhibits the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg originating from <b>ingot</b> <b>cast</b> material. The crown wheel types that were compared were the R 780 Steg, R 780 Slät and R 885 Slät. Crown wheels manufactured from <b>ingot</b> <b>cast</b> material and from continuous cast material were compared. Hence, 6 combinations were examined. The slope of the back plane was measured with the measuring probe FARO after press quenching. The slope of the crown wheels was found to depend on both casting technique and the geometry of the crown wheel. The results confirmed that the crown wheel type and supplier combination that by far yields the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg supplied by Steel Plant A who uses the <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> technique. For this combination the variation exceeds 0, 1 mm. All other combinations of crown wheels and suppliers yield acceptable variations. The second part of this master’s thesis was composed of determining if segregations in the <b>cast</b> <b>ingot</b> are the cause of the variations in slope of the back plane of the crown wheel type R 780 Steg. This was done by measuring if there is a correlation between {{the slope of the}} back plane of the crown wheel after press quenching, the chemical composition and the original position of the crown wheel in the ingot. As in the first part of the study, the distortion was measured by the measuring probe FARO. The samples were sent to Degerfors Laboratorium for chemical analysis. Analyses of C, S and N were made by using combustion analyses. For As, P, B and Al optic spectrometry (spark) was used. All other elements were analysed by x-ray fluorescence. Segregations were found to be present and in combination with the geometry of R 780 Steg to be the cause of the large variations in slope of the crown wheels. The results of this thesis show that, for the crown wheel type R 780 Steg, Scania should not use suppliers that employ the <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> technique. Instead, only suppliers using the continuous casting technique should be used. However, for the other crown wheel types <b>ingot</b> or continuously <b>cast</b> material can be used...|$|R

40|$|The {{horizontal}} direct chill (HDC) {{casting process}} has been investigated as a production route for magnesium remelt ingot. During this development program, HDC ingots of AZ 91 were cast at two pilot plants. <b>Ingots</b> <b>cast</b> at one site exhibited columnar microstructures and were prone to formation of centreline cracks, whereas <b>ingots</b> <b>cast</b> at the other site had equiaxed microstructures and did not crack. In order to determine whether differences in the casting conditions or the melt preparation practices at the two sites {{were responsible for the}} change in the microstructure, available models of the columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) were applied. Ingot microstructures were examined and thermal data were obtained. CAFE (cellular automata finite element) modelling using the CalcoMOSTM program was also used to predict grain structures.

40|$|Continuous <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> is an {{important}} processing technology for many materials. Under most practical circumstances, turbulence plays a critical role which, along with transport mechanisms such as buoyancy, surface tension, and phase change, {{is responsible for the}} quality of the end products. A modified turbulence model based on the standard k-e two-equation closure is proposed and applied to predict the phase change and convection-diffusion characteristics during titanium alloy <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> in an electron beam melting process. In conjunction with an adaptive grid computational technique, solutions of the coupled mass continuity, momentum, energy, and turbulence transport have been obtained {{in the context of the}} enthalpy formulation. Effects of casting speed and gravity on solidification and convection characteristics have been investigated and compared to ones obtained previously with a simple zeroequation turbulence model. The present turbulence model predicts that the mushy zone is generally of substantial thickness as a result of the convection effect, that the solidus line has a high curvature, and that the temperature gradient close to the solidus line is higher than elsewhere. Under all conditions, the turbulence structure largely reflects the combined influence of convection and energy input by the electron beam and the superheated feeding material from the top surface.

40|$|The use of TurboSwirl {{to obtain}} an {{improved}} steel cleanliness during filling of an ingot was numerically studied by VOF and DPM models. It was found that a radius-reduced TurboSwirl or a proper tapered mold entrance nozzle with an adequate developed region for steel flow can {{reduce the risk of}} mold flux entrapment in a mold. The <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> process can create highly turbulent conditions inside the mold during the initial stages of casting. Since the TurboSwirl generates much calmer filling conditions it can promote separation of large nonmetallic inclusions. The TurboSwirl also collects large inclusions (200 [*]μm) towards the axis of rotation, which should promote agglomeration. In addition, the residence time for inclusions of small sizes can be prolonged, increasing chance of agglomeration, which indirectly promotes their separation from steel. Moreover, the average turbulent dissipation rate in an <b>ingot</b> <b>casting</b> swirl setup is about 40 % higher than that in a no swirl setup. This further facilitates the agglomeration of inclusions before they enter the mold. The removal of nonmetallic inclusions is thus enhanced because of an increasing inclusion collision rate due to both Stokes collisions and turbulent collisions, while maintaining a calm flow inside the mold...|$|R

The microstructure of the as-cast AZ 31 alloy strip consists of columnar zones near the roll side and equiaxed zones in the mid-thickness region. On the other hand, AZ 91 alloy strip shows the fine, equiaxed dendrites through the thickness of strip. There is a variation of secondary dendrite arm spacing through the thickness of strips, showing the smallest value at the roll side and the largest value at the center of strips.
