5|$|The cruise port of Puerto Costa Maya was {{severely}} damaged, causing Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world's two largest cruise operators, to divert away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> {{until at least}} 2009. The Mexican government was quick to fund rebuilding of the destroyed concrete piers which, by June 2008, were rebuilt to accommodate even larger ships than before.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreign coal}} is brought via various ports by rail. In c.2007 GB Railfreight won a {{contract}} to move coal brought <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> of Tyne, celebrated by the company naming one of their locomotives Drax Power Station in 2007. DB Cargo UK haul coal from the nearby ports of Hull and Immingham, and from Hunterston Terminal {{on the west coast}} of Scotland. Freightliner Group move coal imported through Redcar.|$|E
5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E

5|$|Due to Allied {{victories}} in France and Eastern Europe, Germany's surface shipping was largely {{confined to the}} lower Baltic and Norwegian waters by late 1944. This left ports in Norway as Germany's last remaining bases to continue the Battle of the Atlantic and conduct trade with Sweden. When the Baltic iced over {{during the winter of}} 1944–45, Germany was forced to transport its vital imports of Swedish iron ore <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> of Narvik in northern Norway.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} in 1867 until 1895, when she was removed from front-line service {{to serve as a}} training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, plagued the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath {{attributed}} {{the invention of}} the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the war in the Cape Colony, the Boers {{surrounded}} and laid siege to the British garrisons in the towns of Kimberley and Mafeking and destroyed the railway bridge across the Orange River at Hopetown. Substantial British reinforcements (an army corps under General Redvers Buller) arrived in South Africa and were dispersed to three main fronts. While Buller himself advanced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> of Durban in Natal to relieve the besieged town of Ladysmith and a smaller detachment under Lieutenant General Gatacre secured the Cape Midlands, the reinforced 1st Division under Lord Methuen advanced from the Orange River to relieve Kimberley.|$|E

5|$|Ships {{occasionally}} departed Bristol for Iceland {{as early}} as 1420, and speculation exists that sailors (fisherman who landed on the Canadian coast to salt/ smoke their catch) from Bristol made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. Beginning in the early 1480s, the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers sponsored exploration of the North Atlantic in search of trading opportunities. In 1552, Edward VI granted a royal charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port. Among explorers to depart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> after Cabot were Martin Frobisher, Thomas James, after whom James Bay, on southern coast of Hudson Bay is named and Martin Pring, who discovered Cape Cod and the southern New England coast in 1603.|$|E
5|$|Telenor Denmark, {{part of the}} Norwegian Telenor {{telecommunications}} and mobile phone company, has a workforce of about 1,100 in Aalborg, {{making it one of}} the city's largest new employers. Siemens Wind Power has rotor-blade production and testing facilities in Aaborg. In 2012 and 2013, there were additions in both areas. The new testing plant is the world's largest research test centre for wind turbine technology. In 2012, the company shipped a record 570 wind turbine blades <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> of Aalborg, mainly to England and Ireland, up 45% on the previous year.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Les Sables-d'Olonne {{was a minor}} naval battle {{fought on}} 23 February 1809 off the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne on the Biscay Coast of France between a French Navy {{squadron}} of three frigates and a larger British squadron of ships of the line. The French squadron had sailed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> of Lorient on 23 February {{in an effort to}} link up with a fleet from Brest under Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, but missed the rendezvous and was pursued by a British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford. The French commander, Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien, anchored his squadron under the batteries which protected the town of Les Sables-d'Olonne in the hope of dissuading an attack.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Aarhus {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while feedstuffs, stone, cement and coal are among the chief imports. Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Port Hedland {{was shut}} down for 86hours as the cyclone slowly moved by, causing {{significant}} disruptions to shipping. Twenty-six ships were evacuated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> prior to the storm's arrival. Onshore mining was suspended for similar durations nearby. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto Group, and Fortescue Metals Group temporarily shut down or scaled back all operations in the area. The prolonged closure of the port resulted in a 2.4% drop in iron ore prices. Losses from lack of productivity and revenue associated with the port closures were estimated to {{be as high as}} A$500million (US$480million).|$|E
