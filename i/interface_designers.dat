Raymond had {{attempted}} to install CUPS using the Fedora Core 1 print manager but found it non-intuitive; he criticised the <b>interface</b> <b>designers</b> for not designing with the user's point-of-view in mind. He found the idea of printer queues was not obvious because users create queues on their local computer but these queues are actually created on the CUPS server.|$|E
50|$|Fonts - and {{therefore}} font-management programs - support {{people in a}} variety of professions: graphic designers, publishers (such as book publishers and news and periodical publishers), web-site designers, <b>interface</b> <b>designers,</b> illustrators, packaging designers, typeface designers, letterpress printers (using plates made from page layout programs), motion-graphic and film-title designers, advertising agencies, signage and wayfinding (environmental graphic design studios), industrial designers, and architectural firms that have in-house 2D design-staff who work with signs and typography.|$|E
50|$|<b>Interface</b> <b>designers</b> are {{graphical}} {{user interface}} (GUI) layout artists. They are employed by multimedia, software, and web development companies. Because graphical control elements are interactive, interface design often overlaps interaction design. Because interfaces are not usually composed as single computer files, interface design may require technical understanding, including graphical integration with code. Because interfaces may require hundreds of assets, {{knowledge of how to}} automate graphic production may be required. An interface designer may hold the job title of web designer in a web development company.|$|E

50|$|To {{build an}} interface, a {{developer}} simply drags interface {{objects from the}} palette onto a window or menu. Actions (messages) which the objects can emit are connected to targets in the application's code and outlets (pointers) declared in the application's code are connected to specific objects. In this way all initialization is done before runtime, both improving performance and streamlining the development process. When Interface Builder was a standalone application, <b>interface</b> <b>designers</b> could ship nib files to developers, who would then drop them into their projects.|$|E

Some hackathons are intended simply for educational or social purposes, although {{in many cases the}} goal is to create usable software. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, or the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created. It was presented by CodeCell and CSI. It was held in Abhyantriki 2016.|$|E
