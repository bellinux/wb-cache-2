5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects {{for an extended}} run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E

25|$|Baumeister {{and colleagues}} {{also note that}} volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of {{counterfactual}} thinking. This is worrying because counterfactual thinking ("If I <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> different...") {{is an important part}} of learning from one's choices, including those that harmed others. Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|E
25|$|On 5 March 2011, Mayall {{appeared}} on Let's Dance for Comic Relief {{in which he}} came on stage and attacked Ade Edmondson with a frying pan during his performance of The Dying Swan ballet.

It would be the last time the duo performed together in public.|$|E
500|$|To try {{to change}} the public {{backlash}} related to the alleged 1999 rape, The Birth of a Nations studio hired The Glover Park Group and Don McPherson to give Parker media training and public relations advice. [...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on the woman {{at the center of the}} charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> morally wrong.|$|E

500|$|However, Siobhan Grogan of NME {{magazine}} stated [...] "to {{the delight}} of lonely men everywhere, she tells us she's 'weak with desire' and knows 'I'm meant to say no'—and the mind boggles at how she'd have turned out if she'd spent her teens glugging cider on a street corner." [...] Chuck Campbell of Daily News viewed the song as [...] "gurgling" [...] and noted that Simpson was singing it breathlessly. An editor of The Advocate remarked that the track sounded more manufactured than composed. Craig Seymour of The Buffalo News wrote that he felt [...] "Irresistible" [...] was a [...] "limp seduction tune". Similarly, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the single could have been easily reprocessed for a [...] "new virginity ad campaign." [...] The Northern Echos Hayley Gyllenspetz dismissed the song, elaborating that it sounded similar to the works of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. She added, [...] "If only this 21-year-old songbird <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> original she may indeed have been irresistible." [...] An editor of The Malay Mail echoed Gyllenspetz's comment, writing that the track sounded like a typical Aguilera pop-Latino piece. [...] In 2003, [...] "Irresistible" [...] won a Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) [...] "Pop Music Award".|$|E
500|$|On 18 June 1999, Ackah {{anonymously}} telephoned Brent social services, expressing {{concern over}} Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer {{who received the}} call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, {{and what happened to}} it was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of [...] "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" [...] the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah said that she was told by the person {{on the other end of}} the telephone that [...] "probably they [...] <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> about it". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted [...] "a significant missed opportunity" [...] to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events [...] "wholly unbelievable". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it [...] " [...] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's [...] "inept handling" [...] of a genuine child protection case.|$|E
2500|$|He {{married his}} second wife, Yvonne Spenceley Gibb, on 17 October 1975. They had two children, Adam and Samantha Gibb, and their {{marriage}} lasted until his death. Maurice's alcoholic nadir came in 1991, {{when he pulled}} a gun on {{his wife and kids}} after a month-long bender. [...] She left him and immediately went over to brother Barry's house, refusing to come back until he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> about his drinking. Maurice went into rehab, calling Yvonne telling her he was going to stay because he really wanted to stop drinking. [...] She said that was the call she had been waiting for.|$|E

2500|$|The Andrews were {{sympathetic}} {{and tried to}} convince her that she need not fear the police because she had acted in self-defense. [...] Mrs. Andrew gave Dann a pair of her daughter's pants to wear. While she was putting them on, Philip Andrew was {{able to pick up}} and pocket the Beretta. [...] He suggested that she call her family. [...] Dann agreed and called her mother, telling her she <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> terrible and that the police were involved. [...] Philip took the phone and explained Dann's story about the rape and shooting, suggesting that Mrs. Wasserman come to get Dann; Mrs. Wasserman said she could not come because she did not have a car.|$|E

A victim of the Holocaust found solace when Don had given a stolen painting which held much sentimentality back to her. Prior to this she had said that he knew pain in losing his mother. All of this had surfaced deep emotions in Don. Also in this episode, Don has jokingly stated he was a [...] "lost cause," [...] when his father expressed a failure in parenting him. On the other hand, in the previous season's [...] "Calculated Risk," [...] Don showed a connection to a boy who had lost his mother, giving hope to Alan that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> right.|$|E

2500|$|Bogart had {{a lifelong}} disgust for the pretentious, fake or phony. Sensitive yet caustic, {{he was once}} again disgusted by the {{inferior}} movies he was performing in. He rarely saw his own films and avoided premieres. He even issued phony press releases about his private life to satisfy the curiosity of newspapers and the public. When he thought an actor, director, or a movie studio <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> shoddy, he spoke up about it and was willing to be quoted. He advised Robert Mitchum {{that the only way}} to stay alive in Hollywood was to be an [...] "againster." [...] As a result, he was not the most popular of actors, and some in the Hollywood community shunned him privately to avoid trouble with the studios. [...] But the Hollywood press, unaccustomed to candor, was delighted. Bogart once said: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 20/20 {{also asked}} Black Swan editor Andy Weisblum for {{his take on}} the math. He responded that [...] "there are about 35 shots that are full body shots in the movie. Of those 35 shots, 12 are Natalie, {{and then the rest}} are Sarah. But over the overall film, Natalie did a lot more than that. I mean, she did most of the other shots. It was {{sometimes}} hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was really focused on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar." ...|$|E
