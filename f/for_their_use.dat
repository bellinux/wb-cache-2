5|$|Bede relates {{that after}} the mission's arrival in Kent and {{conversion}} of the king, {{they were allowed to}} restore and rebuild old Roman churches <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use.</b> One such was Christ Church, Canterbury, which became Augustine's cathedral church. Archaeological evidence for other Roman churches having been rebuilt is slight, but the church of St Pancras in Canterbury has a Roman building at its core, although it is unclear whether that older building was a church during the Roman era. Another possible site is Lullingstone, in Kent, where a religious site dating to 300 was found underneath an abandoned church.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Davidson's return, England had {{retained}} the Ashes 2–1 after annihilating Australia by an innings in consecutive Tests. Prior to this, Australia had not lost by an innings since 1938, let alone twice in a row. The Surrey finger spin pairing of Jim Laker and Tony Lock had led the decimation, taking 38 of the 40 wickets of dry dusty wickets doctored <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use.</b> In Australia's match against Surrey before the Tests, the pair had taken 19 wickets as the tourists lost to a county side {{for the first time}} since 1912.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E

Military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> as a restraining force.|$|E
5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants.

They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use.</b> On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E

5|$|When Constantine V died in 775, {{his eldest}} son Leo IV ascended the Byzantine throne. Soon, Leo caused a rift with his half-brothers, when he confiscated {{a large amount of}} gold {{reserved}} <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> and distributed it to the army and the citizens of Constantinople as a donative. Then, in spring 776, a conspiracy headed by Nikephoros and involving a number of middle-ranking courtiers was discovered. Nikephoros himself was stripped of his rank, but otherwise not harmed, while the other plotters were tonsured as monks and exiled to Cherson in the Crimea.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E

5|$|Alan Grant, {{a writer}} from Scotland, {{got his start}} on 2000 AD as an {{assistant}} writer for John Wagner. Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner's {{in the creation of}} Judge Dredd comic strips. These stories were noted favorably <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> of socio-political commentary and satire. Together, the duo acquired employment with DC Comics. Dennis O'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988, hoping they would bring their gritty, violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines. Soon after, Wagner left the company, leaving Grant to continue the run on his own. Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd, Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book, and avoided using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations. Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe. Anarky was conceived singularly by Grant {{as a result of these}} circumstances, and Grant's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years.|$|E
5|$|DraftKings and FanDuel {{also became}} known <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> of direct {{response}} advertising on television, especially during sports telecasts. Capitalizing on {{the start of}} football season, iSpot.tv estimated that DraftKings and FanDuel collectively spent over $107 million on television advertising in September 2015 alone—with nearly half being spent on advertising during National Football League telecasts ($23.6 million by DraftKings, and $26.7 million spent by FanDuel). Of the total, $60.1 million was spent by DraftKings, with $7.95 million spent during college football games, $2.05 million during ESPN's sports news program SportsCenter, and $1.36 million during South Park episodes. The marketing push was met with a negative reaction from viewers on social networks such as Twitter, who considered the repetitive airplay of DFS commercials during football games to be an annoyance.|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of their history, Andalusians have been used for both riding and driving. Among the first horses used for classical dressage, they are still making a mark in international competition in dressage today. At the 2002 World Equestrian Games, two Andalusians were on the bronze-medal winning Spanish dressage team, a team that went on to take the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Today, the breed is increasingly being selectively bred for increased aptitude in classical dressage. Historically, however, they were also used as stock horses, especially suited to working with Iberian bulls, known for their aggressive temperaments. They were, and still are, known <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>use</b> in mounted bull fighting. Mares were traditionally used for la trilla, the Spanish process of threshing grain practiced until the 1960s. Mares, some pregnant or with foals at their side, spent full days trotting over the grain. As well as being a traditional farming practice, it also served as a test of endurance, hardiness and willingness for the maternal Andalusian lines.|$|E
