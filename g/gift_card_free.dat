The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. <b>Gift</b> <b>cards,</b> to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls.

40|$|The website, Plastic Jungle, {{is taking}} {{advantage}} of the rapidly growing <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> phenomena by creating a secondary market that enables consumers to buy, sell, and exchange <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> online at a discount. This paper examines the relationship between this secondary <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> market and the corporate bankruptcy risk of companies with <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> listed on the market. When a company issues a <b>gift</b> <b>card,</b> the card is unsecured debt and the cardholder becomes an unsecured creditor to the company. This paper investigates whether the cardholder acts similarly to other unsecured creditors or as someone who is merely holding another form of cash. As was expected, this paper finds evidence indicating the spot price on the <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> is correlated to some forms of bankruptcy risk. Specifically, the gift cardholders act like unsecured creditors in terms of excess stock returns, CDS price, and the idiosyncratic risk of companies...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gift</b> <b>cards</b> {{have been}} criticized for the ability of the issuer to set rules that are {{detrimental}} to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss. Over time fees may render the value of a <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the United States, many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for <b>gift</b> <b>cards.</b> Further, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a [...] "no fee, no expiration" [...] policy for their <b>gift</b> <b>cards,</b> whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post sale fees.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Clinician surveys provide {{critical}} information about many facets of health care, but are often challenging to implement. Our {{objective was to}} assess use by participants and non-participants of a prepaid <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> incentive that could be later reclaimed by the researchers if unused. Methods Clinicians were recruited {{to participate in a}} mailed or online survey as part of a study to characterize women’s primary health care provider attitudes towards breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines and practices (n[*]=[*] 177). An up-front incentive of a $ 50 <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> to a popular online retailer was included with the study invitation. Clinicians were informed that the <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> would expire if it went unused after 4 months. Outcome measures included use of <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> by participants and non-participants and comparison of hypothetical costs of different incentive strategies. Results 63. 5  % of clinicians who responded to the survey used the <b>gift</b> <b>card,</b> and only one provider who didn’t participate used the <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> (1. 6  %). Many of those who participated did not redeem their <b>gift</b> <b>cards</b> (36. 5  % of respondents). The price of the incentives actually claimed totaled $ 3700, which was {{less than half of the}} initial outlay. Since some of the respondents did not redeem their <b>gift</b> <b>cards,</b> the cost of incentives was less than it might have been if we had provided a conditional incentive of $ 50 to responders after they had completed the survey. Conclusions Redeemable online <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> codes may provide an effective way to motivate clinicians to participate in surveys...|$|R

40|$|Archival data of {{unrestricted}} {{and restricted}} <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> transactions was compared with national level consumer spending data {{from both the}} U.

The objective for this comparison was to investigate the motivational power of unrestricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> compared to cash rewards, restricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> and other hedonic tangible incentive. Through results interpretation, the data supported the hypotheses that people perceive and use unrestricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> as a cash carrying medium rather than a tangible reward. A restricted <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> that is hedonic by design constrains its recipients to hedonic purchase and removes the guilt and eliminates the justification process. The results also suggested that the elimination of justification seems to be associated to not only the hedonic dimension of goods/services but also transaction size...|$|R

50|$|Unless the <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> is {{obtained}} {{at a discount}} (paying less than the actual value of the card), buying scrip with ordinary money is arguably pointless, as it then ties up the money until it is used, and usually it may only be used at one store.

This study identifies that marketing activities, like store promotions, based on an understanding of consumer purchase involvement, can facilitate quicker redemption of gift vouchers. The {{results of this study suggest}} that store promotions facilitate moving <b>gift</b> <b>card</b> recipients from a state of volition control to elaborating on the potential of adding value to the gift vouchers, inevitably bringing forward the hierarchy of effects that expedite consumers becoming regular store patrons who gift the store's vouchers to others.
