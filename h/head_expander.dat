40|$|LecturePg. 95 - 102 Turboexpander thermal {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} parameter in the process design of hydrogen purification plants. When a process requires low flow and high <b>head,</b> <b>expander</b> {{thermal efficiency}} can only be improved by increasing rotational speed. This trend towards higher speeds is often limited by the stability and rotordynamic characteristics of the rotor-bearing system. High rotational speeds necessitate the use of smaller diameter bearings to maintain acceptable surface speeds. Conventional tilt pad bearings cannot achieve the required clearance and preload due to the stackup of manufacturing tolerances inherent in their multi-piece design. A new style of tilting pad bearings which are manufactured using wire EDM technology, offered {{a solution to the}} size and stability problem. Herein, the authors present an application of high-speed turboexpanders in a hydrogen purification process. The thermal efficiency of this system is approximately 20 percent better than the equipment it replaced. Some problems of a minor nature were experienced during the commissioning of these units and will be discussed along with the approach and solutions used to solve these problems...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} describes {{techniques and}} results of measurement with TIRA vibration generator. A method of experimental modal analysis allows next restore of vibration data. The goal is check validity of <b>head</b> <b>expanders</b> and screw connection. This process is based to using ME’scope environment. Another goal is check possibilities of dSPACE platform to vibration measurement. This task includes design of connection between dSPACE system and power amplifier, creating of {{graphical user interface}} and analyzing main configuration parameters to improve quality of drive signal...|$|R
50|$|Today's <b>expander</b> <b>heads</b> have {{a leading}} end much smaller in {{diameter}} than the trailing (bursting) end, {{small enough to}} fit through the pipe that will be replaced. The smaller leading end is designed to guide the <b>expander</b> <b>head</b> through the existing pipe; earlier models did not have this feature and lost course at times, resulting in incomplete pipe bursts and project failures.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} key pieces of {{equipment}} used in a pipebursting operation: the <b>expander</b> <b>head,</b> pulling rods, a pulling machine, a retaining device, and a hydraulic power pack.|$|R
50|$|A {{machine is}} set in the {{receiving}} pit to pull the <b>expander</b> <b>head</b> and new pipe into the line. The head is pulled by heavy, interlocking links that form a chain. Each link weighs several hundred pounds.|$|R
40|$|Cryocoolers {{are well}} known sources of {{harmonic}} disturbance forces. In this paper two miniaturized, add-on, vacuum compatible, active vibration control systems for cryocoolers are discussed. The first, called VIS 6, is an active/passive isolation hexapod and has control authority in all six degrees of freedom. This capability is desirable when reduction of all cryocooler disturbance loads, including the radial loads, is required. Each of the six identical hexapod struts consists of a miniature moving coil electromagnetic proof mass actuator, custom piezoelectric wafer load cell, viscoelastic passive isolation stage, and axial end flexures. The first five disturbance tones are reduced over a bandwidth of 250 Hz using a filtered-x least mean square algorithm. Load reductions of 30 - 40 dB were measured both axially and radially. The second system, called VRS 1, is a pure active control system designed to reduce axial <b>expander</b> <b>head</b> disturbance loads. It works {{on the basis of}} a counter-force developed from an electromagnetic proof mass actuator. Error signals are provided from a commercial accelerometer to a standalone digital signal processor, on which a filtered-x least means square control algorithm is implemented. Over the 500 Hz control bandwidth, the 11 disturbance tones were reduced on between 14 to 40 dB...|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{enforced}} response {{analysis was}} performed on a multiple degree of freedom <b>expander</b> <b>head</b> shaker table {{to aid in the}} design of the table structure and vibration control system. The payload for this shaker system is a spacecraft with a multitude of flexible modes across a broad frequency band. A Craig-Bampton representation of the spacecraft was used to expedite analysis of multiple shaker table designs. The analysis examines the required forces in the actuators for a constant amplitude base acceleration sine sweep test, the resulting forces in the spacecraft and table attachment restraints, and the resulting accelerations on the spacecraft structure. The results show the spacecraft response at low frequencies is very high near the tip due to the low order spacecraft bending and axial modes. The high response can be addressed by notching the input vibration levels to avoid overtesting the spacecraft. At frequencies above 25 Hz, the spacecraft modal effective masses are very small, and the response of the shaker table dominates the response. Anti-resonances of the shaker table in the frequency range of interest reduce the acceleration output and require much higher actuator forces to achieve the acceleration specification. These effects may require stiffening the shaker structure to move the modes out of the test frequency range or increasing the shaker table damping...|$|R
40|$|Vibration fixtures, at times, have {{resonant}} frequencies {{that exist}} in the frequency range needed for conducting vibration tests. These resonant frequencies can cause significant problems when running vibration tests over ranges which include these resonances. A test engineer will attempt to control the shaker system through a feedback accelerometer which controls the level of vibration input into the test specimen. However, the control accelerometer can only control the level of vibration at that point. It cannot change the resonant behavior of the vibration fixture. Some problems involving this are described in this article along with some basic material about these phenomena. Often times, vibration tests, are performed to qualify or verify the acceptability of specific hardware for certain environments. We use shaker systems to generate forces or accelerations to replicate some known operating condition or to generate an input spectrum that envelops the actual environment. Usually, a specification mandates the particular input that is needed to satisfy the requirement. The interface between the shaker and the test article is the test fixture. As defined in this article, the test fixture includes the shaker armature, <b>expander</b> <b>head</b> (or slip plate) as well as the attachment fixture (i. e.,. the item designed to accommodate the test specimen). So, when we refer to the fixture, we mean everything between the shaker’s driver coil and the test specimen. (Just because we can’t see the armature, doesn’t mean that it’s not part of the fixture setup). Figure 1 shows a typical schematic of the elements of a fixture...|$|R
