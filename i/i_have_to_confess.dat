500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peppino’s mother, Felicia Bartolotta Impastato, {{reacted to}} the {{conviction}} in a very dignified manner: [...] "I never have had any feelings of revenge. All I have done is call for justice for my son’s death. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that, {{after so many years}} of waiting, I had lost faith; I never thought we would reach this point. Now I feel a great deal of contentment and of satisfaction. I always knew what had happened. Badalamenti used to call my husband Luigi to complain about Peppino, and my husband begged him not to kill the boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Lingard, {{we forget}} {{how we have}} met, we forget what is going on. We mustn't. I won't say that you placed your belief wrongly but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> {{something}} to you. I must tell you how I came here to-night. Jorgenson [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that it {{generally}} was not, {{and that this}} was part of my grief with it.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Richmond {{broke off}} abruptly. [...] "I {{spent three days}} trying to tell this to Dr. Martineau. But he wasn't the priest <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> and the words wouldn't come. I can <b>confess</b> it <b>to</b> you readily enough...." ...|$|R
6000|$|Shamefully <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that <b>I</b> did not know; had {{not even}} inquired. [...] "It is my miserable ingratitude. I just blow hot and cold; that is my nature." ...|$|R
60|$|On the whole, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> {{to having}} allowed myself perhaps a wider latitude, and to having taken greater liberties {{than was the}} case with the essays constituting the {{previous}} collection. This, however, applies, where applicable, to the parts rather than to the whole.|$|E
60|$|A week or {{so after}} the {{election}} I {{received a letter from}} George Hutchins asking me to come to Elkington. I shall not enter into the details of the legal matter involved. Many times that winter I was a guest at the yellow-brick house, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess,</b> as spring came on, that I made several trips to Elkington which business necessity did not absolutely demand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and Dulcie." [...] Annette laughed. [...] "Dulcie is our cow. It {{is a great}} {{question}} with Jack Hastings whether Edmund dotes more on Dulcie, or Dulcie dotes more on Edmund. When he goes to San Francisco Dulcie is miserable. So is Edmund, until he hastens back. Oh, Dulcie has given me no few jealous pangs. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> he understands her as no one else does." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> he was right. In {{less than}} five minutes he had the gear- case in two pieces, lying on the path, and was grovelling for screws. He said it was always a mystery to him the way screws disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, she {{was just}} wondering," [...] he explained, [...] "if the costumes are in GENERAL use." [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that they were, and I {{mentioned}} further {{that some of them}} (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> a lot of genuine, greasy last- century things), had served their time, a hundred years ago, on living, world-stained men and women. [...] "We'll put on anything that fits," [...] said the Major.|$|R
6000|$|... "Major Chevenix," [...] put in Miss Gilchrist in {{her most}} Rhadamanthine voice, [...] "always sets me in mind {{of a pair of}} scissors." [...] She opened and shut the pair in her hand, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that the stiff and sawing action was admirably illustrative. [...] "But I wish to heaven, madam," [...] thought I, [...] "you could have chosen another simile!" ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{it is my}} {{political}} book comes to an end, {{and in a sense}} my book ends altogether. For the rest is but to tell how I was swept out of this great world of political possibilities. I close this Third Book as I opened it, with an admission of difficulties and complexities, but now with a pile of manuscript before me <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> them unsurmounted and still entangled.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> {{that the}} devil {{whose name is}} Jealousy has entered into me, and is {{threatening}} the tranquillity of my married life. You dislike Iris, I know--and she returns your hostile feeling towards her. Try to do my wife justice, nevertheless, as I do. I don't believe my distrust of her has any excuse--and yet, I am jealous. More unreasonable still, I am as fond of her as I {{was in the first}} days of the honeymoon. Is she as fond as ever of me? You were a married man when I was a boy. Let me give you the means of forming an opinion by a narrative of her conduct, under (what I admit to have been) very trying circumstances.|$|E
60|$|But {{the book}} I had bought was a success, a great success, if the {{newspapers}} and the reports of the sales were to be trusted. I read the criticisms out of curiosity {{more than any other}} prompting, and no two of them were alike: they veered from extreme negative to extreme positive. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that it gratified me not a little to find the negatives for the most part of my poor way of thinking. The positives, on the other hand, declared the gifted young author to have found a manner of treatment of social life entirely new. Other critics still insisted it was social ridicule: but if this were so, the satire was too delicate for ordinary detection.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{go right}} over to Spencervale after it {{tomorrow}}," [...] said Anne resolutely, [...] "and {{you must come}} with me. It will be such a weight off my mind, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to town day after tomorrow and how can I face your Aunt Josephine without a willow-ware platter? It would be even worse than the time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> about jumping on the spare room bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{this latter}} idea in my mind, I {{examined}} all the coffee-cups most carefully, remembering {{that it was}} Mrs. Cavendish who had brought Mademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from each cup, and had them analysed--with no result. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> counted the cups carefully, {{in the event of}} one having been removed. Six persons had taken coffee, and six cups were duly found. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> myself mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh she {{was just}} wondering," [...] he explained, [...] "if the costumes are in GENERAL use." [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that they were, and I {{mentioned}} further that some of them--I had a lot of, genuine greasy last-century things--had served their time, a hundred years ago, on living, world-stained men and women; on figures not perhaps so far removed, in that vanished world, from THEIR type, the Monarchs', QUOI! of a breeched and bewigged age. [...] "We'll put, on anything that FITS," [...] said the Major.|$|R
6000|$|And now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> {{that all}} this time, whilst Ethel Newcome has been growing in grace with my wife, poor Clive has been lapsing sadly out of favour. She has no {{patience}} with Clive. She drubs her little foot when his name is mentioned and turns the subject. Whither are all the tears and pities fled now? Mrs. Laura has transferred all her regard to Ethel, and when that lady's ex-suitor writes to his old friend, or other news is had of him, Laura flies out in her usual tirades against the world, the horrid wicked selfish world, which spoils everybody who comes near it. What has Clive done, in vain his apologist asks, that an old friend should be so angry with him? ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not like}} it yesterday. I thought Lake Tahoe was much finer. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> now, however, that my {{judgment}} erred somewhat, though not extravagantly. I always had an idea that Como was a vast basin of water, like Tahoe, shut in by great mountains. Well, the border of huge mountains is here, but the lake itself is not a basin. It is as crooked as any brook, and only from one-quarter to two-thirds {{as wide as the}} Mississippi. There is not a yard of low ground on either side of it --nothing but endless chains of mountains that spring abruptly from the water's edge and tower to altitudes varying from a thousand to two thousand feet. Their craggy sides are clothed with vegetation, and white specks of houses peep out from the luxuriant foliage everywhere; they are even perched upon jutting and picturesque pinnacles a thousand feet above your head.|$|E
60|$|But I must beg you {{to dismiss}} all such scenic prettiness, {{suitable}} {{as they may}} be to a clergyman's character and complexion; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that Mr. Tryan's study was a very ugly little room indeed, with an ugly slapdash pattern on the walls, an ugly carpet on the floor, and an ugly view of cottage roofs and cabbage-gardens from the window. His own person his writing-table, and his book-case, were the only objects in the room that had the slightest air of refinement; and the sole provision for comfort was a clumsy straight-backed arm-chair covered with faded chintz. The man who could live in such a room, unconstrained by poverty, must either have his vision fed from within by an intense passion, or he must have chosen that least attractive form of self-mortification which wears no haircloth and has no meagre days, but accepts the vulgar, the commonplace, and the ugly, whenever the highest duty seems to lie among them.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> gone a-roving {{with a pair}} of drovers {{and their}} cattle, <b>to</b> <b>having</b> used a false name, <b>to</b> <b>having</b> murdered or half-murdered a fellow-creature in a scuffle on the moors, and <b>to</b> <b>having</b> {{suffered}} a couple of quite innocent men to lie some time in prison on a charge from which <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> immediately freed them. All this I gave him first of all, to be done with the worst of it; and all this he took with gravity, but without the least appearance of surprise.|$|R
60|$|My {{chances of}} {{discovering}} her whereabouts, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> myself (when {{it came to}} the point) were extremely slender. She had vanished from my horizon, melted into space. My sole hint of a clue consisted {{in the fact that the}} letter she sent me had been posted at Basingstoke. Here, then, was my problem: given an envelope with the Basingstoke postmark, to find in what part of Europe, Asia, Africa, or America the writer of it might be discovered. It opened up a fine field for speculation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} anybody would laugh at that?" [...] Wakeham would pathetically enquire at the {{termination}} of his supremest effort. And honestly <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> <b>I</b> did not think any living being would.|$|R
6000|$|As to {{the latter}} half of the paragraph, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> a doubt whether it has any {{definite}} meaning. But I imagine that the Duke is alluding to my assertion that the law of gravitation is nowise [...] "suspended" [...] or [...] "defied" [...] when a man lifts his arm; but that, under such circumstances, part of the store of energy in the universe operates on the arm at a mechanical advantage as against the operation of another part. I was simple enough to think that no one who had as much knowledge of physiology as is to be found in an elementary primer, or who had ever heard of the greatest physical generalisation of modern {291} times--the doctrine of the conservation of energy--would dream of doubting my statement; and I was further simple enough to think that no one who lacked these qualifications would feel tempted to charge me with error. It appears that my simplicity is greater than my powers of imagination.|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} I cannot hear people rejoice in their summer sojourn as {{beyond the reach}} of excursionists without a certain rebellion; and yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> also that after {{spending}} a Sunday afternoon of late July, four or five years ago, with the excursionists at one of the beaches near New York, I was rather glad that my own summer sojourn was not within reach of them. I know very well that the excursionists must go somewhere, and as a man and a brother I am willing they should go anywhere, but as a friend of quiet and seclusion I should be sorry to have them come much where I am. It is not because I would deny them a share of any pleasure I enjoy, but because they are so many and I am so few that I think they would get all the pleasure and I none. I hope the reader will see how this attitude distinguishes me from the selfish people who inhumanly exult in their remoteness from excursionists.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} my ill-concealed bias in favour of Lady Harman <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that she began this {{conflict}} rashly, planlessly, with no equipment and no definite end. Particularly I would emphasize {{that she had no}} definite end. She had wanted merely to establish a right to go out by herself occasionally, exercise a certain choice of friends, take on in fact the privileges of a grown-up person, and in asserting that she had never anticipated that the participation of the household would be invoked, or that a general breach might open between herself and her husband. It had seemed just a definite little point at issue, but at Sir Isaac's angry touch a dozen other matters that had seemed safely remote, matters she had never yet quite properly thought about, had been drawn into controversy. It was not only that he drew in things from outside; he evoked things within herself. She discovered she was disposed to fight not simply to establish certain liberties for herself but also--which had certainly not been in her mind before--to keep her husband away from herself. Something latent in the situation had surprised her with this effect. It had arisen out of the quarrel like a sharpshooter out of an ambuscade. Her right to go out alone had now only the value of a mere pretext for far more extensive independence. The ultimate extent of these independences, she still dared not contemplate.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{addressed}} {{my first}} letter <b>to</b> you <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never {{so much as}} heard of the [...] "Eagle" [...] scandal. But I am thankful that my perception of the inevitable tendency of all religious autocracies towards evil was clear enough {{to bring about a}} provisional condemnation of Mr. Booth's schemes in my mind. Supposing that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> decided the other way, with what sort of feeling should <b>I</b> <b>have</b> faced my friend, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that the money had passed into the absolute control of a person about the character of whose administration this [269] concurrence of damnatory evidence was already extant? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> my {{total and}} humiliating {{ignorance of the}} subject at issue. What, for example, were Fraunhofer's lines? McArdle had just been {{studying}} the matter {{with the aid of}} our tame scientist at the office, and he picked from his desk two of those many-coloured spectral bands which bear a general resemblance to the hat-ribbons of some young and ambitious cricket club. He pointed out to me that there were certain black lines which formed crossbars upon the series of brilliant colours extending from the red at one end through gradations of orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo to the violet at the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot truthfully {{describe}} {{my mental}} attitude as acquiescence {{and far less}} cheerful acquiescence," [...] grumbled Summerlee over his pipe. [...] "I submit because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to.</b> <b>I</b> <b>confess</b> that <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> liked another year of life to finish my classification of the chalk fossils." ...|$|R
6000|$|Flora and I {{were married}} early in June, {{and had been}} settled for little over six months, amid the splendours of Amersham Place, when news came of the Emperor's escape from Elba. Throughout the {{consequent}} alarums and excursions of the Hundred Days (as M. de Chambord named them for us), <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that the Vicomte Anne sat still and warmed his hands at the domestic hearth. To be sure, Napoleon had been my master, and I had no love for the cocarde blanche. But here was I, an Englishman, already, in legal but inaccurate phrase, a [...] "naturalised" [...] one, having, as Mr. Romaine put it, {{a stake in the}} country, not to speak of a nascent interest in its game-laws and the local administration of justice. In short, here was a situation to tickle a casuist. It did not, I may say, tickle me in the least, but played the mischief with my peace. If you, my friends, having weighed the pro and contra, would have counselled inaction, possibly, allowing for the hébétude de foyer and the fact that Flora was soon to become a mother, you might have predicted it. At any rate I sat still and read the newspapers: and on the top of them came a letter from Ronald, announcing that the 4-th had their marching, or rather their sailing, orders, and that within a week his boat would rock by the pier of Leith to convey him and his comrades to join the Duke of Wellington's forces in the Low Countries. Forthwith nothing would suit my dear girl but we must post to Edinburgh to bid him farewell--in a chariot, this time, with a box seat for her maid and Mr. Rowley. We reached Swanston in time for Ronald to spend the eve of his departure with us at the Cottage; and very gallant the boy looked in his scarlet uniform, which he wore for the ladies' benefit, and which (God forgive us men!) they properly bedewed with their tears.|$|E
5000|$|Italian: Tesoro, devo confessarti una cosa (Darling, <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Confess</b> One Thing to You) ...|$|E
5000|$|The episode title, Sweetheart, <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Confess</b> is {{from the}} lyrics of the song, [...] "Could I Leave You?" [...] from the Stephen Sondheim musical, Follies.|$|E
60|$|I need {{scarcely}} {{say that}} I was deeply interested in Ernest Everhard. It {{was not alone}} {{what he had said}} and how he had said it, but it was the man himself. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never met a man like him. I suppose that was why, in spite of my twenty-four years, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not married. <b>I</b> liked him; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> it <b>to</b> myself. And my like for him was founded on things beyond intellect and argument. Regardless of his bulging muscles and prize-fighter's throat, he impressed me as an ingenuous boy. I felt that under the guise of an intellectual swashbuckler was a delicate and sensitive spirit. I sensed this, in ways I knew not, save that they were my woman's intuitions.|$|R
60|$|Neither Fields nor Doctor Holmes smoked, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>confess</b> that <b>I</b> did not; but Lowell smoked {{enough for}} all three, and the spark of his cigar {{began to show}} in the waning light before we rose from the table. The time that never had, nor can ever have, its fellow for me, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come to an end, as all times must, and when I shook hands with Lowell in parting, he {{overwhelmed}} me by saying that if I thought of going to Concord he would send me a letter to Hawthorne. I was not to see Lowell again during my stay in Boston; but Doctor Holmes asked me to tea for the next evening, and Fields said I must come to breakfast {{with him in the}} morning.|$|R
6000|$|... --And {{you made}} me <b>confess</b> <b>to</b> you, Stephen said, thrilled by his touch, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> you so many other things, <b>have</b> <b>I</b> not? ...|$|R
