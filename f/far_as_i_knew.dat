2500|$|Abbess’s initial {{idea for}} the film was his fondness for the name ‘Gabriel.’ He and co-writer Matt Hylton Todd {{researched}} angels and demons in various religions, drawing figures from Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam as well as John Milton’s Paradise Lost. The writers chose their favourite seven angels and favourite seven demons to create an [...] "all-star" [...] supernatural battle. Abbess says, [...] "There hadn’t really been a movie about angels. Not like this. I hadn’t even seen Constantine at the time, nor the one with Christopher Walken (The Prophecy) in it, so as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> – and, anyway, this {{is very different from}} those – it hadn’t been done before." [...] The writers were interested in the backstory and mythology of purgatory, and aimed to focus more on the characters than the special effects. Gabriel was deliberately designed to be commercial and [...] "franchiseable." [...] It was written as the first part of a trilogy, and, if financially successful, will be followed by two sequels that will explore the world outside purgatory.|$|E

I had exactly obeyed my instructions, {{fulfilled}} my warranty to the utmost in my knowledge and power. There was, therefore, left for me in the present nothing but to wait.|$|E

6000|$|... "I have, your honour. Sure, I {{was sent}} for to the colonel's quarters, and there I found a tall gentleman, whom I {{had never seen}} before, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} that I didn't feel cold, and didn't feel hungry, and didn't feel thirsty. That was the whole round of human feelings, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> except the pain of being beaten.|$|E
60|$|This {{interview}} {{took place}} at Windsor, where I had passed (as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew)</b> my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all necessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.|$|E
60|$|So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{there are}} no Peace Commissioners in the city or {{likely to be in}} it.|$|R

60|$|I {{was beside}} myself with anxiety for {{knowledge}} of {{the progress of the}} expedition which was to rescue Dejah Thoris. I felt that Carthoris would not let the matter drop, were he free to act, but in so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> he also might be a prisoner in Zat Arrras' pits.|$|E
60|$|You {{stated that}} the working classes were better dressed abroad than in England?--As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> that is {{certainly}} the fact.|$|R

6000|$|... "This {{will not}} hold long," [...] I thought to myself; for I was not {{accustomed}} to find in women or girls any power of self-control, or strength of self-denial. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> them, {{the chance of a}} gossip about their usually trivial secrets, their often very washy and paltry feelings, was a treat not to be readily foregone.|$|E
6000|$|The old priest, who {{at first}} {{had seemed to}} me so deaf and infirm, must yet have {{retained}} his faculties in tolerable preservation; absorbed in his book as he appeared, without once lifting his head, or, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> turning his eyes, he perceived the point towards which my attention was drawn, and, in a slow distinct voice, dropped, concerning it, these four observations:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{expedition}} was {{no longer}} one of rescue but of revenge. I did not remind Kantos Kan of the terrible fact that ere we could hope to enter the Temple of Issus, the Princess of Helium would be no more. In so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she might be already dead, for I {{did not know the}} exact date on which she first viewed Issus.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile, Zangwill's {{study was}} the only warm place in London--so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> His glowing fire of hard coal was a {{powerful}} lure, and I was often there, reacting to {{the warmth of his}} rug like a chilled insect. On his hearth I thawed into something like good humor, and with his knowledge of American steam heat he was fitted to understand my vocal delight.|$|E
60|$|Some of my shipmates {{seemed to}} doubt {{the truth of this}} story; but, for my part, I {{believed}} it, because the mate was a grave, truthful man, though he was gruff, and never told lies, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> Moreover, a case of the same kind happened some years afterwards, to a messmate of mine, while he was serving aboard the Royal Bounty, on the 28th of May 1817.|$|E
6000|$|No one else, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> was {{transmitting}} this Coast {{life into}} literature. Edwin Markham was an Oakland school teacher, Frank Norris, a college student, and Jack London {{a boy in}} short trousers. Miller dominated the coast landscape. The mountains, the streams, the pines were his. A dozen times as I passed some splendid peak I quoted his lines. [...] "Sierras! Eternal tents of snow that flash o'er battlements of mountains." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Maiden {{described}} Swainson's {{efforts as}} {{an exhibition of}} reckless species-making that, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> stands unparalleled {{in the annals of}} botanical literature.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{reason at}} all, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> only asked the question," [...] {{and now the}} man tried to speak as {{carelessly}} as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean Nokes. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> he's {{a decent}} man. You wouldn't have me not employ a man {{just because you}} had {{dismissed}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|No one, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> at {{that time}} possessed an extra, {{light-weight}} suit for hot-weather wear, although a long, yellow, linen robe called a [...] "duster" [...] was in fashion among the smart dressers. John Gammons, who was somewhat of a dandy in matters of toilet, {{was among the first}} of my circle to purchase one of these very ultra garments, and Burton soon followed his lead, and then my own discontent began. I, too, desired a duster.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was already}} past noon. Why was I {{wandering}} {{alone in this}} city of the dead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends that I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the chemists' shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled the two sodden creatures of despair, who so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> shared the city with myself. [...] .|$|E
60|$|I had fished {{from dawn}} till almost six o'clock, one morning, {{and had taken}} two good trout, which were all that the stream promised to yield for the day. Then I thought of a little pond in the woods over the mountain, which looked trouty when I had {{discovered}} it and which, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> had never been fished with a fly. Led more by the fun of exploring than by the expectation of fish, I started to try the new waters.|$|E
60|$|So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> {{there is}} no {{monograph}} on this subject, or certainly I would have consulted it {{for the purpose of}} this Christmas Annual.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this moment}} I have stated, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> nothing but well-authenticated facts, and the {{immediate}} conclusions which they force upon the mind.|$|R
