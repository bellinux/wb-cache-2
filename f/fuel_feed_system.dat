40|$|As more {{stringent}} emission limits and low consumption requirements also involve s. i. 2 -stroke engines, {{one of the}} most important design modifications that can cope with these constraints is to perform the scavenging process using pure air, which means not only fuel-free air but also oil-free air. A new single-cylinder prototype engine, equipped with a gasoline direct injection (GDI) apparatus has therefore been designed and built. In order to reduce manufacturing costs, this prototype was obtained by modifying a mass-produced 4 -stroke 4 -cylinder automotive engine. Apart from the replacement of the original indirect <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> with GDI, two more remarkable features should be pointed out: the use of a force-fed lubrication system, like those used in current 4 -stroke engines and, as a consequence, the use of an external scavenging pump. Before using an electronically controlled direct injection system on the new prototype engine, the whole apparatus was tested on a mass-produced crankcase scavenged 2 -stroke engine (Husqvarna WR 250) in order to evaluate the magnitude of the improvements. A comparison of a carburettor <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> with a direct fuel injection system was carried out, under cubic power requirements, to check whether the GDI strategies were advantageous.

40|$|A {{fluidized}} bed gasification (FBG) pilot plant {{was designed and}} constructed at the University of Saskatchewan Chemical Engineering Department Fluidization Laboratory. FBG is a thermo-chemical method for converting solid biomass to a gaseous fuel, termed syngas. Several instrumentation and control issues were particularly challenging with this pilot plant, including development of the <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>system,</b> pressure measurement of high temperature fluids, and metering of steam as a process reactant. The <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> was tested using MBM (meat and bone meal) to determine the output rate stability, and predictability and measurability of the system as the components in the <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> were integrated. The <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> that was tested included a 150 mm primary metering screw conveyor, a 150 mm rotary airlock, and a 50 mm secondary injection screw conveyor. Each component of the system was fitted with a 3 -phase electric motor and a variable speed drive {{to allow for a}} variable output rate. The weighing system that was integral to the metering conveyor was tested as well, but upon pressurizing the metering conveyor and hopper, the weighing system sustained an unreasonable amount of noise. Integrating a pneumatic injection nozzle with the injection conveyor was found to work effectively both under ambient temperatures and hot FBG conditions up to 725 oC. Above 725 oC, {{it was found that the}} test fuel would char and coat the nozzle, causing it to plug. Testing of the <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> with the injection nozzle removed illustrated that the system could work well without it. It was determined that the injection conveyor speed to metering conveyor speed ratio that should be used for this system was 1 : 110 for absolute rotational speeds, or 1 : 1 of the full conveyor speeds. The complete system, including the injection nozzle, was analyzed and determined to produce a fuel output rate (FS) for % speeds from 5 - 25 %, which roughly corresponded to the desired plant <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> rate of 1 - 5 g/s. Techniques for remote pressure measurement of {{fluidized bed}}s were examined as well, including the use of long tubes to cool hot gases and filters for blocking solid particles. The pressure measurement delay of these techniques was examined in comparison to a direct local measurement. This was conducted by comparing the pressure readings from two identical sensors; one mounted directly to a manifold, and the other mounted via a variable assembly (comprised of a variable length of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 ") PE tubing and a porous plate filter). Assemblies without a porous plate were found to have a minimal delay of up to 0. 303 seconds for 30 m length of PE impulse tubing. More significant delays were found for systems using both a 10 media grade porous plate filter and impulse tubing; a 3 m tube length with filter has a delay of up to 0. 221 s, and a 30 m impulse tube combined with the filter has a measurement delay of up to 1. 915 s, a significant delay in cases where high-frequency analysis of pressure is used for bed agglomeration prediction, or systems where fast response is required to changing pressure conditions. Additionally, a steam flow measurement system using an orifice plate and differential pressure sensor was installed and calibrated. By collecting time-based steam samples and process data, the physical system coefficients were determined for this system, allowing for steam flow measurement, accurate within 5 % over a flow range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 g/s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{recent decades}} several {{industrial}} activities polluted the soil, which caused {{the accumulation of}} heavy metals to an extent greater than the natural concentration. This is mainly typical of countries, where mining and industry plays or has {{played an important role}} in the economy. The utilization of these lands is an economic interest, since locating the contamination, controlling its spreading and maintaining the area has costs. One of the methods for remediation is phytoextraction, during which heavy metals, especially harmful to water and soil, are removed from the soil by plants capable of accumulating contaminants. However, during the combustion of these plants their heavy metal content is replaced into the formed gaseous and solid combustion remains, so the hazard, composition and treating method of these remains must be defined by the appropriate examinations. In this article we present some part of the results of this research, where we examine the gaseous and solid pollutant content of flue gas formed during combustion, as well as the heavy metal content of fly ash.
