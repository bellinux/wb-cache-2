500|$|The {{public opinion}} and the media in the city were {{overwhelmingly}} against the strikers. All the city's newspapers ran editorials denouncing the strike, which was perceived as unpatriotic and harmful to the war effort; a number of editorials also decried the racial nature of the strike. Most of the {{letters to the editor}} condemned the strike. The radio stations in the city denounced the strike as well, as did the national press. The New York Times wrote: [...] "It would be hard to find in the whole history of American labor a strike in which so much <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> for so base a purpose". The Wall Street Journal editorial condemned the strike but stated that the powers exercised by the government in ending the strike were only justified by the war time conditions. The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, while denouncing the strike, tried to put the blame for causing it on the CIO-affiliated Transport Workers Union, and accused the Roosevelt administration of acting too slowly because of its support for the CIO.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the floods}} of 2004-2005, the {{riparian}} areas of Hendrick Island have been choked by debris {{carried to the}} island from upstream, especially along the western shore. Though access to {{the interior of the}} island from the western shore is now limited, it appears that little ecological <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship had}} {{approximately}} 220,000 litres of diesel {{fuel on board}} and 23,000 litres of lubricating oil. She was also carrying 16 vehicles, and her foundering created an oil slick that quickly spread throughout the sound. Containment efforts began that morning, and on March 25, 2006, officials said that it [...] "appears no major <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to the environment in the area." [...] The long-term effects on Wright Sound's biosystem, and especially its shellfish population, are not yet known. Officials doubted any salvaging of the vessel would be possible. Burrard Clean Operations was hired to conduct environmental response operations as required.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately, {{no great}} <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> One side board <b>had</b> <b>been</b> loosened, {{but this was}} easily nailed tight, and then the {{houseboat}} proceeded on her way as before.|$|R
50|$|After that John Coll {{was able}} to read his email and {{continue}} the demonstration as no <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to the account (although Oz and Yug had sent a few emails).|$|R
6000|$|... "A breakdown!" [...] exclaimed the captain, {{and so it}} proved. The screw {{had become}} {{entangled}} in the limb of a tree, and sufficient <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to render the screw useless.|$|R
2500|$|This artistic legacy {{has been}} {{decimated}} by neglect, war, and vandalism. [...] Much of the <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in the 20th century. Some French {{scholars such as}} Henri Parmentier and Jean Boisselier {{were able to take}} photographs, create drawings, and pen descriptions of works which have been destroyed in the meantime. [...] Neglect continues to endanger the legacy of Champa to this day, especially the neglect of the inscribed stone steles, the source of much valuable information on the history of Champa. [...] The participants in the Vietnam War wrought their share of devastation, wiping out for example the vestiges of the Buddhist monastery at Dong Duong (Quáº£ng Nam). [...] Willful vandalism and pilfering are an ongoing concern.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report by}} the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) {{released}} on 28 July 2014 said that based on [...] "conservative estimates", at least 1,129 civilians had been killed since mid-April during the fighting, and at least 3,442 had been wounded. In addition, the report found that at least 750 million US dollars worth of <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to property and infrastructure in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Human Rights Watch said that Ukrainian government forces, pro-government paramilitaries, and the insurgents had used unguided Grad rockets in attacks on civilian areas, stating that [...] "The use of indiscriminate rockets in populated areas violates international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, and may amount to war crimes". The New York Times reported that {{the high rate of}} civilian deaths had [...] "left the population in eastern Ukraine embittered toward Ukraine's pro-Western government", and that this sentiment helped to [...] "spur recruitment" [...] for the insurgents. By early January 2015, the number of deaths caused by the war had risen to 4,707, despite the signing of the Minsk Protocol in early September 2014.|$|E

50|$|Zijlaard-Van Moorsel, who {{had crashed}} on the {{penultimate}} lap {{of the road}} race three days earlier, showed no serious <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> as she successfully defended her Olympic individual time trial title.|$|R
60|$|All lost no time {{in getting}} away from the {{vicinity}} of the hornets' nest, and presently the pests left them {{and went back to the}} hole, to see what <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{those in}} the second car got out and walked to that which was stalled in the bushes. They found Dick and Fred walking around the machine trying to learn if any <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Seven of you, eh?" [...] was the teacher's sour comment. [...] "A fine {{piece of}} business, truly." [...] He {{thought for a}} moment. [...] "Come with me, all of you, and we'll see what <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> down in the office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you do it}} now?" [...] she asked. [...] "Can you do it to-day? I don't want {{a minute}} lost. I have not been outside to see what <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> but {{the first thing to}} do is to take your house away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Gilbert, {{have you}} heard the news? Mr. Levi Boulter's old house was struck and burned to the ground. It {{seems to me that}} I'm dreadfully wicked to feel glad over THAT, when so much <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b> Mr. Boulter says he {{believes}} the A.V.I.S. magicked up that storm on purpose." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richard Foster Howard, then {{director}} of the Dallas Museum of Art, defended Zorach [...] and the sculptor {{went so far as}} to revise his model so that the figures were clothed, but the <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
60|$|The gale was as {{short-lived}} {{as it was}} fierce. By {{the dawn}} of the following day it had abated considerably, and it was found that less <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to the ship than might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> expected.|$|R
2500|$|Sullivan {{apparently}} {{felt the}} <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> and relented on bands {{using the word}} [...] "higher". The following year, Sly & the Family Stone sang a medley where Sly repeated the lyric [...] "Wanna take you higher!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "While you're seein' {{how much}} <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to the tug, me an' the boys will get an anchor out aft so's the brig can't work further inshore." [...] Bob {{said to the}} engineer. [...] "If you can get up steam, an' the tug's afloat, it oughtn't take very long to pull us off this sand-bank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} plan of yours has saved the ship, sir," [...] the captain said, when, after five minutes, the {{lightning}} ceased {{as suddenly as}} it had begun. [...] "I am sure that a score of those flashes struck the mast, and yet no <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to it, so far as I could see by the last flash. Are you all right there, Purvis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, not at all," [...] the Squire broke in. [...] "You {{have had}} a {{tremendous}} load on your mind, {{and now it is}} lifted off; the thundercloud has burst, and though <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> one is thankful that it is no worse. Now I can talk to you of a matter that has been on my mind for the last three weeks. What steps do you think that I ought to take to find a successor for you? It is most important to have a man who will be a real help in the parish, as you have been, would pull with one comfortably, and be a pleasant associate. I don't want too young a fellow, and I don't want too old a one. I have no more idea how to set about it than a child. Of course, I could ask the Bishop to appoint, but I don't know that he would appoint at all the sort of man I want. The living is only worth 200 pounds a year and the house--no very great catch; but there is many a man that would be glad to have it." ...|$|E

50|$|By 1895 the tramway was in poor {{condition}} and the track needed relaying. Much <b>damage</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by vehicles other than the tramway engines, and {{it was decided to}} reconstruct the track on a raised formation above road level.|$|R

50|$|In {{the large}} {{southern}} {{region of the}} park, extensive <b>damage</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by all-terrain vehicles, especially in boggy areas and along trails.

5000|$|Damage {{to hearing}} {{is caused by}} a {{combination}} of three factors - length of exposure to the noise, the average level of the noise and the peak level of the noise.
