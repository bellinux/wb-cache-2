40|$|The {{performance}} and feasibility of switched multibeam array antennas in cellular systems is investigated. We assume that multicarrier power amplifiers (MCPA:s) {{are used in}} the base-station, to co-amplify the transmitted signals. The MCPA generates intermodulation distortion and it is shown how the multibeam antenna makes the radiated intermodulation distortion dependent on the azimuthal lookdirection. Given the carrier to <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>ratio</b> of the MCPA, semi-analytical expression for the outage probability for the mobiles is derived assuming a lognormal fading radio channel. Furthermore, the impact of the frequency reuse factor, trunkpool scheme and number of antennas is investigated. The analysis show that when the number of antennas are increased, it is possible to reduce the requirements on the MCPA linearity. 1.

40|$|The {{performance}} of switched multibeam antennas for cellular radio systems is investigated when the transmit amplifier is of a multicarrier (MCPA) type. The MCPA nonlinearity generates <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> in the transmitted signal that is spatially filtered by the array radiation pattern. Hence, the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion</b> becomes direction-dependent, {{and the direction}} of the generated intermodulation products of any order is derived. It is shown by using Monte Carlo simulations how the downlink carrier to interference ratio depends on the frequency reuse distance and on the MCPA linearity measured as its noise power ratio (NPR). For reuse factor one systems, which is made possible by use of multibeam antennas, the linear co-channel interference dominates the interference. On the contrary, for a reuse factor seven system it is shown that a weak nonlinearity directly gives a degradation in carrier to interference ratio (CIR) due to <b>intermodulation</b> <b>distortion.</b> However the reuse [...] ...|$|R
