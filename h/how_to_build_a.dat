While attending Willamette, Hatfield became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega and Kappa Gamma Rho, which he later helped become {{a chapter of}} Beta Theta Pi. In college he also worked part-time for then Oregon Secretary of State Earl Snell, where he learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> political base by sending out messages to potential voters after reading about life changes posted in newspapers, such as deaths and graduations. He also sketched out a political career path beginning with the state legislature and culminating in {{a spot in the}} United States Senate, with a blank for any position beyond the Senate. Hatfield {{graduated from}} Willamette in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree after three years at the school. While at the school he lost his only election, for student body president.|$|E

Since less-affluent {{families}} {{could not afford}} to own one, newspapers and magazines carried articles on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> crystal radio with common household items. To minimize the cost, many of the plans suggested winding the tuning coil on empty pasteboard containers such as oatmeal boxes, which became a common foundation for homemade radios.|$|E

25|$|After British {{scientists}} {{demonstrated to}} the United States in late 1957 {{that they had}} developed a Teller-Ulam design different from American methods and thus understood <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> hydrogen bomb, the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement made fully developed and tested American designs available more quickly and more cheaply. The first of these was the US B28 nuclear bomb, which was anglicised and manufactured in the UK as Red Snow and quickly deployed as Yellow Sun Mk.2 in the V-bomber fleet. Red Snow became the warhead of choice for the Blue Steel stand-off missile {{and some of the}} Skybolt missiles intended for carriage by the V-bombers. (The American B28 design had reliability issues. The British soon withdrew their warheads from deployment, and never again simply copied an American design.) Under the Mutual Defence Agreement 5.4 tonnes of UK produced plutonium was sent to the US in return for 6.7kg of tritium and 7.5 tonnes of HEU over the period 1960–1979, replacing Capenhurst production, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing UK fleet of nuclear submarines, both of the Polaris variety and others numbering approx twelve.|$|E
500|$|The {{scientists}} at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire included William Penney, William Cook, Ken Allen, Samuel Curran, [...] Henry Hulme, Bryan Taylor and John Ward. They did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> hydrogen bomb, but produced three designs: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. The first series of Operation Grapple tests involved Britain's first airdrop of a thermonuclear bomb. Although hailed as a success at the time, the first test of the Green Granite design was a failure. The second test validated Orange Herald as a usable design of a megaton weapon, {{but it was not}} a thermonuclear bomb, and the core boosting did not work. A third test attempted to correct the Green Granite design, but was another failure.|$|E

500|$|The main viral {{marketing}} site was {{revealed in the}} second trailer in February 2012. The official Twitter account revealed a scavenger hunt by posting [...] "Property of Peter Parker... Lost" [...] with the longitude and latitude coordinates of direct markets in major US cities. The missing items included a JanSport backpack. One of the clues hidden in the backpack was a link to a page on the viral site that unlocked countdown timers for the cities of Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona. Once the countdown was up, each of the city-specific Twitter accounts for the marketing campaign sent out five locations in each city. A person at each spot waited to give the first person with the password a package and the tag-name [...] "operative". These operatives painted the Spider-Man logo as graffiti. The operatives then could view a scene related to the film. The main viral website revealed hints to other websites, such as a photo blog that expressed Peter Parker's point of view.

500|$|The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire was {{directed}} by William Penney, with William Cook as his deputy. The scientists at Aldermaston did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> hydrogen bomb, but produced three designs: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon in which the fission yield was increased ("boosted") though the addition of lithium-6 deuteride; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design in which fusion occurred in layers of lithium-6 deuteride that alternated with layers of [...] uranium-235; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design in which the thermonuclear fuel was separate {{and the majority of}} the yield came from thermonuclear burning. The British bomb designers used the terms [...] "Tom" [...] and [...] "Dick" [...] for the bomb's primary and secondary stages respectively. The Tom would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode the Dick. Implicit {{in the creation of a}} hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested. Eden, who replaced Churchill as prime minister after the latter's retirement on 5 April 1955, gave a radio broadcast in which he declared: [...] "You cannot prove a bomb until it has exploded. Nobody can know whether it is effective or not until it has been tested." ...|$|E
500|$|Marge is {{generally}} a stereotypical sitcom mother, {{and she also}} plays the [...] "long-suffering wife" [...] who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in [...] "Homer Alone" [...] (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at [...] "Rancho Relaxo", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she [...] "put {{up with a lot}} in [...] marriage," [...] and has left Homer or thrown {{him out of the house}} on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an adult education class on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is [...] "complete and utter dependence." [...] At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he [...] "really [...] make a gal feel needed." [...] Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.|$|E
