40|$|In the National Basketball Association {{there are}} many {{external}} factors that affect the movement of a point spread from its opening line to its closing line. <b>Injury</b> <b>updates,</b> suspensions, recent game history, and public betting trends are amongst the most common reasons for a point spread to move, but {{it is virtually impossible}} to know the full reason why a line has moved. Once establishing that the bookmakers’ reasons are unknown, a careful look into the largest moving lines from open to close can provide an arbitrage opportunity for an individual gambler. This paper will analyze each NBA game’s line movement over the past six NBA seasons including playoffs to determine inefficient ratios of winning percentages when gambling on the closing line after the line has moved a certain amount. The results indicate that when the line moves three points or more, betting on the cold team can beat the bookie through repeated use of the strategy over the course of a season...|$|R

In the abdomen, an injured spleen is the most frequent cause of major bleeding. Splenectomy is historically the treatment of choice. In 2007, non-operative management (NOM) with splenic artery embolization (SAE) was introduced in our institution. The indication for SAE is hemodynamically stable patients with extravasation of contrast, or grade 3 – 5 spleen injury according to the Abbreviated Organ <b>Injury</b> Scale 2005, <b>Update</b> 2008. We wanted to examine if the introduction of SAE increased the rate of salvaged spleens in our trauma center. Method All patients discharged with the diagnosis of splenic injury in the period 01. 01. 2000 – 31. 12. 2013 from the University Hospital of North Norway Tromsø were included in the study. Patients admitted for rehabilitation purposes or with an iatrogenic injury were excluded. Results A total of 109 patients were included in the study. In the period 2000 - 7, 20 of 52 patients were splenectomized. During 2007 - 13, there were 6 splenectomies and 24 SAE among 57 patients. The reduction in splenectomies is significant (p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Cricket, {{classified}} as noncontact game, {{has been shown}} to be associated with increased incidence of injury. Further the recent consensus <b>update</b> in cricket <b>injury</b> surveillance have <b>updated</b> the <b>injury</b> definitions which includes “Medical Attention” injuries. The purpose of this review was to systematically review the various case reports and studies reporting injuries in the game of cricket that fall under the gambit of medical attention injuries. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted online using PubMed and Google Scholar, as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Metaanalyses guidelines. Predefined eligibility criteria were applied, and the data thus compiled were analysed. Results: A total of 32 studies reporting 43 players including 42 males and 1 female were included in the review. Bowling injuries were the most commonly reported injury. Impact injury was the most common mode with acute presentation in batting and fielding injury, whereas it was gradual onset mode with chronic presentation in bowling injuries. Head and neck injuries were the most common in batting injuries while extremity injuries were common in fielding and bowling injuries. No injuries were reported in umpires. Conclusion: The evidence provided, although not sufficient for any recommendation, it should alert the physicians and those concerned with the primary care of the cricketers to be vigilant of the eccentricity and severity of the injuries, their atypical presentation, mode, mechanism and trend, thereby being prepared for the unexpected presentations...|$|R
40|$|Closed access. Objective: This paper {{describes}} how maps were {{developed from the}} Clinical Modifications of the 9 th and 10 th Revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) to the Abbreviated <b>Injury</b> Scale 2005 <b>Update</b> 2008 (AIS 08). The development of the mapping methodology is described, with discussion of the major assumptions used in the process to map ICD codes to AIS severities. There were many intricacies to developing the maps, since the two coding systems, ICD and AIS, were developed for different purposes and contain unique classification structures to meet these purposes. Methods: Experts in ICD and AIS analyzed the rules and coding guidelines of both injury coding schemes to develop rules for mapping ICD injury codes to the AIS 08. This involved subject matter expertise, detailed knowledge of anatomy, and an in-depth understanding of injury terms and definitions as applied in both taxonomies. The official ICD- 9 -CM and ICD- 10 -CM versions (injury sections) were mapped to the AIS 08 codes and severities, following the rules outlined in each coding manual. The panel of experts was comprised of coders certified in ICD and/or AIS from around the world. In {{the process of developing}} the map from ICD to AIS, the experts created rules to address issues with the differences in coding guidelines between the two schemas and assure a consistent approach to all codes. Results: Over 19, 000 ICD codes were analyzed and maps were generated for each code to AIS 08 chapters, AIS 08 severities, and ISS body regions. After completion of the maps, 14, 101 (74...|$|R
40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the practice of}} work surrounding a technology, the temporary injury journal, on Holbæk emergency department. Through this project we try to identify and {{develop an understanding of}} potential issues with application of this technology. The project is based on collaboration between us and the emergency departments’ personnel as well as their management. We study the department’s practice of work through the use of the case studies’ observation and in-situ dialog. We perceive the field through a hermeneutical-phenomelogical approach, through which we applicate no theoretical understandings, nor do we establish any governing hypothesis. We attempt to approach the departments’ practice of work openly. Through an analysis of our observations and in-situ dialogs we establish, that the most significant issue is that the departments’ temporary injury journal is outdated. The injury journal does not support nor offer the functionality needed by the departments’ current practice of work. Inspired by this we develop an <b>updated</b> <b>injury</b> journal, which can provide the necessary support and functionality that the emergency departments’ current practice of work require. To facilitate this design process we employ the MUST-methods four basic principles which concern the involvement and support of the users of the design. In order to scientifically confirm that the design actually does provide the aforementioned support and functionality, we decided to evaluate the design. This was done through a qualitative dialog with the users and a quantitative test through which the temporary injury journal was applied in the emergency departments’ real work. The qualitative as well as the quantitative evaluation both suggested that the updated design did in fact provide the desired features. Thus we concluded that the <b>updated</b> temporary <b>injury</b> journal is more fitting for the emergency departments’ current practice of work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Many trauma {{registries}} {{have used}} the Abbreviated Injury Scale 1990 Revision Update 98 (AIS 98) to classify injuries. In the current AIS version (Abbreviated <b>Injury</b> Scale 2005 <b>Update</b> 2008 - AIS 08), injury classification and specificity differ substantially from AIS 98, and the mapping tools provided in the AIS 08 dictionary are incomplete. As a result, data from different AIS versions cannot currently be compared. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an additional AIS 98 to AIS 08 mapping tool to complement the current AIS dictionary map, and then to evaluate the completed map (produced by combining these two maps) using double-coded data. The value of additional information provided by free text descriptions accompanying assigned codes was also assessed. Methods Using a modified Delphi process, a panel of expert AIS coders established plausible AIS 08 equivalents for the 153 AIS 98 codes which currently have no AIS 08 map. A series of major trauma patients whose injuries had been double-coded in AIS 98 and AIS 08 was used to assess the maps; both of the AIS datasets had already been mapped to another AIS version using the AIS dictionary maps. Following application of the completed (enhanced) map with or without free text evaluation, up to six AIS codes were available for each injury. Datasets were assessed for agreement in injury severity measures, and the relative performances of the maps in accurately describing the trauma population were evaluated. Results The double-coded injuries sustained by 109 patients were used to assess the maps. For data conversion from AIS 98, both the enhanced map and the enhanced map with free text description resulted in higher levels of accuracy and agreement with directly coded AIS 08 data than the currently available dictionary map. Paired comparisons demonstrated significant differences between direct coding and the dictionary maps, but not with either of the enhanced maps. Conclusions The newly-developed AIS 98 to AIS 08 complementary map enabled transformation of the trauma population description given by AIS 98 into an AIS 08 estimate which was statistically indistinguishable from directly coded AIS 08 data. It is recommended that the enhanced map should be adopted for dataset conversion, using free text descriptions if available. </p...|$|R
