5|$|Tulsa is home {{to several}} internationally renowned museums. Located in the former villa of oil pioneer Waite Phillips in Midtown Tulsa, the Philbrook Museum of Art is {{considered}} one of the top 50 fine art museums in the United States, and is one of only five to offer a combination of a historic home, formal gardens, and an art collection. The museum's expansive collection includes work by a diverse group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Andrew Wyeth, Giovanni Bellini, Domenico di Pace Beccafumi, Willem de Kooning, William Merritt Chase, Auguste Rodin and <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe.</b> Philbrook also maintains a satellite campus in downtown Tulsa.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{social life}} {{generally}} centered on sports, outdoor activities, and dinner parties {{with his family}} and friends from the film industry, including directors Henry Hathaway, Howard Hawks, William Wellman, and Fred Zinnemann, and actors Joel McCrea, James Stewart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Robert Taylor. As well as hunting, Cooper enjoyed riding, fishing, skiing, and later in life, scuba diving. He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing, and over the years, he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings, including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Gauguin, and <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe.</b> Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso, whom he met in 1956. Cooper also had a lifelong passion for automobiles, with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe,</b> Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E

5|$|The European collection, {{which is}} {{organized}} into works before 1800 and works from 1800–1945, includes highlights such as Aristotle by Jusepe de Ribera and The Flageolet Player on the Cliff by Paul Gauguin. Rembrandt's Self-Portrait {{is part of}} the Clowes Fund Collection, which comprises a number of significant Old Masters pieces. Part of the Neo-Impressionist collection, The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe by Georges Seurat {{was one of the first}} works to be donated by Caroline Marmon Fesler in the 1940s. Fesler would go on to donate a number of important works, including her bequest in 1961 of notable 20th-century modernism pieces that included Pablo Picasso, Chagall, and Matisse. Pieces in the American collection represent American Impressionism and Modernism, including works by <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe</b> and George Inness. Significant pieces include Hotel Lobby (1943) by Edward Hopper and Boat Builders by Winslow Homer.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe,</b> and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E

50|$|American works {{comprises}} {{one of the}} ASU Art Museum's smallest collections. ASU's {{holdings of}} American art began with the museum's original contributions from Oliver B. James. Earlier works in the collection include early American limner painters, while the most recent works are from 20th century modernists, including Charles Demuth, Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Stuart Davis. Among the holdings in the American collection are various 19th-century Romantic landscape paintings from the 19th century, Ash Can School works, and portraits, include Gilbert Stuart's Mrs Stephen Peabody (1809). The museum holds <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe's</b> Horse's Skull on Blue (1930), a depiction of a sun-bleached skull {{that is the first}} in a series of skull paintings created by O'Keeffe after bones found in the desert around her ranch.

5000|$|Beginning {{with her}} 2001 recording, [...] "Castles in the Air", Ritter {{expanded}} her work into the classical avant-garde {{world with the}} debut of Opus 17, New Southern Symphonic Suite for Modern Dance, described by the Boston Globe as [...] "intriguing, adventurous explorations". In 2004, her recording Greener and Blue, also incorporated non-Western instruments and folk music elements into her composing. In 2007, AllMusic describes her album, Waltzing the Splendor, which was inspired by painter <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe's</b> [...] "Orange and Red Streak", as [...] "musically painting broad strokes of bright color, based in nature like O'Keeffe". Ritter's latest 2015 CD release, [...] "Soho Solo" [...] a solo piano recording, received 4-5 star reviews and is described as [...] "unfailingly beautiful". Her pianist approach continues to be inspired {{by the work of}} Mary Lou Williams, Ran Blake, and Thelonious Monk, noted recently in the liner notes of [...] "Soho Solo", as [...] "direct and succinct, like the North Carolina pianist-composer Thelonious Monk's style".|$|R
40|$|Images of Remembered Earth is {{a musical}} {{composition}} scored for full orchestra. The composition {{was inspired by}} <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe's</b> painting, Light Coming on the Plains I (1917), which depicts a sunrise over a flat and empty landscape. In the painting, the expanse of the sun's rays is expressed through an even-blended transformation of color from goldish-blue at the light's source to progressively darker shades of blue near {{the edges of the}} canvas. The progression of color is interrupted by thin gold bands which sectionalize the sunrise into seven concentric arches. The construction of the musical composition derives musical materials directly from elements found within O'Keeffe's painting, specifically the shaping of structure, expansion, and color in arch patterns. Arch patterns, an integral element in O'Keeffe's painting, govern elements in the musical composition, including pitch selection, the overall tempo scheme, rhythmic activity, and formal shape. Pitch materials are expansive by design; this expansive quality is exhibited through the employment of wedge-shaped musical ideas and through the utilization of higher and lower registers. O'Keeffe's use of color in the painting influenced the orchestration of the music and is manifested in two ways: 1) gradual transformation of timbral colors and 2) the juxtaposition of contrasting instrumental groupings...|$|R
5000|$|She met pop artist Robert Dowd in {{the early}} 1960s. They lived and worked {{together}} as fellow artists, and were married in 1962. And although they were each working to develop a unique message, Devereux recalls subjugating her work on many occasions in deference to her husband. [...] "The spaces we rented always became his studio, with very little space left for my work." [...] She admits to playing a willing part in this arrangement. At the time, she knew his work was groundbreaking and she did everything she could {{to create an environment}} conducive to creativity, albeit his creativity. Together, she and Dowd left Los Angeles and relocated to New York City in 1971. At first, they lived with Devereux's parents in Flushing. They followed this move into a Broome Street loft and eventually, into the Chelsea Hotel. Their residence at the Chelsea was based on an exchange; Dowd's works were on the walls in the lobby, and that enabled him and Devereux to live rent-free for a time. In 1992, Devereux gained residency at Goast Ranch, New Mexico, <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe's</b> former outpost, where she gainfully settled in. She lived quite romantically in a trailer next to a cantina where she would take her meals. Devereux moved back to Los Angeles in 1995 when Dowd learned he had cancer. She stayed with him and nursed him until his death.|$|R

40|$|Victoria Erickson Abstract Topic Selection and Thesis: In {{writing my}} honors thesis, Summer Days, I was {{particularly}} interested in exemplifying how the characteristics of <b>Georgia</b> <b>O’Keeffe’s</b> 1936 painting, Summer Days, defied the general publics’ preconceived notions of her as an artist whose brushstroke was limited to what was coined as ‘feminine’ subject matter. As Summer Days divulges into a harsher narrative of a barren desert scene struck by the skull of a deer suspended amid a smoky, white washed sky, it was my mission to acknowledge the fact this painting, {{as well as others}} of O’Keeffe’s desert scene paintings, challenged so much that was publicized about her. As O’Keeffe had been overly associated with the sensual connotations attached to her iconic flower paintings, I felt that Summer Days, deserved to be further explored. Research was primarily lead by a few initial interests, which lead to the: Identification of the symbolism associated with each of the elements in the painting and recognizing their relationship to one another. Recognition of the significance/purpose of the presence of the deer skull. Comparison and contrast among Summer Days and works that depicted similar subject matter, such as O’Keeffe’s: The Horse 2 ̆ 7 s Skull on Blue, 1930; Cow 2 ̆ 7 s Skull: Red, White, and Blue, 1931; Cow 2 ̆ 7 s Skull with Calico Roses, Horse 2 ̆ 7 s Skull with Pink Rose, and the Ram 2 ̆ 7 s Head, White Hollyhock-Hills, all completed in 1935; Deers Skull With Pedernal, 1936; From the Faraway, Nearby, 1937; and lastly the Ram 2 ̆ 7 s Head, Blue Morning Glory, 1938. Through the exploration of such interests, I concluded that: Summer Days is a great example in which O’Keeffe was able to create a hybrid between still life (which was recognized as a historically female subject) and abstract painting (a modern style, that was primarily associated with male artists) as the painting features elements of both. O’Keeffe’s artistic persona had been artificially crafted by her husband and promoter, Alfred Stieglitz, despite the fact that O’Keeffe largely denied claims that her sexuality and feminine identity clouded/overwhelmed her works. Summer Days is a direct example that O’Keeffe was interested in more than just ‘female appropriate’ still life paintings. Reflection Overall, I was pleased with the research and if I were to continue writing, I would especially like to re-evaluate O’Keeffe’s works using a feminist art theory, in opposition to the many Freudian readings. Especially as I believe they are responsible for generalized gendered interpretations of O’Keeffe’s works...|$|R

25|$|In 1925, Stieglitz {{was invited}} by the Anderson Galleries to put {{together}} {{one of the largest}} exhibitions of American art, entitled Alfred Stieglitz Presents Seven Americans: 159 Paintings, Photographs, and Things, Recent and Never Before Publicly Shown by Arthur G.

25|$|When 20th-century American artists {{became aware}} of European Modernism, they began to {{interpret}} still-life subjects {{with a combination of}} American realism and Cubist-derived abstraction. Typical of the American still-life works of this period are the paintings of <b>Georgia</b> <b>O'Keeffe,</b> Stuart Davis, and Marsden Hartley, and the photographs of Edward Weston. O’Keeffe’s ultra-closeup flower paintings reveal both the physical structure and the emotional subtext of petals and leaves in an unprecedented manner.|$|E
