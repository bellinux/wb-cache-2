40|$|Objectives Changes in the {{traditional}} model of drug development are creating a potential opportunity for New Zealand's <b>drug</b> development <b>industry.</b> This research evaluates whether New Zealand could utilise some of the policies employed by countries with successful <b>drug</b> development <b>industries.</b> Methods A framework to support a <b>drug</b> development <b>industry</b> was developed by taking into account policies that affect the industry. The framework was then used to analyse the types of policies provided by different countries and to postulate six different models that support a pharmaceutical industry. Results Countries with a successful <b>drug</b> development <b>industry</b> have identified their strengths, analysed the opportunities in the industry, and have employed consistent and specific policies in support of their industry. New Zealand's policy in support of its <b>drug</b> development <b>industry</b> is most {{similar to that of}} the medical research-based model of the UK, Australia and Canada. Conclusions New Zealand needs to develop a consistent policy for support of its <b>drug</b> development <b>industry</b> based on identifying and focussing on the competencies where it is internationally competitive. A strong partnership with Australia could capitalise on the strengths of both countries and linkages with other Asia-Pacific countries could further promote the region's capabilities in drug development research.

2500|$|The {{disintegration}} of the Zetas gang may increase violence in Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Veracruz. However, violence is not inevitable; the split may discourage them from making incursions into other states. If the bosses of Los Zetas relocate their gunmen from other states to northeastern Mexico, tension could lessen elsewhere. If many Zetas reunite with the Gulf Cartel (considering that [...] "resisting collaboration" [...] could mean an end to their <b>drug</b> <b>industry),</b> then northeastern Mexico could achieve peace. Guatemala moved to improve security in seven of its provinces in September 2012 fearing that the conflict could expand.

2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L.

People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs me is that the people think the FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the <b>drug</b> <b>industry,</b> he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the <b>drug</b> <b>industry</b> and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he thinks that what the Administration was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, a United States {{federal court}} {{decision}} {{resulted in the}} release of approximately 1500 documents detailing how articles highlighting specific marketing messages written by unattributed writers, but [...] "authored" [...] by academics, are strategically placed in the medical literature – a practice known as ghostwriting. To release these documents, PLOS Medicine, represented by the public interest law firm Public Justice, and The New York Times, acted as [...] "intervenors" [...] in litigation against menopausal hormone manufacturers by women who developed breast cancer while taking hormones. PLOS Medicine argued that sealed documents identified during the discovery process for the court case, which demonstrated the practice of ghostwriting, should {{be made available to}} the public. The documents were initially made publicly available on the PLOS Medicine website but they are now available as part of the <b>Drug</b> <b>Industry</b> Documents Archive at the University of California, San Francisco. In 2010 PLOS Medicine published the first academic analysis of the documents by Adriane Fugh-Berman. Her article revealed that the pharmaceutical company Wyeth used ghostwritten articles to mitigate the perceived risks of breast cancer associated with menopausal hormone therapy (HT), to defend the unsupported cardiovascular “benefits” of HT, and to promote off-label, unproven uses of HT such as the prevention of dementia, Parkinson's disease, vision problems, and wrinkles. The article was subsequently covered by The Guardian.|$|E
