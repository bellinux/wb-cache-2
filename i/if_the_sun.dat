5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{relative}} {{isolation is}} ultimately what a life-bearing system needs. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> were crowded amongst other systems, {{the chance of}} being fatally close to dangerous radiation sources would increase significantly.

25|$|However {{plausible}} it {{may appear}} at first sight, the nebular hypothesis still faces the obstacle of angular momentum; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> had indeed formed from the collapse of such a cloud, the planets should be rotating far more slowly.

25|$|In December 2012, a {{research}} team in China {{announced that it}} had produced measurements of the phase lag of Earth tides during full and new moons which seem {{to prove that the}} speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light.

25|$|The Groundhog Day celebration {{is rooted}} in a Celtic and Germanic {{tradition}} that says that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Pagan holiday of Imbolc (known among Christians as Candlemas), winter and cold weather will last another six weeks.

In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> came out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow {{all the way into}} May.

25|$|Convex lenses {{produce an}} image of an object at {{infinity}} at their focus; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is imaged, much of the visible and infrared light incident on the lens is concentrated into the small image. A large lens creates enough intensity to burn a flammable object at the focal point. Since ignition can be achieved even with a poorly made lens, lenses {{have been used as}} burning-glasses for at least 2400 years. A modern application is the use of relatively large lenses to concentrate solar energy on relatively small photovoltaic cells, harvesting more energy without the need to use larger and more expensive cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{phase diagram}} {{explains}} why liquids {{do not exist}} in space or any other vacuum. Since the pressure is zero (except on surfaces or interiors of planets and moons) water and other liquids exposed to space will either immediately boil or freeze depending on the temperature. In regions of space near the earth, water will freeze <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> is not shining directly on it and vapourize (sublime) {{as soon as it}} is in sunlight. If water exists as ice on the moon, it can only exist in shadowed holes where the sun never shines and where the surrounding rock doesn't heat it up too much. At some point near the orbit of Saturn, the light from the sun is too faint to sublime ice to water vapour. This is evident from the longevity of the ice that composes Saturn's rings.|$|E
25|$|Now Hipparchus {{made such}} an {{examination}} principally from the sun. Since from other {{properties of the}} sun and moon (of which a study will be made below) it follows that if the distance of one of the two luminaries is given, the distance of the other is also given, he tries by conjecturing the distance of the sun to demonstrate the distance of the moon. First, he assumes the sun to show the least perceptible parallax to find its distance. After this, he makes use of the solar eclipse adduced by him, first as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> shows no perceptible parallax, and for exactly that reason the ratios of the moon's distances appeared different to him for each of the hypotheses he set out. But with respect to the sun, not only the amount of its parallax, but also whether it shows any parallax at all is altogether doubtful.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} {{there is no}} clear {{majority}} in either element or quality to give a clear signature. In these cases the ruling planet of the sun is noted for its position in the chart (alternatively, the ascendant can be added at this stage if it has not already been included). Whatever sign the ruling planet occupies is then added to the totals for element and quality. So for example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is in Taurus, its ruling planet Venus is noted for its position by sign. If Venus is in, say, Pisces, then an additional 'casting vote' is given to the element water and quality mutable. This is usually enough to provide a signature. A 'casting vote' is given in this way on account of the extra importance of the Sun in the natal chart. The signature sign is regarded by those astrologers who use it as frequently having an over-riding influence in the natal chart, irrespective of what sign the sun or ascendant occupies.|$|E

5000|$|A {{conjunction}} (abrv. Con) is {{an angle}} of approximately 0-10°.

25|$|An eclipse {{season is}} the only time during which the Sun (from the {{perspective}} of the Earth) is close enough to one of the Moon's nodes to allow for an eclipse to occur. During the season, whenever there is a full moon a lunar eclipse will occur and whenever there is a new moon a solar eclipse will occur. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is close enough to a node, then a total eclipse will occur. Each season lasts from 31 to 37 days, recurring about every 6 months. At least two (one solar and one lunar, in any order), and at most three eclipses (solar, lunar, then solar again, or vice versa), will occur during every eclipse season. This is because it is about 15 days (a fortnight) between full moon and new moon and vice versa. If there is an eclipse {{at the very beginning of}} the season, then there is enough time (30 days) for two more eclipses.|$|E
25|$|Models and {{observations}} (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming {{of the lower}} atmosphere at the surface (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere). Depletion {{of the ozone layer}} by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming {{at the top of the}} stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. Hadley cells are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.|$|E
