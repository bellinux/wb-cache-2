The volume fraction occupied by glass fibres was 20 - 30 %, which is that typically used in boat building. The beams tested were all unidirectional, with fibres oriented parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the beam. Various techniques have been developed which may be applicable to other composite materials. The microstructure of the beams was investigated by observation of cross-sections using a Quantimet 720 <b>Image</b> <b>Analysing</b> <b>Computer.</b> Volume fractions and the distribution. of fibre cross-sectional areas were measured. Methods have been developed for the quantitative definition of the microstructure, in terms of the fibre arrangement. Cracks were grown in four-point flexural loading while monitoring acoustic emission. The acoustic emission circuit was built in the laboratory, and designed to monitor fibre failures only, one count being associated with one fibre failure. The processes of crack growth were further investigated by observation of fracture surfaces using a scanning electron microscope and measurement of crack profiles. The factors controlling the processes of crack growth have been elucidated. The material condition was monitored by specific damping capacity measurements. A free-free rig with excitation at the ends of the beam was developed. In addition measurements were made using a cantilever rig. Simple analyses involving the solution of the classical wave equation were carried out; a receptance analysis was also developed which allows the undamaged and cracked portions of the beam to be separated in the analysis. Invisible cracks, which had been indicated by acoustic emission, were successfully detected in both rigs. The correlation between recorded acoustic emissions and specific damping capacity measurements supports the validity of both techniques. Some correlation between properties and measured microstructures has been obtained here. These quantitative methods for the measurement of the microstructure of composite materials should prove very useful {{in a wide range of}} applications...|$|E
40|$|It is {{postulated}} that {{definition of the}} availability of nutrients in soil t for plant uptake, will not be satisfactory, unless there is consideration of the plant's role as the absorber. The amount of nutrients absorbed by plants from soil can be related to i) the initial concentration in the soil solution, ii) the capacity of the soil to maintain this concentration (the buffer power), iii) the ease of movement of the nutrient to an absorbing root, and iv) the plant demand. These ideas are the foundation of models which successfully describe the nutrient uptake by single roots, growing in an infinite quantity of soil. The aim of the present work was to extend the approach used to explain uptake by single roots, to complete root systems. The requirements for the work are: a theoretical description of nutrient flow to an absorbing, multiple root system experiments for examining the proposed hypotheses. When a root absorbs a nutrient, there is a depletion in the nutrient concentration at the root surface. In a system of many roots, the zones of nutrient depletion around each root overlap. This reduces the effective initial concentration in the soil solution. So, in a multiple root system, the soil around each root is limited. The extent of overlap depends on the diffusion coefficient of the nutrient, the plant demand, and the interroot distance. The consequence is a lowering of the concentration at each root surface, below that of a similar root absorbing alone. An electrical analogue (Sanders et al. 1971) of diffusion of solutes to groups of absorbing roots was used to simulate nutrient uptake by plants from soil. The analogue was particularly useful for investigating the general consequences of different plant and soil conditions. To interpret specific plant uptake data, a more flexible computer model of diffusion and mass flow to a root system of variable density, with any specified uptake properties, was developed. For workers interested in an accuracy of andplusmn; 20 %, an equation for calculating uptake, by systems similar to those which the computer model treats, is presented, which can be solved on a desk calculator. To test the model, experimental data on nutrient uptake, root dimensions and distribution, and soil conditions, during the growth of whole plants in soil was obtained. The computer model predicted the measured plant uptake wall, when values of the plant demand coefficient (which related uptake rate to the external solution concentration) given is the literature, from solution culture work under similar conditions, were used. It is concluded that the theory is an adequate representation of the simple plant-soil system used in the experiments. The expression, relating plant demand to concentration in the soil solution, was simulated on the electrical analogue. The effects of pattern, density, radius and demand coefficient of roots, on the course of uptake of solutes, of varying degrees of mobility, were investigated. Quantitative interrelations between soil and plant characteristics were established, which are discussed in the light of earlier concepts of mobility and availability of nutrients in soil. The uptake of a solute by any root system is roughly determined by the plant demand coefficient and the product of the solute diffusion coefficient, D, the absorption time, t, and the root density, L. The product DtL, for potassium, may often be is the range where root pattern affects uptake. This can be estimated graphically. Theory suggests that the uptake rate of K and K is the plant experiments was reduced by interroot competition. In both experiments, if supply was by physical processes only, the plants were absorbing K from the soil near to a maximum rate, which was set by transport through the soil. In those circumstances, the rate of uptake into a plant is limited by the length of root. Movement through the soil was easily able to supply the plant's requirement of N, until the total quantity was exhausted. It is deduced that this will usually be the case in British arable soils. A major problem, in the experimental determination of plant uptake from soil, results from the inaccessibility of the roots. A technique was devised for estimating the length and pattern of living roots of individual plants, without excessive labour. Radioactive roots are detected by autoradiography as they intersect planes of soil, and the root length par unit volume and rooting pattern follow easily. If two plants are labelled with different isotopes, their root systems can be distinguished. Any spatial interactions between the root systems are detected by the method, and the causes can be inferred. If the roots are extracted from the soil, their length can be automatically measured with an <b>Image</b> <b>Analysing</b> <b>Computer.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} ophthalmic pathological reasons of blindness among people of working age. Previous techniques for blood vessel detection in retinal images can be categorized into rulebased and supervised methods. This research presents a new supervised technique for blood vessel detection in digital retinal images. This novel approach uses an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approach for pixel classification and calculates a 7 -D vector comprises of gray-level and moment invariants-based features for pixel representation. The approach is based on pixel classification using a 7 -D feature vector obtained from preprocessed retinal images and given as input to a ELM. Classification results (real values between 0 and 1) are thresholded to categorize each pixel into two classes namely vessel and nonvessel. Ultimately, a post processing fills pixel gaps in detected blood vessels and eliminates falsely-detected isolated vessel pixels. The technique was assessed on the publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases, widely used for this purpose, as they comprises of retinal images where the vascular structure has been precisely marked by experts. Method performance on both sets of test images is better than other existing solutions in literature. The approach proves particularly accurate for vessel detection in STARE images.
