The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E

When this relentless fellow, having reached his sixth Test hundred against England, at length took a liberty he had made 592 runs in the Tests, average 84, the highest aggregate since Bradman's in 1946/7: not only that, he had scored 979 against Smith's side since they landed in Perth, and had occupied the crease for forty-one and a half hours.

5000|$|After the Connecticut game, Roh told reporters, [...] "Last year, we weren't good, so {{this year}} we wanted {{to come out and}} make a statement." [...] He was also an outspoken defender of Michigan's embattled head coach, Rich Rodriguez. Following the Connecticut game, he told reporters: [...] "He's had more on him than any other coach in the USA. <b>He's</b> <b>just</b> stayed so positive, and <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> his eyes toward the goal. To get this win right here, it's a {{stepping}} stone to what greater things can happen this season." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{offensive}} line was frequently shuffled due to injuries, with left guard Matt Slauson playing some games at center and right guard Kyle Long moving to tackle. The former alternated between guard and center during the season, playing weeks seven to nine and sixteen at center. At left tackle, second-year player Charles Leno, Jr. started 13 games after taking over for an injured Jermon Bushrod; Gase stated, [...] "He {{had a little}} bit of a rough start, but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> working and then when he got the opportunity at left tackle, he took full advantage of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga rap on [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was just hanging around the studio. We {{asked him to come}} freestyle on [...] After that, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> hanging around. Then we had the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals. Collectively, the group had written and recorded approximately 40songs {{at the end of the}} sessions. In an interview for Billboard, D'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E
50|$|At the high-altitude circuit the {{turbocharged}} Renaults dominated qualifying, with René Arnoux securing pole over Jabouille but Jones won the start, leading until Arnoux {{took over}} on lap 3.

In 1814, he commanded an army corps which participated in diverse fighting around Moret-sur-Loing.|$|R
5000|$|Puig {{has been}} {{sponsored}} by Cliche for {{the entirety of}} his career and, as of December 2012, is an integral member of the brand's team. The company's brand manager, Al Boglio (a former sponsored skateboarder from Australia), has described Puig in the following manner: [...] "Lucas {{has been with us}} since ... yeah, for eleven years now. His skateboarding's unique, and we're <b>just</b> stoked that <b>he's,</b> <b>just,</b> <b>kept</b> by Cliche—he loves what we do. We've been lucky enough to have, you know, to have met Lucas and we're lucky enough to have him on board today, umm, and for a few years to go, for sure, you know, he's fucking on fire!" [...] In January 2013, Puig identified the Cliche videos, Bon Apetit and Freedom Fries, as those videos that contain his most significant video parts.|$|R
2500|$|.....he {{was home}} writing. We lived {{outside of the}} city along a river. Rats as big as cats ran through our little house. Sometimes we had no water or {{electricity}} - {{but he had the}} time of his life. In our time there he wrote most of his 'Vincent Mahieu' oeuvre. Typewriter on a wooden case turned over, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> on typing. He said: [...] "This is where I live." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Journey's End", the Tenth Doctor {{manages to}} avert his own {{regeneration}} by {{using some of}} the energy to heal himself, then channeling the remaining energy into his severed hand, thus retaining his appearance and personality. That regenerative energy was a key point in a [...] "humanTime Lord biological metacrisis" [...] inadvertently caused by Donna Noble that creates the Meta-Crisis Doctor while she obtains a Time Lord intellect. Later in the series, during the events of [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] the Eleventh Doctor revealed that it was considered a full regeneration; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> the same face due to [...] "vanity issues", and that he was now in his final (13th) life (given that the Tenth Doctor counted as two regenerations and the revelation of the existence of the War Doctor, this made a total of 12 regenerations). However, during the same episode, the Doctor is given a new cycle of regenerations by the Time Lords, allowing him to regenerate for the thirteenth time into the Twelfth Doctor, with the Twelfth Doctor ("Kill the Moon") and Rassilon ("Hell Bent") each expressing uncertainty about how many regenerations the Doctor now has.|$|E
2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition. And I thought I was funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program Tell Me More. [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Times Book Review of 12 August 1928 said, [...] "Nominally Poirot has retired, but {{retirement}} {{means no}} more to him {{than it does to}} a prima donna. Let a good murder mystery come within his ken, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> can't be <b>kept</b> out of it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{refused to}} give him {{so much as a}} glance. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> grunted and <b>kept</b> right on about his business. All the little meadow people and forest folks began to giggle and then to laugh.

6000|$|... "After that, {{instead of}} hunting for food himself, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> {{a sharp eye}} on his neighbors, and when they had found {{something}} he wanted, he frightened them away and helped himself. All {{the time he was}} so sly about it that never once was he suspected. He was a great talker, was Mr. Crow, and {{spent a great deal of}} time gossiping, and he was always one of the first to offer sympathy to those who had lost a meal.|$|E
60|$|Danny didn't answer. The fact is, he was {{too frightened}} to answer. Besides, he didn't know what he could do. So <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> still, but his bright eyes never once left Reddy's cruel face. For all his fright, Danny was doing some hard thinking. He had been in tight places before and had learned never to give up hope. Something might happen to frighten Reddy away. Anyway, Reddy had {{to get him out}} of that old can before he would admit that he was really caught.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{as soon as}} I {{had taken}} a rest and had had my dinner, I went on deck {{to get ready for}} another diving expedition. There was the stock-broker, {{watching}} me like a snake watching a bird. He didn't stamp around and ask any more questions: <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> his venomous eye on me as if he would like to kill me because I knew more than he did. But I didn't concern myself about him, and down I went, and this time I got myself aboard the English vessel just as soon as I could.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2002, Scott {{called into}} the Howard Stern show to say that {{although}} he was making up to $5000 a night doing appearances at bars, {{he wanted to do}} something else before he was only ever known as [...] "The Wassup Guy". Howard told him <b>he</b> should have <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> milking it for years until there was no more money coming in, but Scott insisted that he was finished with doing [...] "Wassup Guy" [...] appearances.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{then the}} sparrow saw a soldier {{walking up the}} bridge. It pleaded with him to help find the bean, but the soldier too was uncooperative. [...] "Who's going to help a sparrow?" [...] he said and walked away. Then a captain came up the bridge, but he wouldn't help the sparrow either. And then a minister, but no help from him too. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> laughed and <b>kept</b> walking.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like the}} cool {{way in which}} he takes bad fixes," [...] {{continued}} Rectus, who had a fancy for doing things that way himself. [...] "Don't you remember that time he struck on the sand-bank. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> sat there in the rain, waiting for the tide to rise, and made no fuss at all. And here, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>just</b> as cool and comfortable, down in that dungeon. He must have educated his mind a good deal {{to be able to do}} that." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{did not go}} {{too near}} Lightfoot, for {{he did not want}} to alarm him. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> within sight of Lightfoot, paying no {{attention}} to him but going about his work. You see, this man loved and understood the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows, and he knew that there was no surer way of winning Lightfoot's confidence and trust than by appearing to take no notice of him. Lightfoot, watching him, understood. He knew that this man was a friend and would do him no harm. Little by little, the wonderful, blessed feeling of safety crept over Lightfoot. No hunter could harm him here.|$|E
60|$|By and by, after a long, long time, {{he came to}} {{a hollow}} log, and just {{happening}} to peep in, he saw some one curled up fast asleep. Who was it? Why, Billy Mink, to be sure! You see, Billy thought that he was so far ahead that he might just as well take it easy, and that was what he was doing. Spotty the Turtle didn't waken him. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> right on going the same slow way he had come all day, and so, just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was going to bed behind the Purple Hills, Spotty the Turtle found the cause of the trouble in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{cutting down}} trees is hard work. Yes, Siree, cutting down trees {{is the hardest}} kind of hard work. Mr. Beaver had to sit up on his hind legs to do it, and his legs grew very, very tired. In those days he had a tail {{very much like the}} tail of Jerry Muskrat. It was very useful when he was swimming, but it was of no use at all at any other time. Sometimes he tried to brace himself with it--when he was sitting up to cut trees, and found it of no help. But he didn't complain; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> right on working, and only stopped to rest when his legs ached so that he had to.|$|E
60|$|After a long, long time, Spotty the Turtle came to {{a little}} pool where the {{sunshine}} lay warm and inviting.

It was Caroline Trevelyan at Home, Caroline Trevelyan at Brighton, Caroline Trevelyan and the Shah of Persia, Caroline Trevelyan and the Old Apple-woman. When it wasn't Caroline Trevelyan herself it would be Caroline Trevelyan's dog as would be doing something out of the common, getting himself lost or summoned or drowned--it didn't matter much what.|$|E
6000|$|A pedagogue in Indiana, who was [...] "had up" [...] for unmercifully waling {{the back}} of a little girl, {{justified}} his action by explaining that [...] "she persisted in flinging paper pellets at him when his back was turned." [...] That is no excuse. Mr. Grile once taught school up in the mountains, and about every half hour had to remove his coat and scrape off the dried paper wads adhering to the nap. He never permitted a trifle like this to unsettle his patience; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> on wearing that gaberdine until it had no nap and the wads wouldn't stick. But when they took to dipping them in mucilage he made a complaint to the Board of Directors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he turned}} it over, {{and he took the}} job. He thought she'd relent after the first week or two, but she didn't. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> that place for over fifteen months, and learnt the business. In the house he was James the boots, and she Mrs. Wrench the landlady, and she saw to it that he didn't forget it. He had his wages and he made his tips, and the food was plentiful; but I take it he worked harder during that time than he'd ever worked before in his life, and found that a landlady is just twice as {{difficult}} to please as the strictest landlord it can be a man's misfortune to get under, and that Mrs. Wrench was no exception to the rule.|$|E
50|$|In the APFA, the Bulldogs {{found the}} {{competition}} somewhat tougher than expected. Canton had a respectable 9-5-4 record {{over the next}} two seasons. The APFA became the National Football League in 1922 and Hay hired Guy Chamberlin as Canton's player-coach. Chamberlin rebuilt the Bulldogs into a championship team. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>just</b> five players from the 1921 squad. As a player Chamberlin led his team past the Chicago Cardinals in 1922 by blocking a punt that set up a touchdown, and running back two interceptions for touchdowns to beat the Cards' 20-3.

60|$|It {{was still}} dark, but Armand St. Just was a born Parisian, {{and he knew}} every inch of this quarter, where he and Marguerite had years ago lived.
