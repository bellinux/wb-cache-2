5000|$|One {{important}} question facing {{the study of}} mind-wandering is how it relates to working memory capacity. Recent research has studied the relationship between mind-wandering and working memory capacity. This relationship requires more research to understand how they influence one another. It is possible that mind-wandering causes lower performance on working memory capacity tasks or that lower working memory capacity causes more instances of mind-wandering. Although only this last one has actually been proven. Also, reports of task-unrelated thoughts are less frequent when performing tasks that do not demand continuous use <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory than tasks which do. [...] Moreover, individual difference studies demonstrate that when tasks are non-demanding, <b>high</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory capacity are associated with more frequent reports of task-unrelated thinking especially when it {{is focused on the}} future. [...] By contrast, when performing tasks that demand continuous attention, <b>high</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>working</b> memory capacity are associated with fewer reports of task-unrelated thoughts. [...] Together these data are consistent with the claim that working memory capacity helps sustain a train of thought whether it is generated in response to a perceptual event or is self-generated by the individual. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the experience of mind-wandering is supported by working memory resources. Working memory capacity variation in individuals has been proven to be a good predictor of the natural tendency for mind-wandering to occur during cognitively demanding tasks and various activities in daily life.|$|R
