40|$|The Flow and Temperature Field of a 1000 MW Unit Nuclear reactor {{operation}} process was numerically studied with standard k- model. The conditions of reactor normal, circuit and inlet failure were studied. The different reactor flow characteristics between normal operating and {{two kinds of}} failure cases were compared. The numerical simulation and experiment result as follows: In normal operation condition, coolant of three circuits is distributed in symmetry along circumference of the reactor <b>inlet</b> <b>ring.</b> The coolant flow surrounding and center is relatively large before the reactor core inlet. At upper grating plate region, the coolant flow is symmetry distributed along the grating plate. In case that a circuit fails suddenly and the coolant totally loses, the distribution of water flow for operation circuits is unevenly increased rapidly. In case three circular passages at inlet of the reactor is unevenly blocked by sundries, when a circuit fails suddenly and coolant is totally lost, asymmetry of water flow distribution for three circuits will increase further, which may accelerate the degree and probability of damage to reactor core...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this analysis was to {{study the effects of}} the erosion patterns from the introduction of nozzle flaws machined into the nozzle of the SRTMV-N 2 (Solid Rocket Test Motor V Nozzle 2). The SRTMV-N 2 motor was a single segment static subscale solid rocket motor used to further develop the RSRMV (Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor V Segment). Two flaws or "wedgeouts" were placed in the nozzle inlet parallel to the ply angles of that section to study erosion effects. One wedgeout was placed in the nose cap region and the other placed in the <b>inlet</b> <b>ring</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the bondline, separated 180 degrees circumferentially. A coupled CFD (Computational Fluid Analysis) -thermal iterative analytical approach was utilized at the wedgeouts to analyze the erosion profile during the burn time. The iterative CFD thermal approach was applied at five second intervals throughout the motor burn. The coupled fluid thermal boundary conditions were derived from a steady state CFD solution at the beginning of the interval. The derived heat fluxes were then applied along the surface and a transient thermal solution was developed to characterize the material response over the specified interval. Eroded profiles of each of the nozzle's wedgeouts and the original contour were created at each of the specified intervals. The final iteration of the erosion profile showed that both wedgeouts were "washedout," indicating that the erosion profile of the wedgeout had rejoined the original eroded contour, leaving no trace of the wedgeouts post fire. This analytical assessment agreed with post-fire observations made of the SRTMV-N 2 wedgeouts, which noted a smooth eroded contour...|$|E
40|$|Wet gas {{metering}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important problem to {{the oil and gas}} industry. Much research has been done to measure the water and gas flow rates of two-phase flows using a Venturi meter. The Venturi meter is a favoured device for metering of unprocessed wet natural gas production flows. In this thesis, various combinations of techniques have been employed in annular gas-liquid two phase flows to measure the flow parameters (e. g. liquid film thickness, gas volume fraction and gas and water flow rates). One of the most useful techniques which was used and which has proven attractive for many previous multiphase flow applications is the electrical conductance technique used in conjunction with the Venturi. In this thesis, research has been done on designing a novel wet gas flow metering technique, which combines a Venturi with conductance sensors at the inlet and throat to measure the gas and the water flow rates and gas mass flow rate in vertical annular (wet gas) flows. Two ring conductance sensors at the inlet of the Venturi were used to measure the film velocity by cross correlation, one of the <b>inlet</b> <b>ring</b> conductance sensors was used to measure the film thickness and the inlet gas volume fraction. A ring conductance sensor at the throat was used to measure the gas volume fraction at the Venturi throat. A digital level sensor was also used to measure the film thickness (and the gas volume fraction) at the inlet of the Venturi. The reason for measuring the film thickness, the film velocity, the gas volume fraction at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi was to determine the gas and water flow rate and the gas mass flow rate in annular wet gas two phase flow using a variety of mathematical models of Venturis. This work included both static ‘bench’ and flow loop experiments. In the flow loop experiments, which were limited to air-water two-phase flow, the test section included a Venturi meter with a 50 mm inlet diameter with conductance sensors at inlet and the throat. Reference measurements of the water and air were made with a turbine flow meter and a variable area flow meter respectively. A Honeywell DP cell sensor was used to measure the differential pressure between the inlet and the throat of the Venturi. A NI USB 6009 data acquisition device was used to integrate the system measurements and to control the operation of the overall Venturi system. A program was created using Labview software to read the input signals from the throat conductance ring sensor; the inlet conductance ring sensors; the digital level sensor; the DP cell sensor; the variable area flow meter and the turbine meter. From these measurements the gas volume fraction at the Venturi inlet and the throat, the differential pressure between the inlet and the throat of the Venturi, the film thickness and the film velocity at the Venturi inlet were calculated and were used with appropriate mathematical models to calculate the gas volumetric rate; gas mass flow rate; and the water mass and volumetric flow rates. Reference values of the gas a water flow rates were also calculated from the turbine meter and variable area flow meter outputs...|$|E

40|$|A 2 D fluid {{model for}} RF {{discharges}} {{in a mixture}} of silane and hydrogen is applied to a cylindrically symmetric reactor with an electrode radius large compared to the electrode separation. In the model the electron kinetics are included by solving the two-term Boltzmann equation to obtain the electron energy distribution function. The chemistry is taken from the literature and only diffusive transport of the neutral species is considered. The plasma-wall interaction (including the deposition) is modelled by using surface reaction coefficients. As a result of the large depletion of silane, the uniformity of the deposition strongly depends on the type of gas inlet. Both a showerhead gas inlet system, where the powered electrode is perforated, and gas <b>inlet</b> through a <b>ring</b> shaped area around one of the electrodes are considered. As can be expected, both the discharge and the deposition are homogeneous in case of a shower <b>inlet.</b> The <b>ring</b> <b>inlet</b> leads to an almost pure hydrogen plasma in the centre, while {{at the edge of the}} electrodes a mixture of silane and hydrogen is present. As compared to a small scale reactor with a low depletion, the growth precursor shifts from SiH 3 and higher silane radicals to SiH 2...|$|R

40|$|A set of long chord {{stator vanes}} was {{designed}} to replace the vanes in an existing fan stage. The long chord stator vanes consisted of a turning section and axial extension pieces, all of which incorporated acoustic damping material. The long chord stator vanes were tested in two lengths, with the long version giving more noise reduction than the short, {{primarily because of the}} additional lining material. The noise reduction achieved with the acoustically treated long chord stator vanes was compared with the reduction achieved by an acoustically treated exhaust splitter. The long chord stator was at least as good as the splitter as a method for incorporating acoustic lining material.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [90]- 91) The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate the cause of the failure of a plastic 20 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene blower wheel. The blower wheel plays an integral part in the forced distribution of the airflow in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system of commercial vehicles. Therefore, it is essential that the blower wheel be highly dependable. This is especially true for commercial vehicles where long warranty requirements and high reliability are required. Several test and analysis methods were employed to understand the cause of the failure of the blower wheel. Initially, the high-speed burst test was used to expose the effects of temperature and imbalance on the part. Experimental vibration analysis was performed on the blower wheel to show the characteristic natural frequencies. This was compared to the numerical natural frequencies found with a finite element analysis (FEA) software package. The experimental stress values were compared to the numerical stress values. The material analysis showed the material was not degraded during the injection molding process and it was not always meeting specifications for the glass coupling agent. Finally, the failures were compared to the S-N fatigue life curves for 25 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene and 20 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene material. The study found the root cause of the failures to be a combination of resonance, material issues and fatigue that cause the <b>inlet</b> top <b>ring</b> to break on the blower wheel. Improvements in design, process, and testing are recommended for the blower wheel. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|Tracheal {{ultrasonography}} {{was performed}} to measure {{the width of the}} tracheal ring shadow and to assess the clinical relevance of these measurements for identifying tracheal collapse. The first tracheal ring width (FTRW) and thoracic <b>inlet</b> tracheal <b>ring</b> width (TITRW) were measured on both expiration and inspiration. The mean of the FTRW width (129 dogs) was greater in expiration (10. 97 ± 1. 02 mm, p = 0. 001) than that in inspiration (9. 86 ± 1. 03 mm). For 51 normal dogs, the mean of the TITRW width was greater in expiration (9. 05 ± 1. 52 mm, p = 0. 001) than in inspiration (8. 02 ± 1. 43 mm). For 78 tracheal collapse dogs, the mean of the TITRW width was greater in expiration (15. 89 ± 1. 01 mm, p = 0. 001) than in inspiration (14. 85 ± 1. 17 mm). The TITRW/FTRW ratio of the normal dogs was higher (p = 0. 001) in expiration (0. 81 ± 0. 09) than that in inspiration (0. 79 ± 0. 10). When compared between the normal and tracheal collapse dogs, the TITRW/FTRW ratio was also increased (p = 0. 001) both in expiration (1. 54 ± 0. 09) and inspiration (1. 47 ± 0. 08), respectively. Based on these results, the cutoff level of the TITRW/FTRW ratio was statistically analyzed according to the receiver operating characteristic curve and it could be set at 1. 16 in expiration and at 1. 13 in inspiration. We have demonstrated that tracheal ultrasonography is a useful technique for the evaluation of tracheal collapse and it can be a supportive tool together with the radiographic findings for making the correct diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{acoustic}} {{data have}} shown larger noise attenuations than predicted for acoustically treated aircraft engine <b>inlets</b> without splitter <b>rings.</b> These data have stimulated {{a more detailed}} theoretical study of the acoustic propagation of spinning modes in acoustically treated open circular ducts. In addition, the suppressor with splitter rings was modeled by using the rectangular approximation to the annular duct. The theoretical models {{were used to determine}} optimum impedance and maximum attenuation for several spinning lobe numbers from 0 to 50. It is found that for circular ducts the maximum possible attenuation and the optimum wall impedance are strong functions of the lobe number. For annular ducts the attenuation and optimum wall impedance are insensitive to the spinning lobe number for well cut-on modes. The results help explain why suppressors with splitter rings have been quite effective in spite of the lack of detailed information on the noise-source modal structure. Conversely, effective use of outer-wall treatment alone will require expanded knowledge of the noise-source structure. Approximate solutions are presented to help interpret the more exact theoretical results...|$|R

The fermentor was equipped with a temperature probe, pH sensor and dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor. The height and diameter of the 5 L fermentor were 0.35 and 0.2  m, respectively. The agitation system was a coupling of stirrer that consisted of two propellers on one axle and each propeller had four flat-blades. The agitation rate was controlled by electromagnetic impulse. The aeration system was an air <b>inlet</b> through a <b>ring</b> sparger with air-flow meter and filter. The fermentor and all its parts containing 3 litre medium was sterilized at 121  °C for 30  min. After sterilization, the fermentation medium was inoculated with 5 % (v/v) seed medium. Diluted antifoaming agent was added when foam appeared in the fermentor during the fermentation process. The temperature and aeration rate were maintain at 28  °C and 3  L/min during the whole fermentation process, respectively. The agitation speed was controlled {{in the range of}} 150 – 300  rpm to maintain the DO concentrations over 20 % saturation, which made sure that oxygen supply was enough for cell growth. Samples were acquired from fermentor at every 24  h interval for analysis of GP- 1 production and dry cell weight (DCW).|$|R
40|$|Each H-disk ring {{assembly}} {{is comprised of}} 24 wedge assemblies that are mounted to a ring that provides both structural support and cooling to the detector wedges. Figure 1 - 1 shows the general layout of a disk assembly. In order for the H-disks to operate on the same cooling system {{as the rest of}} the silicon detectors, the pressure drop must be compatible with that of the overall system design. That is, the pressure drop for which the system is to operate, which will include cooling channels for bulkheads, Fdisks, and H-disks, should yield unthrottled flowrates in each cooling device that result in acceptable fluid temperature rises due to their respective heat loads. Too low a pressure drop in any channel would either rob flow from other portions of the detector or require that a higher total flow rate be supplied by the cooling system. Too high a pressure drop would yield an unacceptably large fluid temperature rise across the H-disk ring. In order to keep the detector temperatures low, thus reducing the effect of radiation damage to the silicon, the channel design should also minimize the difference between the bulk fluid temperature and the temperature of the mounting surfaces to which the wedges are attached. This is a significant portion of the overall temperature difference between the coolant fluid and the hottest portion of the silicon. This report compares calculated pressure drops to test results measured on ring mock-ups for two different channel designs. The cross-section of the two different channels discussed here are shown in Figure 1 - 2. Channel A is a simple rectangle with a 1 x 16 mm cross section, while Channel B has a serpentine cross section but maintains a width of 1 mm. Channel A represents an early design concept while Channel B represents the culmination of the design evolution. The serpentine Channel B design has a larger cross-sectional area than Channel A (29 vs. 16 square mm), so it is expected to have a lower {Delta}P. Its larger surface area, while maintaining the same gap height, provides improved heat transfer performance. Both of these channels assume that the <b>ring</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet are 180 {sup o} apart with the flow evenly split between ring halves. Channel configurations that had a single 360 {sup o} channel were also considered. However, in order to keep {Delta}Ps low, larger channels were required to accommodate the higher flows through the channel, and larger gap heights lead to larger fluid-to-wall temperature differences. Therefore, this option was not developed further...|$|R
