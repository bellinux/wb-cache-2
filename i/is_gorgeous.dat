500|$|The {{production}} value has been met with positive critical response. Silverman praised the film's animation, stating that [...] "the movie <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> {{and not just}} for theatrical animation." [...] Silverman also praised the cast, most notably Yuri's voice actors. EGMnow also gave high praise to the animation calling it [...] "beautiful and rich" [...] and said [...] "It is top-of-the-line in artwork, artistic style and coloring. The action sequences, though reminiscent of the game, are not repetitive nor silly. This is a very serious movie and it was treated as such." [...] The Fandom Post agreed saying [...] "the feature has some absolutely stunning visuals which create lush and vibrant environments for the characters to live in which adds a wonderful polish to the work." [...] Similar praise was given by Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com. Andy Hanley praised the distinctive character designs despite criticizing some aspects from the fight scenes.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{received}} negatively by Katherine Dacey of Mangacritic.com {{where it was}} listed as fifth on Manga Critic's [...] "The 2009 Manga Hall of Shame Inductees". Dacey criticized the series' lack of comedy, art style, and the personality of girls stating the author must hate girls. Kurt Hassler of Yen Press rebutted Mangacritics review and disagreed and praised the characters and the art style. Hassler's response to the review led to Dacey modifying her review to specify it was not hatred of women, but of the characters. Hassler also highlighted a quote from a review by Julie Opipari of Manga Maniac Cafe, a personal website, which stated, [...] "The art alone makes this title worthy of a read, with its fine lines, elegant details, and overall attractiveness…the vision revealed inside this book <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous.</b> Dramatic and comedic scenes are played out with equal effectiveness, making the visuals a joy to behold." ...|$|E
500|$|Slugmags Gavin Sheehan wrote: [...] "This soundtrack <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> {{at least}} for the time it was created in." [...] He noted the {{experimental}} style of the tracks, which he credited to the experimental style of the game itself as well as the relative newness of the genre of video game music at the time. Reviewer Patrick Gann of RPGFan received the album well, saying that he enjoyed the variety of genres presented in it, though he noted that the lyrics were [...] "trite and cheesy", though still [...] "catchy". He also applauded the production value, calling it [...] "incredible, especially for 1989". Square Enix Music Online, in their review of the album, called it [...] "a happy little gem with quirks and surprises". Though unlike RPGFan they felt that the sound production quality was not as good as it could be, they still felt that the pieces had [...] "stood the test of time in terms of good music".|$|E

500|$|Enlightenment was {{released}} on VHS in February 1993. It was subsequently released on DVD {{as part of the}} Black Guardian Trilogy, along with preceding stories Mawdryn Undead and Terminus on 10 August 2009. The second disc of the DVD includes a [...] "Special Edition" [...] version of the story; a movie-style edit featuring new CGI graphics throughout, with a newly recorded introduction by director Fiona Cumming. [...] Doctor Who Magazine was not enthusiastic about the new edit suggesting, that [...] "...what is special about it is up for debate." [...] The reviewer disparaged the new special effects, stating that [...] "...this is ironic as there are few Doctor Who stories less in need of replacement effects than Enlightenment. The original model work <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> while this substitute material is crude and unsophisticated in comparison." [...] Alongside the special edition, the DVD contained a number of extra features, including a Making of... documentary and extended interviews with director Fiona Cumming, writer Barbara Clegg and actor Mark Strickson, a documentary on the Guardians plus an excerpt from the Russell Harty Christmas Party TV special featuring Peter Davison. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 57 on 9 March 2011.|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Ryan McCaffrey scored it 8.5 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "one {{of the finest}} XBLA titles of the year." [...] He was {{particularly}} impressed with the graphics; [...] "its aesthetic <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous</b> [...] Several of Deadlights set-pieces are so stunning that I had to actually stop to admire them before pressing onward." [...] He was, however, critical of the puzzle-based levels in the sewers, {{the ease with which}} the player can die, and the final section of the game, writing [...] "These flaws are the difference between Limbos transcendent excellence and Deadlights mere greatness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Film editor Michael Kahn {{spoke of}} {{his work on the}} film: [...] "We have some shots in War Horse that are just fantastic ... We shot it in Devon, and you know it's {{gorgeous}} down there, and the horses are beautiful and the farms are beautiful, beautiful scenery and every shot <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> and eventually you get to the war part of it and it's really, really something." [...] Kahn had a trailer on set and edited the film during filming. Kahn and Spielberg cut the film digitally on an Avid, rather than on film, a first time with this technology for Spielberg: [...] "He decided that he’d like to try it", Kahn commented.|$|E

Cameron does not turn up to the meeting, but suggests they meet somewhere else. Kingston said that [...] " [...] thinks, what the heck? So she goes off ... to a horrible end." [...] On her way to the meet Cameron, India is grabbed in a [...] "dark and empty" [...] alleyway and is murdered by Silas.|$|E
2500|$|Superstition {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Q {{gave it a}} 4-star rating, saying: [...] "They pop it up with sweet string textures on the single 'Kiss Them for Me', bear down on the maritime metaphor of 'Drifter' with doomy foghorn and bells effects, give it the all but Twin Peaks dreamscape for 'Softly'." [...] Melody Maker highly praised the first single: [...] "'Kiss Them for Me' <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> wicked and glamorous". In the same paper, reviewer Jon Wilde described Superstition as [...] "a giant record about obsession, phobia, perspective and emotional tyranny". Wilde said that the song [...] "The Ghost in You" [...] was [...] "a furiously pretty six note refrain that haunts long after the needle has returned to safety". In a 4 out of 5 review, Select praised the album, saying that [...] "Kiss Them for Me" [...] was a [...] "passionately laidback" [...] single, [...] "exotic" [...] and [...] "funky", with [...] "an underlying hush of electro pulsebeat" [...] making it dancefloor friendly. The rest of the album was also reviewed favourably. [...] "Drifter" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of a Sergio Leone film {{with a touch of}} [...] "ethereal sensuality", and [...] "Silver Waterfalls" [...] was qualified as [...] "gorgeous". The reviewer noted that the album ends with the [...] "delicate" [...] "Softly", with lyrics bare and tender enough to be almost like Scott Walker. Glyn Brown concluded: [...] "ambitious".|$|E

2500|$|Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media {{selected}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] as {{a song of}} the day, {{claiming it}} served as a reaffirmation of popular music: [...] "Sometimes, pop music can still break your heart." [...] Writing for BBC Online, Ian Wade noted that the [...] "final track Someone Like You, just voice and piano, is an actual thing of beauty, placing the listener {{in one of those}} moments where you feel you're {{in the presence of a}} future standard." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that [...] "the piano melody <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous</b> and combined with Adele's heartfelt reading of her words, the effect is highly emotional. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike." [...] Lamb went to write that the song is one of the [...] "top songs of 2011" [...] and that [...] "romantic pain has rarely been so utterly beautiful." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters called the song an [...] "absolute magic" [...] and praised Adele's performance by saying, [...] "Though it is unquestionably her finest vocal showcase to date, it is less remarkable for its more powerful moments than for the small ones where her voice dips, with rueful melancholy on the line 'I heard that your dreams came true' or cracks on the 'I beg' in the chorus, like she's startled at the revelation of her own vulnerability." [...] He further called her vocal performance of the song [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "finally worthy of her talents".|$|E
2500|$|Mass Effect 3 was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim by video game critics. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer awarded it 10 out of 10 and asserted that [...] "BioWare has delivered {{one of the most}} intricately crafted stories {{in the history of the}} medium". Thierry Nguyen of 1UP.com rated the game [...] "A" [...] and concluded, [...] "While Mass Effect 3 stumbles at times, the fact that it's the ultimate culmination of my own Shepard's story makes it one of the signature (and somewhat-literal) role-playing-games of this year." [...] Edge rated the game 8/10 saying [...] "It's off-putting to new players, too busy tying up loose ends to dangle any threads of its own, and fails to stand up as its own game in the same manner as its predecessors. But it's also a spectacular, powerfully imagined and dramatically involving final act to one of gaming's richest sci-fi sagas." [...] Tom Francis of PC Gamer U.S. gave the game a score of 93/100 and ended with saying [...] "...the end of the series is a mixed bag. Satisfying in some ways, nonsensical in others, and ultimately too simple. But the sheer scale of the adventure it's ending – and the music, which <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous</b> throughout – gives it an emotional impact that goes beyond its plot payload." [...] Mass Effect 3 was nominated for five awards in the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, including Game of the Year, and it won one, Best RPG. Game Informer awarded it their game of the year award.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{accredited}} {{the script}} and voice acting. Woolsey stated that the game's world is complemented by [...] "interesting, entertaining, and often hilarious" [...] characters whose personalities [...] "shine through every conversation" [...] and a [...] "great vocal cast" [...] that [...] "makes each character believable and memorable." [...] Thew said the characters are well-written and showcase [...] "some great" [...] humor through [...] "extensive and amusing dialogue trees," [...] and like previous Broken Swords, [...] "some of the industry’s best voiceover work". McDonald noted that the mixture of a dark story with [...] "ridiculous" [...] characters with [...] "over-the-top accents" [...] was part of [...] "Broken Swords charm", which he liked, but added {{that it was a}} matter of [...] "personal taste". He stated that a majority of the characters are [...] "well-written" [...] with [...] "memorable individuality", writing: [...] "for once I can actually use the word 'character' without inwardly rolling my eyes." [...] He pointed out Bassam and Rolf Saxon's performance as George Stobbart as highlights. Others were less enthusiastic. Langshaw and Metro GameCentral agreed that, while [...] "by no means poor," [...] the script fell victim to [...] "attempts at humour" [...] that [...] "fall embarrassingly flat", and that the voice cast was [...] "highly variable," [...] namely approving Rolf Saxon's return as George but denouncing Emma Tate as Nico. Even Snædal who commended the [...] "quality" [...] voiceovers, showed disapproval of Tate's overacting. Some reviewers applauded the music. McDonald said [...] "The sound design <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous</b> and reminiscent of earlier games." [...] Thew said the games's [...] "powerful and cinematic" [...] score [...] "evoke nostalgia" [...] and that there is [...] "some fantastic ambiance at play here that really brings the environments to life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jerry Pournelle of BYTE {{named the}} Atari ST version his {{game of the}} month for August 1986, {{describing}} it as [...] "like the old 8-bit Star Raiders had died and gone to heaven.

2500|$|Rating {{the film}} 4/5 stars, Eye for Film commented that [...] "Of all the {{films in the}} Texas Chainsaw series, this is {{probably}} the least gory, a fact that will no doubt disappoint some fans. It certainly has its moments and those disturbed by gore should still approach it with caution, but it's nothing like as gratuitous as much of what has gone before. Events happen to serve the story more than the theme. Horror is found in different places." [...] Staci Wilson of Dread Central wrote that [...] "Not to say I loved Leatherface - It’s far too disgusting for my taste (I'm okay with gore, but there's some gooey necrophilia in this flick that I felt was just thrown in for the ick of it), and there are too many plot holes. Still, it's a very well made film, the cinematography <b>is</b> <b>gorgeous,</b> and the acting is aces across the board", giving a final verdict of 3/5 stars. Anton Bitel of SciFiNow appraised, [...] "In spite, or perhaps because, of all the splatter and excess, this still does not come close to the elusively non-explicit horrors of the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even as it serves as their grim rites of passage. If 'Nobody messes with our family' is the ultimate message, then Maury and Bustillo certainly maintain a respectful continuity to reunite the old clan, as Jed pieces together his future identity from the different influences around him." [...] For being what he called [...] "the most entertaining and pleasing TCM film since 1974's classic", ComingSoon.Net writer Jerry Smith gave the prequel a positive review. He assessed that [...] "Do we really need yet another horror icon origin story and if so, would the explanation be anything we haven't seen before? The answers to these questions are quite refreshing", contrasting the origin story given to that of [...] as having been able to [...] "acknowledge what came before it without ever seeming like a wink-wink to the previous films in the series". V.O.D.zillas Matthew Turner assigned a 6.2 rating, opining [...] "This Texas Chainsaw prequel lacks the original's terror but gets by on style, strong performances and a bucket or two of the red stuff." ...|$|E
