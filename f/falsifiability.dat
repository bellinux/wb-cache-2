5|$|In {{fields such}} as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of <b>falsifiability</b> is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} {{multiple}} intelligences is sometimes cited {{as an example}} of pseudoscience because it lacks empirical evidence or <b>falsifiability,</b> though Gardner has argued otherwise.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-20th century, Karl Popper {{emphasized}} {{the criterion of}} <b>falsifiability</b> to distinguish science from nonscience. Statements, hypotheses, or theories have <b>falsifiability</b> or refutability if there is the inherent possibility {{that they can be}} proven false. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and psychoanalysis as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's theory of relativity as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.|$|E
25|$|SETI {{has also}} {{occasionally}} {{been the target}} of criticism by those who suggest that it is a form of pseudoscience. In particular, critics allege that no observed phenomena suggest the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, and furthermore that the assertion of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence has no good Popperian criteria for <b>falsifiability.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{theory to}} which Kuhn replies {{directly}} is Karl Popper’s “falsificationism,” which stresses <b>falsifiability</b> {{as the most}} important criterion for distinguishing between that which is scientific and that which is unscientific. Kuhn also addresses verificationism, a philosophical movement that emerged in the 1920s among logical positivists. The verifiability principle claims that meaningful statements must be supported by empirical evidence or logical requirements.|$|E
25|$|Some {{accounts}} {{use this}} response to rebut {{claims that the}} theory of evolution is not falsifiable by any empirical evidence. This followed an assertion by philosopher, Karl Popper, who had proposed that <b>falsifiability</b> is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper stated it is {{insufficient}} to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from metaphysics, by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the empirical method, which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation. He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing empirical evidence based on observation, on horoscopes and biographies, it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards. Popper proposed <b>falsifiability</b> as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.|$|E
25|$|Creation {{science is}} not falsifiable: An idea or {{hypothesis}} {{is generally not}} considered to be in the realm of science unless it can be potentially disproved with certain experiments, this is the concept of <b>falsifiability</b> in science. The act of creation as defined in creation science is not falsifiable because no testable bounds can be imposed on the creator. In creation science, the creator is defined as limitless, with the capacity to create (or not), through fiat alone, infinite universes, not just one, and endow each one with its own unique, unimaginable and incomparable character. It is impossible to disprove a claim when that claim as defined encompasses every conceivable contingency.|$|E
25|$|There are {{anomalies}} for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, {{that are}} brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject Karl Popper's model of <b>falsifiability</b> {{as the key}} force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To {{put it in the}} context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating Mercury's perihelion more troubling than the Michelson-Morley experiment results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the logical positivists in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.|$|E
25|$|Kuhn {{states that}} the {{probabilistic}} tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall {{under one of the}} paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of <b>falsifiability</b> is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.|$|E
25|$|Empiricism {{has stood}} in {{contrast}} to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation. Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation {{is made in the}} light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it. Popper proposed replacing verifiability with <b>falsifiability</b> as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method. Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error. It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.|$|E
500|$|Early {{attempts}} by the logical positivists grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless. [...] Popper argued that the central property of science is <b>falsifiability.</b> That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{criterion}} of <b>falsifiability,</b> first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper, astrology is a pseudoscience. Popper regarded astrology as [...] "pseudo-empirical" [...] in that [...] "it appeals to observation and experiment," [...] but [...] "nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards." [...] In contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology has not responded to falsification through experiment.|$|E
500|$|Although later data {{demonstrated}} that this original {{model for the}} structure of globular proteins needed to be amended, several elements of the cyclol model were verified, such as the cyclol reaction itself and the hypothesis that hydrophobic interactions are chiefly responsible for protein folding. [...] The cyclol hypothesis stimulated many scientists to research questions in protein structure and chemistry, and was a precursor of the more accurate models hypothesized for the DNA double helix and protein secondary structure. [...] The proposal and testing of the cyclol model also provides an excellent illustration of empirical <b>falsifiability</b> acting {{as part of the}} scientific method.|$|E
500|$|Flew {{continued}} in many subsequent publications {{to maintain the}} <b>falsifiability</b> criterion for meaning; but in later life retracted the specific assertion in his 1945 paper that all religious language is unfalsifiable, and so meaningless. [...] Drawing specifically on the emerging science of molecular genetics (which had not existed {{at the time of}} his original paper), Flew eventually became convinced that the complexity this revealed in the mechanisms of biological reproduction might not be consistent with the time known to have been available for evolution on Earth to have happened; and that this potentially suggested a valid empirical test by which the assertion [...] "that there is no creator God" [...] might be falsified; [...] "the latest work I have seen shows that the present physical universe gives too little time for these theories of abiogenesis to get the job done." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn {{argued that it}} was not lack of <b>falsifiability</b> that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical. Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research, and so [...] "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise." [...] While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.|$|E
500|$|The cyclol {{model of}} protein {{structure}} {{is an example}} of empirical <b>falsifiability</b> acting as part of the scientific method. [...] An original hypothesis is made that accounts for unexplained experimental observations; the consequences of this hypothesis are worked out, leading to predictions that are tested by experiment. [...] In this case, the key hypothesis was that the cyclol form of the peptide group could be favored over the amide form. [...] This hypothesis led to the predictions of the cyclol-6 molecule and the cyclol fabric, which in turn suggested the model of semi-regular polyhedra for globular proteins. [...] A key testable prediction was that a folded protein's carbonyl groups should be largely converted to hydroxyl groups; however, spectroscopic and chemical experiments showed that this prediction was incorrect. [...] The cyclol model also predicts a high lateral density of amino acids in folded proteins and in films that does not agree with experiment. [...] Hence, the cyclol model could be rejected and the search begun for new hypotheses of protein structure, such as the models of the alpha helix proposed in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Popper instead {{proposed}} that science should adopt a methodology based on <b>falsifiability</b> for demarcation, because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, {{but a single}} experiment can contradict one. [...] Popper holds that scientific theories are characterized by <b>falsifiability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Falsifiability</b> {{has caused}} {{problems}} for creationists: in his 1982 decision McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education, Judge William R. Overton used <b>falsifiability</b> as one basis for his ruling against {{the teaching of}} creation science in the public schools, ultimately declaring it [...] "simply not science." ...|$|E
2500|$|... <b>falsifiability</b> (does it alert us {{when it is}} {{not good}} to use, i.e. when {{assumptions}} are violated?) ...|$|E
2500|$|Debate {{among some}} {{scientists}} and philosophers of science on {{the applicability of}} <b>falsifiability</b> in science continues. Simple <b>falsifiability</b> tests for common descent have been offered by some scientists: for instance, biologist and prominent critic of creationism Richard Dawkins and J. B. S. Haldane both pointed out that if fossil rabbits {{were found in the}} Precambrian era, a time before most similarly complex lifeforms had evolved, [...] "that would completely blow evolution out of the water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher {{of science}} Karl R. Popper {{set out the}} concept of <b>falsifiability</b> {{as a way to}} {{distinguish}} science and pseudoscience: testable theories are scientific, but those that are untestable are not. In Unended Quest, Popper declared [...] "I {{have come to the conclusion}} that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a metaphysical research programme, a possible framework for testable scientific theories," [...] while pointing out it had [...] "scientific character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Karl Popper {{argues that}} a {{preference}} for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its <b>falsifiability</b> criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones [...] "because their empirical content is greater; {{and because they are}} better testable" [...] (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.|$|E
2500|$|In science, Occam's razor {{is used as}} a {{heuristic}} {{guide in}} the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models. In the scientific method, Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the <b>falsifiability</b> criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives. [...] Since one can always burden failing explanations with ad hoc hypotheses to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more testable.|$|E
2500|$|Discerning {{between science}} and [...] "pseudoscience" [...] was the theme of a book by Karl Popper whose summary was quoted in Daubert: [...] "the {{criterion}} of the scientific status of a theory is its <b>falsifiability,</b> or refutability, or testability." [...] The book, Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (5th ed. 1989), pp.34–57, explains how psychology is more like astrology than astronomy {{because it does not}} make predictions about an individual which are falsifiable. He wrote that [...] "the impressive thing about" [...] Einstein's predictions [...] "is the risk involved...If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted." [...] But [...] "it was impossible to describe a human behaviour" [...] which would be accepted as proving psychology false.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Popper {{gave the}} example of Einstein's {{gravitational}} theory, which predicted [...] "light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted." [...] Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs {{had to be taken}} during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, [...] "If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted." [...] Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its <b>falsifiability,</b> refutability, or testability.|$|E
2500|$|The anthropic {{principle}} {{has given rise}} to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The {{anthropic principle}} is often criticized for lacking <b>falsifiability</b> and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, [...] "conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist", is [...] "easy" [...] to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a tautology or truism. [...] However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.|$|E
