5|$|The company's {{first account}} {{was funded by}} a US$5million <b>fixed-income</b> {{investment}} through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987. In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and currencies for institutional investors. As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained {{a reputation as a}} currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>fixed-income</b> securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, have unique characteristics, such as prepayments, which impact their pricing.|$|E
25|$|Interest rate risk: {{the risk}} that the {{relative}} value of an interest-bearing liability, such as a loan or a bond, will worsen due to an interest rate increase. Interest rate risks can be hedged using <b>fixed-income</b> instruments or interest rate swaps.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} tax on <b>fixed-income</b> {{securities}} was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During {{the first week of}} the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, {{the tax on}} <b>fixed-income</b> securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|According to {{estimates}} {{published by the}} International Financial Services London, for the decade prior to the financial crisis in 2008, M was a primary source of investment banking revenue, often accounting for 40% of such revenue, but dropped {{during and after the}} financial crisis. Equity underwriting revenue ranged from 30% to 38% and <b>fixed-income</b> underwriting accounted for the remaining revenue.|$|E
25|$|The {{revenues}} from taxes were disappointing; for example, {{revenues from}} the tax on <b>fixed-income</b> securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million. In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting {{revenues from the}} equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day that}} the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of {{information}} prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on <b>fixed-income</b> securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.|$|E
25|$|Revenues vary {{according}} to tax rate, transactions covered, and tax effects on transactions. The Swedish experience with transaction taxes in 1984–91 demonstrates that the net effect on tax revenues {{can be difficult to}} estimate and can even be negative due to reduced trading volumes. Revenues from the transaction tax on <b>fixed-income</b> securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year but actually amounted to no more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year. Reduced trading volumes also caused a reduction in capital gains tax revenue which entirely offset the transaction tax revenues.|$|E
25|$|In January 1984, Sweden {{introduced}} a 0.5% {{tax on the}} purchase or sale of an equity security. Hence a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. In July 1986, the rate was doubled, and in January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on <b>fixed-income</b> securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%. Analyst Marion G. Wrobel prepared a paper for the Canadian Government in June 1996, examining the international experience with financial transaction taxes, and paying {{particular attention to the}} Swedish experience.|$|E
25|$|In November 1997, Travelers Group (which {{had been}} renamed again in April 1995 when they merged with Aetna Property and Casualty, Inc.), {{acquired}} Salomon Brothers, a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank, in a $9 billion transaction. This deal complemented Travelers/Smith Barney well as Salomon {{was focused on}} <b>fixed-income</b> and institutional clients, whereas Smith Barney was strong in equities and retail. Salomon Brothers absorbed Smith Barney into the new securities unit termed Salomon Smith Barney; a year later, the division incorporated Citicorp's former securities operations as well. The Salomon Smith Barney name was abandoned in October 2003 {{after a series of}} financial scandals that tarnished the bank's reputation.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, the IWW in Canada {{supported}} the Spanish Revolution {{and began to}} recruit for the militia of the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), in direct conflict with Communist Party recruiters for the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, a conflict {{which resulted in a}} number of violent clashes at recruitment rallies in Northern Ontario. Several Canadian IWW members were killed in the Spanish Civil War and the CNT's ensuing defeat at the hands of both Fascist and Stalinist forces. By the middle of the Second World War, IWW membership had dropped to 500, but had rebounded to 2000 by 1946. After this, the IWW entered a long period of decline, with the Canadian Administration slowly shrinking back to its traditional strongholds in Port Arthur and Vancouver, and becoming more of a social club and mutual aid society of mostly Finnish members in Port Arthur and the co-operative businesses they controlled. An Education Workers Industrial Union branch was established at the University of Waterloo in 1968, but failed to achieve success and dissolved. As well, in 1970 La Presse Populaire du Montréal, an IWW-run print shop, was shut down under the War Measures Act due to its support for the FLQ during the October Crisis. As a sign of the times, the old Canadian Administration in Port Arthur was dissolved in 1973 and replaced by a Canadian Regional Organizing Committee, meaning that Canadian branches would be administrated by the General Administration in the United States. IWW activity in Canada began to shift largely toward strike support and labour activism, such as support for the Artistic Woodwork strike in Toronto in 1974. By the 80s, the Vancouver branch was supporting unemployed activism through the Vancouver Unemployed Action Centre by helping to shut down the scam operation Vancouver Job Mart and supporting the campaign for a <b>fixed-income</b> transit pass.|$|E
500|$|A second fund, called All Weather, was {{launched}} in 1996 and highlighted low fees, global inflation-linked bonds, and global <b>fixed-income</b> investments. The fund began as the founder's personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients. The goal of the fund was to create [...] "high, risk adjusted returns" [...] that exceeded {{the return of the}} general market. The All Weather fund contains more than US$46billion {{and is one of the}} largest funds in the U.S. as of 2011. In April 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the fund moved into [...] "safe portfolio" [...] mode which included nominal and inflation-linked bonds and gold instead of equities, emerging market debt, and commodities.|$|E
2500|$|Investors in <b>fixed-income</b> {{securities}} {{are typically}} {{looking for a}} constant and secure return on their investment. For example, a retired person might like to receive a regular dependable payment to live on like gratuity, but not consume principal. This person can buy a bond with their money, and use the coupon payment (the interest) as that regular dependable payment. When the bond matures or is refinanced, the person will have their money returned to them. [...] The major investors in <b>fixed-income</b> securities are institutional investors, such as pension plans, mutual funds, insurance companies and others.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} a company to grow its business, it often must raise money - for example, to finance an acquisition; to buy {{equipment}} or land; or to invest in new product development. The terms on which investors will finance the company {{will depend on the}} risk profile of the company. The company can give up equity by issuing stock, or can promise to pay regular interest and repay the principal on the loan (bonds or bank loans). [...] <b>Fixed-income</b> securities also trade differently than equities. [...] Whereas equities, such as common stock, trade on exchanges or other established trading venues, many <b>fixed-income</b> securities trade over-the-counter on a principal basis.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil {{is a large}} economy {{which has}} {{generally}} allowed their currency to float freely, {{with the exception of}} some low level interventions to counter large capital inflows resulting from major stock sales. As a result, since early 2009 her currency has risen substantially against the dollar, with Goldman Sachs saying the real is the most over valued currency in the world. In October 2010, Brazil began increasing her capital controls, doubling a tax on foreign purchases of <b>fixed-income</b> assets to 4 percent so as to curb the real's appreciation to a two-year. [...] On 18 October, Brazil sought to curb the real's gains by raising taxed capital inflow on <b>fixed-income</b> assets by 2% to 6% and taxed inflows for margin deposits on futures to 6% from 0.38%.|$|E

"A {{survey by}} the Bond Market Association shows {{that at the end}} of 2004, in the United States and Europe there were 74 {{electronic}} trading platforms for trading <b>fixed-income</b> securities and derivatives, with 5 platforms for asset-backed securities in the United States, and 8 in Europe." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Subtitle D, {{the term}} [...] "Asset-Backed Security" [...] {{is defined as}} a <b>fixed-income</b> or other {{security}} collateralized by any type of self-liquidating financial asset, such as a loan, lease, mortgage, that allows the owner of the Asset-Backed Security to receive payments that depend on the cash flow of the (ex.) loan. For regulation purposes, Asset-Backed Securities are described as including (but not limited to): ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{narrative}} {{describing the}} causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000–2007 period when the global pool of <b>fixed-income</b> securities increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2007. This [...] "Giant Pool of Money" [...] increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{fixed income}} is also {{applied to a}} person's income that does not vary {{materially}} over time. This can include income derived from <b>fixed-income</b> investments such as bonds and preferred stocks or pensions that guarantee a fixed income. When pensioners or retirees are dependent on their pension as their dominant source of income, the term [...] "fixed income" [...] can also carry the implication that they have relatively limited discretionary income or have little financial freedom to make large or discretionary expenditures.|$|E
2500|$|The total {{face value}} of an MBS {{decreases}} over time, because like mortgages, and unlike bonds, and most other <b>fixed-income</b> securities, the principal in an MBS is not paid back as a single payment to the bond holder at maturity but rather is paid along with the interest in each periodic payment (monthly, quarterly, etc.). This decrease in face value {{is measured by the}} MBS's [...] "factor", the percentage of the original [...] "face" [...] that remains to be repaid.|$|E
2500|$|Fixed income {{refers to}} {{any type of}} {{investment}} under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule. For example, the borrower {{may have to pay}} interest at a fixed rate once a year, and to repay the principal amount on maturity. <b>Fixed-income</b> [...] securities can be contrasted with equity securities - often referred to as stocks and shares - that create no obligation to pay dividends or any other form of income.|$|E
2500|$|Global Banking and Markets is the {{investment}} banking arm of HSBC. It provides investment banking and financing solutions for corporate and institutional clients, including corporate banking, investment banking, capital markets, trade services, payments and cash management, and leveraged acquisition finance. It provides services in equities, credit and rates, foreign exchange, money markets and securities services, {{in addition to}} asset management services. Global Banking and Markets has offices in more than 60 countries and territories worldwide, and describes itself as [...] "emerging markets-led and financing-focused". It is currently being led by former <b>fixed-income</b> trader Samir Assaf, who was promoted from global head of markets on 10 December 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The {{preferred}} habitat {{theory is}} {{a variant of}} the liquidity premium theory, and states that in addition to interest rate expectations, investors have distinct investment horizons and require a meaningful premium to buy bonds with maturities outside their [...] "preferred" [...] maturity, or habitat. Proponents of this theory believe that short-term investors are more prevalent in the <b>fixed-income</b> market, and therefore longer-term rates tend to be higher than short-term rates, for the most part, but short-term rates can be higher than long-term rates occasionally. [...] This theory is consistent with both the persistence of the normal yield curve shape and the tendency of the yield curve to shift up and down while retaining its shape.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Cisneros left {{public office}} and became {{chairman}} of the Cisneros Asset Management Company, a national asset-management investment firm that managed $550 million in <b>fixed-income</b> accounts. [...] During this period, he hosted Texans, a one-hour television show produced quarterly in Texas, and Adelante, a national daily Spanish-language radio commentary. [...] He also served as deputy {{chairman of the}} Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and until he was named Secretary of HUD, {{he served as a}} board member of the Rockefeller Foundation, chairman of the National Civic League and chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Construction of San Antonio's Alamodome. [...] In 1990, citizens urged Cisneros to run for Governor of Texas, but chose to stay close to home to spend as much time as possible with his family. At the time, doctors did not know if surgery could correct John Paul’s heart problem. [...] Cisneros’ collaboration with his wife in caring for John Paul — who later recovered to flourish in school after several major surgeries — brought the two back together. [...] In 1991, VISTA Magazine awarded him with its Hispanic Man of the Year honor.|$|E
2500|$|From the post-Great Depression era to the present, {{the yield}} curve has usually been [...] "normal" [...] meaning that yields rise as {{maturity}} lengthens (i.e., {{the slope of}} the yield curve is positive). [...] This positive slope reflects investor expectations for the economy to grow in the future and, importantly, for this growth to be associated with a greater expectation that inflation will rise in the future rather than fall. [...] This expectation of higher inflation leads to expectations that the central bank will tighten monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates in the future to slow economic growth and dampen inflationary pressure. [...] It also creates a need for a risk premium associated with the uncertainty about the future rate of inflation and the risk this poses to the future value of cash flows. Investors price these risks into the yield curve by demanding higher yields for maturities further into the future. In a positively sloped yield curve, lenders profit from the passage of time since yields decrease as bonds get closer to maturity (as yield decreases, price increases); this is known as rolldown and is a significant component of profit in <b>fixed-income</b> investing (i.e., buying and selling, not necessarily holding to maturity), particularly if the investing is leveraged.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} inflation-indexed bonds, <b>fixed-income</b> {{securities}} {{linked to a}} specific price index. The most common examples are US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and UK Index Linked Gilts. The interest and principal repayments under this type of bond are adjusted in line with a Consumer Price Index (in the US this is the CPI-U for urban consumers). This means that these bonds are guaranteed to outperform the inflation rate (unless (a) the market price has increased so that the [...] "real" [...] yield is negative, which {{is the case in}} 2012 for many such UK bonds, or (b) the government or other issuer defaults on the bond). This allows investors of all types to preserve the purchasing power of their money even at times of high inflation. For example, assuming 3.88% inflation over the course of 1 year (just about the 56 year average inflation rate, through most of 2006), and a real yield of 2.61% (the fixed US Treasury real yield on October 19, 2006, for a 5 yr TIPS), the adjusted principal of the fixed income would rise from 100 to 103.88 and then the real yield would be applied to the adjusted principal, meaning 103.88 x 1.0261, which equals 106.5913; giving a total return of 6.5913%. TIPS moderately outperform conventional US Treasuries, which yielded just 5.05% for a 1 yr bill on October 19, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|But while Goldman {{was praised}} for its foresight, some argued its bets against the {{securities}} it created {{gave it a}} vested interest in their failure. These securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by April 2010, at least US$5 billion worth of the securities either carried [...] "junk" [...] ratings, or had defaulted. One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against, but also sold to investors, was the $800 million Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in 2006. In the Senate Permanent Subcommittee hearings, Goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books. Unable to sell them directly, it included them in the underlying securities of the CDO and took the short side, but critics McLean and Nocera complained the CDO prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as [...] "'assets sourced from the Street', making it sound as though Goldman randomly selected the securities, instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book." [...] The CDO did not perform well and by March 2008—just 18 months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out [...] "about US$310 million to Goldman and others who had bet against it". Goldman's head of European <b>fixed-income</b> sales lamented in an email made public by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the [...] "real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients" [...] who had invested in the CDO. [...] "The damage this has done to our franchise is very significant." ...|$|E
