50|$|If both {{of these}} {{processes}} (Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering) occur at an equal rate, the vibrations will merely heat up the object. However, one may use an optical cavity to suppress e.g. the Stokes process. This reveals {{the principle of the}} basic optomechanical setup: A laser-driven optical cavity is coupled to the mechanical vibrations of some object. This is a very generic setting. The purpose of the cavity is to select optical frequencies (e.g. to suppress the Stokes process), to resonantly enhance the light intensity and to enhance the sensitivity to the mechanical vibrations. This setup displays features of a true two-way interaction between light and mechanics. This is in contrast to optical tweezers, optical lattices, or vibrational spectroscopy, where the light <b>field</b> <b>controls</b> the mechanics (or vice versa) but the loop is not closed.|$|E
50|$|The PDP-8 divided its memory into 128-word pages. An {{instruction}} could reference {{the current}} page, {{that being the}} page where the instruction itself was located, or page 0, the 128 words of memory at addresses 0-127. Indirect addressing {{could be used to}} produce 12 bit addresses. If more than 4K memory is implemented, the indirect addressing is extended to include the Data Field, thus it is possible to access any location indirectly in 32K maximum. Again, hardware limitations of the LINC-8 make it hard to achieve a total size of more than 8K total. Also implemented is the Instruction Field, making it possible to load larger programs into the same addressing space the Data <b>Field</b> <b>controls.</b> Transfer of control can be either direct or indirect as required. The new address is determined by first setting the new Instruction Field value, and then executing a JMP or JMS instruction into the new field's corresponding 12-bit address, thus effecting a 15-bit address overall.|$|E

40|$|We used a {{controlled}} CO 2 perturbation experiment to test hypotheses {{about changes in}} diversity, composition and structure of soft-bottom intertidal macrobenthic assemblages, under realistic and locally relevant scenarios of seawater acidification. Patches of undisturbed sediment were collected from 2 types of intertidal sedimentary habitat in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (South Portugal) and exposed to 2 levels of seawater acidification (pH reduced by 0. 3 and 0. 6 units) and 1 unmanipulated (control) level. After 75 d the assemblages differed significantly between the 2 types of sediment and between <b>field</b> <b>controls</b> and the ex situ treatments, but not among the 3 pH levels tested. The naturally high values of total alkalinity buffered seawater from the changes imposed on carbonate chemistry and {{may have contributed to}} offsetting acidification at the local scale. Observed differences on biota were strongly related to the organic matter content and grain-size of the sediments, particularly to the fractions of medium and coarse sand. Soft-bottom intertidal macrofauna was significantly affected by the stress of being held in an artificial environment, but not by CO 2 -induced seawater acidification. Given the previously observed variations in the sensitivities of marine organisms to seawater acidification, direct extrapolations of the present findings to different regions or other types of assemblages do not seem advisable. However, the contribution of ex situ studies to the assessment of ecosystem-level responses to environmental disturbances could generally be improved by incorporating adequate <b>field</b> <b>controls</b> in the experimental design.
