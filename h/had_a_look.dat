Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, it was {{announced}} that it would reopen in October under a new chef-owner, Chris Harrod. Harrod had previously worked under Raymond Blanc at two Michelin starred restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons. He had been looking for a restaurant with rooms to purchase, having originally thought to look for one in the Chiltern Hills where they could be added. Harrod said that [...] "I went and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> and was amazed to find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes for what I was looking for. It had the location, the quality suppliers and I knew straight away that I had been looking in the wrong place." [...] The Crown at Whitebrook reopened the following October, and gained a new Michelin star under the new team in the 2014 list. In February 2015, the restaurant was renamed to The Whitebrook.|$|E

500|$|Emperor Shah Jahan {{maintained}} a rigorous schedule during his entire thirty years rule {{and used to}} get up at 4 AM and, after ablutions and prayers, religiously appeared at the jharokha window to show himself to his subjects. During his stay in Agra or Delhi, huge crowds used to assemble to receive his darshan below the balcony. He would appear before the public 45 minutes after sunrise. His subjects would bow before him which he would reciprocate with his imperial salute. There was one particular group of people known as darshaniyas (akin to the guilds of Augustales of the Roman Empire) who were [...] "servile" [...] to the king and who would take their food only after they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the face of the emperor which they considered as auspicious. More than half an hour had to be spent by the King at the balcony as {{it was the only time}} people could submit petitions to the king directly through the chain let down for the purpose (which was drawn up by attendants) of receiving such petitions by passing the nobles of the court. At one time in 1657 when Shah Jahan was sick he could not appear for the Jharokha Darshan which spread speculations of his death.|$|E
500|$|The {{sandwich}} {{that would}} eventually become the Big King was preceded by a similar sandwich called the Double Supreme cheeseburger. Burger King's take on rival McDonald's well-known Big Mac sandwich was released as a test product in January 1996 when McDonald's was having difficulties within the American market. Hoping to build on improving sales of Burger King {{and take advantage of}} perceived market weakness of McDonald's, the chain introduced the Double Supreme as part of an advertising blitz against its competitor. Originally, the burger <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> and composition that resembled the Big Mac: it had two beef patties, [...] "King" [...] sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a three-part sesame seed bun. Because its patties are flame-broiled and larger than McDonald's grill fried and seasoned patties, and the formulation of the [...] "King Sauce" [...] was different from McDonald's [...] "Special sauce", the sandwich had a similar, but not exact, taste and different caloric content. The sandwich was reformulated after the initial test run, removing the center roll. The Double Supreme was advertised with a direct attack on the Big Mac, using the claims that it had 75% more beef and less bread than the McDonald's sandwich. A review of the Burger King sandwich by the Chicago Tribune verified these claims and also stated that the ingredients of the newer sandwich were of better quality than those of the McDonald's product.|$|E

2500|$|The game {{engine was}} {{internally}} developed by SNK. They were considering Unreal Engine earlier in development but {{decided not to}} go with it because the version at the time didn't match well with SNK's situation including their knowledge, budget, and potential risks. They didn't go with cell-shaded graphics because Oda and Kuroki's vision of the King of Fighters series is that of '94. Neo_G agrees that Neo Geo games back then <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> that tried to imitate reality through pixels. According to Oda, the series always had tall [...] "realistic" [...] characters up until XIII, which was more anime-style. The original game had more realistic visuals but clashed with character modelslike Kula Diamond and Athena Asamiyaso they opted for the current look.|$|E

[...] It was only after Mickey Arthur, the former coach of the national team, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at him in the nets and saw potential as a spinner that Botha dropped his ambitions for speed. Spurred on by Arthur's comments that he would do well to turn to spin, Botha remodeled his action and began studying the art of the off spinner and doosra in hopes of emulating the likes of Muttiah Muralitharan and Harbhajan Singh. A successful tour of Sri Lanka with the South Africa A side - in which he took key wickets as well as scoring runs - saw Botha's name penciled in as a potential spinning all-rounder.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the hearings, McCarthy and Senator Stuart Symington (D-Missouri) sparred {{over the}} {{handling}} of secret files by McCarthy's staff. [...] McCarthy staff director Frank Carr testified that everyone who worked on McCarthy's staff had access to classified files regardless of their level of security clearance. [...] Symington hinted that some members of McCarthy's own staff might themselves be subversive and signed a document agreeing to take the stand in the hearings to reveal their names in return for McCarthy's signature on the same document agreeing to an investigation of his staff. But McCarthy, after calling Symington [...] "Sanctimonious Stu", refused to sign the agreement, claiming it contained false statements, and called the accusations an [...] "unfounded smear" [...] on his men. He then rebuked Symington by saying [...] "You're not fooling anyone!" [...] But Symington retaliated with a prophetic remark of his own: [...] "Senator, the American people have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at you now for six weeks; you're not fooling anyone, either." ...|$|E
