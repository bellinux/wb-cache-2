40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} are the upgrade truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for single unit trucks of type, 1. 2 and 1. 22 which {{are not covered by}} AASHTO. The {{equivalency}} factors for front and rear axles of single unit trucks were developed using AASHO Road Test equation after considering the decrease in front axle load and the increase in rear axle load due to the axle load redistribution on upgrades. The axle loads on upgrades are function of position of center of gravity of the truck, wheel base, upgrade magnitude and truck weight. The truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained by summing up the equivalency factors of front and the corresponding rear axles. For upgrade truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> the new term H / B representing the ratio of the height of the center of gravity H to the base length of single unit truck is of great importance. The upgrade truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> were developed taking into consideration the following three values for upgrade namely; 0 %, 8 % and 12 %, four values of slab thickness namely; 6, 8, 10 and 12 inches (15. 24, 20. 32, 25. 40 and 30. 48 cm) and two extreme ratios of H / B of 0. 2 and 1. 0. Three values for terminal levels of serviceability of 2, 2. 5 and 3 were considered. The paper reveals that the upgrade truck <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> increase as the upgrade slopes as well as slabs thickness increase. The increase in the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> is of significance at the higher values of H / B than at the lower ones...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{methods for}} {{assessing}} reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for several common systems that comprise independent components or subsystems. We consider improving {{the reliability of}} the systems by (a) a reduction method and (b) several duplication methods: (i) hot duplication; (ii) cold duplication with perfect switching; (iii) cold duplication with imperfect switching. Two measures for comparing system improvements are considered in this study, survival reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> and mean reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors.</b> We apply our study to: (1) some simple systems including parallel-series and series-parallel systems, with flexible lifetime distributions including generalized quadratic failure rate and exponentiated Weibull lifetime distributions; (2) networks and complex systems with multiple types of components. We choose the exponentiated Weibull and generalized quadratic failure rate distributions because they are flexible and enable comparisons with other reliability equivalence studies. We use the concept of survival signature to derive the reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for any coherent system with any structure and with different lifetime distributions. In order to implement this approach, we use the ReliabilityTheory R package to derive survival reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> and mean reliability <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> for networks and complex systems with multiple types of components. Numerical examples for simple and complex systems are presented, to illustrate how to apply the theoretical results and demonstrate the relative benefits of various system improvements. We explain and discuss the results obtained by presenting summary tables and figures, before presenting conclusions and recommendations that arise from this study. In particular, we deduce that considerable advances in reliability equivalence testing are made possible by specifying and analysing the survival signature, especially for the increasingly common context and practice of modelling networks and complex systems...|$|E

40|$|When {{developing}} a real-time energy management strategy for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, {{it is still}} a challenge for the Equivalent Consumption Minimum Strategy to achieve near-optimal energy consumption, because the optimal <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> is not readily available without the trip information. With the help of realistic speeding profiles sampled from a plug-in hybrid electric bus running on a fixed commuting line, this paper proposes a convenient and effective approach of determining the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> for an adaptive Equivalent Consumption Minimum Strategy. Firstly, with the adaptive law based on the feedback of battery SOC, the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> is described as a combination of the major component and tuning component. In particular, the major part defined as a constant is applied to the inherent consistency of regular speeding profiles, while the second part including a proportional and integral term can slightly tune the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> to satisfy the disparity of daily running cycles. Moreover, Pontryaginâ€™s Minimum Principle is employed and solved by using the shooting method to capture the co-state dynamics, in which the Secant method is introduced to adjust the initial co-state value. And then the initial co-state value in last shooting is taken as the optimal stable constant of <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor.</b> Finally, altogether ten successive driving profiles are selected with different initial SOC levels to evaluate the proposed method, and the results demonstrate the excellent fuel economy compared with the dynamic programming and PMP method...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} modelling the relative effects of seine net biases and for deriving <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> to standardize fish abundance data sets collected using multiple sampling gears. Nearshore fish communities were sampled from 10 sites {{in each of the}} basin and riverine portions of the Swanâ€“Canning Estuary, Western Australia, using beach seine nets of three different lengths (21. 5, 41. 5 and 133 m). The resulting data were subjected to generalized linear modelling to derive <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> relating catches from the two larger net types to those from the 21. 5 m net. <b>Equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> were derived on the basis of functional habitat guilds of fish (small benthic, small pelagic, demersal, pelagic). Prior to standardization, catches from the 41. 5 and 133 m nets consistently underestimated fish densities relative to those from the 21. 5 m net. Following standardization, the degree to which fish densities were underestimated by the two larger nets was reduced and/or eliminated for most guilds, and particularly {{in the case of the}} 133 m net. For both of the larger nets, standardized estimates of total fish density across all species were far closer to those recorded using the 21. 5 m seine, thus indicating that standardization of the fish abundance data had greatly reduced the overall effects of the biases introduced by the different net types. This approach could be applied to other systems and sampling methods, to facilitate more robust comparisons of fish abundances between studies with divergent sampling methodologies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In many {{design codes}} for roadway bridges, fatigue design {{involves}} passing a loadmodel over an influence {{line for a}} critical location on the bridge and then determining the resulting nominal stress range. For fatigue design in the finite-life domain, this stress range is then mul-tiplied by a damage equivalence factor to account for differences in the fatigue damage because of the loadmodel and the expected real traffic. In general, the effects of simultaneous vehicle crossings are not considered in the calibration of the damage equivalence factor. In this paper, fa-tigue design procedures in the U.

Using computer simulation and the Taxi <b>Equivalence</b> <b>Factor</b> (TEF), a concept similar to the passenger car equivalents for heavy vehicles, the impacts of taxi traffic on the capacity, and delays at urban road sections is quantified. The taxi <b>equivalence</b> <b>factor</b> is based either on capacity or on delay.

The results suggest that the TEF is significantly higher for one-lane roads than it is for two-lane roads. Further, the capacity based TEF takes on very low values, while the delay based TEF takes on values that under specific traffic conditions may approach 2. This indicates that the presence of taxis does not seem to affect road capacity, but it significantly affects traffic delay.

40|$|In this paper, a {{systematic}} procedure {{to determine the}} equivalence factor in the equivalent consumption minimisation strategy (ECMS) is proposed. This is relevant when ECMS is not only used for controlling the power split between {{the internal combustion engine}} and the electric machine of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), but also for controlling several auxiliary systems. In this case, the number of controlled components and energy buffers increases, which causes the number of tunable <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> to increase. The procedure to determine the <b>equivalence</b> <b>factors</b> proposed in this paper is based on the observation that ECMS can be considered as a time-invariant feedback policy and dynamic programming (DP) also yields a time-invariant feedback policy when the time horizon of the control problem approaches infinity and the disturbances are constant or absent. As the drive cycle can be considered as a (stationary stochastic) disturbance, we propose to formulate ECMS as the solution of a 1 -step look-ahead stochastic dynamic program (1 slSDP). This strategy results in an energy management strategy that performs close to optimal and yields similar fuel consumption results, when compared to a well-tuned ECMS. The absence of any parameters to be tuned and the fact that fuel consumption is similar to a well-tuned ECMS makes 1 slSDP a useful strategy for energy management of HEVs...|$|E
