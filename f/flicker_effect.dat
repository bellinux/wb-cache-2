50|$|The {{lighting}} {{inside the}} tunnel was last updated in 1981. Before this the lighting was of amber fluroescent tubes {{on the walls}} of the tunnel. The reason given for the change was that the old lighting was ineffective and inefficient. It also caused a <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> on vehicle windscreens, which could induce epileptic reactions in susceptible people.|$|E
50|$|The light {{could be}} varied {{in two ways}} to further enhance any effect:The {{addition}} of a blue or amber filter would make the light source seem further away or closer respectively.The operation of a shutter would create a <b>flickering</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|R

50|$|Kell {{factor is}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly stated to exist {{to account for}} the effects of interlacing. Interlacing itself does not affect Kell factor, but because interlaced video must be low-pass filtered (i.e., blurred) in the vertical dimension to avoid spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e., <b>flickering</b> <b>effects),</b> the Kell factor of interlaced video is said to be about 70% that of progressive video with the same scan line resolution.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{decorative}} element, {{the design of}} a flameless candle is relatively versatile. The body or [...] "housing" [...] of the device is commonly cylindrical, containing a battery pack and an often flame shaped LED light that rests {{at the top of the}} candle. Many manufactures use LED lights with an irregular twinkling or <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> to simulate the calming glow of an open flame. The body of a flameless candle can likewise be made of wax to enhance its resemblance to traditional candles. Because LED lights do not put out as much heat as a live flame, wax based flameless candles do not melt but, rather, maintain their original shape and size for future use.|$|E
5000|$|Conrad knew {{a friend}} who had died from an epileptic seizure, so he talked to a doctor at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital's seizure clinic about the film. He was told that less than 0.01% of the {{population}} was affected and that prompting non-epileptic people with a warning could cause them to have [...] "seizures". He was still concerned about legal liability after finding two cases in New York where theater owners had been sued after people suffered reactions from a frame rate of 16 frames per second. With this in mind, he decided to add a warning {{to the beginning of the}} film. He also added a long section with the film's credits to lull the audience into a state of compliance, making the <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> more impactful.|$|E
5000|$|According to P. Adams Sitney, {{the trend}} in American avant-garde cinema during the late 1940s and 1950s (such {{as the work of}} Maya Deren and Stan Brakhage) was towards [...] "increased complexity". Since the mid-1960s, filmmakers such as Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Paul Sharits, Tony Conrad and Joyce Wieland {{produced}} works where simplicity was foregrounded. Sitney labeled this tendency [...] "structural film." [...] The four characteristics of structural film are [...] "fixed camera position…the <b>flicker</b> <b>effect,</b> loop printing, and rephotography off the screen." [...] Sitney describes Snow as the [...] "dean of structural film-makers" [...] who [...] "utilizes the tension" [...] of Wavelengths use of a [...] "fixed-frame and…the flexibility of the fixed tripod". Where Sitney describes structural film as a [...] "working process," [...] Stephen Heath in Questions of Cinema finds Wavelength [...] "seriously wanting" [...] in that the [...] "implied…narrative Wavelength in some ways a retrograde step in cinematic form". To Heath, the principal theme of Wavelength is the [...] "question of the cinematic institution of the subject of film" [...] rather than the apparatus of filmmaking itself.|$|E

5000|$|A flicker {{light bulb}}, flicker flame light bulb or flicker glow lamp is a gas-discharge lamp which {{produces}} light by ionizing a gas, usually neon mixed with helium {{and a small}} amount of nitrogen gas, by an electric current passing through two flame shaped electrode screens coated with partially decomposed barium azide. The ionized gas moves randomly between the two electrodes which produces a <b>flickering</b> <b>effect,</b> often marketed as suggestive of a candle flame (see image).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} wind power plants working {{connected}} to weak network. For high power applications, at present, doubly fed induction machines are often used. Their use is widespread {{because they make}} possible the speed regulation, even if in a limited range, without the need high power electronic converters. Wind energy conversion systems can produce torque fluctuations at the generator shaft. These fluctuations represent a serious limitation for weak networks in which <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> can emerge. In the paper a full modelling of the doubly fed induction machine used in wind energy systems and of the flicker phenomenon is done. In particular, a new analytical function suitable to represent the magnetic behaviour of the induction machine basing only on some steady state data has been proposed and verified by means of experimental tests. It is shown that rotor feeding influences flicker amplitude. In order to reduce <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> a proper rotor feeding algorithm has been proposed and tested by means of numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the flicker of {{characters}} and images displayed on the home use television screen is often perceived. This study investigated whether such a traditional television screen with <b>flicker</b> <b>effects</b> and a flickerless television screen(non-interlace scan) are different in causing visual fatigue. Each of 16 subjects had five sessions of 20 min each a screen monitoring task followed by a rest period of 20 min. A questionnaire to evaluate visual fatigue was given and dark-focus accommodation, near point accommodation and grating acuity were measured {{at the beginning of}} experiment, after each session and after the rest period. The results of the nearpoint accommodation and grating acuity indicated {{no significant differences between the}} two screens. However, the symptoms of “dryness of the eyes” was more intensive in the increased subjective rating of visual fatigue in the course of the screen monitoring task sessions in the case of a interlace scan screen than in the case of a flickerless screen. Further, the change in dark-focus accommodation during the task did not recover after the rest period of 20 min when the interlaces can screen was used. These results suggest that a flickerless television screen has the possibility of causing less visual fatigue in comparison with a traditional screen with <b>flicker</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

In the video, a circular form materializes on the screen and presents a division between inner and outer. A pulsation between the two is sustained throughout.|$|R
40|$|Squirrel cage {{induction}} machines {{represent a}} common solution widely adopted in wind generation. In fact, the induction machine is simple, reliable, cheap and requires very little maintenance. The employment of induction machines in wind {{power generation system}} needs, however, particular care and braininess. It is well known, in fact, that generator operating conditions can imply saturation of magnetic circuits of the machine. The saturation phenomenon {{has to be taken}} into account when the capacitance necessary for the power factor correction is chosen. Moreover, wind energy conversion system can produce torque fluctuations at the generator shaft. These fluctuations represent a serious limitation for weak networks in which <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> can emerge. In the paper a full modelling of the induction machine used in wind energy systems and of the flicker phenomenon is done. Moreover, the problem of connection of the induction generator to a weak network is analysed. In particular, guidelines to design an electrical filter suitable to avoid <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> are given...|$|E

40|$|Bees were {{conditioned}} to collect food on natural and artificial flower beds, parts {{of which could}} be set into rotation or side to side movement. Through the relative motion of the flowers the number of alternating stimuli upon the bee's eye is increased. Due to the fact that bees show a strong reaction to intermittent optical stimulation, the proportion of bees settling on the moving section of the flower bed is increased. It seems probable therefore that the visual reaction of bees to flowers in nature is largely due to the <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> produced through the motion of the bees relative to the flowers...|$|E

To reduce the <b>flickering</b> <b>effect</b> introduced during the process of frame-based dehazing, a flicker-free module is formulated to alleviate the impacts.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{algorithm}} that stylizes an input video into a painterly animation without user intervention. In particular, {{we focus on}} pointillist animation with stable temporal coherence. Temporal coherence is an important problem in non-photorealistic rendering for videos. To realize pointillist animation, the various characters of pointillism {{should be considered in}} painting process to maintain temporal coherence. For this, we used the particle video algorithm which is a new approach to long-range motion estimation in video. Based on this method, we introduce a method to control the density of particles considering the features of frames and importance maps. Finally, the propagation methods of stroke to minimize <b>flickering</b> <b>effects</b> of brush strokes are introduced...|$|R
40|$|Many {{existing}} {{rate control}} schemes {{in the literature}} consider spatial quality only. As a result, this may introduce a large distortion variation over frames that human is sensitive to. In fact, human is also sensitive to temporal quality. In this work, we design the real-time rate control based on PID controller to have better tradeoff between spatial and temporal quality. From different estimated number of bits of frames and buffer status, different target bits of each frame are used {{in order to reduce}} <b>flickering</b> <b>effect</b> (smaller distortion variation) which is one factor to affect temporal quality. The experimental results suggest that our scheme can obtain more consistent quality while keeping high spatial quality...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{fire and}} the <b>flicker</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{complicated}} process to simulate in realtime and little {{work has been done}} to simulate this complicated illumination effect in realtime. Fire is not a directionally uniform source of light but varies in intensity not only with time but also with direction. Most realtime applications use a standard point light source model for local illumination effects and may use a model to change the light source intensity with time but not direction. The problem is that point light sources are isotropic, but many sources of light have anisotropic qualities as well. Radiance maps and Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) have been used to increase realism at realtime interactive frame rates. These models approximate global illumination by applying an environment map (typically approximated with spherical harmonics) to get their soft lighting effect. In this paper we present Local Dynamic Radiance Maps (LDRM) which uses radiance maps in a local illumination model to add anisotropic behavior to light sources. We implemented a realtime rendering engine that supports shadow mapping and the physically based Cook-Torrance model to approximate global illumination. In particular, we generate dynamic radiance maps using Perlin noise to simulate the nonlinear radiance of fire and we also implement a rudimentary Lattice-Boltzmann flame rendering effect. Finally, we show how LDRM can be applied not just to approximating the fire <b>flicker</b> <b>effect,</b> but as a general framework for simulating the illumination properties of other nonlinear light sources.

In this paper arc furnace is modeled using both chaotic and deterministic elements. The <b>flicker</b> <b>effect,</b> which is the manifestation of voltage fluctuations, is captured using chaotic circuit, whereas a dynamic model in the form of differential equation is used for the electric arc.

The only experimental data available are the ones obtained, for a certain incandescent lamp, by asking several people to report their perception about flicker they were subjected to. In this paper, the possibility of achieving an "objective" evaluation of the <b>flicker</b> <b>effects</b> on human subject is investigated. In particular, the increment of the blood flow in a vessel at the optic nerve papilla is considered and taken as possible index of the annoyance due to flicker...|$|R
50|$|These rather simple {{types of}} dimmers can be {{effectively}} used with inert (or relatively slow reacting) light {{sources such as}} incandescent lamps, for example, for which the additional modulation in supplied electrical energy which {{is caused by the}} dimmer causes only negligible additional fluctuations in the emitted light. Some other types of light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), however, turn on and off extremely rapidly and would perceivably flicker if supplied with low frequency drive voltages. Perceivable <b>flicker</b> <b>effects</b> from such rapid response light sources can be reduced by increasing the PWM frequency. If the light fluctuations are sufficiently rapid (faster than the flicker fusion threshold), the human visual system can no longer resolve them and the eye perceives the time average intensity without flicker.|$|R
