40|$|Intrinsic {{crystallisation}} is invoked at {{each process}} stage during {{the manufacture of}} fluoride glass fibres. Thermal history and crystallisation distributions were calculated by numerical simulation of the entire fibre manufacturing process, from the preform to fibre drawing. Assuming a gaussian field distribution for single-mode fibre, the attenuation due to crystallisation was calculated using classical scattering theory. Results show strong dependence on {{the temperature of the}} core melt and fibre drawing conditions. During fibre manufacture it is necessary to maximise both fibre tension and speed in order to reduce additional attenuation to a level below that of Rayleigh scattering. The mechanical properties of such fibres is governed by the surface quality. A pristine surface was achieved by modifying the <b>drawing</b> <b>furnace</b> to allow evacuation prior to pulling. This indicates that the mechanical weakness of earlier fibres was due to water attack during drawing. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Preform heating {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} steps in the polymer fibre fabrication process due to the potential distortion that can be introduced when exposing the structure to high temperatures. Such heating is further complicated when internal air-structures are introduced into the preform- such as in Microstructured Polymer Optical Fibre (MPOF) preforms. The aim of this study was thus to investigate heat transfer in an MPOF preform. The effect of air-structure was studied using both numerical heat transfer simulations and preform heating experiments. A two-dimensional conductive heat transfer model with surface radiation was used in simulating the transient heat transfer in MPOF preforms with the results compared to those for a solid preform. It was found that relatively long heating times were required to reach a uniform temperature distribution within a preform, and that depending on the preform’s air fraction its centre could heat up either faster or slower than a solid preform. Experimental tests where both a solid and an air-structured preform were heated in a <b>drawing</b> <b>furnace</b> with internal temperatures measured across the preform, confirmed the findings from the numerical simulations. ...|$|E
40|$|Preform is an {{intermediate}} {{product in the}} optical fiber manufacturing process. There are three major processes used in the manufacturing of preform. These are MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, ACVD (Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition) process and VAD (Vapor Axial Deposition) process. In the ACVD process {{it is difficult to}} predict the outer preform diameter as it depends on many in-process parameters like density of soot glass deposited, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the target core rod, sintering speed, furnace temperature and helium flow in the sinter tube during consolidation process. Diameter of preform must be within the limits according to the set up of <b>drawing</b> <b>furnace.</b> For the uniform sintering environment i. e. at constant sintering temperature, speed and helium flow, density of soot glass {{plays a major role in}} deciding the preform diameter. We report here a linear relationship between density of soot glass, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the core rod and final preform diameter after sintering process using a multiple regression technique. Total 2825 samples were taken for the study with soot density between 0. 3 to 0. 7 gm/mm 3 and CSA of glass to be deposited on the core rod between 3700 to 6500 mm 2. Data were analyzed using minitab 14 software. It has been found that 80 % variation in the preform diameter can be explained and hence can be controlled using this relationship.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of glass devitrification and melt crystallization has received considerable interest {{from the point}} of view of controlling the total number of scattering centres in drawn fibers and glass preforms. In recent investigations [1] on bulk glass thermal properties we have evaluated the stability and the devitrification kinetic parameters, by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results obtained by the use of isothermal techniques are in good agreement with those obtained by continuous heating procedures. The thermal characteristics indicate that the glasses have a good combination of casting and devitrification properties and are expected to be suitable for high quality glass preform and fibre fabrication. The aim of this work is the calculation of the viscosity of the glass-forming melts and its dependence on temperature, by using an appropriate model; and also the use of the kinetics data to construct the temperature-heating rate-transformation curves (T-HR-T), which will account for the heating cycle of a glass preform in a fibre <b>drawing</b> <b>furnace.</b> The classical theory of crystal nucleation and simultaneous three dimensional crystal growth models have been used in the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Erofe'ev equation for transformation kinetics to calculate the time-temperature-transformation curves.

We also report on the comparison of measured crystal growth rate in one of the types of cadmium mixed halide glasses (CdF 2 -BaF 2 -NaCl) with the theoretically predicted value.

40|$|It is well {{understood}} that optical fibre quality {{can be affected}} by the conditions present during fibre drawing. fibre tension, drawing speed, furnace temperature, the atmosphere within the ddrawing zone, viscosity of the glass, pre-form neck down shape and vibration in the drawn fibre are all factors which may affect the drawing process, and consequently the properties of the optical fibre. Most of these factors can {{be affected by the}} behaviour of the <b>drawing</b> <b>furnace.</b> Therefor monitoring furnace condition and predicting furnace decay are very important to the optical fibre manufacturing process. However, furnace conditions are very complicated and cannot be described by traditional mathematical models. In order to implement condition monitoring more effectively, the effects of process parameters and vibrations on the porperties and geometry of germanium-doped silica-core single-mode fibre, the subject of the current study were investigated by experiments and literature survey. These results can be used to determine the optimum processing conditions and select feature parameters for a condition monitoring system. Sources of vibration were analysed in order to provide information on which subsequent work to minimise vibrations on the drawn fibre could be based. The feature parameters which relate to furnace decay were extracted from the selected drawing parameters and are presented in this thesis. A new non-contact tension measurement system was devised. Different kinds of neural networks and their application in the furnace condition monitoring systems were investigated and the results are reported. A neural network software with fast training speed and a data exchange interface was developed {{to meet the needs of}} this furnace monitoring system. This thesis oresents a novel on-line condition monitoring system for drawing furnaces in the optical fibre drawing process. This system utilises the feature parameters extracted from drawing parameters and a neural network as the learning and decision making component. It can monitor the performance of the drawing process and give a pre-warning when furnace decay occurs or drawing parameters exceed the allowed working range. Hence, fibre properties can be enhanced, the production yield can be improved and machine utilities can be increased. This system has been used on a production optical fibre drawing tower at Pirelli Cables Limited and a high success rate for recognising furnace condition was achieved. ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Hollow {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} plastics have a structural performance niche {{in a class}} of their own. They offer increased flexural rigidity compared to solid glass fibre reinforced plastics, they offset the need for thin sandwich construction which is both difficult and expensive, and they provide an opportunity to develop laminates with improved or tailored characteristics. An experimental hollow glass fibre manufacturing facility is in operation at the University of Bristol. The facility is capable of drawing precision hollow glass fibres of various diameters with varying degrees of hollowness under precise parameter control. Hollow borosilicate glass fibres have been manufactured from tubular preforms with a variety of internal and external diameters which correspond to a range of hollowness values. In all cases, the resulting hollowness was reduced from that present in the preform state, regardless of <b>drawing</b> rate or <b>furnace</b> temperature. In fact, temperature has been demonstrated to be of paramount importance in controlling fibre hollowness due to the interaction between glass viscosity and surface tension effects. These results suggest that for a given temperature and draw rate there is a single condition where fibre hollowness is maximised and external diameter minimised...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{transport}} {{associated with}} optical fiber drawing at relatively high drawing speeds, ranging up to around 15 m/s, has been numerically investigated. A conjugate problem involving {{the glass and}} the purge gas regions is solved. The transport in the preform/fiber is coupled, through the boundary conditions, with that in the purge gas, {{which is used to}} provide an inert environment in the furnace. The zonal method, which models radiative transport between finite zones in a participating medium, has been employed to compute the radiative heat transfer in the glass. The flow of glass due to the drawing process is modeled with a prescribed free-surface neck-down profile. The numerical results are compared with the few that are available in the literature. The effects of important physical variables such as draw speed, purge gas velocity and properties, furnace temperature, and preform diameter on the flow and the thermal field are investigated. It is found that the fiber <b>drawing</b> speed, the <b>furnace</b> temperature, and the preform diameter have significant effects on the temperature field in the preform/ fiber, while the effects of the purge gas velocity and properties are relatively minor. The overall heating of the preform/fiber is largely due to radiative transport in the furnace and the changes needed in the furnace temperature distribution in order to heat the glass to its softening point at high speeds are determined. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} thermofluidynamical features occurring during {{the drawing of}} capillaries for microstructured optical fibres. Here, the process stability depends strongly on flow and thermal processes taking place as a preform is heated and <b>drawn</b> in the <b>furnace.</b> This is the case particularly for hollow fibres for which {{the existence of the}} inner hole directly depends on material parameters such as the surface tension and the rheological properties and on process parameter such as hole internal pressure and the process temperature. A fluid-mechanics model suggested in the literature [8] that makes use of asymptotic analysis based on small aspect ratio of the micro capillaries, has been revisited and improved recently and the leading-order equations have been then examined in some asymptotic limits by Luzi et al. [7]. Starting from the novel class of solutions of the simplified equations of motion the present paper focuses on the effect of both surface tension and internal hole pressure since those are of essential importance during drawing. Thus, comparisons with experimental data are performed, in order to validate the analytical model developed in [7], which will be briefly presented here. The theoretical model gives very accurate predictions both when the internal hole is pressurized or when no pressure is applied, as long as the temperature does not reach too high values...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{bloomery}} iron-workers in Europe, India or China, African metalworkers did {{not make}} use of water power to blow bellows in furnaces too large to be blown by hand-powered bellows. This is partly because sub-Saharan Africa has much less potential for water power than these other regions, but also {{because there were no}} engineering techniques developed for converting rotary motion to linear motion. African ironworkers did however invent a way to increase the size of their furnaces, and thus the amount of metal produced per charge, without using bellows. This was the natural-draft furnace, which is designed to reach the temperatures necessary to form and drain slag by using a chimney effect - hot air leaving the topic of the <b>furnace</b> <b>draws</b> in more air through openings at the base. (Natural-draft furnaces {{should not be confused with}} wind-powered furnaces, which were invariably small). The natural-draft furnace was the one African innovation in ferrous metallurgy that spread widely. [...] Natural draft furnaces were particularly characteristic of African savanna woodlands, and were used in two belts - across the Sahelian woodlands from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east, and in the Brachystegia-Julbenardia (miombo) woodlands from southern Tanzania south to northern Zimbabwe. The oldest natural-draft furnaces yet found are in Burkina Faso and date to the seventh/eight centuries [...] The large masses of slag (10,000 to 60,000 tons) noted in some locations in Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali reflect the great expansion of iron production in West Africa after 1000 CE that is associated with the spread of natural-draft furnace technology. But not all large scale iron production in Africa was associated with natural draft furnaces - those of Meroe (Sudan, first to fifth centuries CE) were produced by slag-tapping bellows-driven furnaces, and the large 18th-19th century iron industry of the Cameroon grasslands by non-tapping bellows-driven furnaces. All of the large-scale iron smelting recorded so far are in the Sahelian and Sudanic zones that stretch from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east; there were no iron-smelting concentrations like these in central or southern Africa.|$|R
40|$|Chinese {{translation}} of the Reduce Air Infiltration in Furnaces fact sheet. Provides {{suggestions on how to}} improve furnace energy efficiency. Fuel-fired furnaces discharge combustion products through a stack or a chimney. Hot furnace gases are less dense and more buoyant than ambient air, so they rise, creating a differential pressure between the top and the bottom of the furnace. This differential, known as thermal head, is the source of a natural draft or negative pressure in furnaces and boilers. A well-designed furnace (or boiler) is built to avoid air leakage into the furnace or leakage of flue gases from the furnace to the ambient. However, with time, most furnaces develop cracks or openings around doors, joints, and hearth seals. These openings (leaks) usually appear small compared with the overall dimensions of the furnace, so they are often ignored. The negative pressure created by the natural draft (or use of an induced-draft fan) in a <b>furnace</b> <b>draws</b> cold air through the openings (leaks) and into the furnace. The cold air becomes heated to the furnace exhaust gas temperature and then exits through the flue system, wasting valuable fuel. It might also cause excessive oxidation of metals or other materials in the furnaces. The heat loss due to cold air leakage resulting from the natural draft can be estimated if you know four major parameters: (1) The furnace or flue gas temperature; (2) The vertical distance H between the opening (leak) and the point where the exhaust gases leave the furnace and its flue system (if the leak is along a vertical surface, H will be an average value); (3) The area of the leak, in square inches; and (4) The amount of operating time the furnace spends at negative pressure. Secondary parameters that affect the amount of air leakage include these: (1) The furnace firing rate; (2) The flue gas velocity through the stack or the stack cross-section area; (3) The burner operating conditions (e. g., excess air, combustion air temperature, and so on). For furnaces or boilers using an induced-draft (ID) fan, the furnace negative pressure depends on the fan performance and frictional losses between the fan inlet and the point of air leakage. In most cases, it would be necessary to measure or estimate negative pressure at the opening. The amount of air leakage, the heat lost in flue gases, and their effects on increased furnace or boiler fuel consumption can be calculated by using the equations and graphs given in Industrial Furnaces (see W. Trinks et al., below). Note that the actual heat input required to compensate for the heat loss in flue gases due to air leakage would be greater than the heat contained in the air leakage because of the effect of available heat in the furnace. For a high-temperature furnace that is not maintained properly, the fuel consumption increase due to air leakage can be as high as 10 % of the fuel input...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 An {{electric}} arc furnace makes use of electrical {{energy in the form}} of an arc to heat charged material. In the ferromanganese smelting process the ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and manganese oxide (MnO 2) are reduced with coke. The basic reaction that takes place is described in the following equation Fe 203 + 2 Mn 02 + 7 C	 = 2 FeMn + 	 7 C 0 The high quantity of carbon monoxide (CO) produced in the process, which has a significantly high calorific value, can be used to generate energy to supplement certain areas of the process. Due to the moisture in the charged material, electrolysis takes place within the furnace, generating hydrogen (H 2) and oxygen (O 2). The high temperature allows a percentage of the carbon monoxide to combust instantly with the available oxygen, which forms carbon dioxide (CO 2). The balance of gas in the process is primarily nitrogen (N 2), which comes from the air <b>drawn</b> into the <b>furnace,</b> as it is impossible to seal the furnace off perfectly. The oxygen from the air also combusts with the carbon monoxide, however there is always a small percentage of oxygen that does not combust. The following table indicates the percentiles of the different gas compositions within the furnace Gas Composition Percentage (Typical) Percentage (Range) Carbon Monoxide 51. 0 % 50. 0 - 65. 0 % Carbon Dioxide 13. 0 % 10. 0 - 20. 0 % Nitrogen 25. 0 % 20. 0 - 28. 0 % Hydrogen 8. 30 % 7. 50 - 12. 0 % Oxygen 2. 00 % 0. 50 - 3. 50 % Methane 0. 70 % 0. 40 - 0. 80 % Table 1 : Typical gas composition percentages The power input into the furnace process to induce the reduction of the ferric- and manganese oxide, determines the rate at which the reaction takes place. The power input is most commonly measured in MVA and then multiplied by the furnace power factor, which is a function of the electrode characteristics as an inductor, to convert to MW. The rate at which off-gas is generated does not change significantly with the change in power input, however the dust load in the off-gas stream changes exponentially. Larger particulate is generated with the increase in power, as well as the total mass of dust per cubic meter of gas. The dust loading of the off-gas plays a critical role in the design of an off-gas scrubbing system. The following table indicates the increase in dust load with the increase of power input into the furnace. Power Input [MVA] Dust Emission Rate [μg/s] 30 1082. 877 40 2793. 574 50 7206. 776 60 18591. 82 70 47962. 61 Table 2 : Dust emission rate as a function of furnace power Another critical factor of the scrubbing system design is particle size distribution (PSD). The maximum emission of a plant is dictated by environmental legislation, and needs to be adhered to. The greater the dust load in the gas stream, the more efficient the scrubbing system needs to be, because small particulate, which are particles with a sub-micron aerodynamic diameter, is more difficult to remove from a gas stream. The greater the dust load per cubic meter, the greater the quantity of the sub-micron particulate, which significantly influences the design of the scrubber. The required increase in efficiency exponentially increases the power consumption of the scrubbing system, which greatly increases supply costs and service requirements of the plant. The following table indicates the particle size distributions Particle Size [μm] Percentage [Typical] < 1. 00 20. 0 % 1. 00 - 5. 00 40. 0 % 5. 00 - 10. 0 20. 0 % 10. 0 - 100. 0 15. 0 % 50. 0 - 100. 0 4. 00 % 100. 0 - 500. 0 1. 00 % Table 3 : Particle size distribution at 40 MW furnace load These parameters are paramount when conducting the front-end engineering of a scrubbing system for this application. Not only are there financial and commercial implications when failing to adhere to acceptable emissions, but the impact on the surrounding environment can detrimental.
