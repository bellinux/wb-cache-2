40|$|It is {{reported}} that there were <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>buildings</b> called "Disin no Ma" in the mansions {{of some of the}} feudal lords of ancient Japan. Recently the author investigated a "Disin no Ma" that was in a good state of preservation in the site of tha Hikone castle. This building was constructed two hundreds and sixty four years ago. The design of this structure is very striking and worthy of note from the standpoint of present structural engineering. The author points out the gret value of the structure in studying the historical development of earthquake-proof construction in Japan...|$|R
50|$|Constructed by Kapıcıoğlu Company, the <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>building</b> cost 54 million (approx. $40 {{million as}} of 2005). It is {{situated}} on the busy highway , which runs from Istanbul westwards through Büyükçekmece. The mall houses 80 stores, one Migros hypermarket and a food court with fast-food restaurants {{in an area of}} 56000 m2 on three floors. There is also place for 63 offices. The parking lot has a capacity of 700 cars. Around 1,000 service people are employed in the property.|$|E
50|$|The {{fortified}} outer {{structures are}} formed by compacting earth, mixed with stone, bamboo, wood and other readily available materials, to form walls up to 6 ft thick. Branches, strips {{of wood and}} bamboo chips are often laid in the wall as additional reinforcement. The result is a well-lit, well-ventilated, windproof and <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>building</b> that is warm in winter and cool in summer. Tulous usually have only one main gate, guarded by 4 - 5 in wooden doors reinforced with an outer shell of iron plate. The top level of these earth buildings has gun holes for defensive purposes.|$|E
50|$|A Fujian Tulou {{is a type}} {{of rural}} {{dwelling}} of the Hakka people in the mountainous areas in southeastern Fujian, China.They were mostly built between the 13th and the 20th centuries. A tulou is a large, enclosed and fortified earth building, rectangular or circular, with very thick load-bearing rammed earth walls between three and five stories high.A toulou might house up to 80 families. Smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls, storehouses, wells and living areas.The structure resembles a small fortified city.The walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone, bamboo, wood and other readily available materials, and are to 6 ft thick. The result is a well-lit, well-ventilated, windproof and <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>building</b> that is warm in winter and cool in summer.|$|E
30|$|A lot {{has been}} {{accomplished}} in Turkey after the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake in terms of earthquake preparedness. This is especially valid for the Istanbul Metropolitan Area, where comprehensive re-urbanization is taking place to ensure non-earthquake-proof buildings are replaced with <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>buildings.</b> The criticality of this re-urbanization is evident according to a 2011 study, which shows that an earthquake with Mw[*]=[*] 7.25 on the Main Marmara Fault is expected to heavily damage or destroy 2 to 4  % of around 1, 000, 000 buildings in Istanbul with a population around 13 million, with 9 to 15  % of the buildings receiving medium damage and 20 to 34  % of the buildings damaged lightly (Erdik 2013).|$|R

50|$|The {{town was}} {{completely}} destroyed in a destructive earthquake on 8 October 2005. The fault almost {{passes through the}} main bazar of Balakot. It follows the hilly area to the north up to Allai and leads to the Bagh in Azad Jammu & Kashmir from the villages of Balakot like Kanshian and Jabri Kaleesh. The United Arab Emirates has volunteered to rebuild this town into an improved one with housing colonies, schools, hospitals, and other civic facilities. However the Pakistan government has announced that the city will be relocated. The town will be reconstructed about 20 km away at a safer spot with more <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>buildings.</b> The hillside town of Balakot, comprising 12 union councils {{with a population of}} 30,000 people, was completely destroyed by the earthquake on 8 October 2005. Over 90 per cent of the houses were reduced to muddy smears. The survivors will be relocated to the New Balakot City, currently being developed near Mansehra.|$|R
40|$|This {{activity}} {{is designed to}} help students gain experience with the thought process involved in constructing an <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>building.</b> Students use index cards to construct a building that can remain standing as heavy books are dropped nearby. They may also opt to create a building that can sustain strong winds. It must remain standing when it is placed 10 feet from an electric fan that is blowing at low speed.

40|$|A {{powerful}} earthquake {{occurred in}} Nepal on 25 th April 2015 where the highest {{measure of the}} tremor was 7. 9 on the Richter scale {{with a minimum of}} 6. 6. The death toll was around 3000 and thousands were injured in the devastation of the disaster. The earthquake and subsequent earth tremors were also felt in other South East Asian countries including Bangladesh, India and China. Bangladesh was jolted twice by tremors and, although the tremor was not as severe, it was reported to be between 4 and 5 on the Richter scale. Aftershocks {{over the next few days}} were also experienced and these ranged around 5 on the Richter scale. In Bangladesh, six lives were lost, and more than 200 people were injured and were taken to hospital. There were also many buildings that collapsed in the mega city Dhaka and its surrounding areas. This study describes the country’s response to the earthquake. This experience and the lessons learnt highlight the importance for national <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>building</b> regulations and systems to lessen the damage and devastation of any future earthquake...|$|E
40|$|As {{regards the}} 1930 Irpinia {{earthquake}} a detailed research {{both on the}} institutional response to the seismic event in Vulture area and reconstruction of the damage scenario for the town of Melfi has been performed. This study {{was carried out by}} an analysis of coeval dossiers drawn up by the Special Office of Civil Engineers, which was set up after the earthquake. The research brought to light the typologies and the modalities of the institutional actions taken during the post-seismic period. In general, these territorial interventions had a notable effect on urban systems, especially those involving both the partial shifting of urban areas and the construction of <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>buildings.</b> The research also identified the damage pattern in Melfi by a deeper study on about 2400 archive files. A preliminary analysis of the damage pattern indicates probable seismic amplification phenomena due to the lithological and geomorphological features of the site. Moreover, the analysis of time-dependent activities of reconstruction has shown that almost all the buildings of the town (90 %) were repaired or reconstructed within five years after the seismic disaster...|$|R
5000|$|From 1966 to 1971, 1,400,000 {{square metres}} {{of public and}} {{cooperative}} housing were built. Annually, around 300,000 square metres of dwellings were under construction. Most of the buildings constructed during this time were <b>earthquake-proof</b> multi-storey <b>buildings.</b> The Soviet government tried to diversify architectural forms {{to create a more}} varied cityscape. During this period, many schools, hospitals, cultural, and entertainment facilities were constructed, including Lenin's Palace, the Kazakhstan Hotel, and the [...] "Medeo" [...] sports complex.|$|R

2500|$|There was anger {{among the}} {{survivors}} {{over the fact}} that the local authorities did not provide them with temporary shelters. Government officials virtually did not take part in the relief efforts, but Islamic charities tried to provide quick assistance. The inability of the state to effectively respond to the disaster led to widespread criticism. The effects of the earthquake became worse because the construction industry in Algeria did not apply rigorous safety standards of earthquake engineering to build <b>earthquake-proof</b> <b>buildings</b> and several buildings lacked the architecture to withstand earthquakes. New housing blocks constructed by the government and by individual builders were destroyed by the quake, but private building from the French period withstood the earthquake. This was another cause of public anger. Some people claimed that officials saved money by using below-standard material in construction projects. Many angry protesters threw debris when President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Minister of State for the Interior and Local Authorities, Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni, tried to visit some affected regions. A crowd kicked and stoned the car of Bouteflika when he visited Boumerdès shouting [...] "pouvoir assassin". Prime Minister Ouyahia expressed the view of possibility of corruption in the construction sector. A commission of inquiry was set up by the government to investigate the faulty construction of several buildings which collapsed in the quake.|$|R
50|$|As of 2006, {{materials}} {{scientists and}} mechanical engineers are collaborating to develop stand-alone seismic dampers which, when positioned anywhere within a building, will operate within the building's resonance frequency, absorbing detrimental shock waves and oscillations within the structure, giving these dampers {{the ability to}} make any <b>building</b> <b>earthquake-proof,</b> or at least earthquake-resistant.|$|R
50|$|First Trust Building and Garage, {{also known}} as Lloyd's Bank, is a {{historic}} 1927 building located on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California. The building was designed by Cyril Bennett and Fitch Haskell; its design incorporates the Mediterranean Revival, Renaissance Revival, and Beaux-Arts styles. The design features decorative exterior stonework, a red tile hip roof topped with a cupola, and a frieze and balustrade on the south facade. The building's interior is decorated with murals depicting scenes from around Pasadena. Caltech professor R. R. Martel designed the <b>building's</b> <b>earthquake-proof</b> support system, which uses steel beams and girders with reinforcing concrete; the system was considered an important advancement in earthquake-proof construction and became a standard form of construction.|$|R
