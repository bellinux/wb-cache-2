25|$|However, {{despite the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many Shakespearean {{scholars}} believed the play {{to have been}} written by someone other than Shakespeare, there were those throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century who argued against this theory. One such scholar was Edward Capell, who, in 1768, said that the play was badly written but asserted that Shakespeare did write it. Another major scholar to support Shakespeare's authorship was Charles Knight in 1843. Several years later, a number of prominent German Shakespeareans also voiced their belief that Shakespeare wrote the play, including A.W. Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good things {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> {{many people}} are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates {{of the society of}} states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to do much more than most now do.|$|E

The game finally kicked off an hour late, finishing goalless in front of 32,000 spectators. The Birmingham Daily Post editorial next day suggested that [...] "the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many spectators attended under such adverse conditions augurs well for the step that the directors have taken", and that the directors were [...] "to be congratulated in having provided their supporters with a ground second to none in the country".|$|E

500|$|In a Gamasutra feature, Patrick Redding of Ubisoft attested that [...] "the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many of System Shock {{features}} are now virtually de rigueur in modern sci-fi shooters {{is a testament}} to the influence exerted by this one game." [...] GameSpy argued that the game [...] "is the progenitor of today's story-based action games, a group with titles as diverse as Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil, and even Half-Life." [...] Eurogamer called the System Shock series [...] "the benchmark for intelligent first-person gaming", and noted that it [...] "kick-start the revolution which ... has influenced the design of countless other games." [...] Steven Wright for Glixel said in a 2017 essay that System Shock still is important to gaming today, and that the only reasons it is not considered a [...] "Mt. Olympus of gaming" [...] is due to its lower sales compared to titles like Half-Life that sold in the millions, and that at the time it was released, it was difficult for players to adjust to the complex systems in the game compared to straightforward first-person shooters.|$|E
500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

[...] Its last tour, in [...] Australasia, {{conducted}} by the company's new musical director, Fraser Goulding, was a success in 1979. [...] Throughout the 20th century, until 1982, the company toured, on average, for 35 weeks per year (in addition to its 13-week London seasons), fostering a [...] "strong family atmosphere, reinforced {{by the number of}} marriages in the company and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many people stayed with it for so long." [...] Principal soprano Valerie Masterson married the company's principal flautist, Andrew March. [...] She explained, [...] "people didn't have flats or houses ... touring was your life." [...] Throughout its history, the company maintained strict moral standards, and it was sometimes referred to as the [...] "Savoy boarding school", enforcing policies regarding behaviour on and off stage, and even a dress code. [...] Soprano Cynthia Morey ascribed the strong affection that artists had for the company to [...] "the unique family atmosphere engendered by the company's direct descent from its creators, Gilbert, Sullivan ... Richard D'Oyly Carte, followed by his widow, Helen, his son Rupert, and finally his granddaughter Bridget."

She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Vermeer {{was rescued}} from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, {{by which time}} several of his works had been re-{{attributed}} to others. However the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many of his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates {{that the quality of}} individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown. [...] Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of Adriaen Coorte in the 1950s, and the landscapists Jacobus Mancaden and Frans Post earlier in the century.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{sections}} of SR 17 are so dangerous {{that they have}} been nicknamed. [...] The first long sweeping turn North of Summit Road with its sharp angle and steep entering downhill slope is called [...] "The Valley Surprise" [...] for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many strike the median shortly after having entered the Santa Clara Valley. The most infamous is called [...] "Big Moody Curve". [...] This curve is named after Big Moody Creek below, slightly greater than a 180 degree turn, and bracketed by additional 90 degree turns. [...] The inside surfaces of the median barriers in both of these turns are normally chipped up and black with tire rubber.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{question}} {{in the mind of}} anyone acquainted with the <b>facts</b> <b>that,</b> <b>so</b> far as observation and experiment can take us, the structure and the functions of the nervous system are fundamentally the same in an ape, or in a dog, and in a man.

This alluded to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many people have attempted the song on guitar while at music stores, employees became sick of hearing it and banned patrons from playing [...] "Stairway", threatening them with removal. In the video releases and television airings of the movie, however, the notes are changed to a generic guitar riff due to licensing restrictions imposed by WMG and the band.|$|E
2500|$|Hymes clearly {{considers}} {{folklore and}} narrative {{a vital part}} of the fields of linguistics, anthropology and literature, and has bemoaned the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> few scholars in those fields are willing and able to adequately include folklore in its original language in their considerations (Hymes 1981:6-7). He feels that the translated versions of the stories are inadequate for understanding their role in the social or mental system in which they existed. He provides an example that in Navajo, the particles (utterances such as [...] "uh," [...] "So," [...] "Well," [...] etc. that have linguistic if not semantic meaning), omitted in the English translation, are essential to understanding how the story is shaped and how repetition defines the structure that the text embodies.|$|E
2500|$|Church {{construction}} [...] After the conquest, Spaniards' first {{efforts were}} directed at evangelization {{and the related}} task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called tequitqui (Nahuatl for “vassal”), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief. The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. [...] "Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship." [...] The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction.|$|E
