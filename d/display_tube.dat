25|$|Gitton's design {{relies on}} gravity {{powering}} multiple siphons {{in the same}} principle as the Pythagorean cup; for example, after the water level in the minute or hour display tubes is reached, an overflow tube starts {{to act as a}} siphon and thus empties the <b>display</b> <b>tube.</b> Actual time keeping is done by a calibrated pendulum powered by a water stream piped from the clock's reservoir. The pendulum has a carefully constructed container attached to it; this measures the water that is then poured into the display system. There are other modern designs of water clocks, including the Royal Gorge water clock in Colorado, the Woodgrove Mall in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and the Hornsby Water Clock in Sydney, Australia.|$|E

25|$|Devices that functioned in {{the same}} way as Nixie tubes were {{patented}} in the 1930s, and the first mass-produced <b>display</b> <b>tubes</b> were introduced in 1954 by National Union Co. under the brand name Inditron. However, their construction was cruder, their average lifetime was shorter, and they failed to find many applications due to their complex periphery.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} color {{meetings}} {{hosted by the}} FCC, the selection board {{made it clear they}} did not consider the Triniscope to be an acceptable solution. They allowed RCA to use the system in order to illustrate the dot-sequential system, but stated that only a system with a single <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> would be selected. In any event, RCA's displays never produced a reasonable image in testing.|$|E
50|$|The system's opening {{was inaugurated}} by the Minister of Posts Paul von Eltz-Rübenach in Berlin on March 1, 1936, who viewed {{and spoke with}} Leipzig's chief burgomaster. It {{employed}} a Nipkow disk flying-spot scanner for its transmitter, and a cathode ray <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> with (an initial) resolution of 150 lines at its receiving-end videophone booth. The same coaxial cables were also used to distribute television programming.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} between the QT-8D and the QT-8B {{in the operation of}} the right-hand <b>display</b> <b>tube,</b> which contains both a minus-sign indicator and a large dot. On the QT-8D, this dot is used as an overflow error indicator. But on the QT-8B, it acts as a low-battery indicator; overflow errors are signalled by displaying all zeroes with all the decimal point indicators lit.|$|E

5000|$|A remarkably {{wide variety}} of tube and similar sockets is listed and described, with some {{informal}} application notes, at a commercial site, Pacific T.V., including nuvistor, 8-pin subminiature, vidicon, reflex klystron, nine-pin octal-like, 10-pin miniature (two types), 11-pin sub-magnal, diheptal 14-pin, and many <b>display</b> <b>tubes</b> such as Nixies and vacuum fluorescent types (and even more). As well, each socket has a link to a clear, high-quality picture.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{components}} in the composite waveforms for the NTSC, [...] PAL and SECAM broadcast television systems a wideband luminance signal (Y) and two narrow band colour-difference signals, containing (R - Y) and (B - Y). These components are combined to give a waveform suitable for transmission. After reception and demodulation, the composite waveform is decoded to give red, green and blue signals which are applied to the three guns of a <b>display</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|Valve {{oscilloscopes}} {{share this}} very high input impedance {{and thus can}} be used to measure voltages even in very high impedance circuits. There may typically be 3 or 4 stages of amplification per display channel. In later oscilloscopes, a type of amplifier using a series of tubes connected at equal distances along transmission lines, known as a distributed amplifier was employed to amplify very high frequency vertical signals before application to the <b>display</b> <b>tube.</b> Valve oscilloscopes are now obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|Observing {{high speed}} signals, {{especially}} non-repetitive signals, with a conventional CRO is difficult, due to non-stable or changing triggering threshold {{which makes it}} hard to [...] "freeze" [...] the waveform on the screen. This often requires the room to be darkened or a special viewing hood to be placed over the face of the <b>display</b> <b>tube.</b> To aid in viewing such signals, special oscilloscopes have borrowed from night vision technology, employing a microchannel plate electron multiplier behind the tube face to amplify faint beam currents.|$|E

25|$|Other numeric-display {{technologies}} concurrently in use included backlit columnar transparencies ("thermometer displays"), light pipes, rear-projection and edge-lit lightguide displays (all using individual incandescent or neon {{light bulbs}} for illumination), Numitron incandescent filament readouts, Panaplex seven-segment displays, and vacuum fluorescent <b>display</b> <b>tubes.</b> Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly {{by use of}} cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of stepping switches to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of stepping switch to drive Nixie tubes.|$|R
50|$|Although RCA's {{system had}} {{enormous}} benefits, {{it had not}} been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the <b>display</b> <b>tubes.</b> Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the luminance concept, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era.|$|R
50|$|The primary design used an {{electron}} gun arranged {{to the side}} of the screen, either firing horizontally across the top of the <b>display</b> <b>tube,</b> or firing vertically towards the top and then bent through 90 degrees to travel along the top. Across the top of the tube were a series of C-shaped plates and a matching set of parallel bars below it. The plates were charged relative to the bars to provide deflection, bending the beam to travel between the bars and down the face of the tube.|$|E
5000|$|General Electric's Porta-Color was {{the first}} [...] "portable" [...] color {{television}} introduced in the United States. The Porta-Color set introduced a new variation of the shadow mask <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> invented by RCA. It had the electron guns arranged in an in-line configuration, rather than RCA's delta arrangement. The GE tube otherwise used {{the same kind of}} round dot phosphors as RCA, The main benefit of the in-line gun arrangement is that it simplified the convergence process, thus making true portability possible. There were many variations of this set produced from its introduction in 1966 until 1978, all using GE's Compactron vacuum tubes (valves).|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} first charged up by {{scanning}} {{the plate with}} an electron gun similar to one in a conventional television <b>display</b> <b>tube.</b> This process deposits charges into the granules, which {{in a dark room}} would slowly decay away at a known rate. When exposed to light, the photosensitive coating releases electrons which are supplied by the charge stored in the silver. The emission rate increases in proportion to the intensity of the light. Through this process, the plate forms an electrical analog of the visual image, with the stored charge representing the inverse of the average brightness of the image at that location.|$|E

50|$|Zworykin {{pitched the}} concept to Sarnoff, {{claiming}} a viable television {{system could be}} realized in two years with a mere $100,000 investment. Sarnoff opted to fund Zworkyin's research, most likely well-aware that Zworykin was underestimating the scope of his television effort. Seven years later, in late 1935, Zworykin's photograph appeared {{on the cover of}} the trade journal Electronics, holding an early RCA photomultiplier prototype. The photomultiplier, subject of intensive research at RCA and in Leningrad, Russia, would become an essential component within sensitive television cameras. On April 24, 1936, RCA demonstrated to the press a working iconoscope camera tube and kinescope receiver <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> (an early cathode ray tube), two key components of all-electronic television.|$|E
5000|$|Philo Taylor Farnsworth, the American {{inventor}} of all-electronic television in September 1927, {{contributed to this}} in an important way. Farnsworth refined a version of his picture tube (cathode ray tube, or CRT) and called it an [...] "Iatron;" [...] generically known as a storage tube. It could store an image for milliseconds to minutes and even hours. One version that kept an image alive about a second before fading proved to be useful for radar. This slow-to-fade <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> was used by air traffic controllers {{from the very beginning}} of radar usage. With the development of more sophisticated radar systems, it became possible to digitize data and store it in memory, allowing access at a later date.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} and develop the colour picture tubes with high and super-high resolution. The condition for optimum focusing of the electron beam has been determined, the method for analysis of the paraxial electron trajectories has been proposed and developed, the generalized numerical model of electron flow in the electron-optic system design with super-high resolution and also the complex of programs and alorithms for numerical simulation of the electron-optic systems (EOS) have been developed. EOS for the colour tubes with super-high resolution and increased durability has been developed. The methods of engineering design of the proposed gun have been given. The perspective designs of colour <b>display</b> picture <b>tubes</b> have been tested.

50|$|Although RCA's {{system had}} {{enormous}} benefits over CBS's, {{it had not}} been successfully developed because it proved difficult to produce the <b>display</b> <b>tubes.</b> Compared to the CBS system, where the color changed once a frame at 144 times a second, RCA's system changed the color continually across the line, thousands of times a second, far too fast for a mechanical filter like the CBS design. Instead, the system required small dots of colored phosphor to be deposited on the screen, instead of the even coating used in conventional sets or mechanical color systems. These dots were far too small to be accurately hit by an electron gun.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} this time that {{he came up with}} the idea for a new type of thin cathode ray tube (CRT) while he was working with oscilloscopes. He thought the <b>display</b> <b>tubes</b> in use at the time were too long, and a shorter tube would be much more practical. Aiken was not the first to {{consider}} the possibility of a compact CRT with a thin display screen, but no-one had been successful in developing one at that point. There were any number of problems, especially with focusing arrangements, but Aiken kept attacking them one by one until he developed what he felt was a workable solution.|$|R
5000|$|An E-scope is {{essentially}} a B-scope displaying range vs. elevation, rather than range vs. azimuth. They are identical in operation to the B-scope, the name simply indicating [...] "elevation". E-scopes are typically used with height finding radars, which are similar to airborne radars but turned to scan vertically instead of horizontally, they are also {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "nodding radars" [...] due to their antenna's motion. The <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> was generally rotated 90 degrees to put the elevation axis vertical in order to provide a more obvious correlation between the display and the [...] "real world". These displays are also referred to as a Range-Height Indicator, or RHI, but were also commonly referred to (confusingly) as a B-scope as well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result was}} a 2-D display of the air space around the station with the {{operator}} in the middle, with all the aircraft appearing as dots in the proper location in space.

50|$|Because Japanese {{integrated}} circuit manufacturers {{were not yet}} able to produce the high-density MOS LSI ICs which Sharp needed, Sharp sought help from U.S. semiconductor firms. Sharp eventually made an agreement with Rockwell, which manufactured the QT-8D's LSI ICs for Sharp based on Sharp's logic designs. Each of the four LSI ICs contains {{the equivalent of about}} 700 to 900 transistors, and the ICs are named based on their functions. The NRD 2256 handles numerical read-in and display, converting keyboard scancodes into digit values and activating the various <b>display</b> <b>tube</b> segments based on digit values. The DC 2266 does decimal-point control, performing the automatic floating-decimal logic and aligning decimal points for arithmetic operations. The AC 2261 controls the arithmetic and provides the registers, and the AU 2271 performs the arithmetic (using a digital adder) and controls input to the registers.|$|E
