500|$|Reviews of [...] "White Tulip" [...] were {{overwhelmingly}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly {{enjoyed the}} episode, writing [...] "Fringe is becoming ever more adroit at blending its mythology with its paranormal cases". He also praised guest star Peter Weller's performance. After initially expecting a [...] "filler" [...] episode, Ramsey Isler of IGN {{said he was}} [...] "pleasantly proven wrong", as the [...] "story {{turned out to be}} one of the best of the series". Isler continued that [...] "the writers really <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> integrating the overall mythology into a standalone story that is actually damn good... It's brilliant storytelling". Andrew Hanson of Los Angeles Times enjoyed the episode, but wished Astrid got more screen time.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} game's {{real-time}} strategy elements and graphics. IGN considered {{the high quality}} of The Battle for Middle-earth II proof that Electronic Arts was truly interested in building great real-time strategy games. Despite a few minor issues, GameZone was happy with the gameplay of The Battle for Middle-earth II, believing that the game <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> enabling the player to experience the turmoil of the fantasy world. They also admired the game's conversion for the Xbox 360 version, calling it [...] "one of the best PC-to-console conversions" [...] and praising the developers for a [...] "commendable job of assigning actions to the 360 controller’s eight buttons". The graphics were appreciated by ActionTrip, which found it [...] "really hard not to drool over this game", commending the game's design and art team for doing a fabulous job on every location {{that appeared in the}} single-player campaign.|$|E

[...] Fox added that [...] "this was a much anticipated and hoped-for pairing and we got it!" [...] Annie Wu of TV Squad thought that Fey's [...] "impression wasn't perfect {{but it was more}} accurate than Amy Poehler's Hillary Clinton, which [...] still find incredibly off." [...] Wu added that [...] "the mugging for the camera was absolutely hilarious." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote that [...] "Fey's Palin was perfectly good enough" [...] and that [...] "the skit itself <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> what SNL—which has lately cultivated a strong set of female comics—tried hard to do through Hillary's campaign, which is try to address sexism without either simply going for the easy stereotypes or letting female candidates off the hook."

He also {{believed}} Ann's part-time job {{was a good}} way to integrate her into the case, as she had [...] "seemed adrift this season". Zap2it writer Rick Porter felt the episode was [...] "a little light on plot" [...] but included many funny scenes, particularly Andy and April's role-playing, and Ron's chipper attitude the morning after the bar visit, while everyone else remained hungover. Porter also praised Rashida Jones's performance during her hangover scenes. Matt Fowler of IGN said he enjoyed Tom's efforts to [...] "become a high-roller this season", and said Andy and April were fantastic during their role-playing scenes. Fowler also described Ron's defense of Tom's actions as [...] "heart-warming". He gave the episode a 9 out of 10. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said he believed Ann's new part-time job would help better integrate her into the cast. McHatton said the sweet scenes between Leslie and Ben are [...] "quickly becoming my favorite scenes in the series", and said a shot of Ron dancing while drunk at the Snakehole Lounge was [...] "easily one of the funniest things he’s done yet".|$|E

500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club {{felt the}} script balanced all the character subplots extremely well, writing, [...] "It's {{this ability to}} hold down the 'situation' part of situation comedy, while never scrimping on the comedy, that makes it the class of the NBC lineup—the purest, if not the best, sitcom on the air." [...] Pierce also complimented the final scene between Leslie and Mark, which he said brought the season to [...] "a touching full circle". IGN writer Matt Fowler ranked the episode as [...] "outstanding" [...] and claimed it highlighted the strengths of Leslie, by emphasizing the passion with which she views her job, and Ron, by showing how much he cares for his employees even though he hates his job. Fowler said Schneider's departure was handled well, even though he described Mark as the show's least interesting character. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> bringing closure to the season and starting new storylines regarding Pawnee's budget problems. Sepinwall praised the chemistry between Poehler and Scott, as well as Lowe's comedic performance, but said the April and Andy romantic subplot was less consistently effective than the similar pairing between Jim and Pam Halpert on the NBC comedy, The Office.|$|E
500|$|Having left Cold Feet, Ripley {{began to}} take on more leading roles; her first role was as {{housewife}} Deanna in the BBC thriller Green-Eyed Monster, which was broadcast in September 2001. She researched her character, a murderer, by visiting a coroner. Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote of her performance, [...] "Ripley <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> exorcising the ghost of Jenny Gifford [...] by coolly cranking up the insane desperation and needy malevolence to an impressive degree." [...] In 2002, she played domestic abuse victim Donna Massey in Danny Brocklehurst's The Stretford Wives. Ripley was initially not eager to play another character from around Manchester so soon after leaving Cold Feet, but {{she changed her mind}} after reading the script. She did not research spousal abuse to play her character, a woman struggling to bring up her two children in a run-down house while her husband is imprisoned, because she did not find it difficult to [...] "work out what it's like to be scared and want to protect your kids". Also in 2002, Ripley played Rose Bell in the ITV post-war period drama Dead Gorgeous, alongside Helen McCrory. The following year, she provided the voice of Meg in the ITV adaptation of the Meg and Mog children's books, before playing Jill in the third series of the BBC One sitcom Bedtime at the end of 2003.|$|E

This meant that Herbert did not set a time in the session, while Schumacher completed only two of his twelve allotted laps. Speaking of the incident, Schumacher said that [...] "there was a little movement in the steering wheel at the previous corner and at the next it went completely. I spun the car backwards into the tyre barrier and the safety structure behind my head <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> protecting me.

[...] The problem was determined to be a steering failure, specifically a joint in the car's steering column. Replacement steering components were sourced from São Paulo by Benetton engineer Tim Wright, and the team did not encounter any problems over the remainder of the weekend.|$|E

500|$|The episode first {{aired in}} the United States on September 8, 1998. Since then, it has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Andrew Wood of The Plain Dealer had mixed feelings for the episode, stating the episode <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> setting up the world of Pokémon, {{and that it was}} faithful to the game. However, Wood thought it was [...] "apparent" [...] in this episode that without a traveling partner, [...] "Ash just isn't all that interesting". Andrew Tei of Mania.com said that [...] "one great thing about listening to early dubs is how the voice actors haven't completely gotten into their roles yet. Ash's and James' voices are much deeper than where they end up at." [...] Louis Bedigian of GameZone believed the best moment of the episode to be the Pokémon battle on television at the beginning, stating that [...] "the Pokémon battle side-to-side in black and white. Their movements are slow and appear to be turn-based. It emulates the game perfectly, then quickly transforms into a more realistic, full-color battle. Few game-based anime series incorporate the game elements so well." [...] X-Entertainment considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be the moment when Ash spots the mysterious Ho-Oh, a Pokémon whose data was not included in the Pokédex at the time.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said after}} six episodes, he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] was the episode where the Parks and Recreation {{found the right}} tone for the series and Leslie Knope character. Sepinwall said all the {{characters}} were very likable, the jokes seemed natural and the awkwardness of the show was turned down enough to work properly. The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said while the first five episodes of the season had been disappointing, [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked an improvement in which [...] "the characters were more defined, their quirks and rhythms understood". Matt Fowler of IGN {{said he did not}} find the episode especially funny but that it <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> fleshing out the characters. He said Chris Pratt was especially funny, and that his band's song [...] "The Pit" [...] was stuck in his head after the episode. The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps, who had mixed feelings about Parks and Recreation throughout the season, said [...] "Rock Show" [...] was very funny and restored his faith in the potential of the series. Phipps said he believed the show would become very popular in the second season, and that people would later claim to like the first season more than they did the first time they saw it. In October 2009, while reviewing the second season episode [...] "Sister City", A.V.
