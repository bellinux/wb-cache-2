40|$|Because some {{evidence}} favors the hyperarousal model of insomnia, {{we sought to}} learn more about the dynamics of this phenomenon during sleep. Polysomnographic data from 30 normative subjects and 86 untreated primary insomnia sufferers recruited from the database of the sleep laboratory were studied for whole nights and in terms of <b>thirds</b> of <b>the</b> night. Untreated primary insomnia sufferers had an increased sleep latency and excess of WASO, together with a deficit in REM and NREM sleep <b>during</b> <b>the</b> entire night. In terms of <b>thirds</b> of <b>the</b> night, they presented a major excess of WASO <b>during</b> <b>the</b> first and last <b>thirds</b> of <b>the</b> night but an excess of lesser importance <b>during</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>third.</b> A deficit in SWS was found <b>during</b> <b>the</b> first <b>third</b> of <b>the</b> night, but for REM, the deficit was present <b>during</b> both <b>the</b> first and last thirds. Primary insomnia sufferers had no SWS or REM deficit <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second <b>third</b> of <b>the</b> night. We found that the hyperarousal phenomenon occurs mainly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> sleep-onset period of the first and last <b>thirds</b> of <b>the</b> night and is less important <b>during</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>third.</b> These results open new avenues for understanding the pathophysiology of primary insomnia.
