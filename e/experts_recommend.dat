5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. <b>Experts</b> <b>recommend</b> total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Blood {{pressure}} readings do vary but <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> that blood pressure should not range above 140/80. Secondly, {{high blood pressure}} is a silent disease and thus it is vital for all diabetics to regularly check their blood pressure or have it checked at a doctor's office on a regular basis. The American Diabetes Association recommends that all diabetics get their blood pressure measured by a health care professional at least 2-5 times a year.|$|E
25|$|Routine {{complete}} {{blood count}} (CBC), basic metabolic profile, liver enzymes, and coagulation should be performed. Most <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> a diagnostic paracentesis be performed if the ascites is new or if the patient with ascites is being admitted to the hospital. The fluid is then reviewed for its gross appearance, protein level, albumin, and cell counts (red and white). Additional tests will be performed if indicated such as microbiological culture, Gram stain and cytopathology.|$|E
25|$|Bra <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> that women, {{especially}} those whose cup sizes are D or larger, get a professional bra fitting from the lingerie department of a clothing store or a specialty lingerie store. However, even professional bra fitters {{in different countries}} including New Zealand and the United Kingdom produce inconsistent measurements of the same person. There is significant heterogeneity in breast shape, density, and volume. As such, current methods of bra fitting may be insufficient for this range of chest morphology.|$|E

However, the proposal was dropped following the birth of Hisahito, the Emperor's first grandson and Aiko's first male cousin.|$|R
50|$|Vented {{thermal storage}} walls vented to the {{interior}} have proven somewhat ineffective, mostly because they deliver too much heat during the day in mild weather and during summer months; they simply overheat and create comfort issues.

25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid {{levels in the}} blood, and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concludes that the findings ″do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids.″ Researchers acknowledged that despite their results, further research is necessary, especially in people who are initially healthy. Until the picture becomes clearer, <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> people stick to the current guidelines on fat consumption.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{not often}} {{considered}} as a treatment option in SCLC (including c-SCLC) due to the high probability of distant metastases {{at the time of}} diagnosis. This paradigm was driven by early studies showing that the administration of systemic therapies resulted in improved survival as compared to patients undergoing surgical resection. Recent studies, however, have suggested that surgery for highly selected, very early-stage c-SCLC patients may indeed improve outcomes. Other <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> resection for residual masses of NSCLC components after complete local tumor response to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in c-SCLC.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of these aromas is very {{dependent on the}} amount of anthocyanins and other phenolics that protect these compounds from oxidation. One of the reasons why rosés have such a very limited shelf-life is because of their low phenolic levels due to the very limited skin contact and extraction time. Usually within a year of production the levels of 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol in the wine have dropped to half its fermentation levels with the presence of 3-mercaptohenyl acetate undetectable in most wines. This is why most wine <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> that rosés are consumed as soon after release as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, these experts, whose {{ideas were}} {{embodied}} in Infant Care pamphlets {{distributed by the}} U.S. government, warned against “excessive” affection by parents for their children. [...] To maintain sterility and to prevent children from becoming spoiled or fussy, these <b>experts</b> <b>recommended</b> kissing children only on the forehead and limiting hugs or other displays of affection.|$|R
5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international <b>experts</b> <b>recommended</b> that the tram company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a full-scale model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|R
50|$|This {{mushroom}} {{is available}} fresh or canned, with <b>experts</b> <b>recommending</b> fresh enoki specimens with firm, white, shiny caps, {{rather than those}} with slimy or brownish stalks that are best avoided. It is traditionally used for soups, but {{can also be used}} for salads and other dishes. The mushroom has a crisp texture and can be refrigerated for approximately one week.|$|R
2500|$|Bacterial {{overgrowth}} {{is usually}} {{treated with a}} course of antibiotics although whether antibiotics should be a first line treatment {{is a matter of}} debate. Some <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> probiotics as first line therapy with antibiotics being reserved as a second line treatment for more severe cases of SIBO. Prokinetic drugs are other options but research in humans is limited. A variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, [...] metronidazole, neomycin, cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitazoxanide have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of rifaximin.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the risk}} of viability—and the {{corresponding}} legal implications that can come with a live birth—most <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> induced fetal demise, also referred to as feticide, for abortions after 18 to 20 weeks gestation. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstericss states that abortions [...] "after 22 weeks [...] must be preceded by feticide." [...] If medical staff observe signs of life, they may be required to provide care: emergency medical care if the child has a good chance of survival and palliative care if not.|$|E
2500|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{the widespread}} use of cervical [...] "Pap smear" [...] screening programs has reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer by 50% or more. Current preventive vaccines reduce but do not eliminate the chance of getting cervical cancer. Therefore, <b>experts</b> <b>recommend</b> that women combine the benefits of both programs by seeking regular Pap smear screening, even after vaccination. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has recommended all European teenage girls to be vaccinated; however Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Turkey currently do not have a vaccination program in place.|$|E
