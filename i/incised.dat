5|$|At Puerco Pueblo {{and many}} other sites within the park, petroglyphs—images, symbols, or designs—have been scratched, pecked, carved, or <b>incised</b> on rock surfaces, often on a patina known as desert varnish. Most of the petroglyphs in Petrified Forest National Park {{are thought to be}} between 650 and 2,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} part of the period there is {{relatively}} little metalwork and a larger amount of ceramics. The assemblage of early Iron Age ceramics from Atlantic Scotland is large compared with the rest of Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which resemble those of southern Britain, particularly those with <b>incised</b> geometric ornament.|$|E
5|$|Han luxury items {{furnished}} {{the homes}} of wealthy merchants, officials, nobles, and royalty. Such goods were often highly decorated by skilled artisans. These include red-and-black lacquerwares in various shapes and sizes, bronze items such as raised-relief decorated mirrors, oil lamps {{in the shape of}} human figures, and gilded bronzewares, glazed ceramic wares with various <b>incised</b> designs, and ornaments and jewelry made of jade, opal, amber, quartz, gold, and silver.|$|E
50|$|<b>Incises</b> (1994/2001) and Sur <b>Incises</b> (1996/1998) are {{two related}} {{works of the}} French {{composer}} Pierre Boulez.

50|$|The {{pitches of}} the row used in Répons are those based on the Sacher hexachord and used in the rows for several other Boulez compositions: Messagesquisse, Dérive 1, <b>Incises,</b> and Sur <b>Incises.</b>|$|R
50|$|The twelve {{compositions}} include Pierre Boulez's Messagesquisse, Hans Werner Henze's Capriccio, Witold Lutosławski's Sacher Variation, and Henri Dutilleux's Trois strophes sur le nom de Sacher. Messagesquisse {{is dedicated}} to Sacher, but Boulez's Répons, Dérive 1, <b>Incises,</b> and Sur <b>Incises</b> all use rows with the same pitches.|$|R
5|$|In {{the centre}} {{room of the}} {{transept}} there is a low slate slab altar stone, with an etched red Chi-Ro emblem, with Alpha and Omega <b>incised.</b> A Chi-ro is an early form of Christogram, and is formed by the super imposition {{of the first two}} letters of the Greek alphabet onto a circle. There is a rough Cornish granite monolith seat and prie-dieu, which with the altar stone are inset with gold-enamelled small tiles by Andrew Rowe. The wall plaster has an <b>incised</b> red line. There is a white glazed tiled floor with red tile border around the two early Celtic crosses. In the south wall above the stone crosses are 1920s/1930s windows representing Saints Padarn, Dewi and (in the centre and above) Teilo. The Padarn window is a single-light window with a standing figure of St Padarn holding a staff and chalice, with a valley and hills behind him. It was given in memory of members of the Bonsall family, and was made by the Heaton, Butler & Bayne, London, around 1930, thus preceding Peter Lord's work on the transept.|$|E
5|$|No {{architectural}} drawings {{survive for}} any English cathedral earlier than 1525 (although an engineer's {{design for a}} proposed new water supply at Canterbury cathedral priory exists in a 12th-century plan). Architectural details, such as window tracery designs, were not executed as scale drawings, but were <b>incised</b> full-size onto a large flat gypsum tracing-floor, examples of which survive at York and Wells.|$|E
5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed. They are {{primarily}} distinguished by {{the height of}} mature plants {{and the depth of}} the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply <b>incised</b> leaves, may actually be hybrids of P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides. In that context, some may be referred to by the hybrid name P. ×hybrida.|$|E
5000|$|Based on the {{material}} of <b>Incises,</b> Sur <b>Incises</b> is a two-movement work (the movements are called [...] "Moment I" [...] and [...] "Moment II") for three pianos, three harps, and three percussion parts, which {{use a variety of}} tuned percussion instruments: vibraphone, marimba, glockenspiel, steel drums, tubular bells, and crotales. Here the sounds of the piano in <b>Incises</b> are broken into component parts played by the harps and percussion, and they are deployed across space by spreading the three groups apart in the performance area. This kind of reworking of an earlier piece is characteristic of Boulez, the first instance being Structures.|$|R

5|$|About 250 Pictish stones {{survive and}} have been {{assigned}} by scholars to three classes. Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the 7th century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include <b>incised</b> symbols of animals including fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and <b>incised</b> cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria {{can be traced back}} to the Paleolithic. Animal bones <b>incised</b> with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply <b>incised</b> and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{types and}} styles of {{ceramics}} {{have been found}} during the excavations at Gedi including Chinese porcelain, Islamic glazed ware, and locally produced earthenwares. Several examples of the ceramics recovered at Gedi are represented in different quantities at other coastal sites. Red slipped pottery is rare at Gedi, compared to other inland sites, while bowls with rounded bottoms, flat rims, and <b>incised</b> ornamentation {{on top of the}} rims are more common at Gedi. White to cream colored bowls were also found in small quantities, along with an isolated pottery type that has a golden brown luster. A sherd with a trellis pattern is a possible import from the African interior.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to study the surface {{characteristics}} of the dental 3 Y-TZP ceramic treated by machining process and analysis what impact on the mechanical properties of the 3 Y-TZP dental restorations. Dense core ceramic discs were made of 3 Y-TZP. The samples were partially sintered to get part strength after uniaxial pressure moulding. The partially sintering green body could be treated by grinding, <b>incising</b> and milling and <b>incising</b> to simulate the CAD-CAM (computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing) process in dentistry. The partially sintering samples were then sintered to achieve full density. The dense sintered ceramics were also treated by grinding and <b>incising</b> to simulate the dental restorations adjusting process in dental clinic. The both surface of the specimens were studied with an optical microscope and field emission SEM. Bulges were observed on the surface of the sample after uniaxial pressure moulding process. The defects due to partially sintered green body milling process were different from <b>incising</b> process in size and shape. Groves are observed on the surfaces of the samples after grinding process. The conclusions were that (i) machining of the final sintered dental 3 Y-TZP ceramic brought more critical damage than the machining of partly-sintered green-bodies; (ii) the milling process of the partially sintered green-body brought less damage to the 3 Y-TZP samples than the <b>incising</b> process...|$|R
