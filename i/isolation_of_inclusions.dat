40|$|New {{methods for}} the chromatographic <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> bodies {{directly}} from crude Escherichia coli homogenates {{and for the}} refolding of denatured protein are presented. The traditional method of differential centrifugation for the <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> purified <b>inclusion</b> bodies {{is replaced by a}} single gel-filtration step. The principle is that the exclusion limit of the gel particles is chosen such that only the inclusion bodies are excluded, i. e., all other components of the crude homogenate penetrate the gel under the conditions selected. In the novel column refolding process, a decreasing gradient of denaturant (urea or Gu-HCl), combined with an increasing pH gradient, is introduced into a gel-filtration column packed with a gel medium that has an exclusion limit lower than the molecular mass of the protein to be refolded. A limited sample volume of the protein, dissolved in the highest denaturant concentration at the lowest pH of the selected gradient combination, is applied to the column. During the course of elution, the zone of denatured protein moves down the column at a speed approximately threefold higher than that of the denaturant. This means that the protein sample will gradually pass through areas of increasingly lower denaturant concentrations and higher pH, which promotes refolding into the native conformation. The shape and slope of the gradients, as well as the flow rate, will influence the refolding rate and can be adjusted for different protein samples. The principle is illustrated using a denatured recombinant scFv fusion protein obtained from E. coli inclusion bodies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|The {{development}} of methods to assemble nucleosomes from recombinant histones decades ago has transformed chromatin research. Nevertheless, nucleosome reconstitution remains time consuming to this day, {{not least because}} the four individual histones must be purified first. Here, we present a streamlined purification protocol of recombinant histones from bacteria. We termed this method "rapid histone purification" (RHP) as it circumvents <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> bodies and thereby cuts out the most time-consuming step of traditional purification protocols. Instead <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> body <b>isolation,</b> whole cell extracts are prepared under strongly denaturing conditions that directly solubilize inclusion bodies. By ion exchange chromatography, the histones are purified from the extracts. The protocol has been successfully applied to all four canonical Drosophila and human histones. RHP histones and histones that were purified from isolated inclusion bodies had similar purities. The different purification strategies also did not impact the quality of octamers reconstituted from these histones. We expect that the RHP protocol can be readily applied to the purification of canonical histones from other species {{as well as the}} numerous histone variants...|$|R

Cell fractionation studies showed that these inclusions could be recovered in subcellular fractions containing ribosomes and polysomes. <b>Isolation</b> <b>of</b> these <b>inclusions</b> was accomplished by procedures involving RNase treatment of these fractions followed by repurification, or by fluorocarbon extraction and gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopy indicated that the isolated inclusions exhibited a major periodicity of approximately 8 nm with minor periodicities of approximately 4 nm.

A Thioflavin-S assay was set-up to evaluate inclusion body formation during growth and optimize culture conditions for amyloid-beta peptides production. A simple and fast purification protocol including first the <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclusion</b> bodies and second, two cycles of high pH denaturation/neutralization combined with an ultrafiltration step on 30 -kDa cut-off membrane was established. Special attention was paid to purity monitoring based on a rational combination of UV spectrophotometry and SDS-PAGE analyses at the various stages of the process. It revealed that this chromatography-free protocol affords good yield of high quality peptides in term of purity. The resulting peptides were fully characterized and are appropriate models for highly reproducible in vitro aggregation studies...|$|R
40|$|By {{use of a}} T 7 {{expression}} system, {{large amounts}} of active Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase sigma A factor were produced in Escherichia coli cells. This overproduced protein {{was found in the}} form <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> bodies and constituted 40 % of the total cellular protein. Because of the ease <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclusion</b> bodies and the acidic properties of sigma A, the protein was purified to more than 99 % purity and the yield was about 90 mg/liter of culture. Gel mobility, antigenicity, specificity of promoter recognition, and N-terminal amino acid sequence of the overproduced sigma were found to be the same as those of native sigma A. Partial proteolysis analysis of sigma A protein suggested the presence of a protease-sensitive surface region in the C-terminal part of the sigma A protein. The promoter - 10 binding region of sigma A was less sensitive to proteases and was probably involved in a hydrophobic, tightly folded domain of sigma A protein...|$|R

Two similar, but crystallographically independent, molecules exist within the unit cell. Ab initio calculations, using Gaussian 03 (LanL 2 DZ basis set at the Hartree–Fock level of theory), predict that these have steric energies of 97. 73 and 97. 06 kJ mol- 1, respectively, above that of the minimum energy (gas phase) conformer of the same hydrogen-bonding configuration, which {{is believed to be}} the structure of global minimum energy. The mean of these energies (97. 4 kJ mol- 1) represents a best estimate of the crystal packing energy for (S) -thpec 12, some of which is seen to be expended in rotating the phenyl rings away from the positions favoured in the gas phase. The ability of the CdII complex of (S) -thpec 12 to act as a molecular receptor for aromatic anions is demonstrated by the <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> two <b>inclusion</b> compounds in which p-nitrophenolate and anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonate are retained.

40|$|The development, optimization, and {{analysis}} of downstream processes are challenged by {{a high number of}} potentially critical process parameters that need to be investigated using lab-scale experiments. These process parameters are spread across multiple unit operations and potentially show interactions across unit operations. In this contribution, we present a novel strategy for bioprocess development that considers the risk of parameter interactions across unit operations for efficient experimental design. A novel risk assessment tool (interaction matrix) is introduced to the Quality by Design (QbD) workflow. Using this tool, the risk of interaction across unit operations is rated. Subsequently, a design of experiments (DoE) across unit operations is conducted that has the power to reveal multivariate interdependencies. The power of the presented strategy is demonstrated for protein <b>isolation</b> steps <b>of</b> an <b>inclusion</b> body process, focusing on the quality attribute inclusion body purity. The concentration of Triton X- 100 in the course <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> body (IB) purification was shown to interact with the g-number of the subsequent centrifugation step.

When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells.

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} for in vivo {{immobilization of enzymes}} on the surfaces <b>of</b> <b>inclusion</b> bodies has been established.

Coexpression in the same cell of galactose oxidase (GOase) from Fusarium spp. carrying a carboxy-terminal positively charged coil (lysine-rich coil [Kcoil]) sequence results in heterodimeric coiled-coil formation in vivo and in the capture of the enzyme in active form on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>inclusion</b> body particle. These round-shaped enzyme-decorated microparticles, with sizes of approximately 0. 7 μm, can be isolated from lysed cells simply by centrifugation.
