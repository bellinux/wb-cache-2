5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a <b>key</b> <b>attribute.</b> Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E

25|$|Boyd is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} goal poacher, whose <b>key</b> <b>attribute</b> is his strike rate. He scored {{an average of two}} goals for every three games when he arrived at Rangers; many of which came from the substitute bench, making his goals-to-games ratio even more impressive. He prefers to play in the penalty box, where he can play-off the shoulder of defenders who are close to their goals. Former Rangers manager Alex McLeish compared him to rival Ally McCoist in goalscoring ability.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} scheme {{is based on}} Waters’s scheme of CP-ABE [2]. Water’s scheme supports any LSSS access structure. We apply the idea of attribute revocation shown in [3] to the {{proposed scheme}}. In the proposed scheme, the <b>attribute</b> <b>key</b> {{is included in the}} ciphertext and secret <b>key</b> to delegate <b>attribute</b> revocation processes to Cloud Server. The <b>attribute</b> <b>key</b> is master key components corresponding to each attribute in the system. When user’s attributes are revoked, the authority re-defines the <b>attribute</b> <b>keys,</b> and generates PRE keys for updating the <b>attribute</b> <b>keys.</b> Cloud Server re-encrypts ciphertext and updates secret <b>key</b> by updating <b>attribute</b> <b>key</b> by using PRE <b>key.</b> Each <b>attribute</b> is associated with version number for updating <b>attribute</b> <b>key.</b>|$|R
25|$|A pony bottle {{is a small}} {{independently}} filled diving cylinder, {{often of}} only a few litres capacity, which forms part of an extended scuba set and which is fitted with its own independent regulator. In an emergency, such as exhaustion of the diver's main air supply, it can be used as an alternate air source in place of a controlled emergency swimming ascent. The <b>key</b> <b>attribute</b> of a pony bottle is that it provides a totally independent and redundant source of breathing gas for the diver. A pony bottle is a specific configuration of bailout cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Theorems in {{mathematics}} and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its <b>key</b> <b>attribute</b> {{is that it is}} falsifiable, that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by experiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{complicated}} task for admissions staff at selective colleges to analyze and process thousands of applications with a [...] "huge mail deluge" [...] since there are often six pieces of mail for each applicant, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the application itself. College admissions personnel spend less time on average reading each particular application; in 2009, the average admissions officer was responsible for analyzing 514 applications, and the trend was {{in the direction of}} officers having to read more and more applications. A typical college application receives only about 25 minutes of reading time, including three to five minutes for the personal essay if it is read. Advisors suggest that understanding some of the criteria can help an applicant apply to colleges with greater success. Some colleges extract information from the federal FAFSA financial aid form, including names of other schools the applicant is applying to. Counselors urge students and parents to understand what types of things colleges tend to look for in applications, and plan accordingly. A <b>key</b> <b>attribute</b> admissions evaluators look for, according to Mamlet and Vandevelde, is authenticity—a real person who comes through the application, not a packaged artificial entity or distortion crafted to impress an admissions officer. An admissions officer at Vanderbilt University wrote about how their office evaluates applicants: [...] "It's really about, 'What did I take advantage of in the environment I was given.'" [...] Several reports suggested that colleges were not looking for the [...] "well-rounded kid" [...] but rather a [...] "well-rounded class": ...|$|E

40|$|Mining {{activities}} in Jeneberang River carry out to fulfil construction materials demand of Gowa Regency and Makassar City. In the recent years mining activities are under strong pressure {{to comply with}} good environmental practice. The issue of sustainable development is becoming increasingly important for the mineral extraction. Analysis of four dimensions (social, economic, environmental, and institutional) indicates that currently, management sustainability of mining categorized as quite sustainable with index value 54. 28 %. Therefore, objective {{of this study is}} to formulate strategy of the sustainable management based on scenarios considering <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> to increase the index value. The sustainability index and <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> were conducted by Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analysis. Meanwhile, to define future states of the scenarios were analysed by prospective analysis. Result of leverage analysis in Multidimensional Scaling indicates that 18 out of 43 attributes are categorized as sensitivity attributes of the sustainability. Based on prospective analysis, the selected scenario for developing the management sustainability is moderate scenario. There are seven <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> affecting the sustainability. The scenario will take place if the <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> develop positively in order to increase from 54. 28 % to 60. 48 %...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} demands for new infrastructure and an aim to reduce initial public investment, Australian government agencies are increasingly using public-private partnerships (PPPs) {{as a form}} of delivery for infrastructure projects. Environmentally, there is growing pressure for the building industry in general to become more sustainable. Moreover, as the built environment continues to grow each year, the performance of buildings as a whole will need to continually improve purely for national energy consumption to remain stable. Based on a systematic and extensive review on relevant literature, this paper has identified the <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> that will influence the environmental sustainability of infrastructure completed through a PPP. The <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> are grouped into five groups defined by whom or what has the majority of control over the <b>attribute.</b> Meanwhile, the <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> are explored and their influence on environmental sustainability justified. This paper was able to not only identify significant factors involved in creating environmental sustainability in infrastructure PPPs, but also trends of the <b>key</b> <b>attributes.</b> It has been found that (1) the longevity of the contract in a PPP project allows greater innovation into environmental sustainability than traditional methods of procurement, (2) innovation is a requirement for the improving upon environmental performance in the built environment, (3) improvements to environmental sustainability relies upon a positive relationship between economic and environmental benefits, and (4) the <b>key</b> <b>attributes</b> for PPP projects are decided upon relatively early in the contract. Due to space limit, detailed discussion on each of the identified attributes is not provided in this paper. Nonetheless, further research direction is discussed...|$|R
