40|$|Data hiding is a {{technique}} {{that is used to}} embed secret information into a cover media. It has been widely used in protecting copyright and transmitting sensitive data over an insecure channel. Conventional data hiding schemes only focus on how to reduce the distortion when sensitive data is embedded into the cover image. However, the transmitted images may be compressed or occur transmitting errors. If such errors occur, the receiver cannot extract the correct information from the stego-image. In this paper, we proposed a novel hiding data scheme with <b>distortion</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The proposed scheme not only can prevent the quality of the processed image from being seriously degraded, but also can simultaneously achieve <b>distortion</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Experimental results show that the proposed scheme indeed can obtain a good image quality and is superior to the other schemes in terms of its <b>distortion</b> <b>tolerance.</b> (c) 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract:- With {{the rapid}} growth of Internet technology, data {{security}} protection has become an important issue. As a tool for improving the effectiveness of land cultivation, land consolidation {{plays an important role in}} enlarging farming plots and enhancing crop productivity. To fulfill land consolidation, more and more remote sensing images are widely used. This paper presents a LSB watermarking algorithm to protect the images data security. In the proposed scheme, the land reorganization planning map is embedded into a remote sensing image of the same area for information security and copyright protection. Before being embedded, the land reorganization planning map is compressively encoded. The contradiction between large information quantity and invisibility of digital water marking is perfectly eliminated. To avoid the shortcoming of being easily attacked in the original LSB method, the host image is preprocessed by exclusive-OR (XOR) operation. That is, the value of the least significant bit is decided by the XOR result of the first several bits. The watermark signal is embedded into the LSB of the processed host image by XOR operation. Moreover, by applying an optimal adjustment process, the watermarked image has the ability of <b>distortion</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The experimental results fully illustrate that the embedded watermark is not only imperceptible to the human eyes, but also has better security in the statistical sense. Moreover, the proposed scheme is superior in terms of its <b>distortion</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Key-Words:- land consolidation, watermarking, least significant bit (LSB), exclusive-OR (XOR) operation, remote sensing image, data protection, land reorganization planning map...|$|E

The suitability of the process for high volume production has the possibility to give a strong advantage compared to several other welding methods. However, {{it is important to have}} the process in full control since various quality issues may otherwise occur. During laser welding of boron steels quality issues such as imperfections, changes in local and global geometry as well as strength reduction can occur. The aspects that need to be considered are strongly depending on alloy content, process parameters etc. These problems that can occur could be fatal for the construction and the lowest level of occurrence is wanted, independent of industry. The focus of this study has been to investigate the properties of laser welded boron steel. The study includes laser welding of boron alloyed steels with strengths of 1500 MPa and a recently introduced 1900 MPa grade. Focus has been to investigate weldability and the occurrence of cracks, porosity and strength reducing microstructure that can occur during laser welding, as well as <b>distortion</b> studies for <b>tolerances</b> in geometry. The results show that both conventional and 1900 MPa boron alloyed steel are suitable for laser welding. Due to the martensitic structure of welds the material tends to behave brittle. Cracking and porosity do not seem to be an issue limiting the use of these steels. For tolerances in geometry for larger structures tests has been done simulating laser welding of A-pillars and B-pillars. Measurements have been done with Vernier caliper as well as a more advanced optical method capturing the movements during the welding sequence. Results from the tests done on Ushaped beams indicates that depending on the geometry of the structure and heat input distortions can be controlled to give distortions from 1 to 8 mm, at a welding length of 700 mm.

The PrInO 3 adopts a highly distorted variant of the perovskite structure with the orthorhombic Pnma space group in the whole temperature range investigated. The bond length and bond-angle analysis revealed a very slow tendency to decrease structural distortion with increasing temperature. Comparison of different parameters quantifying perovskite structure distortion calculated for PrInO 3 and the similar PrAlO 3 and PrGaO 3 shows the advantage of using the tolerance factor t 12 calculated for the 12 -fold coordinated Pr by geometrical averaging of the individual interatomic distances. An additional advantage of the tolerance factor method results from the possibility of extending it to predict the average structural distortion and the geometrical stability of the perovskites at various temperatures once the accurate dependence of t(x,T,d) on the composition, temperature and oxygen content is found. By comparing PrInO 3 with several AMO 3 perovskites containing ions in the fixed oxidation state on the A and M crystal sites {{it was found that}} structural <b>distortion</b> and the <b>tolerance</b> factor t 12 for PrInO 3 are consistent with the empirical thermal expansion coefficient based on the bond strength calculation [R. M. Hazen, and C. T. Prewitt, Am. Mineral., 1977, 62 (3 – 4), 309]. In contrast to perovskites AMO 3 -d containing mixed-valent M ions, which allow {{for a wide range of}} changes of the tolerance factor t 12 (T,d) as a function of oxygen content, perovskites AMO 3 with M ions in the fixed oxidation state show much less flexibility. This flexibility is further reduced for the A 3 +M 3 +O 3 perovskites like PrInO 3 for which even a large change of the synthesis temperature has a minor effect on controlling the resulting t 12 (T) and the structural phase in comparison with A 2 +M 4 +O 3 perovskites.

40|$|Cobalt-containing perovskite-type oxides {{have been}} the subject of intense {{research}} mainly due to the possibility of optimizing their structural and physical properties by doping. The range of possible application for these oxides is wide, extending from components in solid oxides fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen separation membranes and electrochemical reactors, to sensor devices based on their ability to catalytically oxidize CO and CH 4 and reduce NO. In addition, perovskite cobaltites have received further attention after the observation of elevated Seebeck coefficients in related layered systems which suggest their possible application as thermoelectric materials (TE). Recent reports showed that doped perovskite cobaltites have relatively high figures of merit (Z) and this directly correlates to the different spin states available for the cobalt ions. As a consequence, the TE materials research is the latest field where cobaltites appeared as promising and new compounds. Their magnetic and magnetoresistive properties are also of recent interest. In particular, a debate has been opened regarding the actual spin-state of Co in lanthanum cobaltites. In fact, it has been shown that in the range from 5 to 1000 K the Co ions pass through three different spin-states (low-spin LS, intermediate-spin IS, and high-spin HS) which are intimately connected to the structural as well as internal parameters such as the metal-oxygen bond lengths. The spin state, in turn, affects the physical properties such as transport, magnetic and optical properties acting as a sort of “Jahn-Teller switch”, where for certain spin configurations the J-T distortion, for the same Co valence state, is suppressed. The internal parameters, such as bond lengths and angles, play a major role in defining the cobaltites physical properties. Much of the work on RECoO 3 compounds focussed on bulk or single crystalline materials and less on thin films preparation and characterization which, however, is the useful “physical form” for sensing and catalytic as well as TE micro-devices applications. Moreover, it would be desirable to make available nanocrystalline thin films where the high surface-to-volume ration can enhance the cobaltites physical properties. We report the synthesis and structural and morphological investigation of oriented epitaxial thin films of Nd 1 -xSrxCoO 3 with x = 0, 0. 2 and 0. 5 on single crystalline substrates (SrTiO 3 and LaAlO 3) by means of rf-sputtering.

According to this, the block holding the most relevant fitness value is the place where embedding of the secret data (secret image) is done. Thus, a stego-image is retrieved at the other end, which is not only good in quality but is also able to sustain certain noise and compression attacks during the transmission. The objective function is defined in such a manner that both quality and robustness of the stego image are acceptable, for which the performance analysis parameter values of the stego-image are also determined. The results, when compared with some other data hiding technique show better stego image quality along with <b>distortion</b> <b>tolerance...</b>|$|E

These display components present a cascaded energy attenuator to the battery of handheld device {{which is responsible for}} about half of energy drain at maximum display intensity. As such, the display components become the main focus of every effort for maximization of embedded system’s battery life-time. This paper proposes an approach for pixel transformation of the displayed image to increase the potential energy saving of the backlight scaling method. The proposed approach takes advantage of human visual system (HVS) characteristics and tries to minimize distortion between the perceived brightness values of the individual pixels in the original image and those of the backlight-scaled image. This is in contrast to previous backlight scaling approaches which simply match the luminance values of the individual pixels in the original and backlight-scaled images. Furthermore, this paper proposes a temporally-aware backlight scaling technique for video streams. The goal is to maximize energy saving in the display system by means of dynamic backlight dimming subject to a video <b>distortion</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The video distortion comprises of (1) an intra-frame (spatial) distortion component due to frame-sensitive backlight scaling and transmittance function tuning and (2) an interframe (temporal) distortion component due to large-step backlight dimming across frames modulated b...|$|E
