Data collection was performed using an instrument developed based on the clinical indicators of these diagnoses, both from NANDA International. Diagnostician nurses were selected to perform diagnostic inference. Irritability, restlessness, bradycardia, pallor, jaundice, tachycardia, slow capillary refill and peripheral vasoconstriction were specific clinical indicators for hypothermia and body temperature below the normal range was the only sensitive indicator. Tachypnea, vasodilation and apnea were specific to hyperthermia however sensitive indicators were not found.

This study aimed to determine the frequency, clinical forms, aetiology and outcome of seizures in relation to rectal temperature <b>in</b> <b>newborn.</b> Patients and Methods: The study was located in paediatric department of our University Hospital. This prospective research had assessed consecutive admitted newborns aged 0 - 28 days with incident seizure during a period from January to December, 2013. Newborns with epilepsy and non-incident admission seizure were excluded. Results: Seizures were observed in 344 / 4836 (7. 1 %). The sample included 192 males and 152 females. The seizures frequency <b>in</b> <b>newborn</b> 0 - 21 days was 95. 9 % and was 52. 6 % in neonates < 1 day. The focal seizures were reported in 68 % follow by generalized tonic-clonic in 24. 4 %. Status epilepticus was observed in 7. 6 %. Seizures had occurred in a context of hypothermia in 77. 9 %, normal temperature, 14. 2 % and <b>hyperthermia</b> <b>in</b> 7. 8 %. The hypothermia and normal temperature seizures were more common <b>in</b> <b>newborn</b> < one week and <b>hyperthermia</b> was noted <b>in</b> older.

40|$|Background: Artificial <b>hyperthermia</b> <b>in</b> {{association}} with radiotherapy or chemotherapy {{has become a}} promising method for cancer treatment. Thus, {{this study was designed}} to assess the impact of repetitive hyperthermia (41 ˚ ± 0. 5 ˚C) on some normal histological, histochemical, and biochemical variables <b>in</b> <b>newborn</b> rats. Materials and methods: After parturition, the neonates were randomly chosen and assigned to two groups (each being comprised of ten animals) : one group was exposed to hyperthermia (41 ˚ ± 0. 5 ˚C) and the other one was exposed to normothermia (25 ˚ ± 0. 5 ˚C). Both groups were treated daily for 2 hours from the day of labor until the age of 21 days. Results: Histological and histochemical examination of the tissue sections of hypothermic rat neonates exhibited numerous cirrhotic changes in liver with deposition of collagen fibers extending from the central veins or portal tracts forming thick or thin fibrotic septa and even pseudolobule formations. The kidneys showed areas of necrosis, edema, glomerular hyperplasia or infiltration o...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the monoaminc oiidase activities in the hypothalamus and striafum between malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (Pietrain) and malignant hyperthermia-resistant (Landrace/Large White) pigs showed {{no significant difference between}} the two breeds. The concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine and their non-O-methylated metabolites did not reflect the low activities of monoamine oiidase type A differentially. The malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs had significantly greater concentrations of 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl grycol in the stnarum, and of 3, 4 -dihydroxymandelic acid in the hypothalamus. Consequently, in the brain, low monoamine oxidase type A activity does not appear to be involved in susceptibility to malignant <b>hyperthermia.</b> <b>In</b> addition, monoamine oxidase activities in the heart, liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa and catechol-O-methyl transf erase activities in the kidney were the same in the susceptible and resistant pigs. f Susceptibility to malignant <b>hyperthermia</b> <b>in</b> pigs is defined by the onset of malignant <b>hyperthermia</b> <b>in</b> response to the administration of halothane or sux-amethonium (Hall et al., 1966; Harrison et al. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect was}} studied of chronic alcohol intake in the rat during {{pregnancy}} and lactation on the brown adipose tissue (BAT) in pups.

In the BAT of pups sympathetic activity, as demonstrated by noradrenaline, was also increased by long-term exposure to alcohol.

Chagas infection was determined serologically in mothers and parasitologically <b>in</b> <b>newborns.</b> Consequences of congenital Chagas disease were assessed clinically. RESULTS The prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women was 42. 2 %. Congenital transmission was estimated at 6 % of infected mothers leading to an incidence rate of 2. 6 % among newborns. Main risk factors of congenital transmission were mothers' seropositivity and maternal Trypanosoma cruzi parasitaemia. Parity was higher in infected than in non-infected mothers, but it was not associated with the risk of congenital transmission. The rate of congenital infection was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>newborns</b> from multiple pregnancies than in singletons. However, we did not observe statistically significant consequences of Chagas disease <b>in</b> <b>newborns</b> from single pregnancies or among twins. CONCLUSION The main risk factors for congenital transmission were infection and parasitaemia of mothers. Consequences of the disease seemed mild <b>in</b> <b>newborns</b> from single pregnancies and perhaps more important in multiple births...|$|R
