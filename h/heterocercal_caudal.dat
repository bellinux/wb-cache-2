50|$|Named {{for their}} {{exceptionally}} long, thresher-like <b>heterocercal</b> tail or <b>caudal</b> fins (which {{can be as}} long as the total body length), thresher sharks are active predators; the tail is used as a weapon to stun prey. The thresher shark has a short head and a cone-shaped nose. The mouth is generally small, and the teeth range in size from small to large. By far the largest of the three species is the common thresher, Alopias vulpinus, which may reach a length of 6.1 m and a weight of over 500 kg. The bigeye thresher, Alopias superciliosus, is next in size, reaching a length of 4.9 m (16 ft); at just 3 m (10 ft), the pelagic thresher, Alopias pelagicus, is the smallest.|$|R
50|$|The American {{paddlefish}} (Polyodon spathula) is {{a species}} of basal ray-finned fish closely related to sturgeons in the order Acipenseriformes. Fossil records of paddlefish date back over 300million years, nearly 50million years before dinosaurs first appeared. American paddlefish are smooth-skinned freshwater fish commonly called paddlefish, but are {{also referred to as}} Mississippi paddlefish, spoon-billed cats, or spoonbills.

40|$|During primary axis {{development}} in vertebrates, Hox genes are deployed in a collinear fashion, where {{the order in}} which they are present on the chromosome is {{the order in which}} they are expressed in the organism. During development of secondary axes, the same order will end up determining emerging pectoral fins and homologous limbs, but as these appendages differentiate, an alternate regulatory sequence unfolds. There is an inversion in the expression pattern of the posterior HoxD genes, where the most posterior gene shifts from the most restricted to the least restricted expression domain relative to neighboring genes, with anterior expansion. This pattern is referred to as inverse collinearity (IC) and has been established for pectoral fin, yet relatively little is known about expression patterns in other proximodistal axes such as median fins and pelvic fins of ray-finned fishes. Looking beyond early stages of fin development, we detected the Hox limb program deviating from previously documented collinear patterns in regions of differentiation and subdivision of median fins in the American paddlefish, Polyodon spathula. For the first time, these data provide evidence of anterior exclusive domains characteristic of IC expression found in median fins. These data also describe a variant of IC expression where largely non-overlapping domains occur in pelvic fin, suggesting the ancestor of bony fishes may have employed IC expression differently in pectoral and pelvic appendages. From these patterns, these results reveal that the Hox gene repertoire is expressed {{in a variety of ways}} beyond general collinear modules in median fins, and that the limb program can be employed in unique structures such as the metamorphosis of a <b>heterocercal</b> <b>caudal</b> fin...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of the heterocercal tail in sharks has long been debated in the literature. Previous kinematic data have supported the classical theory which proposes that the beating of the <b>heterocercal</b> <b>caudal</b> fin during steady horizontal locomotion pushes posteroventrally on the water, generating a reactive force directed anterodorsally and causing rotation around the center of mass. An alternative model suggests that the heterocercal shark tail functions to direct reaction forces {{through the center of}} mass. In this paper, we quantify the {{function of}} the tail in two species of shark and compare shark tail function with previous hydrodynamic data on the heterocercal tail of sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus. To address the two models of shark heterocercal tail function, we applied the technique of digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to quantify the wake of two species of shark swimming in a flow tank. Both steady horizontal locomotion and vertical maneuvering were analyzed. We used DPIV with both horizontal and vertical light sheet orientations to quantify patterns of wake velocity and vorticity behind the heterocercal tail of leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) and bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium punctatum) swimming at 1. 0 Ls– 1, where L is total body length. Two synchronized high-speed video cameras allowed simultaneous measurement of shark body position and wake structure. We measured the orientation of tail vortices shed into the wake and the orientation of the central jet through the core of these vortices relative to body orientation. Analysis of flow geometry indicates that the tail of both leopard and bamboo shark generates strongly tilted vortex rings with a mean jet angle of approximately 30 ° below horizontal during steady horizontal swimming. The corresponding angle of the reaction force is much greater than body angle (mean 11 °) and the angle of the path of motion of the center of mass (mean approximately 0 °), thus strongly supporting the classical model of heterocercal tail function for steady horizontal locomotion. Vortex jet angle varies significantly with body angle changes during vertical maneuvering, but sharks show no evidence of active reorientation of jet angle relative to body angle, as was seen in a previous study on the function of sturgeon tail. Vortex jet orientation is significantly more inclined than the relatively horizontal jet generated by sturgeon tail vortex rings, demonstrating substantial differences in function in the heterocercal tails of sharks and sturgeon. We present a summary of forces on a swimming shark integrating data obtained here on the tail with previous data on pectoral fin and body function. Body orientation plays a critical role in the overall force balance and compensates for torques generated by the tail. The pectoral fins do not generate lift during steady horizontal locomotion, but play an important hydrodynamic role during vertical maneuvering...|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} of the present {{investigations}} was to work out on the problems {{in relation to the}} culture and the propagation of the carp. From this point of view a detailed study of the spawning behaviour, embryology, larval growth, digestive system, and other organs of the carp reared in the experimental pond of Fisheries Laboratory, Kyushu University, was {{made on the basis of}} microscopic preparations. The following distinctive remarks would be noteworthy. 1. The carp spawns on vegetations or like substances at an optimum water temperature of 22 - 24 ℃ for nearly 6 hours at any time of the day, but usually at dawn from April to July at short and irregular intervals. During the spawning act the male nudges the female from behind and approximates the genital part, lying almost parallel to her side. Both lash the caudal region forcibly, discharging simultaneously the ova and milt, and then separate after swimming together for about 30 - 50 cm. The total number of eggs in a spawning female, 590 mm in total length and 4. 9 kg in weight, is nearly 765, 000, which is a considerably a high number for the production of fry. 2. In the embryonic and the larval stages, the blood vessels form a network on the yolk sac and fin folds, and are representations of well developed respiratory devices as an adaptation to less favourable conditions. Large secretory cells are marked around the head and the yolk sac of the embryo and the larvae, and last till the yolk absorption. These seem to aid the larvae in sticking to the substratum, which is a natural device of safety against driftng by the current of stagnant water. The first sign of the rudiment of the gut is marked as an endodermal thickening by about 40 hours after fertlization, which assumes a cylindrical form of double layered cells by 70 hours (18 hours before hatching). By 78 hours after hatching a lumen is formed by the retreat of cells rather than the evagination as in other vertebrates (Fig. 5 P, R, S, T). The mouth is formed at about 8 - 10 hours before hatching (Fig. 5 U, V). The liver is formed on the latero-ventral sides of the gut (Fig. 5 T). Pharyngeal folds are marked at 41 - 45 hours after fertilization as two dorso-lateral endodermal outgrowths which proceed to meet an inwardly pushed layer of ectoderm to form gill slits by 56 - 57 hours after fertilzation (Fig. 5 Q). Pectoral fins begin their formation at about 55 hours after fertilization and the median fin fold is prominently visible by 70 hours. 3. The period of incubation varies with the temperature (Table 2) and at 13 - 17 ℃ the larvae hatch in 90 hours after incubation and measure 3. 9 - 5. 6 mm. Hatching is completed wthin 2. 5 - 3. 5 days. The yolk sac is completely absorbed in 8 mm. All the fins are marked in 10 mm. The posterior end of the notochord is begining to turn upward in 7. 5 - 7. 7 mm larvae. The <b>heterocercal</b> <b>caudal</b> fin starts its formation at 7. 5 - 7. 7 mm. Hypurals number 7 (Fig. 10). Scales first appear behind the opercle at 17 - 18 mm, and cover the entire body surface of the carp by 24 - 30 mm. Young carp of this length resembles the adult in appearance (Figs. 6, 13). Liver cells start arranging themselves into lobular forms in 4. 2 mm larva within 10 hours after hatching. The pancreas is differentiated along the left dorsal side of the intestine as a deeply stained mass of cells among the liver cells by 5. 3 mm larva. The gall bladder is marked at this stage (Fig. 7 F, H). The hepato-pancreas assumes the young form by 9. 6 - 10. 5 mm. The anlage of the air bladder is marked a few hours before hatching (Fig. 5 W) and becomes to be filled with air by 6 mm (Fig. 7 C) and pushes the first part of intestine. The anterior one is formed in about 10 mm larva. The newly hatched larva begins its active life after the absorption of yolk (i. e., 7 - 8 mm larva). Active preying habit on the zooplankton is quite prominent by this stage. Schooling behaviour, though, beginning at 9. 5 mm, at this stage or even after is not so significant. They start feeding 24 - 36 hours after hatching. The juvenile and the young prefer to eat at short intervals, which seems to be advantageous for the absence of stomach. The power of discriminating eatable substances appears to be intense. Weberian ossicles are marked by 10. 6 mm joining the ear bones anteriorly and the air bladder posteriorly. The longitudinal grooves and fenestrations are formed by 17 - 18 mm (Fig. 11). 4. The club cells appear at about 12 mm larva on the head skin between the upper lip and the nasal cavity and occasionally multinucleate giant cells are marked more along the dorsal side of the head than the ventral one (Fig. 16 E). By 6 mm the dorsal skin of the head shows wrinkles which are the cytoplasmic extensions of the cells. They seem to disappear at 12 - 13 mm, which is the time of the appearance of club cells at that position. Taste buds first appear on the head skin (between the upper lip and the nasal cavity) at 18 mm. Occasionally, promucous cells like those of the buccal epithelium are observed from the head skin epithelium. A girdle of elongated cells intercepted by collagenous fibres hanging down into the dermis from the basement membrane is observed: this has not been reportd before (Fig. 16 F, G). Mandibular barbels first appear at 18. 5 mm in total length and measure about 217 μ, while the maxlilary ones are noticed at 22 mm which is the stage of the appearance of the taste buds on the barbels. Mucous cells and club cells are evidenced abundantly in the proximal or post-proximal regions of the barbels. The epidermis enveloping the anterior side of the nasal flaps is thicker than that of the posterior one. Taste buds are marked from the distal anterior end. Club cells are absent from the middle and the distal region of the flaps (Fig. 19 A-D). The outer epidermis of the operculum appears to be thicker than the inner one and a few taste buds are noted from the outer side only. Conjunctiva of the eye and the caudal fin also possess taste organs in their epidermis (Fig. 20 AF). Their presence on all these organs are suggestive of their wide adaptability to environments. 5. Lips of the young and the adult are provided with low ridges and shallow furrows (Fig. 22) which appear to be helpful during the feeding activity from the bottom. Horny type of dentitions resting upon the membranous structure are marked on the inner posterior side of the lips of the larvae, juveniles and the young ones; these may help in holding the food materials (Fig. 27 C, D). The maxillary valve is marked with the opening of the mouth in the embryonic stage. It is a small, almost cresentic membranous structure hanging freely into the buccal cavity behind the upper lip. In 6. 9 - 6. 8 mm larvae the mucosa of the buccal cavity (roof) is marked to enter as a thin Iayer into the proximal of the maxillary valve. Mucous cells are greater and larger on the ventral sides of the valve than the dorsal one. One to 3 typical taste buds born on papillae are recorded only from the ventral surface of the valve, which come in direct touch with food substances (Fig. 27 C, E-G). A few prominent papillary folds marked in the mouth cavity as early as 9 - 10 mm become regularly to be arranged by 15 mm in total length and 3 - 4 longitudinal folds are marked from the centre of the buccal cavity (roof). The roof is concave and the floor is slightly convex so as to fit nicely during the food taking. Papillae on the pharyngeal roof are more abundant than those of the buccal one and they decrease posteriorly; on the Aoor, they reach tiI 1 the fourth gill arch (Fig. 23 A-F). Mucous cells are almost uniformly distributed in the buccal cavity. Promucous cells and club cells are occasionally marked (Fig. 27 M). Three types of taste buds are recognized from the epithelium of the cavity: buds with truncated, protruding, and depressed apices. Besides lymphocytes, vacuoles or oval cells are occasionally found towards the middle or distal ends of the buds (Fig. 29 E-J). Five developmental stages of the mouth are marked (Fig. 21) in this study which are related to the change of feeding habits. Pharyngeal teeth are apparent in 6. 8 mm in total length. In the larvae and the juveniles they are arranged asymmetrically in 3 - 4 rows totalling 7 - 8 on each arch. They are curved, serrated, and backwardly directed, which befits the carnivorous feeding habits. They hold the prey tightly and transfer them to the oesophageal cavity. The flatness on the crowns of teeth on the first and second row become apparent by 28 mm (Fig. 24 F), and furrows are established by 45 - 50 mm in total length. This change of teeth formation is in correlation to the change of food habits from early carnivorous to the omnivorous one. The relative length and the width of the pharyngel arch appears to be greater (i. e., 3 - 4. 26) till about 30 mm in total length after which it nearly becomes on an average of 2. 87 (2. 2 - 3. 46) by 45 - 50 mm. The higher value is a characteristic of the carnivores and the lower one of the herbivores (Fig. 25). The horny pad is biconvex and almost four cornered (Fig. 26 C). In the larval stage it is a soft structure but considerable hardness is felt by 28 mm, this becoming quite apparent by 45 - 50 mm in total length. This appears to be in relation to the development of furrows or grooves on the crowns of the pharyngeal teeth. Hardness of the pad is correlated with more herbivorous habits than carnivorous ones. Well developed taste buds are recognized on the palatal organs and in the tissues of the pharyngeal teeth but the finding of the same in the middle layer of the horny pad seems to be of special significance in the gustatory sensitiveness during the act of feeding (Fig. 26 B, E). Mucous cells are absent from the lips. These cells and the taste buds appear to be related to each other in their distribution in the pharyngeal and oesophageal cavities. The former increases posteriorly and the latter vice versa. The anterior part of the oesophagus is provided with more mucous cells and taste buds than the posterior one where mixed type of epithelium (oesophago-intestinal epithelium) is present. Taste buds in the oesophagus are marked in about 6. 8 mm larva much later than the buccal cavity where immature buds are recognized at about IO- 12 hours after hatching (Fig. 29 A). The function of the lip is essentially gustatory. hence, the taste organs. Once the food enters the buccal cavity its further passing posteriorly depends upon the slippery epithelium with simultanous food selection: hence both the mucous cells and taste buds. The same is true for pharynx and the oesophagus, too. The presence of gustatory organ in the oesophagus is an indication of the extreme delicacy of taste in accepting eatable substances by the carp. The oesophageal mucosa are stratified like the pharynx and are thrown into longitudinal folds 6 - 8 in number at 6. 8 mm in total length In 200 - 300 mm carp about 24 - 27 folds are developed (Table 11). An oval thickening of unidentified character is marked at the oesophagointestinal junction but the exact function seems to be obscure. 6. Primary gill lamellae are observed as 2 - 3 bud-like protuberances 15 - 16 hours after hatching on the first gill arch and the secondary gill lamellae are formed in 6. 0 - 6. 6 mm in total length (Fig. 30). The outer gill lamellae are larger in size than the inner ones which aid in covering the gill openings (Fig. 31 L). The gill rakers are formed in 15 - 16 mm in total length (Figs. 30 H, 31 E). The papillated gill rakers on the adjacent gill arches interdigitate with each other so closely over the narrow gill clefts as to form an accurate straining mechanism, which appears to be important for bottom feeding. The central cores of the joining ends of the epi- and cerato-branchials are cartilaginous, which help in the easy movement of the arches during respiration. Histologically, the arches, the rakers and the lamellae alike in their epithelial structures but differ in thickness. Typical taste buds like those of the arches and the rakers are noticed on the margins of the primary gill lamellae. A large number of rounded, oval, or elongated mucous cells are abundantly present on the gills, the secretion of which helps in entangling the food particles from surrounding water. The intestinal folds are the continuations of the oesophageal ones; they number about 8 - 13, and measure 25 - 42,U in height in 6. 8 mm larva. Network of the folds are formed in 20 - 24 mm larvae. Zigzag folds are also marked in 31 - 35 mm young carp. A double network of the folds are present in the large specimens and is higher and more complex in the first part of the intestine than the rest. Anal folds are always longitudinal like the oesophageal ones (Fig. 33). 7. The structure of the carp intestine is similar to that of other cyprinids. The development of the intestinal coiling is divided into seven stages in this study (Table 13). The initial step in the coiling is first marked at about lo- 12 mm and is completed by 28 - 30 mm. The complication of the coiling seems to depend upon the length of the intestine. Long intestine is a characteristic of the herbivores and is marked by 29 mm in total length in the carp. The intestine may be histologically divided into three regions. The anterior swollen part consists of a more complicated network of folds than the middle one which is almost uniform in diameter. The height of the columnar cells in the anterior part is greater than the middle one. The anal part consists of longitudinal folds covered by stratified epithelium containing mucous cells like those of the pharynx (Fig. 37 H, I<, L). True stomach is absent but the anterior swollen part may be regarded as a receptacle for storing the food. In the epithelium 4 or 5 types of cells are identified : mucous cells, wandering cells or lymphocytes, granular cells, pear-shaped cells, and certain unidentified large secretory cells. Mucous cells form stratification like those of the pharynx in the rectal region, while they are few in other parts of the intestine. 8. Inflection points of regression lines in the relative growth of snout length, head length, eye diameter, opercular opening, body depth, caudal peduncle height, snout-insertion of the dorsal fin length, pcctoral fin length, intestine length, and pharyngeal arch length at 20 - 24 mm in standard length (Figs. 38, 39) are marked. The gill arch length, the large primary gill length, and the number or gill filaments on the first left gill arch show an inflection point on the growth curve at 9. 5 - 10. 5 mm which correlate with the differentiation and growth of tissues and organs i. e., hepato-pancreas, spleen, taste buds in the buccal cavity, pharynx, and the gill arch. The growth line of the intestine is represented by two inflection points which correspond with the coiling of the alimentary canal, the change of food habits and the developmental stages of the larva, post-larva and juvenile, young, and adult. The epidermal thickness of the head skin (between the upper lip and the nasal cavity) shows two inflection points at 11 and 36 mm in total length, which appear to be related to the disappearance of the cytoplasmic extentions of the superficial cells and the appearance of the club cells in the epidermis in 12 mm in total length. The height of taste buds from the roof of the buccal cavity and pharynx to gill arch shows inflection ponits at 8. 6 - 10. 6 mm in total length and the same of the latter one is higher than the former ones. The coefficient of the weight-length is calculated to be 3. 049 (Fig. 38). The growth of the organs or tissues may conclusively be represented by two inflection points (Figs. 38. 40) which are found to correlate with the transition period of food, developmental stages (larva, juvenile, young and adult) and other histological and morphological changes discussed...|$|E
