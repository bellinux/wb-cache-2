He grew up {{listening}} to the music of the Beatles – for most of his teenage years the only album he owned was Sgt.

After finishing school and moving to Melbourne, Australia, for his university education, he had a group of friends who played the guitar and wrote their own music.

Zinni had been floated as a possible Vice Presidential running mate of Barack Obama, the 2008 Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.|$|E

This inspired him into a burst of creativity, including several novels and screenplays. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>his</b> novel writing moved in a more commercial direction {{following the death of}} his editor Hiram Haydn in late 1973. This included a children's book, Wigger (1974); a thriller, Marathon Man (1974), which became a best seller; Magic (1976), a thriller; screenplays for the films of Marathon Man (1976) and Magic (1978); screenplays for The Stepford Wives (1975), The Great Waldo Pepper (1975), All the President's Men (1976) and A Bridge Too Far (1977). Some of this work was extremely lucrative – he was paid $1million for the screen rights and screenplay fees for Magic and $500,000 to do Marathon Man.

500|$|Spiegelman {{suffers from}} a lazy eye, and thus lacks depth perception. [...] <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>his</b> art style is [...] "really a result of [...] deficiencies". [...] His is a style of labored simplicity, with dense visual motifs which often go unnoticed upon first viewing. [...] He sees comics as [...] "very {{condensed}} thought structures", more akin to poetry than prose, which need careful, time-consuming planning that their seeming simplicity belies.Spiegelman's work prominently displays his concern with form, and pushing the boundaries of {{what is and is}} not comics. [...] Early in the underground comix era, Spiegelman proclaimed to Robert Crumb, [...] "Time is an illusion that can be shattered in comics! [...] Showing the same scene from different angles freezes it in time by turning the page into a diagram—an orthographic projection!" [...] His comics experiment with time, space, recursion, and representation. [...] He uses the word [...] "decode" [...] to express the action of reading comics and sees comics as functioning best when expressed as diagrams, icons, or symbols.|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} and DVD set titled , author Laurence Rees {{indicates}} that although Gröning had requested to leave Auschwitz after he witnessed the killing, his objection was only {{on the basis of}} its practical implementation, and not on the general militaristic principle of the mass extermination of enemies. Gröning said that he thought at the time that it was justified due to all the Nazi propaganda he had been subjected to, in that Germany's enemies were being destroyed, which to him made the tools of their destruction (such as gas chambers) of no particular significance. Because of this, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>his</b> feelings about seeing people and knowing that they had hours to live before being gassed were [...] "very ambiguous". He explains that children were murdered because, while the children themselves were not the enemy, the danger was the blood within them, in that they could grow up to become dangerous Jews. Rees points to Gröning's ultra-nationalist upbringing as indication of how he was able to justify the extermination of helpless children. Gröning says that the horrors in the gas chambers did eventually dawn on him when he heard the screams.|$|E
500|$|Noah binds and gags Vicky {{with duct}} tape and uses an audio {{recording}} of her voice to lure Claire to her house. When Claire arrives, she discovers Vicky's dead body, with her throat having been slashed by Noah. A horrified Claire contacts the police, but runs into Noah again. She accuses him of killing his parents, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>his</b> mother wasn't {{the woman in the}} crash. [...] His mother killed herself after his father cheated on her, so he caused the accident which killed his father and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, threatening to kill them unless Claire stays with him. A violent altercation occurs as Claire attempts to free them. Noah pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. Garrett, having freed himself, attempts to choke Noah with a rope, prompting Noah to shoot him in the chest. Claire stabs Noah's eye with Kevin's EpiPen. When Noah removes the EpiPen from his eye and blindly attempts to strangle Claire to death, she then jams her thumb into the same damaged eye to blind him further, much to Noah's agony and he strikes her across the face. When he later holds Kevin at gunpoint, she pulls a switch that drops an engine on Noah, killing him. Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett exit the burning barn house as the police arrive. Garrett is put in an ambulance. A paramedic says that Garrett will be fine. Claire and Kevin ride in the ambulance with him and Claire tells Garrett that he's gonna be okay and promises him after he arrives at the hospital, [...] "we're going home.", hinting at a family reconciliation between Claire, Garrett and Kevin. As all three family members remain together in the ambulance, the ambulance then drives off into road to the hospital and the camera pans out to the moon hovering in the night sky.|$|E
