5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E

50|$|Tropic <b>hormones</b> are <b>hormones</b> <b>that</b> {{have other}} {{endocrine}} glands as their target. Most tropic hormones are produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus secretes tropic <b>hormones</b> <b>that</b> target the anterior pituitary, and the thyroid gland secretes thyroxine, which targets the hypothalamus {{and therefore can}} be considered a tropic hormone.|$|R

25|$|The <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> dominates female {{development}} is an estrogen called estradiol. While estradiol promotes {{growth of the}} breasts and uterus, {{it is also the}} principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and epiphyseal maturation and closure. Estradiol levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men.|$|E
25|$|For {{reasons that}} are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she {{is to have a}} {{multiple}} birth naturally. It is theorized that {{this is due to the}} higher level of follicle-stimulating <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Two {{physical}} functions prevent bedwetting. The {{first is}} a <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> reduces urine production at night. The second {{is the ability to}} wake up when the bladder is full. Children usually achieve nighttime dryness by developing one or both of these abilities. There appear to be some hereditary factors in how and when these develop.|$|E

25|$|Both estrogens and androgens are {{necessary}} in all humans for bone health. Young, healthy women produce about 10nbsp&mg of testosterone monthly, and higher bone mineral density in males {{is associated with}} higher serum estrogen. Both estrogen and testosterone help to stimulate bone formation, especially during puberty. Estrogen is the predominant sex <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> slows bone loss, even in men.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is the {{principal}} <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body, especially liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via the IGF-1.

Cabot settled with the state, agreeing not to make such representations, to pay a $65,000 fine, and to donate $75,000 worth of dairy products to local food banks.|$|E
25|$|An {{androgen}} (from Greek andros meaning male human being) is any {{natural or}} synthetic steroid <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> regulates {{the development and}} maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates by binding to androgen receptors. This includes the embryological development of the primary male sex organs, {{and the development of}} male secondary sex characteristics at puberty. Androgens are synthesized in the testes, the ovaries, and the adrenal glands.|$|E
25|$|Under normal {{metabolic}} conditions, {{the human}} body relies on free blood glucose as its primary energy source. The level of blood sugar is tightly regulated; as blood glucose is consumed, the pancreas releases glucagon, a <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted {{before it can be}} replenished, the body enters hypoglycemia, and begins the starvation response.|$|E

25|$|DDAVP (desmopressin) tablets are a {{synthetic}} replacement for antidiuretic hormone, the <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> reduces urine production during sleep. Desmopressin is usually {{used in the}} form of desmopressin acetate, DDAVP. Patients taking DDAVP are 4.5 times more likely to stay dry than those taking a placebo. The drug replaces the hormone for that night with no cumulative effect. US drug regulators have banned using desmopressin nasal sprays for treating bedwetting since the oral form is considered safer.|$|E
25|$|PEPCK-C is enhanced, both {{in terms}} of its {{production}} and activation, by many factors. Transcription of the PEPCK-C gene is stimulated by glucagon, glucocorticoids, retinoic acid, and adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cAMP), while it is inhibited by insulin. Of these factors, insulin, a <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> is deficient in the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus, is considered dominant, as it inhibits the transcription of many of the stimulatory elements. PEPCK activity is also inhibited by hydrazine sulfate, and the inhibition therefore decreases the rate of gluconeogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{stress hormones}} {{activate}} cellular responses, including cell death, to diverse stress situations in plants. Researchers {{have found that}} some plant stress hormones share the ability to adversely affect human cancer cells. For example, sodium salicylate {{has been found to}} suppress proliferation of lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate, breast, and melanoma human cancer cells. Jasmonic acid, a plant stress <b>hormone</b> <b>that</b> belongs to the jasmonate family, induced death in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Methyl jasmonate has been found to induce cell death in a number of cancer cell lines.|$|E
