2500|$|During its life, the Company {{operated}} {{a number of}} types of ferries including paddle steamers, double-ended ferries with a wheelhouse at each end, coal-fired and oil-fired steamers, <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> <b>ferries</b> and hydrofoils. [...] Some of the ferries even featured padded lounges and a wine bar. Among the many ferries were the Baragoola, Dee Why, Balgowlah and South Steyne.|$|R
5000|$|The Portsmouth Queen {{was built}} in 1966. This vessel {{replaced}} the other two original, smaller, Gosport ferries. However three of the original, smaller <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> <b>ferries</b> were kept and used for harbour cruises {{in the summer and}} standby ferry duties in the winter months, when Gosport Queen or Portsmouth Queen was away for refit. The three original ferries the company kept were Vita, Vesta and Ferry Queen, they were fondly known by retired Captain Albert 'Tiddler' Jessey and his Grandchild as 'The Marjorie Daw boats', (after the nursery rhyme), as they rolled in rough weather like the motion of a seesaw. In 1974 Vita, Vesta and Ferry Queen were sold {{with the arrival of the}} 'Southsea Queen'. The Portsmouth Queen has since been sold to Absolute Charters. She left Gosport for the final time on 29/02/16 to start a new life as a Party Cruise Boat on the River Thames in London and will be renamed London Queen.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a ferry {{at the site of}} the current Windermere Ferry for more than 500 years. The {{earliest}} craft were rowed across the lake, whilst later <b>ferries</b> were steam <b>powered</b> and, more recently, <b>diesel</b> <b>powered.</b> Today the <b>ferry</b> is owned and operated by Cumbria County Council.|$|R
50|$|The {{island of}} New York creates an obvious need for water transportation. In the past, {{conventional}} diesel fueled ferries have admitted high pollutions and costs limiting {{the use of}} ferries. It is estimated that sixty five thousand people ride the Staten Island Ferry every day. This number could increase {{with the use of}} a solar electric <b>diesel</b> wind <b>power</b> hybrid <b>ferry.</b> The Solar Sailor Vessels operate as a catamaran equipped with sails. This vessel can be propelled by either wind from the sails, an internal combustion engine, or electric batteries charged with solar arrays. These power sources will work independently which reduces the energy efficiency but increases power and speed.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 CONDEC began {{building}} 3188 <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> M123As, Mack {{began building}} 420 in 1968. In 1969 Mack then upgraded 210 gas engine models to <b>diesel</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R
50|$|Powers Island {{was named}} for James Power (1790 - 1870). In 1835, he {{established}} <b>Power's</b> <b>ferry</b> on the Chattahoochee River, connecting what is now Sandy Springs to Cobb County. <b>Power's</b> <b>Ferry,</b> now spelled <b>Powers</b> <b>Ferry,</b> was used by units of General William Sherman's army in July 1864. The ferry was eventually replaced by a bridge, which was built in 1903.|$|R
50|$|<b>Powers</b> <b>Ferry</b> Landing: The {{business}} district {{just east of}} the river crossing is called <b>Powers</b> <b>Ferry</b> Landing, located where Northside Drive crosses the road, {{just east of the}} former landing. This provides freeway access at Northside Drive (west ramps) and New Northside Drive (east ramps, road and ramps built in a 1990s reconstruction). Signage on the freeway indicates <b>Powers</b> <b>Ferry</b> Road, Northside Drive, and New Northside Drive.|$|R
40|$|The {{project scope}} was {{to install a}} <b>diesel</b> {{generated}} <b>power</b> source to deep well 4 {{in addition to the}} existing commercial <b>power</b> source. The <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> source and its fuel supply system shall be seismically qualified to withstand a Performance Category 4 (PC- 4) seismic event. This <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> source will permit the deep well to operate during a loss of commercial power. System design will incorporate the ability to select and transfer power between the new <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> source and commercial power sources for the the deep well motor and TRA- 672 building loads...|$|R

50|$|There {{was also}} a new 1.6 L diesel engined version of the Fiesta, making full {{advantage}} of the now wider engine compartment. <b>Diesel</b> <b>power</b> units in this market segment were still unusual, and commentators found that the impressive fuel economy of the <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> Fiesta came at the expense of a power unit that was noisy and rough. Even in West Germany, a market traditionally receptive to <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> passenger cars, the petrol/gasoline powered Fiesta was still outselling the diesel version by more than four to one in 1988.|$|R

It shared the 40 HP (29 kW; OM 636 <b>diesel</b> <b>power</b> unit of the <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> 170 V and came with the same official top speed of 105 km/h (65 mph). In 1952 <b>diesel</b> <b>powered</b> passenger cars were {{still very much a}} novelty even in Germany. The relatively lumpy engine note and reduced performance of the diesel car were at variance with the up-market image of the 170 S, but no doubt both cost conscious company directors and upmarket taxi operators appreciated the >25% improvement in fuel consumption using a fuel which, on account of the tax rates applied, was already provided at a relatively “friendly” price in Germany.|$|R
