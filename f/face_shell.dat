Estas verificações e análises se fazem necessárias porque a NBR 8798 (1985) ainda especifica a colocação de argamassa em todas as paredes dos blocos (argamassa plena), embora o que mais se tem observado nas nossas construções é a colocação de argamassa apenas nas paredinhas longitudinais. Além disso, essas verificações se tornam mais necessárias quando se sabe que esse tipo de assentamento é o mais usado nos países mais ricos e desenvolvidos do mundo. Para a determinação do valor dessa redução, bem como para melhor compreender a ruptura das paredes com esses dois tipos de assentamento, foram ensaiados corpos-de-prova de blocos, prismas eparedes de 1, 00 m de altura, na idade de 14 dias, com argamassa plena e longitudinal. Todos os ensaios foram feitos com blocos de concreto e com blocos cerâmicos. Finalizando, após evidenciar as deficiências dos atuais modelos de prismas, principalmente dos prismas com argamassa longitudinal, este trabalho tem como um último objetivo propor novos modelos de prismas para ensaios, em conformidade com os tipos de assentamentoAbstract: The {{two main}} aims {{of this work}} are to verify and analyze the {{reduction}} of the compressive strength of structural masonry walls, when the blocks are laid with mortar only in the outside faces of the block (<b>face</b> <b>shell</b> bedding). These verifications and analysis are important because, although the Brazilian code NBR 8798 (1985) still specifies that the entire block surface must be bonded (full mortar bedding), in Brazil the most used type of bedding is the <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> bedding. Besides, these verifications are important because we notice that the <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> bedding is used in the richest countries. In order to find the magnitude of this reduction and to understand the collapse of the two types of bedding, 14 days old specimens of blocks, prisms and wallettes of one meter height were tested, with <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> and full mortar bedding. All the tests were carried out with concrete and ceramic structural blocks. After realize the handicaps of the Brazilianprisms, mainly that ones bonded whit <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> bedding, the last aim of this work is to propose a new model of prisms, to be used in laboratory test...|$|E

Fibre reinforced cement composite (FRCC) is used as surface rendering for the imparting strength and stiffness to the DSM system constructed using special blocks consisting of tongue and groove joints in this research. The FRCC is a patent pending product (the details of which are therefore not provided in this paper) that sandwiches a fibreglass mesh within the fibre cement - polymer matrix. To examine the behaviour of this DSM system under compression, twelve waliettes of various configurations were constructed and tested under vertical compression under <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> loading.

For rational analysis of the wall clarification is sought as to whether the wall acts as a composite of unreinforced panels and reinforced cores or as a continuum of masonry embedded with reinforced at wider spacing. This paper reports the results of four full scale walls tested under inplane cyclic shear loading to provide some insight into the effect of the grout cores in altering the load paths within the wall.

Moreover, it is believed that <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> bedding induces lateral tensile stress on the web compared with full bedding. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of height-to-thickness ratio, bond type as well as mortar joint type on concrete masonry compressive strength. An experimental study using 78 prisms was completed. It was observed that the compressive strength for both grouted and hollow prisms decreases with the increase of the height-to-thickness ratio from 2 to 5.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} performed for {{qualitative and quantitative}} comparison of the maximum tensile resistance of contact and non-contact lap spliced bars in reinforced concrete block masonry using double pullout and wall splice specimens. A total of 32 specimens were tested, consisting of {{an equal number of}} double pullout specimens and full-scale wall splice specimens. Both specimen types had the identical cross-section. Eight replicate specimens for each specimen type were constructed with both contact and non-contact lap splice arrangements. Grade 400 deformed reinforcing bars with a 300 mm lap splice length were provided in all specimens. The double pullout specimens were tested applying direct tension to the lapped reinforcing bars. The splice resistance and displacement were recorded during testing. All double pullout specimens with contact lap splices developed, as a minimum, the yield strength of the reinforcing bars and generally displayed evidence of a yield plateau. In contrast, the double pullout specimens with non-contact lap splices failed when only 46. 1 % of the theoretical yield strength of the reinforcing bars was recorded as the maximum splice resistance. The difference between the average value of the tensile resistance in the contact and non-contact spliced bars was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Wall splice specimens were tested under a four-point loading arrangement with the lapped bars located in the constant moment region. The applied load and specimen deflection were recorded until failure occurred. A numerical analysis was then performed to calculate the maximum resistance of the spliced bars. The specimens with contact lap splices developed the theoretical yield capacity of the reinforcing bars. In contrast, the wall splice specimens with non-contact lap splices developed an average tensile resistance of 78 % of the theoretical yield capacity. The difference between the average tensile resistances of the lapped bars in the two splice arrangements was identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. On average, the contact and non-contact lap spliced bars in the double pullout specimens developed 8. 47 % and 41. 2 % less tensile resistance, respectively, as compared to the wall splice specimens with the identical splice arrangement. Both differences were identified as being statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. Bond loss between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding grout was identified as the failure mode for both the double pullout and wall splice specimens with contact lap splices. In contrast, bond loss at the masonry block/grout interface was observed along the non-contact lapped bars in both specimen types, as identified by visual observations upon removal of the <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> and the surrounding grout. Based on the test results of the wall splice specimens with non-contact lap splices, a correction factor of 1. 5 is suggested when calculating the effective splice length for the non-contact splice arrangement as tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{and failure}} mode of fully-grouted concrete blockwork masonry walls under compression loading {{is of great}} importance {{in the design of}} masonry structures, which are primarily designed to carry compressive loads. In recent years, it has become common for concrete blockwork masonry walls to be used for load bearing purposes, primarily because of their convenience and economy. For example, the cores in commonly used hollow blockwork allow the incorporation of vertical reinforcement and only minimal formwork is required. The aim of this thesis was to develop an in-depth understanding of the behaviour of reinforced fully-grouted concrete blockwork masonry walls. Important aspects of this included the failure modes of blockwork walls and the contribution of unrestrained compressive reinforcement to their strength. In addition, new failure models were developed that are suitable for inclusion in future codes of practice. The present study included an experimental investigation of the compressive strength of fully-grouted concrete blockwork and its individual components aimed at complementing and extending the available literature. The investigation showed that failure of the bond between the <b>face</b> <b>shell</b> and the grout (i. e. a splitting failure) governs the strength of blockwork masonry in axial compression. Extensive testing also showed that concrete blocks, grout, and mortar all fail in axial compression at strains ranging from about 0. 002 to about 0. 003; that is, at about the same ultimate strain as ordinary concrete. Finite element modelling of fully-grouted concrete blockwork masonry based on the program LUSAS was used to identify the critical stress distributions that lead to the characteristic splitting failure of blockwork. The investigation showed that splitting is caused by horizontal tensile stresses arising from the different stiffnesses of the concrete block, grout, mortar, and steel reinforcement comprising the blockwork, as well as imperfections such as internal voids and cracks, and mortar intrusions into the grout. Voids and cracks within concrete blockwork, particularly at the interfaces between the concrete blocks, grout, and mortar, if any, lead to the development of high tensile stresses and premature failure. This tendency thus can be reduced by careful compaction of the grout. The strength and stiffness of the mortar, if any, must be accounted for in the design of blockwork masonry walls. Weaker mortar reduces the overall strength of blockwork by increasing the horizontal tensile stresses arising from axial compression loading, thus inducing an earlier splitting failure. Unrestrained vertical reinforcement was found to have no significant effect on the mechanism of the splitting failure of blockwork masonry walls although it does increase the compressive load at which the splitting failure occurs. Horizontal reinforcement used to keep the vertical reinforcement in place has no significant effect on the development of stresses at the joints and hence no significant effect on the strength of blockwork masonry walls. The study showed that the empirical failure model for fully-grouted concrete blockwork masonry walls in axial compression incorporated in the Australian blockwork code, AS 3700 – 2001 Masonry Structures (Standards Australia, 2001) can be improved. A new failure model based upon a rationale method has been developed. Reliability analyses of concrete masonry blockwork using the first order second moment method were conducted based on the empirical failure model for fully-grouted concrete blockwork masonry incorporated in AS 3700 – 2001, two failure models based on the provisions of the reinforced concrete code, AS 3600 – 2009 Concrete Structures (Standards Australia, 2009), and the new failure model noted above. The two models based on AS 3600 discount and account for the presence of the concrete blocks, respectively. The reliability analyses showed that the value of the strength reduction factor, Ø, for unreinforced blockwork in axial compression incorporated in the Australian blockwork code, AS 3700 – 2001 Masonry Structures (Standards Australia, 2001) could, if desired, be increased from 0. 45 to 0. 50 for concrete masonry blockwork walls. The model based on AS 3600 – 2009 Concrete Structures (Standards Australia, 2009) that discounted the presence of the concrete blocks was shown to be unsatisfactory. It was also shown that the corresponding model that accounted for the presence of the blocks could be used for design purposes provided that a Ø value of 0. 42 is used in place of the value for walls of 0. 6 given in AS 3600 – 2009. The latter does not account for the characteristic splitting failure of concrete blockwork walls in axial compression. The new failure model for fully-grouted concrete blockwork masonry walls in axial compression developed in this study {{has been shown to be}} superior to the existing empirical failure model incorporated in the Australian blockwork code, and is simple enough to be incorporated in a code of practice. It is applicable to both reinforced and unreinforced and both conventional and dry-stack blockwork, and incorporates a new factor to account for the splitting failure characteristic of blockwork masonry walls...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} and implementation, UNION 3, for computing mass {{properties of the}} union of many identical axis-aligned cubes. This implementation has processed 20, 000, 000 cubes on a dual processor Pentium Xeon workstation in about one elapsed hour. The ideas would extend to the union of general polyhedra. UNION 3 works by combining three techniques. The first {{is a set of}} local topological formulae for computing polyhedral mass properties. No global topology is used, such as complete face or edge information, or edge loops and <b>face</b> <b>shells.</b> For example, the volume of a multiple component, concave, rectilinear object is P sixiyizi, summed over the vertices (xi, yi, zi), where each si {{is a function of the}} directions of the incident edges. The second technique is a 3 -D grid of uniform cells, which is overlaid on the data. Each cell has a list of edges, faces, and cubes that overlap it. Only pairs of objects in the same cell are tested for intersection. Experimentally, the uniform grid is quite tolerant of varying densities in the input. The third technique, building on the second, is the covered-cell concept. When a cell is completely contained within a cube, its overlap list is cleared, and objects in it are not intersected against each other (unless they both also overlap the same other, noncovered, cell). These techniques combine to reduce the expected computation time to linear in the number of cubes, regardless of the number of intersections. In the slowest step of UNION 3, which is testing pairs of objects in each cell for intersection, no inter-cell communication is required. Therefore UNION 3 parallelizes quite well. 1...|$|R

It should be noted that African women <b>face</b> <b>shelling,</b> famine, epidemics, forced displacement, detention, torture and execution like other civilians caught up in the maelstrom of war. Mass rapes in Darfur effectively terrorize women, break their will, and destroy the fabric of the society.

Stones are often given sacred powers in the Maya religion and are believed to be sent from the spiritual world as a sign of one’s calling to midwifery.
