5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943. At Los Alamos Frisch {{continued}} his work on critical mass studies, for which Titterton developed <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry</b> for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, timers and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, {{was one of the}} few women working at Los Alamos in a technical role.

5|$|On graduation, Kilburn was {{recruited}} by C.P. Snow. He {{was given a}} quick course in electronics, and was posted to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in Malvern, where he worked on radar in Group 19 under Frederic Calland Williams. The group was responsible for designing and debugging <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry.</b> Although Williams was initially disappointed at being given someone with so little practical experience, Kilburn became a valued member of the team. On 14 August 1943, he married Irene Marsden, a shop assistant. They went on to raise a son, John, and a daughter, Anne.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry</b> of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
2500|$|Programmable control: The audio circuit is analog {{but with}} {{additional}} <b>electronic</b> control <b>circuitry</b> {{that can be}} programmed by an audiologist, often {{with more than one}} program. The <b>electronic</b> control <b>circuitry</b> can be fixed during manufacturing or in some cases, the hearing professional can use an external computer temporarily connected to the hearing aid to program the additional control circuitry. The wearer can change the program for different listening environments by pressing buttons either on the device itself or on a remote control or in some cases the additional control circuitry operates automatically. This type of circuitry is generally more flexible than simple adjustable controls. The first hearing aid with analog audio circuitry and automatic digital <b>electronic</b> control <b>circuitry</b> was based on US Patent 4,025,721, [...] "Method of and means for adaptively filtering near-stationary noise from speech" [...] by D Graupe, GD Causey, filed in 1975.

25|$|Every {{electronic}} {{hearing aid}} has at minimum a microphone, a loudspeaker (commonly called a receiver), a battery, and <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry.</b> The <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry</b> varies among devices, {{even if they}} are the same style. The circuitry falls into three categories based on the type of audio processing (analog or digital) and the type of control circuitry (adjustable or programmable). Hearing aid devices generally do not contain processors strong enough to process complex signal algorithms for sound source localization.|$|E

40|$|A solar powered {{wireless}} computer mouse (SPM) {{was chosen to}} serve as a case study for the evaluation and optimization of industrial design processes of photovoltaic (PV) powered consumer systems. As the design process requires expert knowledge in various technical fields, we assessed and compared the following: appropriate selection of integrated PV type, battery capacity and type, possible <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitries</b> for PV-battery coupling, and material properties concerning mechanical incorporation of PV into the encasing. Besides technical requirements, ergonomic aspects and design aesthetics with respect to good “sun-harvesting” properties influenced the design process. This is particularly important as simulations show users can positively influence energy balances by “sun-bathing” the PV mouse. A total of 15 SPM prototypes were manufactured and tested by actual users. Although user satisfaction proved the SPM concept to be feasible, future research still needs to address user acceptance related to product dimensions and user willingness to pro-actively “sun-bath” PV powered products in greater detail...|$|R
40|$|Integrated <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitries</b> with {{pressure}} sensors have been extensively researched {{as a key}} component for emerging electronics applications such as electronic skins and health-monitoring devices. Although existing pressure sensors display high sensitivities, they can only be used for specific purposes due to the narrow range of detectable pressure (under tens of kPa) {{and the difficulty of}} forming highly integrated arrays. However, it is essential to develop tactile pressure sensors with a wide pressure range in order to use them for diverse application areas including medical diagnosis, robotics or automotive electronics. Here we report an unconventional approach for fabricating fully integrated active-matrix arrays of pressure-sensitive graphene transistors with air-dielectric layers simply formed by folding two opposing panels. Furthermore, this realizes a wide tactile pressure sensing range from 250 &# 8201;Pa to ∼ 3 &# 8201;MPa. Additionally, fabrication of pressure sensor arrays and transparent pressure sensors are demonstrated, suggesting their substantial promise as next-generation electronics. ope...|$|R
40|$|The synthesis, properties, and {{application}} of {{a new class of}} polymer electrolytes, are here reported and discussed. The electrolytes have a very high ionic conductivity, an acceptable lithium ion transport number, and a wide electrochemical stability window. The members of the family which appear most promising in terms of stability of the lithium electrode interface have been tested as electrolyte separators in high voltage, thin layer, laminated rechargeable batteries. Preliminary results provided indications of promising performance in terms of voltage output and cyclability.

25|$|The {{advantage}} of nanofluidic devices is from its feasibility {{to be integrated}} with <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry.</b> Because they are built using the same manufacturing technology, {{it is possible to}} make a nanofluidic system with digital integrated circuit on a single chip.

50|$|A {{densitometer}} is {{a device}} that measures the degree of darkness (the optical density) of a photographic or semitransparent material or of a reflecting surface. The densitometer is basically a light source aimed at a photoelectric cell. It determines the density of a sample placed between the light source and the photoelectric cell from differences in the readings. Modern densitometers have the same components, but also have <b>electronic</b> integrated <b>circuitry</b> for better reading.|$|R
25|$|Originally, sprites were {{a method}} of {{integrating}} unrelated bitmaps so that {{they appeared to be}} part of the normal bitmap on a screen, such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the data defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry</b> or software. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a hardware construct that employs custom DMA channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.|$|E
500|$|In a {{sequence}} of 20 mock games of Jeopardy, human participants {{were able to use}} the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding. During that time, Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal. Part of the system used to win the Jeopardy! contest was the <b>electronic</b> <b>circuitry</b> that receives the [...] "ready" [...] signal and then examined whether Watson's confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer. Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times, Watson's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated (instead of reacted to) the ready signal. After signaling, Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in Jeopardy! question format. Watson's voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM text-to-speech program in 2004.|$|E

This means that they use more energy than analogue Band II VHF receivers. However, thanks to increased integration (radio-on-chip), DAB receiver power usage is getting closer to that of FM receivers. For example, NXP Semiconductors N.V. is producing both FM only and FM+DAB radio-on-chip, with similar power consumption.|$|E
