5|$|In {{addition}} to fruit and seeds, {{a number of}} other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground <b>doves</b> and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and other insects are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit <b>doves,</b> and ruddy ground <b>doves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning at the post–World War I 1920 Summer Olympics, the {{lighting}} of the Olympic Flame {{was followed by}} the release of <b>doves,</b> symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought newspapers to cover themselves because of the birds' droppings.) The release was discontinued after several <b>doves</b> perched themselves at the cauldron's rim and were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of <b>doves</b> after the flame has been lit.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mourning}} <b>doves</b> migrate along flyways over land. On rare occasions, mourning <b>doves</b> {{have been}} seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning <b>doves</b> remain through winter, sustained {{by the presence of}} bird feeders.|$|E

50|$|The zebra <b>dove</b> {{is closely}} related to the {{peaceful}} <b>dove</b> of Australia and New Guinea and the barred <b>dove</b> of eastern Indonesia.

5|$|Mourning <b>doves</b> {{are light}} grey and brown and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate {{and care for the}} young. Mourning <b>doves</b> eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Mourning <b>doves</b> eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning <b>doves</b> generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning <b>doves</b> are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning <b>doves</b> do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|E
5|$|Mourning <b>doves</b> show a {{preference}} for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and the seeds of pokeberry, amaranth, canary grass, corn, sesame, and wheat. When their favorite foods are absent, mourning <b>doves</b> will eat the seeds of other plants, including buckwheat, rye, goosegrass and smartweed.|$|E

The red-eyed <b>dove</b> is generally similar with an identical display flight. It however has dark wine red eyes, is larger and darker altogether, with a grey belly and grey tail tips. The mourning collared <b>dove</b> has more grey about the head, and pale yellow eyes.|$|R

5|$|The male then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, {{and the female}} will choose one. The female dove builds the nest.

The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning <b>doves</b> will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning <b>doves,</b> other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E

Pigeons and <b>doves</b> may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic. In addition to bright colours, pigeons may sport crests or other ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|Most nests are in trees, both {{deciduous}} and coniferous. Sometimes, {{they can}} be found in shrubs, vines, or on artificial constructs like buildings, or hanging flower pots. When there is no suitable elevated object, mourning <b>doves</b> will nest on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Mourning <b>doves</b> are {{prolific}} breeders. In warmer areas, {{these birds}} may raise {{up to six}} broods in a season. This fast breeding is essential because mortality is high. Each year, mortality can reach 58% a year for adults and 69% for the young.|$|E

50|$|Logical {{components}} of the <b>DOVE</b> architecture are <b>DOVE</b> controllers and <b>DOVE</b> switches (abbreviated as dSwitch). <b>DOVE</b> controllers perform management functions, and {{one part of the}} control plane functions across <b>DOVE</b> switches. <b>DOVE</b> switches perform the encapsulation of layer 2 frames into UDP packets using the Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) frame format, and provide virtual interfaces for virtual machines to plug into, similarly to how physical Ethernet switches provide ports for network interface controller (NIC) connections. <b>DOVE</b> switches are running as part of virtual machine hypervisors.|$|R
5|$|Mourning <b>doves</b> sunbathe or rainbathe by {{lying on}} the ground or on a flat tree limb, leaning over, {{stretching}} one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. Dustbathing is common as well.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} support from {{various members of the}} art community, it was often {{necessary}} for <b>Dove</b> to earn money through farming, fishing and commercial illustration. <b>Dove’s</b> most consistent supporter was Duncan Phillips, founder of the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., which now holds the majority of <b>Dove’s</b> work. <b>Dove’s</b> work convinced Philips that abstract was an artistic process, not just an art style. Stieglitz’s gallery was first visited by Phillips because of <b>Dove,</b> and he continued to return to see <b>Dove's</b> work. In exchange for first choice of paintings from each exhibition, Phillips paid <b>Dove</b> a commission of $50.00 a month. Interestingly, <b>Dove</b> met Phillips only once in his lifetime, in 1936. In 1937 Phillips purchased Goin Fishin for $2,000.00, then the largest sum paid for any of <b>Dove's</b> work. Phillips also purchased “Huntington Harbor 1.” <b>Dove</b> produced about twenty-five assemblages between 1924 and 1930.|$|R
