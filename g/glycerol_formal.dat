40|$|At 250 – 300 °C and 30 – 50 bar, a continuous-flow (CF) {{transesterification}} {{of different}} dialkyl and alkylene carbonates (dimethyl-, diethyl-, dibenzyl-, and propylene carbonate, respectively) with two glycerol derived acetals (<b>glycerol</b> <b>formal</b> and solketal) was investigated without any catalyst. An unprecedented result was obtained; {{not only the}} desired process occurred, but also {{the formation of the}} corresponding mono-transesterification products took place with an excellent selectivity (up to 98 %) in all cases. Under isothermal conditions, a study on the effect of pressure allowed us to optimize the conversion of acetals (up to 95 %) for the reactions of dimethyl- and diethyl-carbonate (DMC and DEC, respectively). This proved that an abrupt progress of the reaction occurred for very small increments of pressure. For example, at 250 °C, the thermal transesterification of DMC with <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal</b> showed a sharp increase of the conversion from 1 – 2 % at 30 bar to∼ 85 % at 37 bar. The lower the temperature, the lower the pressure interval at which the onset of the reaction is achieved. The absence of catalysts allowed us to run CF-reactions virtually indefinitely and with a very high productivity (up to 68 mg min − 1) compared to the capacity (1 mL) of the used CF-reactor. Products of the transesterification of DMC and DEC were isolated in good-to-almost quantitative yields. In the case of heavier carbonates, steric reasons were responsible for the considerably lower reactivity of propylene carbonate (PC) with respect to DMC and DEC, while the transesterification of dibenzyl carbonate (DBnC, solid at room temperature) with <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal</b> required the presence of acetone as an additional solvent/carrier. Although the reactions of both PC and DBnC were not optimized, results offered a proof-of-concept on the extension of thermal transesterification processes to higher homologues of linear and alkylene carbonates...|$|E
40|$|The base-catalysed {{reactions}} of OH-bearing biobased derivatives (BBDs) including <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal,</b> solketal, glycerol carbonate, furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol with nontoxic dialkyl carbonates (dimethyl and diethyl carbonate) were explored under continuous-flow (CF) {{conditions in the}} presence of three Na-exchanged Y- and X-faujasites (FAUs) and four Mg–Al hydrotalcites (HTs). Compared to previous etherification protocols mediated by dialkyl carbonates, the reported procedure offers substantial improvements {{not only in terms of}} (chemo) selectivity but also for the recyclability of the catalysts, workup, ease of product purification and, importantly, process intensification. Characterisation studies proved that both HT 30 and KW 2000 hydrotalcites acted as catalyst precursors: during the thermal activation pre-treatments, the typical lamellar structure of the hydrotalcite was broken down gradually into a MgO-like phase (periclase) or rather a magnesia–alumina solid solution, which was the genuine catalytic phase...|$|E
40|$|Deltamethrin (DLM) is a {{relatively}} potent and widely used pyre-throid insecticide. Inefficient detoxification has been proposed {{to be the primary}} reason for the greater sensitivity of immature rats to the acute neurotoxicity of DLM. The objective {{of this study was to}} test this hypothesis by characterizing the age dependence of DLM metabolism in vitro, as well as toxic signs and blood levels of the neurotoxic parent compound following administration of 10 mg DLM/kg p. o. in <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal.</b> Metabolism was quantified in vitro by monitoring the disappearance of the parent compound from plasma [via carboxylesterases (CaEs) ] and liver microsomes [via CaEs and cytochromes P 450 (P 450 s) ] obtained from 10 -, 21 -, and 40 -day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Mean (S.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the viscoelastic properties of Carbopol 934 P polymeric systems in a variety of mixtures of pharmaceutical solvents. Carbopol 934 P neutralized with a 1 : 1 equivalent ratio of triethanolamine was dissolved in various binary or ternary solvent mixtures consisting of propylene glycol, <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal,</b> and water. Dynamic moduli G′ and G″, complex viscosities, η′ and η″, and loss tangent, tanδ, were examined over a frequency range of 10 - 3 to 10 Hz using an oscillatory viscoelastic rheometer at 30 °C. The results indicated that for 0. 5 - 1. 5 wt% neutralized Carbopol in ternary mixtures, G′ and G″ increased by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude and the phase angle decreased from 80 to 25 ° when the water content in the solvent mixture increased from 10 to 80 wt%. These studies also indicated that the addition of water to nonaqueous Carbopol 934 P polymer systems transforms them from low-viscosity solutions to gels with significant elastic behavior involving physical interaction and entanglement of polymer segments with solvents...|$|E
40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} propertied {{of model}} polymer, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), in ternary solvent mixtures and the variation of viscoelastic properties under dilution with water were investigated. HPMC was dispersed in mixtures of <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal</b> (GF) or ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol (PG), and water. Each polymeric sample was oscillated at different frequencies with fixed stress amplitude {{and the changes}} in elastic modulus, viscous modulus, and apparent viscosity were measured at 30 [deg]C. The moisture absorption rate of HPMC in PG:GF solvent mixtures in a 94 % relative humidified environment was also studied. A linear relationship between the elastic modulus or viscous modulus and polymer concentration was observed for the HPMC samples. The relative mucociliary transport rate tested on the non-depleted frog palate model revealed a curvilinear correlation with the loss tangent (a ratio of the viscous modulus to the elastic modulus) of the polymeric solution. Using GF as a solvent for HPMC resulted in a formation of a rigid gel with the highest elastic modulus and viscous modulus among solvents selected. A higher affinity for water was found for HPMC in the PG:GF 90 : 10 mixture compared with HPMC in the PG:GF 70 : 30 mixture. However, the elastic modulus and viscous modulus were much higher for HPMC in the PG:GF 70 : 30 mixture...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} stability characteristics and kinetics behavior of abamectin (ABM) as a 1 % (m/V) topical veterinary solution. During the study, samples stressed at 55 and 70 °C were regularly analyzed for several parameters over 8 weeks on a chromatographic (HPLC) system, using a Prodigy C 18, 250 × 4. 6 mm, 5 µm, column eluting with 15 : 34 : 51 (V/V/V) water/methanol/acetonitrile as mobile phase. The HPLC method was validated for precision, accuracy, linearity and specificity, and was found to be stability indicating. The result showed that degradation of ABM followed first-order kinetics and data on loss in assay rate kobs (s– 1) and half life (t 1 / 2, days) demonstrated ABM in <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal</b> showing the maximum stability. The degradation behavior of ABM varies from solvent to solvent. The effect of added alkali on pH change and loss in ABM assay was studied and found to be unique for all solvents and very distinct from typical hydrolysis degradation. The present study may serve as a platform to design and develop topical non-aqueous solutions of ABM for veterinary use given there no such comprehensive efforts has been published till date on stability profile of ABM in non-aqueous solvents...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to apply response surface methodology to the design and analysis of composite experiments containing independent covariate(s). The approach is illustrated here by the study of viscosity characteristics of a polymeric mucoadhesive formulation in multicomponent solvent vehicles. The nonaqueous formulation will produce a gel network with significant rheological change when in contact with body fluids. The process of water inclusion will induce not only solvent compositional change of the mixture but also concomitant dilution of the polymer concentration. To study the viscosity change over the solvent compositions and polymeric concentrations of interest, an experimental design is utilized consisting of a 10 -point simplex-centroid lattice augmented with three interior points at each polymeric concentration. The contour patterns are compared with the experimental, data using the variance and lack of fit, starting with the Scheffe linear model and building up to the full cubic model including the covariate terms. The fitted model provides information needed to predict optimum formulations, i. e., initial viscosity of less than 100 cP, but yielding rheological profiles commensurate with high degrees of substantivity when diluted with water. For illustrative purposes, the Carbopol resins neutralized with a 1 : 1 molar equivalent ratio of triethanolamine in three primary solvents, propylene glycol, <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal,</b> and water, were chosen for this study...|$|E
40|$|At T ≥ 200 ◦ C,in the {{presence}} of K 2 CO 3 as a catalyst, an original etheriﬁcation procedure of non-toxic acetals such as <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal</b> (GlyF) and solketal has been investigated by using dialkyl carbonates as safe alkylating agents. The effects of parameters including the temperature, the reaction time, and the loading of both the catalyst and the dialkyl carbonate have been detailed for the model case of dimethyl carbonate (DMC). Both GlyF and solketal were efﬁciently alkylated by DMC to produce the corresponding O-methyl ethers with selectivity up to 99 % and excellent yields (86 – 99 %, by GC). The high selectivity could {{be accounted for by}} a mechanistic study involving a combined sequence of methylation, carboxymethylation, decarboxylation and hydrolysis processes. The O-methylation of GlyF and solketal could be successfully scaled up for multigram synthesis even operating with a moderate excess (5 molar equiv.) of DMC {{and in the absence of}} additional solvent. Notwithstanding the advantageous reduction of the process mass index, scale up experiments provided evidence that prolonged reaction times may induce the decomposition of DMC mainly by the loss of CO 2. TheK 2 CO 3 -catalyzed etheriﬁcation of solketal with other carbonates such as dibenzyl and diethyl carbonate (DBnC and DEC, respectively), proceeded with the same good selectivity observed for DMC. However, at 220 ◦ C, the solketal conversion did not exceed 81 % since both DBnC and DEC were extensively consumed in competitive decarboxylation and hydrolysis reactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were twofold: (1) to characterize the toxicokinetics and dose-dependent systemic/tissue distribution of deltamethrin (DLM) over a range of doses in adult Sprague– Dawley (S–D) rats; (2) to provide comprehensive time course blood and tissue data for development of a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model for DLM. DLM {{is one of the more}} neurotoxic members of a relatively new and commonly used class of insecticides, the pyrethroids. Despite widespread exposure of the general population to pyrethroids, there is little basic toxicokinetic (TK) data to use in health risk assessments or in development of PBTK models. Male S–D rats were dosed orally with 0. 4, 2, or 10 mg DLM/kg dissolved in <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal</b> (GF). Another group received 2 mg/kg iv. Serial blood and tissue samples were taken at sacrifice and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for their DLM content, in order to obtain comprehensive time course data sets for estimation of classical TK, as well as PBTK parameters (e. g., tissues:blood partition coefficients). Gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of DLM was rapid but incomplete. Bioavailability was just 18 %. Some 83 % of DLM in blood was present in the plasma. Just 0. 1 – 0. 3 % of systemically absorbed doses reached the brain, the target organ of the bioactive parent compound. Fat, skin and surprisingly, skeletal muscle, accumulated large amounts of the highly lipophilic chemical and served as slow-release depots. Tissue distribution was dose dependent, though generally not proportional to dose. Clearance was dose independent in this dosage range. The time-profiles were used by A. Mirfazaelian et al. (2006, Toxicol. Sci. 93, 432 – 442) to construct and adjust a PBTK model. Much remains to be learned about physiological/biochemical processes and barriers that govern the GI absorption, transport, brain deposition, and elimination of DLM and other pyrethroids in laboratory animals and humans...|$|E
40|$|Generally, organic water-miscible {{solvents}} {{are used}} intravascularly (both intravenously and intra-arterially) for preparing {{two types of}} formulations, namely, pharmaceutical injections of poorly soluble drugs and precipitating liquid embolic polymeric materials for the minimally invasive treatment of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, or tumors, by arterial route. Although several of such solvents {{have been used in}} both drug delivery and interventional radiology, their safety profile is a concern. In particular, {{there is a lack of}} comparative investigations of their cardiovascular effects when injected intra-arterially. We selected 13 non-aqueous water-miscible solvents based on their capacity to solubilize drugs or embolic polymeric materials, and on their described use, at least diluted with water, in pharmaceutical formulations. Their in vivo hemodynamic toxicity in male adult sheep after infra-renal aorta catheterization has been estimated with respect to the arterial and venous pressures, as well as the heart rate. Saline solution was used as a control. Three different volumes (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mL) were infused rapidly. An increase in arterial pressure and concomitant decrease in venous pressure, which we considered as signs of a cardiovascular toxicity, were observed to a differing extent for all organic solvents. Changes in heart rate were negligible. Based on the intensity of arterial pressure change after a 1 -mL infusion, a classification of the toxicity of the solvents following intra-arterial infusion is proposed: Solvents devoid of significant cardiovascular toxicity: dimethyl isosorbide (DMI), Glycofurol 75, polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG 200), diglyme. Solvents with moderate cardiovascular toxicity: tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA), ethanol, acetone, Solketal, <b>glycerol</b> <b>formal,</b> dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Solvents with marked cardiovascular toxicity: propylene glycol, ethyl lactate, N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP). Emphasis is put on the relative character of the proposed ranking and on the lack for certain solvents, at least in the open literature, of data pertaining at other forms of toxic effects (e. g., undesirable pharmacological action, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, mutagenicity, and irritating and sensitizing properties), all factors that have to be considered when selecting a proper solvent...|$|E
