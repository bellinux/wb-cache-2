5|$|Complete skeletons {{have been}} {{described}} only for the most advanced abelisaurids (such as Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus), {{making it difficult to}} establish defining <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skeleton for the family as a whole.

5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to specific aspects of modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull are much more pronounced, citing <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E
5|$|From {{the bone}} <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, it is {{estimated}} that Acrocanthosaurus requires at least 12 years to fully grow. This number may be much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for these lines, Acrocanthosaurus needs 18–24 years to be mature.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life: Source {{has been}} criticized for not fully {{utilizing}} many of the <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Source engine found in Half-Life 2, as it still uses textures and models from the original game.
