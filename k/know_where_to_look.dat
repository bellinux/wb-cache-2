They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>look.</b> That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|One common way of {{reconciling}} {{these two}} opposing forces {{is simply to}} exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [...] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused {{by the presence of}} symbols (whether known or novel) and they <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more general target readerships, this action leaves the readers without any explanatory annotation and can leave them wondering what the apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the formal requirement (the presence of a gloss) and the functional requirement (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; AMA says, [...] "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention." [...] Thus [...] "188del11" [...] is glossed as [...] "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." [...] This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the [...] "abbreviation-leading" [...] style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as clinical trial acronyms [...] or standardized polychemotherapy regimens [...] ), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.|$|E
