500|$|Deathly Hallows {{begins with}} a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus' The Libation Bearers. Of this, Rowling said [...] "I really enjoyed {{choosing}} those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I'd known {{it was going to be}} those two passages since Chamber was published. I always knew [...] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> They just say it all to me, they really do".|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Stefani {{released}} her first solo single in six years, [...] "Baby Don't Lie", and following its moderate impact and reception, a new single, [...] "Spark the Fire", {{was released in}} December of the same year. However, both singles underperformed on the charts, prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release. After months with no updates on the album, Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over, since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the previous project. Stefani started writing new material in June 2015, and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later, she felt very inspired. In the same interview, Stefani claimed: [...] "I needed {{to go through what}} <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through to write the record that I needed to write. [...] These songs are really natural — they’re from not worrying about what happened or what’s going to happen but about living in the moment, from trying to be present and trying to feel." ...|$|E

Returning to Star Trek, but appearing {{for the first time in}} Enterprise, was Leland Orser, who played Loomis. The actor had previously appeared in the [...] episode [...] "", as well as the [...] episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who would later become better known for portraying Denny Duquette in medical drama Grey's Anatomy and as The Comedian in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, strongly disliked portraying a Xindi Reptilian in [...] "Carpenter Street". He later explained to Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I had to pay my bills. I knew I'd play some guy saying some stuff. Then I got a call saying <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in for a prosthetic fitting. I remember them dripping goop on my face, and I had straws sticking out of my nose. I couldn't eat lunch. I was claustrophobic. I'd go home in tears. This was the job that made me want to quit acting." ...|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E

It's what <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through <b>to</b> get into the incredible serenity and celestial dance of zero gravity." ...|$|R
5000|$|In another {{interview}} with MTV, 50 Cent {{spoke about the}} album. He said: [...] It's like a spinoff — the sequel to Beg for Mercy. It was a statement towards the competition, towards other artists. Terminate on Sight is the version where you get more aggressive. This record embodies that. I kinda know where <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> because <b>I</b> tested the waters with the material I put out. I get to tell with the response to certain records where <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be and chill out from other stuff.|$|R

The race is remembered for a notorious moment towards the end when Radcliffe, {{hindered}} by runner's diarrhea and in need for a toilet break, stopped and defecated {{on the side of the}} road in view of the crowd and TV cameras which broadcast the incident live. After the race, she apologised to viewers and explained what happened, [...] "I was losing time because I was having stomach cramps and I thought 'I just need to go and I'll be fine'. I didn't really want to resort to that in front of hundreds of thousands of people. Basically <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> I started feeling it between 15 and [...] and probably carried on too long before stopping. I must have eaten too much beforehand". In November 2006, the incident was voted top running moment in history in the UK from a choice of ten [...] "unforgettable moments".|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>need</b> a hobby, and I don't {{want it to}} be {{basketball}} ... I {{want it to be}} music. So to {{get away}} from music, I do other music. If I'm producing someone's song or writing with someone else, then doing a Bleachers song or a fun. song is an escape and it keeps me creative and it keeps me locked into what I want to do. If something's making me crazy, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> somewhere else and I don't want that thing to be yoga.|$|R
5000|$|Now, I have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> {{work on my}} State of the Union speech. And I {{worked on}} it until pretty late last night.

I never told anybody to lie, not a single time; never. These allegations are false. And <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> work for the American people. Thank you.|$|R

It's not something I can do sitting at my desk waiting for the phone to ring. To me, that's what an activist does. It's public service.

[...] "I asked my dad if he thought <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> He said no, but I should give it a try. So I did, for just 15 minutes. I went in said 'hello' and explained that I drink because I am in love and have screwed up the relationship. Then I walked out." [...] Winehouse later changed her management company.|$|E

But ultimately the only reason we’re having this conversation is because I love music. And that’s the path that it’s led me on in my life. I never set out to be a successful musician, but musical decisions have always guided my life. For that reason, I will stay true to what I really feel… ...|$|E
