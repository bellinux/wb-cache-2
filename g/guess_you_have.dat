500|$|Muntz {{developed}} a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17tubes. He often carried {{a pair of}} wire clippers, and when he thought {{that one of his}} employees was [...] "overengineering" [...] a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer [...] "Well, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to put that last part back in" [...] and walk away.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{girl you}} ought to have married!" [...] Sadie exclaimed. [...] "What's she like? I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> her picture, though you haven't shown it me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's your {{trouble that}} you're a confiding man. But I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{learned that it}} doesn't pay to take any chances when you deal with Mappin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{better come}} round some other night," [...] Selah {{suggested}} pacifically, {{but with a}} significance which fell upon Olive's ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{not easily}} scared," [...] Lisle commented. [...] "You might <b>have</b> got lost. <b>Guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> some motive {{that made you}} take the risk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'We' is good!" [...] said Earl, with a laugh. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better {{strike up}} a {{partnership}} with that druggist when he arrives." ...|$|R
6000|$|Eliz. Ah! now I <b>guess.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> some trinket for me-- You promised late to buy no {{more such}} baubles-- And {{now you are}} ashamed.--Nay, I must see-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well, {{they will}} turn their faces to-morrow, Denis; {{and as for}} the weather, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got wet before now digging praties in the old country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Stanton said thoughtfully; [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got it right. But {{what was}} his reason? He knows Crane can have him sent up for horse-stealing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better ask Gabe about that," [...] {{answered}} Slugger. [...] "He's {{very anxious}} {{to see all of}} you--wants to see you this evening, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better let us {{carry you}} out of the woods," [...] said Jack. [...] "You can't walk, and you {{certainly}} can't stay here alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} {{understand}} in a minute," [...] returned the rug dealer, blandly. He raised his voice. [...] "Boys, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better come in now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{done all}} you could and can let the fellow go," [...] he said. [...] "My notion is he won't be in the {{neighborhood}} long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll feel {{considerably}} {{better after}} that," [...] said Sally, who watched our efforts with much approval. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> forgotten {{you had no}} breakfast, either of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you must}} clear out to another room!" [...] cried Dick. [...] "Whoever was coming {{will find that}} window wide open, and <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> escaped in this direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young lady}} gave no heed to this announcement, but looked {{straight}} at her brother. [...] "Well, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better be quiet," [...] she simply observed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} nearer, certainly," [...] said Bartley. [...] "But I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better make it thirty." [...] He kept a quiet face, {{but his heart}} throbbed.|$|R
6000|$|The American {{tilted back}} {{his chair and}} poised it an instant. “Well, I’m sorry you want to attack one of our institutions. But I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better enjoy {{yourself}} first!” ...|$|R
6000|$|Sarah reddened, but {{stood beside}} him bravely. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> Bill, {{about as much}} as I have." [...] There was a moment of {{dramatic}} tension and the girls tingled with sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> me beat," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "We'll hook Jim off the binder and {{put you on}} instead. I'll own up I'd {{rather have}} him along with me just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{observed}} Brown confidently, [...] "don't {{you think}} it's {{the best thing}} she {{can do to stop}} outside--with you to look after her? You see, I rather <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> guessed it all yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{they knew}} we were {{following}} them," [...] explained Dave. [...] "Link, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better admit that the game is up," [...] he went on, turning to his former schoolmate.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{ran up to}} tell," [...] Maxwell said this, {{and then}} he hesitated. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better know all about it. Can you bear {{something}} disagreeable, or would you rather wait--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guessed</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{told me how}} {{you were}} practising, and how well you were getting on. I <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> some special purpose for taking so much pains, and you did not come in {{yesterday}} evening as usual. Then, too, you tell me he {{was hit in the}} arm, and you mentioned the other day that you were practising at that, and showed me the iron hand <b>you</b> <b>had</b> had made to hold a pistol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” said Clay. “Your partner’s {{pretty smart}} and I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got it safely {{locked up in}} one of the Island ports. The chances are that you won’t be able to give it to me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We’ll let it go,” Clay {{answered}} dryly. “I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{a different}} idea of your value now. But you don’t {{seem to be}} making much progress with Ruth Osborne. I suppose you really want her?” ...|$|E
6000|$|Witham smiled grimly. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{heard of}} me. Anyway, {{there are a}} good many places in Montana where they know Lance Courthorne. Quite sure I know a {{straight}} game when I see it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sally winced. [...] "Yes" [...] she agreed, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to tell me. He {{was fond}} of you. One could be proud of that. Harry Wyllard never did {{anything}} low down and mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{a man in}} the {{settlement}} who said he was going that way to-day or to-morrow, and it's quite likely that he'd drive <b>you</b> over. <b>Guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better ask for Maverick Thorne at the hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Seven! I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to pay {{for extra}} baggage. Shall I get you a carriage, {{and where do you}} want to be driven to--to your own house or the hotel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Saxton made {{a little}} {{impatient}} gesture. [...] "Then I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got to learn, {{and there are plenty}} of men to be hired in the bush who do. You know how to rough down redwood logs and blow out rocks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Devine nodded tranquilly. [...] "Allonby {{has enough}} for two, but he lets up and loses his grip when the whisky comes along," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got {{something}} that's worth rather more to me. You couldn't help having it. It {{was born in}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{struck the}} nail on the head, Sam," [...] {{answered}} his oldest brother. [...] "But come on, let us see if we can find some trace of him." [...] And {{in less than a minute}} more they had turned their machine around and were heading for the spot mentioned to them by the stage driver.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. All he said was, 'If {{you will}} join with me we can pay Dave Porter off good {{and get him}} in the biggest kind of a hole.' I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better keep your eyes open, Dave." ...|$|R
6000|$|The American {{tilted back}} his chair {{a little and}} poised it an instant. [...] "Well, I'm sorry you want to attack one of our institutions," [...] he said, smiling. [...] "But I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better enjoy {{yourself}} FIRST!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it sounds quite probable; {{but there}} are discrepancies. I'll take these things along, and I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better make for the {{homestead}} {{and ask them to}} let <b>you</b> in. We'll <b>have</b> a lively blizzard down on us very soon." ...|$|R
