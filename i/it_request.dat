50|$|Although CSMA/CA {{has been}} used in a variety of wired {{communication}} systems, it is particularly beneficial in a wireless LAN due to a common problem of multiple stations being able to see the Access Point, but not each other. This is due to differences in transmit power, and receive sensitivity, as well as distance, and location with respect to the AP. This will cause a station to not be able to 'hear' another station's broadcast. This is the so-called 'hidden node', or 'hidden station' problem. Devices utilizing 802.11 based standards can enjoy the benefits of collision avoidance (RTS / CTS handshake, also Point coordination function), although they do not do so by default. By default they use a Carrier sensing mechanism called 'exponential backoff', or (Distributed coordination function) that relies upon a station attempting to 'listen' for another station's broadcast before sending. CA, or PCF relies upon the AP (or the 'receiver' for Ad hoc networks) granting a station the exclusive right to transmit for a given period of time after requesting <b>it</b> (<b>Request</b> to Send / Clear to Send).|$|E

40|$|In {{a context}} of {{increasingly}} demanding and eager users {{for the use of}} the technology, the areas of information and communications technology (ICT) acquire a leading role in the organizations due to the support and input that they provide. The constant and innovative growth of ICT generates in the organizations a difficult dynamic to align with their strategic objectives. This causes a gap among the strategy, the corporate objectives of the organization and the administration of IT services. In this article, a conceptual framework is proposed from a heuristic point of view concerning to the alignment of business processes with IT, using and modifying the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) of Henderson and Venkatraman in order to achieve a value chain implemented through requests and services with the aim of aligning the strategies of the Corporate Governance, Enterprise Governance and IT Governance.

In different forms, this dilemma for instructors {{has been a part}} of debates on education since Plato. However, it is fair to say that we remain far from a precise and sound scientific response. We believe this “Assistance Dilemma ” is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in the cognitive and learning sciences. To address this dilemma, we suggest a four step strategy for more clearly articulating the problem and tackling it with computational models that can be used to make precise, replicable, and testable predictions about when instructional assistance should be given vs. withheld. We illustrate these steps on two different dimensions of instructional assistance. On the “problem spacing ” dimension, we present a computational model that generates precise predictions of the kind we call for. On the more complex “example-problem ” dimension, we illustrate how the field is at a point where such a precise computational model may be possible...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{dominant}} discourse on knowledge management (KM), knowledge {{has been reduced}} to an ahistorical, immutable but mobile resource. In this process, it has fallen victim to a number of KM practices, such as documenting, disseminating, measuring, etc. It is assumed that such KM practices merely displace knowledge from one mode of symbolising to another, without intervening in its content, which is assumed to be something other than those practices. This paper, on the contrary, views knowledge as a contingent, open-ended outcome of those very KM practices. Following Foucault's notion of discourse, it is argued that organisational knowledge is formed discursively, whereby KM practices are constitutive of knowledge. To illustrate these ideas, a body of material has been drawn from six firms that have outsourced (parts of) their information technology (henceforth IT) in the hope of focusing their attention on their core business, gaining access to the supplier's fund of expert knowledge, and so on. However, in practising IT outsourcing, a specific way of knowing the different areas of IT developed discursively and contextually, which has both amplifying and reducing effects. Hoping {{to get rid of the}} IT 'headache', senior managers found themselves increasingly entangled in the bureaucratic practices of documenting IT matters, ensnared in the daily problems of assessing the worth of every separate <b>IT</b> <b>request</b> and being made responsible for its outcomes. This is because the hustle and bustle of IT activities is now captured in a representational form that can be taken into the office for calculation, tabulation and deliberation. The emerging form of knowledge is geared not only towards solving problems associated with managing IT, but also towards constructing those very problems. Knowledge is always an unfinished project, always catering for its own failure. It is not a terminal point, but is always in a process of becoming.

30|$|The {{data for}} the {{analysis}} were drawn from STEPI (the Science and Technology Policy Institute) to support Korean policymakers {{in an effort to}} enhance national competitiveness. STEPI covers a wide range of Korean manufacturing firms in all industry sectors. The survey used here was implemented in 2008 and was based on a manual (a set of integral guidelines for the collection of innovation data; see OECD, 2005) [17]. The Oslo manual distinguishes innovation as either based on a product, process, organization or marketing innovation [17, 53]. Oslo manual is technology innovation guideline for small business [17]. This guideline contains seven characteristics: objectives and scope of manual, needs for the measurement of innovation, basic definitions, TPP innovation activities, institutional classification, measuring aspects of the innovation process, measuring the expenditure on innovation, and survey procedures [17]. We selected product innovation, as it is related to the development of new products and services. Respondents had to be employed in their current jobs for at least 5  years and involved in open innovation. Our sample targeted manufacturing SMEs with no more than 500 employees, and data was collected from 2005 to 2007. The sample contains manufacturing SMEs that tried to achieve product innovation through technology-exploration activities during the 3  years prior to the survey. Our final sample contains 1044 firms that remained in the survey for the 3  years. By analyzing data from STEPI’s ‘Technology Innovativeness Activity Report in 2008 ’, the survey questionnaire separates into two groups as high and low using 0 and 1 in collected samples. The survey questionnaire binary asks “Did you launch following product innovation for last 3  years (2005 – 2007) in the market?” and <b>it</b> <b>request</b> to select out of three criterions which are: 1. Launch new product completely differs from existing product, 2. Launch highly improved product compared to existing product, and 3. None of these are applicable. Criterion number 1 interprets ‘high’ product innovation performance; number 2 interprets ‘low’ product innovation performance, and number 3 interprets insignificant. We defined these criterions as dummy variables. If respondents answered ‘yes’, either criterion 1 or 2, then it values ‘ 1 ’, and if they answered ‘no’, either criterion 1 or 2, then it values ‘ 0 ’. We rejected answers such as ‘no’ for all criterions because the data is insignificant for analyzing this research. Thus, by filtering and interpreting respondents’ data based STEPI’s survey; we could separate and define High and Low product innovation performance measurement and innovated manufacturers.|$|E
