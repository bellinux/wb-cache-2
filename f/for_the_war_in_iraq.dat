500|$|Bush's {{approval}} rating went below the 50percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004. Thereafter, his {{approval rating}}s and approval of {{his handling of}} {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies. There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action. The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, the Bush administration's justification <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions. Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment {{on the floor of the}} House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared that impeachment was [...] "off the table".|$|E
