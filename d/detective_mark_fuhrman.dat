25|$|Detectives went to Simpson's Rockingham {{estate to}} inform {{him that his}} ex-wife had been murdered. In {{the back of his}} home, they found some blood {{scattered}} all over on a white Ford Bronco. <b>Detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances—specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to Chicago late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found under the bed at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the incriminating {{evidence}} — bloody glove, bloody socks, blood in {{and on the}} Bronco — was discovered by Los Angeles Police <b>Detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman.</b> He was later charged with perjury for falsely claiming during the trial {{that he had not}} used the word [...] "nigger" [...] within 10 years of the trial. Later during the trial, with the jury absent, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination when asked [...] "did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?" [...] In a 2016 interview, defense attorney Alan Dershowitz suggested that Detective Philip Vannatter (not Detective Fuhrman) may have planted evidence on socks, based upon the presence of anti-coagulant in the blood discovered on the socks. Dershowitz said that the jury may have concluded that if the bloody socks evidence was fabricated by the police, then other evidence may have been fabricated as well. F.B.I. expert testimony said that the defense exaggerated the significance of the presence of the anti-coagulant.|$|E

50|$|Bugliosi writes {{at length}} about the {{allegations}} that LAPD <b>detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> had planted a bloody glove in order to frame Simpson.

Bugliosi points out that it was highly improbable that Fuhrman or anyone else involved in the case would have tried to frame Simpson, as California law at the time provided that anyone who planted evidence in a death penalty case could have faced the death penalty themselves (though prosecutors ultimately did not seek the death penalty).|$|E

50|$|A key {{piece of}} {{evidence}} against Simpson {{was a pair of}} bloody gloves, one found at the crime scene and the other near a guest house at his mansion. DNA tests matched the blood on both to the victims. Simpson's lawyers alleged that the glove found at his home had actually been with its mate at the crime scene, where LAPD <b>detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> hid it in his sock and planted it in Simpson's yard during a search of the latter. They also raised questions about how the gloves were handled and processed by the LAPD crime lab, suggesting some of the blood was planted at that stage of the investigation as well.|$|E

Darden was also tasked by Clark to prepare for testimony, among others, <b>Detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman.</b> After Hodgman's medical incapacitation shortly before opening statements, Darden was named co-prosecutor.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1995 {{murder trial}} of O. J. Simpson, the defense argued that Los Angeles Police Department <b>detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> had planted {{evidence}} at the crime scene. Although Fuhrman denied the allegations, Simpson was found not guilty, although he was later held liable for the deaths in a civil suit filed by {{the families of the}} victims. In USA Today (August 24, 1995), Francis Fukuyama stated, [...] "defenses lead to a distrust of government and the belief that public authorities are in a vast conspiracy to violate the rights of individuals." [...] However, such misconduct may actually be widespread in the United States. [...] "It’s a result-oriented process today, fairness be damned," [...] Robert Merkle, former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida, said. Prosecutors are protected from civil liability even when they knowingly and maliciously break the law in order to secure convictions, and the doctrine of harmless error can be used by appellate courts to uphold convictions despite such illegal tactics, which some argue gives prosecutors few incentives to comply with the law.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Apologia is {{a rhetorical}} genre of self-defense. As such, apologetic {{discourse}} involves {{a response to}} an attack upon an individual's character or worth as a human being. Los Angeles Police <b>Detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> encountered such a attack during the 0. J. Simpson murder trial. The purpose of this analysis is {{to determine whether the}} rhetorical strategies indicative of apologia are used to perform masculine facework in Mark Fuhrman's Murder In Brentwood. By means of critical analysis, apologia can be established as a masculine face-saving strategy. The analysis takes place in two stages. First, the connection between facework and apologia is established. The four strategies of Hodgins, Liebeskind, and Schwartz (1996), Sandra Petronio's examples of defensive strategies, and three strategies in William L. Benoit's (1995) typology of image restoration strategies provide the first two units of analyses. Second, questions gleaned from the research of Noreen Kruse (1977) determined the topics to which Fuhrman devotes the most time in his discourse and the motivational drives that shape that discourse. By integrating the findings of both analyses, the masculine face Fuhrman endeavors to save emerges...|$|E
40|$|Two {{events in}} September 1995 gave the public a brief glimpse of law {{enforcement}} officers asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege. In the 2 ̆ 2 trial of the century, 2 ̆ 2 Los Angeles Police Department <b>Detective</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> asserted the privilege during the O. J. Simpson murder trial {{in response to questions}} concerning whether he planted evidence or provided truthful testimony. A week later, an FBI agent asserted the privilege in response to a Senate committee 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry concerning the shootout at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. These highly publicized exercises of the privilege are rare. For the most part, invocations of the privilege by the police are a regular occurrence outside the scope of public scrutiny. At this real-world crossing, two basic tenets of constitutional democracy intersect - control of government and preservation of liberty. On the one hand, the people need to regulate the state, especially when it is empowered to take human life. On the other hand, civil liberties must be safeguarded, even when those who claim them stand in the shoes of the state. At this juncture, however, we seem to return to the Twilight Zone. For, it may be asked, how can we both control the state and, at the same time, grant its agents constitutional protection? Before we get to this question, it is necessary to first understand just how much and what kind of official latitude we allow the state {{when it comes to the}} sanctioned use of deadly force by police officials. Having done that, we can then consider the character and scope of certain constitutional claims sometimes invoked by police officers in this context. This latter consideration - the central focus of this article - points to a peculiar phenomenon, namely, the specter of government acting as a powerful deputy authorized to use lethal force and as a powerless individual in need of constitutional safeguards. Typically, we do not think of the government wearing both hats. Yet, when it does, the result is often perplexing. Having thus introduced this perplexity, it is now appropriate to return to a preliminary but nevertheless significant matter - official use of deadly force in America...|$|E

[...] His famous cross-examination of Fuhrman is {{considered by many to be}} the key to Simpson's acquittal. In front of a jury composed predominantly of people of color, Bailey got the detective to claim, [...] "marine to marine", he never used the word nigger to describe blacks at any time during the previous ten years, a claim the defense team easily found evidence to refute. Ultimately, the statement that Bailey drew from the detective forced Fuhrman to plead the Fifth in his next courtroom appearance, thereby undermining his credibility with the jury and the otherwise devastating evidence he allegedly found. Bailey also attracted minor attention for keeping a silver flask on the defense table, which fellow defense attorney Robert Kardashian claimed contained only coffee.|$|R
