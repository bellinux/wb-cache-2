2500|$|Plato’s Problem was {{expressed}} generally by Bertrand Russell: [...] "How comes it that human beings, whose {{contacts with the}} world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to {{know as much as}} they do know?" [...] The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next.

2500|$|In 2002, Paltrow made small {{appearances}} in the documentary Searching for Debra Winger and the action satire comedy Austin Powers in Goldmember, while she starred in the thriller-drama Possession with Aaron Eckhart as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two Victorian poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection. Critically panned, the film made a lukewarm US$14.8 million worldwide. In the following year, she headlined the romantic comedy View from the Top, where she obtained the part of woman {{from a small town}} who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Budgeted at US$30 million, the film only earned US$7 million in its opening weekend; it eventually grossed US$15.6 domestically and US$19,526,014 worldwide. She herself later disparaged the film, calling it [...] "terrible". Paltrow starred as the titular role in Sylvia (2003), a British biographical drama directed by Christine Jeffs and co-starring Daniel Craig chronicling the romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Distributed for a limited release in most markets, Sylvia made US$2.9 million internationally. The New York Times, in its review for the film, wrote that [...] "her performance <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> mimicry. She has a vivid, passionate presence, even when her lively features have gone slack with depression and her bright blue eyes have glazed over".|$|E

[...] Spin gave the album eight out of ten stars. The review said, [...] "Sometimes it's easier to string together some power chords and a few forlorn references to religion, fame and suicide than to actually write songs. And sometimes that's just fine." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A-. Browne said that [...] "the album has a spontaneous, bang-it-out casualness that is, to say the least, extremely rare for a rock veteran." [...] However, Browne criticized the album's lyrics, calling them [...] "mostly jumbled rehashes of standard Young imagery." [...] Time reviewer Christopher John Farley said that [...] "Pearl Jam serves as an extraordinary backup band on the new album." [...] Farley added that the album is [...] "one of the most consistently rewarding works of Young's long rewarding career." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, 10 to 20 {{percent of}} people with breast cancer and people with ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree {{relative}} {{with one of these}} diseases. [...] The familial tendency to develop these cancers is called hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndrome. [...] The best known of these, the BRCA mutations, confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent. [...] Some mutations associated with cancer, such as p53, BRCA1 and BRCA2, occur in mechanisms to correct errors in DNA. These mutations are either inherited or acquired after birth. Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs. However, there is strong evidence of residual risk variation that <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> <b>beyond</b> hereditary BRCA gene mutations between carrier families. [...] This is caused by unobserved risk factors. [...] This implicates environmental and other causes as triggers for breast cancers. [...] The inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes can interfere with repair of DNA cross links and DNA double strand breaks (known functions of the encoded protein). [...] These carcinogens cause DNA damage such as DNA cross links and double strand breaks that often require repairs by pathways containing BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, mutations in BRCA genes account for only 2 to 3 percent of all breast cancers. [...] Levin et al. say that cancer may not be inevitable for all carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. About half of hereditary breast–ovarian cancer syndromes involve unknown genes.|$|E
