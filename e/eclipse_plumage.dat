5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} {{scalloped}} and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (<b>eclipse)</b> <b>plumage,</b> the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are {{more likely to engage in}} this behaviour than are those breeding in <b>eclipse</b> <b>plumage.</b> As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6â€“10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding <b>eclipse</b> <b>plumage</b> at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult male}} is all shiny black {{but for a}} white {{shoulders}} (scapulars) - unlike the better-known Australian fairywrens there is no <b>eclipse</b> male <b>plumage.</b> The tail is shorter than other fairywrens. The bill is black, and the feet and eyes are black or dark brown. The female of subspecies alboscapulatus and naimii bears a pied plumage, with black upperparts, white shoulders and underparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{males in}} {{breeding}} plumage have black back and wings, with a rufous brest. Head is black, with a chestnut nape {{and a black}} bill. The dual-length ornamental tail feathers are black. These tail feathers can reach a length of 195 - 244 mm and a width of 24 - 32 mm. Feet are dark grayish. When in <b>eclipse</b> (non-breeding) <b>plumage,</b> the males {{are similar to the}} hen, as they are tawny above with narrow mantle streaking. In females a dark line extends behind the eye. Also juveniles are quite to the hens.|$|R
40|$|Spur-winged Goose Muscovy Duck White-winged Wood Duck Comb Duck Hartlaub Duck Green Pygmy Goose Cotton Pygmy Goose African Pygmy Goose Ringed Teal North American Wood Duck Mandarin Duck Australian Wood Duck Brazilian Teal This {{group of}} 13 species of {{primarily}} perching waterfowl {{is a rather}} heterogeneous assemblage of birds that are not easily characterized. In addition to being generally perching and cavity-nesting, they also have fairly wide, rounded wings, elongated tails, and sometimes also relatively long legs. Many of the species exhibit {{a great deal of}} iridescent coloration in their plumage, even among females, and in a few species nearly the entire body plumage is iridescent. In some of these brilliantly colored forms, such as the comb duck, muscovy duck, and the spur-winged goose, there is a great difference in the sizes of the sexes even though they may be very similar in plumage patterning. In spite of their brilliant plumages, males of {{only a few of the}} species exhibit definite <b>eclipse</b> <b>plumages,</b> probably in part because most of the forms are tropical, with long or irregular breeding seasons. Pair bonding is generally seasonally established in the species that breed in temperate climates, while in the more tropical and seemingly more primitive species the pair bonds are weak and in a few cases apparently even nonexistent. The patterns of the downy young are typically well marked and characterized by white or yellow spots and stripes on a darker background; in many species they are not readily separable from the downy young of dabbling ducks. The two tribes are obviously closely related, and taxonomists are not agreed on which group some species such as the ringed teal, pink-eared duck, and Brazilian teal should be included in. However, to merge the tribes would make a comparatively large tribe and tend to obscure the well-defined differences in the behavior patterns and breeding biologies of these two groups...|$|R
25|$|The drake's bill is dark grey, in <b>eclipse</b> <b>plumage</b> {{often with}} some light greenish or {{brownish}} hue at the base. The bill of hens and immatures is pinkish or yellowish at the base, becoming dark grey towards the tip; the grey expands basewards as the birds age. The feet are dark grey in males and greyish olive or greyish-brown in females and immatures. The iris is always brown.|$|E
25|$|Males in nuptial plumage are {{distinguished}} from green-winged teals by the horizontal white scapular stripe, {{the lack of}} a vertical white bar at the breast sides, and the quite conspicuous light outlines of the face patch, which are indistinct in the green-winged teal drake. Males in <b>eclipse</b> <b>plumage,</b> females and immatures are best recognised by their small size, calls, and the speculum; they are hard to tell apart from the green-winged teal however.|$|E
25|$|In non-breeding (<b>eclipse)</b> <b>plumage,</b> the drake {{looks more}} like the hen; it is more uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, {{somewhat}} darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks {{on the head and}} neck, and scaly spots {{on the rest of the}} body; overall they look much like a tiny mallard (A. platyrhynchos) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking.|$|E
50|$|Male in {{breeding}} plumage is glossy blackish green crown, with white head, neck, and underparts; a prominent black collar and white wing-bar. Rounded head and short legs. In flight, the wings are green {{with a white}} band, making the male conspicuous even amongst the huge flying flocks of the lesser whistling duck, which share the habitat. Female paler, without either black collar and only a narrow or nonexistent strip of white wing-bar. In non-breeding <b>plumage</b> (<b>eclipse)</b> male resembles female except for his white wing-bar. Flocks on water bodies (jheels), etc.|$|R
40|$|The dabbling ducks grade {{almost imperceptibly}} into the pochard group {{considered}} here, and whether Marmaronetta and Rhodonessa {{should be included}} in one tribe or the other may be open to some question. As here constituted, the tribe includes 16 species of almost world-wide distribution which differ from the preceding group in several minor details. The hind toe has a larger lobe than occurs in the dabbling ducks, and it presumably aids in diving. The feet are also correspondingly larger and are set farther apart and more to the rear than in Anas. One of the most clear-cut differences is in the tracheal structure of the male. Instead of a rounded and entirely osseous tracheal bulla such as occurs in Anas, the bulla is larger, rather angular, and contains several membranceous fenestrae of varying sizes. Although the bulla structure of Netta and Aythya is strikingly {{different from that of the}} Anas, the genera Marmaronetta and Rhodonessa provide such perfect intermediate stages that the evolutionary development of this structure is very clear. In addition, the tracheal tube of males of nearly all species (Aythya novae-seelandiae and A. collaris are apparently exceptions) varies in diameter and is enlarged toward the middle. Unlike the typical dabbling ducks, none of these species have metallic-colored specula, and metallic coloration is restricted to the head plumage of the males of some species. Although some species (especially Rhodonessa and Netta) frequently feed on the surface, all species dive well and typically do not open their wings when submerging. Most species are predominantly vegetarian, but the scauplike ducks tend to consume a high proportion of animal material. Nests may be built on land, usually near water, or on reed beds over the water surface, and females lack the disruptively marked plumage pattern typical of female dabbling ducks. Downy young tend to lack eye stripes and cheek marks, and also generally have reduced back spotting. Most if not all species become sexually mature during the first year; the scauplike ducks may take slightly longer. All species exhibit sexual dimorphism in plumage and/or soft- art coloration, and nearly all species have distinct <b>eclipse</b> <b>plumages.</b> Although metallic-colored specula are absent, the secondaries have a contrasting white pattern in many species...|$|R
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an <b>eclipse</b> non-breeding <b>plumage.</b> They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so {{may be even more}} prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|R

500|$|The splendid fairywren is a small, long-tailed bird [...] long. Exhibiting a {{high degree}} of sexual dimorphism, the {{breeding}} male is distinctive with a bright blue forehead and ear coverts, a violet throat and deeper rich blue back wings, chest and tail with a black bill, eye band and chest band. The blue breeding plumage of the male {{is often referred to as}} nuptial plumage. The non-breeding male is brown with blue in the wings and a bluish tail. The female resembles the non-breeding male but has a chestnut bill and eye-patch. Immature males will moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though this may be incomplete with residual brownish plumage and may take another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an <b>eclipse</b> non-breeding <b>plumage.</b> They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Some older males have remained blue all year, moulting directly from one year's nuptial plumage to the next.

The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum. The call is described as a gushing reel; this is harsher and louder than other fairywrens and varies from individual to individual. A soft single trrt serves as a contact call within a foraging group, while the alarm call is a tsit. Cuckoos and other intruders may be greeted with a threat posture and churring threat.
