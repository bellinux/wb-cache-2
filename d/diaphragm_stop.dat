[...] Boston UniversityThis thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation of}} Berekt's method of third order lens design as applied {{to the design of}} a flat field, photographic triplet. The fields of photographic triplets are usually flattened artificially by adjustment of the astigmatic image surfaces. This process results in degraded image definition in the zonal area of the film plane. The degree of degradation depends primarily upon the original curvature of the Petzval surface with which the astigmatic surfaces are intimately related. If the Petzval surface is steeply curved, then more degradation must be expected than if the Petzval surface is comparatively flat. Most photographic triplets have a Petzval surface whose radius is between two and three times as long as the focal length. The ratio of these radii (called Petzval ratio) chosen for this project was 5. 0, which is attained in the final thin lens solution. Use of the Berek basic equations is analyzed in detail. It is shown that with thirteen quantities involved in six equations, it is necessary to account for seven of them either as arbitrarily set values or as dependent variables, "leaving only six true variables for the solution of the basic equations. This accounting is made; and each of the thirteen quantities is identified as an arbitrarily set quantity, a dependent variable, or a true variable. The six basic equations include expressions for focal length, Petzval sum, oblique (lateral) and axial color correction, distortion, and overall lens thickness. The distortion expression {{is based on the assumption}} that the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>stop</b> coincides with the second element in the thin lens system. Oblique and lateral color are to be set equal to zero. These two assumptions are justified on the basis of convenience and the lack of any valid method of assigning advantageous residuals. The solution of the basic equations yields individual element powers, spacing, and the number ratio for the first and second elements. [Truncated...|$|E

All ejectives are voiceless, or at least transition from voiced to voiceless.|$|R
50|$|The Zunow SLR, {{which went}} on sale in 1958 (in Japan only), was the first 35mm SLR camera with an {{automatic}} <b>diaphragm,</b> which <b>stopped</b> down to the preselected aperture upon release of the shutter. (Although this invention had been anticipated by the 1954 Praktina FX-A which featured a semi-automatic <b>diaphragm,</b> which <b>stopped</b> down automatically, but had to be opened manually after the exposure.) The automatic diaphragm feature eliminated one downside to viewing with an SLR: the darkening of the viewfinder screen image when the photographer selected a small lens aperture. The Zunow Optical Company also supplied the Miranda Camera Company with lenses for their Miranda T SLR cameras.|$|R

50|$|More specifically, kappo {{refers to}} {{resuscitation}} techniques used to revive {{someone who has}} been choked to the point of unconsciousness, to lessen the pain of a strike to the groin, to help unlock a seized thoracic <b>diaphragm,</b> to <b>stop</b> a bleeding nose, and other common training injuries. These techniques, as practiced by the martial arts of Judo and Danzan Ryu, can involve striking specific points on the body, manual manipulation of the carotid triangle to open closed arteries, or manually opening and closing the lungs to allow air to flow in and out. The manual manipulation of breathing, which has some similarities with rescue breathing and CPR, is called katsu.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiffraction of {{symmetrical}} Laguerre–Gauss TEMp 0 beams {{incident on}} an opaque disk {{known as a}} stop is considered. The near- and far-field patterns are studied. Thanks to zero-field occluding, conversion from TEM 10 beam to dark hollow beam can be achieved with better efficiency than from a TEM 00 beam. It is shown that the fundamental mode of a laser cavity including a <b>diaphragm</b> and a <b>stop</b> can be TEM 00 - or TEM 10 -like in shape depending on their size. This result is interpreted from the new divergence hierarchy, which characterises the diffracted TEMp 0 beams emerging from the stop...|$|R
5000|$|A {{relatively}} small diameter booster unit is required; {{for a very}} conservative 50% manifold vacuum, an assisting force of about 1500 N (150 kgf) is produced by a 20 cm radius diaphragm with an area of 0.03 square meters. The <b>diaphragm</b> will <b>stop</b> moving when the forces {{on both sides of}} the chamber reach equilibrium. This can be caused by either the air valve closing (due to the pedal apply stopping) or if [...] "run out" [...] is reached. Run out occurs when the pressure in one chamber reaches atmospheric pressure and no additional force can be generated by the now stagnant differential pressure. After the run out point is reached, only the driver's foot force can be used to further apply the master cylinder piston. In some new models, in addition to providing functionality for ABS, Traction Control, and dynamic stability control, brake hydraulics are being used to augment braking when little or no vacuum is detected in the booster, or booster run-out is reached, or pre-applying the brakes if certain panic braking or wet driving conditions are detected.|$|R
50|$|Pufferfish can be lethal if not served properly. Puffer {{poisoning}} usually {{results from}} consumption of incorrectly prepared puffer soup, fugu chiri, or occasionally from raw puffer meat, sashimi fugu. While chiri {{is much more}} likely to cause death, sashimi fugu often causes intoxication, light-headedness, and numbness of the lips, and is often eaten for this reason. Pufferfish tetrodotoxin deadens the tongue and lips, and induces dizziness and vomiting, followed by numbness and prickling over the body, rapid heart rate, decreased blood pressure, and muscle paralysis. The toxin paralyzes <b>diaphragm</b> muscle and <b>stops</b> the person who has ingested it from breathing. People who live longer than 24 hours typically survive, although possibly after a coma lasting several days.|$|R
5000|$|In optics, a {{diaphragm}} {{is a thin}} opaque structure with an opening (aperture) at its center. The role of the <b>diaphragm</b> is to <b>stop</b> the passage of light, except for the light passing through the aperture. Thus it is also called a stop (an aperture stop, if it limits the brightness of light reaching the focal plane, or a field stop or flare stop for other uses of diaphragms in lenses). The diaphragm {{is placed in the}} light path of a lens or objective, {{and the size of the}} aperture regulates the amount of light that passes through the lens. The centre of the diaphragm's aperture coincides with the optical axis of the lens system.|$|R
40|$|For direct {{detection}} of faint exoplanets, high-contrast imagers would be indispensable for strongly suppressing central bright stars. In particular, extremely high contrast of 10 − 10 {{will be needed}} for detecting Earth-like planets. An eight-octant phase-mask (EOPM) coronagraph is one of promising concepts because of its high-contrast performance, small inner working angle, and simple optical configuration[1]. The EOPM divides a stellar image into eight-octant sectors and provides π-phase difference between adjacent sectors. Then a destructive interference occurs inside pupil area on a reimaged pupil plane, and the stellar light is totally diffracted outside the pupil area. The diffracted stellar light is blocked by a <b>diaphragm</b> called Lyot <b>stop.</b> On the other hand, a planetary image, formed at an off-axis position on th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vacuum booster}} or vacuum servo {{is used in}} most modern {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The vacuum booster is attached between the master cylinder and the brake pedal and multiplies the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the low-pressure portion of the throttle body or intake manifold of the engine, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the brake pedal is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the brake pedal is applied. When the brake pedal is applied, the movement opens an air valve which lets in atmospheric pressure air to one chamber of the booster. Since the pressure becomes higher in one chamber, the diaphragm moves toward the lower pressure chamber with a force created by {{the area of the}} diaphragm and the differential pressure. This force, in addition to the driver's foot force, pushes on the master cylinder piston. A relatively small diameter booster unit is required; for a very conservative 50% manifold vacuum, an assisting force of about 1500 N (200n) is produced by a 20 cm diaphragm with an area of 0.03 square meters. The <b>diaphragm</b> will <b>stop</b> moving when the forces {{on both sides of the}} chamber reach equilibrium. This can be caused by either the air valve closing (due to the pedal apply stopping) or if [...] "run out" [...] is reached. Run out occurs when the pressure in one chamber reaches atmospheric pressure and no additional force can be generated by the now stagnant differential pressure. After the run out point is reached, only the driver's foot force can be used to further apply the master cylinder piston.|$|R
