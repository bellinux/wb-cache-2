5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>frozen.</b> This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|Wary {{and quick}} to flee, leopard sharks pose almost no danger to humans. There {{is a single}} record from 1955 of a leopard shark harassing a skin diver with a nosebleed, though no {{injuries}} resulted. This species is caught by commercial fisheries using gillnets and longlines, and by recreational anglers and spearfishers; it is also caught as bycatch in bottom trawls. The meat is considered excellent eating and is sold <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>frozen.</b> However, leopard sharks living alongside human development may accumulate pollutants such as mercury, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within their bodies, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife warns against eating them regularly. The leopard shark is prized by the aquarium trade for its attractive appearance and hardiness; this led to many newborn pups being captured with hook-and-line off southern California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It may live for over 20 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and {{has been}} {{displayed}} in public aquariums. It is frequently caught by recreational anglers from shore or ski-boats; it is edible but rarely eaten. Small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal longline fishery targeting the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) in the Gansbaai and False Bay region. The meat from sharks caught in the fishery is either made into biltong or jerky and sold locally, or exported <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>frozen</b> to Italy and Taiwan. Although in South Africa the sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species and thus cannot be harvested commercially, it is often mistaken for the common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) by fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sharptooth houndshark as Near Threatened. This species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure, due to its restricted range, slow growth rate, and low fecundity. The fact that most sharks caught by fishers are immature is an additional source of concern.|$|E

50|$|A-ration is a {{term used}} in the United States armed forces for a meal {{provided}} to troops which is prepared using <b>fresh,</b> refrigerated, <b>or</b> <b>frozen</b> foods. The use of <b>fresh,</b> refrigerated <b>or</b> <b>frozen</b> foods distinguish 'A' rations from 'B' rations, which use canned or preserved ingredients {{to enable them to}} be served without adequate refrigeration or freezer facilities. 'A' ration meals may be served in dining facilities ("DFAC"), prepared in the field by the use of field kitchens, or prepared at a fixed facility and transported to field locations in containers.|$|R
50|$|The Okhotsk atka {{mackerel}} {{is an important}} fish in Japanese cuisine. Known as hokke in Japanese, the fish can be <b>fresh,</b> dried, <b>or</b> <b>frozen,</b> and can be served raw, boiled, grilled or fried.|$|R
25|$|In Bangladesh taro is a {{very popular}} {{vegetable}} known as kochu (কচু) or mukhi (মুখি). It is usually cooked with small prawns or the ilish fish into a curry, but some dishes are cooked with dried fish. Its green leaves, kochu pata (কচু পাতা), and stem, kochu (কচু), are also eaten as a favourite dish and usually ground to a paste or finely chopped to make shak – {{but it must be}} boiled well beforehand. Taro stolons or stems, kochur loti (কচুর লতি), are also favoured by Bangladeshis and cooked with shrimps, dried fish or the head of the ilish fish. Taro is available, either <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>frozen,</b> in the UK and US in most Asian stores and supermarkets specialising in Bangladeshi or South Asian food. Also, another variety called maan kochu is consumed and is a rich source of vitamins and nutrients. Maan Kochu is pasted and fried to prepare a delicious food known as Kochu Bata.|$|E
500|$|Poultry is {{available}} <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>frozen,</b> as whole birds or as joints (cuts), bone-in or deboned, seasoned in various ways, raw or ready cooked. The meatiest {{parts of a}} bird are the flight muscles on its chest, called [...] "breast" [...] meat, and the walking muscles on the legs, called the [...] "thigh" [...] and [...] "drumstick". The wings are also eaten (Buffalo wings are a popular example in the United States) and may be split into three segments, the meatier [...] "drumette", the [...] "wingette" [...] (also called the [...] "flat"), and the wing tip (also called the [...] "flapper"). In Japan, the wing is frequently separated, and these parts {{are referred to as}} 手羽元 (teba-moto [...] "wing base") and 手羽先 (teba-saki [...] "wing tip").|$|E
2500|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} {{is a dark}} fleshed species of fair eating quality. The species is marketed {{in a variety of}} ways apart from being sold <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>frozen</b> at market. The yellowstripe scad is {{commonly}} used as a dried fish snack in Asian countries, processed either by salting, curing or mechanical drying, with extensive trials on the optimum conditions and chemical agents for production. The yellowtail scad has also been part of trials into use as fish powder, with a high protein content considered to make the species a candidate. The fat content of the powder can be reduced by treatment, but this negatively affects solubility and other properties. With high lipid and myoglobin content, the species has been considered a poor candidate for surimi (seafood sticks) in the past, however experiments with heating of the surimi gel have shown that this can improve its properties and make it more cohesive.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tumor touch {{imprints}} (TTIs) {{are routinely}} {{used for the}} molecular diagnosis of neuroblastomas by interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (I-FISH). However, {{in order to facilitate}} a comprehensive, up-to-date molecular diagnosis of neuroblastomas and to identify new markers to refine risk and therapy stratification methods, whole genome approaches are needed. We examined the applicability of an ultra-high density SNP array platform that identifies copy number changes of varying sizes down to a few exons for the detection of genomic changes in tumor DNA extracted from TTIs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DNAs were extracted from TTIs of 46 neuroblastoma and 4 other pediatric tumors. The DNAs were analyzed on the Cytoscan HD SNP array platform to evaluate numerical and structural genomic aberrations. The quality of the data obtained from TTIs was compared to that from randomly chosen <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> solid tumors (n = 212) and I-FISH validation was performed. RESULTS: SNP array profiles were obtained from 48 (out of 50) TTI DNAs of which 47 showed genomic aberrations. The high marker density allowed for single gene analysis, e. g. loss of nine exons in the ATRX gene and the visualization of chromothripsis. Data quality was comparable to <b>fresh</b> <b>or</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>frozen</b> tumor SNP profiles. SNP array results were confirmed by I-FISH. CONCLUSION: TTIs are an excellent source for SNP array processing with the advantage of simple handling, distribution and storage of tumor tissue on glass slides. The minimal amount of tumor tissue needed to analyze whole genomes makes TTIs an economic surrogate source in the molecular diagnostic work up of tumor samples...|$|R
