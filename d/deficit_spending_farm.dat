25|$|During {{his first}} term in the Senate, Taft criticized what he {{believed}} was the inefficiency and waste of many New Deal programs and {{of the need to}} let private enterprise and businesses restore the nation's economy instead of relying upon government programs to end the Great Depression. He condemned the New Deal as socialist and attacked <b>deficit</b> <b>spending,</b> high <b>farm</b> subsidies, governmental bureaucracy, the National Labor Relations Board, and nationalized health insurance. However, he did not always follow conservative ideology; for instance, after investigating the lack of adequate housing in the nation, he supported public housing programs. He also supported federal aid to the states to fund public schools.|$|R
50|$|Also, for Ricardian {{equivalence}} to apply, the <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> {{would have}} to be permanent. In contrast, a one-time stimulus through <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> would suggest a lesser tax burden annually than the one-time deficit expenditure. Thus temporary <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> is still expansionary. Empirical evidence on Ricardian equivalence effects has been mixed.|$|R

50|$|The {{contemporary}} Post-Keynesian monetary economic {{school of}} Neo-Chartalism, which advocates government <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> to yield full employment, is attacked as inflationist, with critics arguing that such <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> inevitably leads to hyperinflation.

40|$|Ordinary Keynesian {{spending}} policy means government's <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> {{for public}} goods.

However, if we can put two new factors into <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> policy, namely tax iocrease right after <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> and spending for private goods. {{we will be able}} to open a new possibility of more government spending and therefore increase aggregate demand. But this is a tbeoretical possibility and if we want to put it into practice, we need a new political consensus for this policy. To know the probability ov such consensus we need further study on people's willingness to accept a new income inequality which results from this policy...|$|R

50|$|Contrary to some {{critical}} characterizations of it, Keynesianism does not consist solely of <b>deficit</b> <b>spending.</b> Keynesianism recommends counter-cyclical policies.

Classical economics, on the other hand, argues that one should cut taxes when there are budget surpluses, and cut spending - or, less likely, increase taxes - during economic downturns.|$|R

5000|$|Finally, {{another example}} of fiscal {{illusion}} {{may be seen in}} <b>deficit</b> <b>spending.</b> CATO Institute economist William Niskanen (2004), for instance, has noted that the [...] "starve the beast" [...] strategy popular among US conservatives wherein tax cuts now force a future reduction in federal government spending is empirically false. Instead, he has found that there is 'a strong negative relation between the relative level of federal spending and tax revenues'. Tax cuts and <b>deficit</b> <b>spending,</b> he argues, make the cost of government appear to be cheaper than it otherwise would be.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effectiveness of}} fiscal policy at zero nominal interest rates. I analyze a stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices and rational expectations and assume that the government cannot commit to future policy. Real government spending increases demand by increasing public consumption. <b>Deficit</b> <b>spending</b> increases demand by generating inflation expectations. I derive fiscal spending multipliers that calculate how much output increases for each dollar of government <b>spending</b> (real or <b>deficit).</b> Under monetary and fiscal policy coordination, the real spending multiplier is 3. 4 and the <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> multiplier is 3. 8. However, {{when there is no}} policy coordination, that is, when the central bank is "goal independent," the real spending multiplier is unchanged but the <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> multiplier is zero. Coordination failure may explain why fiscal policy in Japan has been relatively less effective in recent years than during the Great Depression.

50|$|Some Post-Keynesian economists {{argue that}} <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> is necessary, either {{to create the}} money supply (Chartalism) or to satisfy demand for savings in excess {{of what can be}} {{satisfied}} by private investment.|$|R
50|$|Continuing in this vein, Chartalists {{argue that}} a {{structural}} deficit is necessary for monetary expansion in an expanding economy: if the economy grows, the money supply should as well, which should be accomplished by government <b>deficit</b> <b>spending.</b> Private sector savings are equal to government sector deficits, to the penny. In the absence of sufficient <b>deficit</b> <b>spending,</b> money supply can increase by increasing financial leverage in the economy—the amount of bank money grows, while the base money supply remains unchanged or grows at a slower rate, and thus the ratio (leverage = credit/base) increases—which {{can lead to a}} credit bubble and a financial crisis.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a general}} {{equilibrium}} model, this study finds that real output in Estonia is {{positively associated with}} real quantity of money and negatively influenced by real depreciation of the kroon, real stock prices, and the expected inflation rate.

Policy implications are that fiscal discipline pursued by the Estonian government is appropriate, that a stronger currency may better serve Estonia, and that the wealth effect of an increase in the stock price on real money balances is greater than the substitution effect. wealth effect, substitution effect, stock prices, real depreciation, <b>deficit</b> <b>spending...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the robustness of the theory that claims restrictive effects of expansionary fiscal policy.

The paper demonstrates this conclusion through a stylized model – supported by an empirical investigation on ECB and FED reaction functions – in which Central Banks consider <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> as an element that generates inflation expectations. Econometric analysis also shows that the ECB reacts asymmetrically to <b>deficit</b> <b>spending</b> variations while the FED has a linear reaction to this indicator. ...|$|R
