30|$|How can {{a country}} acquire an {{increasing}} returns economic structure? Growth-enhancing structural changes are observed when <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> production are adequately {{enforced by the}} state (Khan 2010). Following Reinert (2007), our theoretical framework makes the distinction between <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> production (industrial polices: tariffs, subsidies, etc.,) and <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> exchange (property rights, rule of law, etc.,). It is obvious that without some minimal {{rule of law and}} some form of property ownership production will not be undertaken. It follows that <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> exchange have non-trivial effects on production. However, <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> exchange do not guarantee production or the production of goods with increasing returns. <b>Institutions</b> <b>of</b> exchange are at best necessary conditions but insufficient alone to generate production. Government subsidies and tax breaks when applied appropriately can have direct effects on production levels and incentivize the production of certain goods over others.|$|R
