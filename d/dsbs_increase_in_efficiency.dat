50|$|Additional {{modifications}} have {{targeted the}} aromatic chromophore. Specifically, multiple studies {{have confirmed that}} the use of a 2,6-dinitrobenzyl PPG increases reaction yield. Additionally, depending on the leaving group, the presence of a second nitro-group may nearly quadruple the quantum yield (e.g. Φ = 0.033 to Φ = 0.12 when releasing a carbonate at 365 nm). While one may credit the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> to the electronic effects of the second nitro group, this is not the case. Analogous systems with a 2-cyano-6-nitrobenzyl PPG exhibit similar electron-withdrawing effects, but do not provide such a large <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Therefore, the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> is likely due to the increased probability of achieving the aci-nitro state; with two nitro groups, an incoming photon will be twice as likely to promote the compound into an excited state.|$|R

The two key mechanisms explaining the results are: (i) a government owner keeping control can affect long-run employment levels when investing and (ii) a privatizing government has a stronger incentive to invest than an acquiring firm: the government exploits the fact that investments increase the sales price not only due to the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the acquirer’s profit, but also due to a reduced profit for the non-acquirer...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSomatic {{hypermutation}} (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes {{appears to}} involve the generation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and their error-prone repair. Here we show that DSBs occur at a high frequency in unrearranged (germline) Ig variable (V) genes, BCL 6 and c-MYC. These DSBs are blunt, target the mutational RGYW/RGY hotspot, and would be resolved through nonhomologous end-joining, {{as indicated by the}} presence of Ku 70 /Ku 86 on these DNA ends.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} privatization on hospital <b>efficiency</b> <b>in</b> Germany. To do so, we obtained bootstrapped DEA <b>efficiency</b> scores <b>in</b> {{the first stage of}} our analysis and subsequently employed a difference-in-difference matching approach within a panel regression framework. Our findings show that conversions from public to private for-profit status were associated with an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> of between 3. 2 and 5. 4 %. We defined four alternative post- privatization periods and found that the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> after a conversion to private for- profit status appeared to be permanent. We also observed an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> one year after hospitals were converted to private non-profit status, but our estimations suggest that this effect was transitory. Our findings also show that the efficiency gains after a conversion to private for-profit status were achieved through substantial decreases in staffing ratios in all analyzed staff categories with the exception of physicians. It was also striking that the efficiency gains of hospitals converted to for-profit status were significantly lower in the DRG era than in the pre-DRG era. Altogether, our results suggest that converting hospitals to private for-profit status may be an effective way to ensure the scarce resources in the hospital sector are used more efficiently.
