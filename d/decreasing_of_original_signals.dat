In this application there is a specific requirement that the harmonic content <b>of</b> the <b>original</b> <b>signal</b> be preserved without creating aliased harmonic content <b>of</b> the <b>original</b> <b>signal</b> above the <b>original</b> Nyquist limit <b>of</b> the signal (i.e., above fs/2 <b>of</b> the <b>original</b> <b>signal</b> sample rate).

The {{pulse broadening}} caused by atmospheric dispersion is very significant when pulsewidth is on the order of 5 ps, and pulse broadening is negligible if the pulsewidth is larger than 20 ps. With the increment of optical wavelength, atmospheric dispersion-induced pulse broadening is mitigated. The received pulsewidth is dominated mainly by dispersion-induced pulse broadening at small duty ratio <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>signal,</b> and <b>original</b> pulsewidth at large duty ratio <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>signal</b> respectively. By selecting proper duty ratio of optical pulse, the received pulsewidth can be minimized and the system bit rate can be maximized. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
