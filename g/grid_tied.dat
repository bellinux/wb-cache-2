40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{common mode}} voltage analysis of single phase grid connected photovoltaic inverter. Many researchers proposed different <b>grid</b> <b>tie</b> inverters for applications like domestic powering, street lighting, water pumping, cooling and heating applications, however traditional <b>grid</b> <b>tie</b> PV inverter uses either a line frequency or a high frequency transformer between the inverter and grid but losses will increase in the network leading to reduced efficiency of the system. In order to increase the efficiency, with reduced size and cost of the system, the effective solution is to remove the isolation transformer. But common mode (CM) ground leakage current due to parasitic capacitance between the PV panels and the ground making the system unreliable. The common mode current reduces the efficiency of power conversion stage, affects the quality of grid current, deteriorate the electric magnetic compatibility and give rise to the safety threats. In order to eliminate the common mode leakage current in Transformerless PV systm two control algorithms of multi-carrier pwm are implemented and compared for performance analysis. The shoot-through issue that is encountered by traditional voltage source inverter is analyzed for enhanced system reliability. These control algorithms are compared for {{common mode voltage}} and THD comparisons. The proposed system is designed using MATLAB/SIMULINK software for analysis. </p...|$|R

40|$|PV based {{distributed}} generation (DG) systems {{must have some}} electrical connection standards while they connected to an electrical grid. One of these electrical conditions {{and the most important}} one is unplanned islanding condition. Islanding is a very dangerous condition because it could damage the PV system and related electrical systems and also working people have been at risk in islanding condition. In this application study, a new communication based islanding detection method was introduced for <b>grid</b> <b>tied</b> PV systems. A real time controller was developed with Labview for detecting islanding condition. Developed method is a hybrid method which uses the effective ways of communication based and passive methods. The results obtained from the proposed real time islanding detection method show that proposed method is reliable, robust, and independent from load and inverter. Nondetection zone (NDZ) is almost zero and islanding detection time is approximately 1 - 2 cycles indicated in experimental results so this time has a significant short response time according to IEEE 929 - 2000 standard.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{noticeable}} increase in use of Solar PV based systems for power generation, given its renewable nature. A solar PV based <b>grid</b> <b>tie</b> inverters are used for dc-ac conversion. The conventional line commutated ac-to-dc inverters have square-shaped line current which contains higher-order harmonics. The line current with the high harmonic contents generates EMI and moreover it causes more heating of the core of distribution/power transformers. Alternatively, PWM based inverters using MOSFET/IGBT switches are also used for the same purpose. However, apart from higher switching losses, the power handling capability and reliability of these devices are quite low in comparison to thyristors/SCR. Nevertheless, the conventional thyristor based forced commutated inverters are not suitable for PWM applications due {{to the problems of}} commutation circuits. A pure sinusoidal line current or waveform with low har- monic contents is the most desirable. In the present work, a multilevel line commutated inverter topology has been proposed and analyzed which improves the wave shape and hence reduces the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the line current in a <b>grid</b> <b>tie</b> line commutated inverter. The scheme has successfully been implemented and tested. Moreover, the performance of the proposed topology is far better than the conventional line-commutated inverter. It reduces THD, losses, switching stress and EMI...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The need of {{electricity}} through-out {{the world is}} growing day by day at a considerable rate. The electricity demand of its consumers has already exceeded the supply. Hence, switching towards green energy is a must to remove this imbalance conditions between the electricity supply and demand. At this particular point, there is a higher tendency of the electricity consumers for moving towards domestic solar power. The <b>grid</b> <b>tie</b> inverters are the main building. So, the proper operation of an inverter is highly important. Although there exists an already provided data sheet by the manufactures along with the inverters, sometimes we can identify mal-operation conditions of these inverters irrespective of the data sheet provided and therefore, many complaints are aroused by the solar consumers. The issue is that there does not exist proper equipment to engage with all types of inverter testing schemes that had been listed in the IEEE 1547 standard; which is the relevant safety standard for interconnecting distributed resources with electric power systems. So, a test bench to test the <b>grid</b> <b>tie</b> inverters was developed according to IEEE 1547 standard. Tests that are stated in the standard were conducted with a higher accuracy data acquisition system and the relevant results were analyzed {{to determine whether a}} particular inverter operates within the limits at abnormal situations as described in the standard. Finally, a test report was generated to provide the solar power consumer informing the operation status of the inverter. This paper elucidates relevant inverter tests, the proposed methodologies to conduct the tests, the logic behind those tests for analysing purposes and the test results obtained for the calculations of the necessary test parameters, thus, the entire outcome will be highly important for the industry...|$|R
