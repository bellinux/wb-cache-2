40|$|In her article, {{the author}} {{presents}} the institute <b>of</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> {{in the light}} of empirical analyses of records of proceedings. Under examination were 238 cases closed,in years 1984 - 1986 in one district court operating in a large town. The research revealed that an important impulse making mothers start proceedings for regulating their children's filiation situation is the need to find material means to bring up and educate the children. Interestingly, seldom do plaintiffs raise claims concerning two non-financial issues, i. e. vesting parental authority in a father and granting a child the father's surname. Relatively frequent are in suits for establishment <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> the defendants' <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> voluntary recognition <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> (48 % <b>of</b> cases). Furthermore, judges too often urge defendants to issue such declarations. The author disapproves of the courts' practice of underestimating biological proofs, especially a serological expertise of the 2 nd degree. At present such an expertise concerning HLA system is rarely performed and most often not before but after anthropological examination. The author is of the opinion that more efforts should be made to spread the application of new biological methods in filiation suits.

50|$|The Domestic Purposes Benefit, or DPB, {{was first}} {{introduced}} in New Zealand in 1973 by the country's 3rd Labour government led by Prime Minister Norman Kirk. The Destitute Persons Act 1910 and the Domestic Proceedings Act 1968 had previously created a statutory means by which a woman could seek a maintenance order against {{the father of her}} children. The court could, at its discretion, set the rate that it thought appropriate for the father to pay the mother in respect of the child. This maintenance continued until the child reached the age of sixteen; maintenance would continue to be payable in respect of a child over the age of sixteen if the child was engaged in full-time education. These statutes provided a means by which women could seek maintenance from the putative father, but in the event of any difficulties, women had to resort to the court in order to enforce the maintenance agreement or order. There were also further difficulties; an unmarried mother had to obtain an acknowledgement of paternity from the father or a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> from the court in order to be entitled to seek maintenance. The DPB, introduced in statutory form in 1973, mitigated these difficulties. The Act provided State financial support for single mothers, irrespective of whether the father was contributing to maintenance payments.|$|E

The aim of this thesis is to analyze and describe the institute <b>of</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> especially in the view of the applicable legislation. The thesis is composed of eight chapters. Chapter One deals with family and parenthood and defines the basic terms, sucha as the biological, social and legal parenthood. Chapter Two is subdivided into two parts and focuses on the legislation <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> Part One describes the historical development of parenthood, part Two briefly describes the source of law witch contains the current legislation. The next chapter concerns the determination of maternity, which is closely connected to the institute <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> Chapter Three, apart from the applicable legislation, also includes a subchapter about hidden birth and a subchapter that documents surrogacy.

40|$|Models of optimal parental {{investment}} {{predict that}} variation in certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> {{can affect the}} optimal level of paternal investment when a male's expected paternity in different nesting attempts is not fixed throughout his lifetime. Several attempts to test this prediction experimentally in monogamous birds have failed to induce a reduction in care by males. This may be because the method used, detaining males, is a poor model for {{what happens when a}} male's certainly <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> is naturally reduced. We caught and detained female collared flycatchers Flctdula piNtvttit for 1 h immediately after laying on one or two occasions in an attempt to induce variation in certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> for the males they were mated to. By capturing females immediately after laying we hoped to exploit the existence of an &quot;insemination window &quot; since males should be very sensitive to female absence during this period. The general effect of the experimental manipulation was consistent with reduced certainty of paternity: males responded by reducing their level of paternal care to nettling*, and males mated to females that had been caught on one morning fed nestlings significantly less often and made a smaller share of feeding visits than males mated to control females. The effects of the experiment were generally weak, however, and we argue that certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> may be fixed well before egg laying, in which case experimental manipulations are unlikely to have large effects. It is difficult to predict the effects of natural variation in certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> on levels <b>of</b> male paternal care because differential allocation by females mated to attractive males may act in the opposite direction.

40|$|The {{way that}} {{variation}} in paternity affects the optimal level of paternal {{effort has been}} a contentious issue, {{both in terms of}} theory and the empirical data needed to test competing theories. Clarification of the theoretical issues has led to the prediction that a reduction in paternal effort should only be expected when (i) there are substantial costs of paternal care and (ii) males have available some cue to their share <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> in the current brood. Previous work on the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, has shown that the first condition is supported because of trade-offs between paternal effort and secondary sexual character size. We carried out experimental manipulations of pairs of collared flycatchers (temporary male removal), which were effective in causing variation in paternity in the current brood. Male responses to these manipulations were studied by quantifying levels of paternal care. All males reared nestlings cross-fostered from non-experimental nests at the egg stage, thus ruling out the possibility that they responded to direct cues about <b>paternity.</b> The timing <b>of</b> male removal predicted the male's share <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> suggesting that males had a clear cue to their share <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> thereby fulfilling the second condition. As expected, the male's share of care, and rate of provisioning, were positively related to his share <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> The suggestion that the timing of removal was the cue used by males to predict their share <b>of</b> <b>paternity</b> was supported, since after the influence of this variable was controlled, there was no longer any relationship between paternity and paternal care. These data provide qualitative support for optimality models of paternal care in relation to certainty <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> and suggest that quantitative tests of the models are possible in well-characterized systems...|$|R
