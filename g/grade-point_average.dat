The experimental population consisted of 100, 1971 - 72 and of 100, 1976 - 77 matriculation graduates who had graduated from schools in the rural school jurisdictions in Education zone 6; and of 100, 1971 - 72, and of 100, 1976 - 77 matriculation graduates who had graduated from schools in the Medicine Hat urban school jurisdiction. All of the students in the experimental population had completed their freshman year at the Medicine Hat College the year following their graduation from high school. The variables analyzed in this study were: (1) Departmental Examination Grade XII <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages,</b> (2) Teacher-assigned Grade XII <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages,</b> (3) college freshmen <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages,</b> and (4) zones (rural and urban). Correlation coefficients were calculated between Grade XII <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> before and after the accreditation of Alberta high schools. Results indicated that the correlation coefficients ranged from. 36 to 50. The Grade XII <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> which showed the highest correlations with college freshmen <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> were those which had been obtained on Departmental Examinations. The Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Zr transformation statistical test indicated, at the. 05 level of significance, that there was no significant difference between the zones 2 ̆ 7 correlation coefficients before and after accreditation.

The need is for a test designed specifically to predict possibilities of success in courses which incoming students encounter and in whcih they are required to progress at a rate considered satisfactory according to college standards. The program followed in this study is two-fold: (1) to develop a vocabulary test, and (2) to verify the sucess of this test as a predictor of <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages.</b> The testing device herein developed is intended specifically to predict <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> for students in their freshman year at Utah State Agricultural College. The vocabulary test presented in this thesis is proposed to be once component of a comprehensive college-entrance examination. In developing the test, it seemed desirable that each of the fields of study required in the lower division of the college, i. e., social science, exact science, natural science, and language and arts, be represent adequately in the vocabulary testing. Development of the test is based upon the hypothesis that a vocabulary test made up of words chosen from the above indicated four areas of study, that discriminate successful from unsuccessful students in specific classes in those areas, can be used effectively in predicting the college <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> of students for their freshman year. This test is designed to predict <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> for entering freshman at Utah State Agricultural college, although it may also be valid for students of class ranks other than freshmen...|$|R

Over approximately fifteen years, the department offered two hundred [...] "classes" [...] that never met and had few if any requirements, but gave students full credit for their completion and counted towards students' grades.

2500|$|In 2011 the university's {{executive}} M.B.A.program {{for students}} from China came under scrutiny after {{an article in}} the Springfield News-Leader questioned the financial relationship between Missouri State and its Hong Kong-based agent, alleging that students were paying double the amount that MSU was receiving. The executive M.B.A. program accepts cohorts of students who come through a sponsor: a provincial or municipal government agency, a university, or a corporation. Missouri State's agent, the International Management Education Corporation (IMEC), identifies and develops relationships with sponsors, who identify and prepare students, screening them for work experience, a minimum <b>grade-point</b> <b>average</b> at the undergraduate level (2.75) and English language proficiency. IMEC then provides MSU with a cohort of a minimum of 30 students, and the sponsors send MSU the students' applications for review. [...] The fees students pay vary by sponsor and range from $15,000 to $22,000. IMEC was contracted to pay Missouri State between $10,103 and $11,886 per student; resulting in between 20 and 55 percent of the student fee being retained by IMEC. IMEC defended the fees claiming they cover marketing/promotion/recruiting and the related overhead costs as well as additional costs including intensive English training, exams, advice on applications and documentations, visa application fees and service and orientations provided by IMEC. University officials defended the program and arrangement stating that it had allowed Missouri State to quickly grow the executive M.B.A. program without having to spend university resources recruiting and marketing overseas. The program has had 370 students since it started in 2007. However, the chair of the Faculty Senate said professors have periodically raised questions about the quality and oversight of the various China initiatives, and had prepared a list of questions for the president in light of the article, expressing a desire to ensure that proper oversight was in place to avoid compromising quality. Following translation and re-publication of information from the News-Leader article by Chinese newspapers, MSU reported that it received calls from several program sponsor organizations in China that they would no longer participate in the program. The university continued to defend the program, arguing that mistranslations of the article had provided an incorrect view of the program's academic rigor and stating that it intended to meet with sponsors and answer any questions about the program.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 51) Purpose This {{study is}} a comparison of characteristics of successful and unsuccessful foreign students at California State University, Northridge. Procedures A structured interview was administered to 70 foreign students who attended California State University, Northridge during Fall 1979 and Spring 1980 semester. Thirty-five of these students were on the Dean's List with <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> above 3. 6. Thirty-five of these students were disqualified, having failed to maintain <b>grade-point</b> <b>averages</b> of 2. 0 in at least 12 units. Responses {{of the two groups}} were compared, using the chi-square test of independence. Statistical significance was determined at the. 05 level. The structured interview attempted to identify personal, educational, and experiential characteristics of the two groups and also to identify initial difficulties, problems concerning living situation, problems concerning academic programs, and problems concerning finances. Conclusions 1. Unsuccessful students tended to be older than successful students. 2. Unsuccessful students indicated far less contact with American students than did the successful students. 3. Loneliness was considered less of a problem for unsuccessful students than it was for successful students. 4. Heavy study loads troubled unsuccessful students considerably more than they did successful students. 5.
