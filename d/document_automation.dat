40|$|The flow of {{information}} is continually increasing due to the ubiquitous use {{of information}} technology. Information communication and distribution is highly automated {{to meet the demand}} for an unobtrusive information flow. Servers, systems and applications overtake the tasks of gathering, storing, distributing and selecting the diverse information requests, though the task of presenting the information in a communicatively effective manner is still a manual tasks handled by professionals. In certain contexts, such as the distribution of dynamically generated content by web servers, the manual tasks restrict the system from performing as efficiently as possible. At the moment there is a great potential for production efficacy gain by automating the workflow to some extent. The system utilization of a document layout generator may cover some designer functions and thereby reducing task redundancy related to the presentation of information. <b>Document</b> layout <b>automation</b> algorithms are typically implemented with weighting metrics for the purpose of quantifying layout characteristics, also called layout attributes, of generated layout in the perspective of visual quality. Several different weighting metrics and algorithms have been studied and implemented in the past years, but still they fail to produce layouts matching the general performance of a designer in practice. Literature suggests that many of the weighting metrics, despite their advanced mathematical implementation, lack the implementation of a persistent set of preference attributes. Weighting metrics based on an extended set of preference attributes related to designer preferences may further improve the performance of a <b>document</b> layout <b>automation</b> algorithm. The scope of this thesis is to establish knowledge about the utilization of document layout attribute operators in <b>document</b> layout <b>automation.</b> How do <b>document</b> layout <b>automation</b> system with an extended attribute operator set perform related to layout quality? The study presented in this thesis reveals that implementing operators for the layout characteristics alignment and equilibrium in layout generators doesn’t automatically enhance the visually perceived quality of the layout generated. A second scope of this thesis is to generalize the modeling paradigms derived from existing literature related to <b>document</b> layout <b>automation</b> systems. Several systems have been proposed for solving layout automation related problems, but still {{there is a lack of}} literature related to the generalization of layout automation system models. Is it possible to recognize modeling patterns can be generalized an utilized in a wide range of layout automation systems, applications and / or components? We propose a layout automation system modeling framework based on a grounded theory study of related literature. The presented proof of concept system LaG is modeled based on this modeling framework and provides an affirmation of the modeling framework flexibility regarding layout automation technology and architectural modeling patterns...|$|R

40|$|Assigning {{relevant}} keywords {{to documents}} {{is very important}} for efficient retrieval, clustering and management of the documents. Especially with the web corpus deluged with digital <b>documents,</b> <b>automation</b> of this task is of prime importance. Keyword assignment is a broad topic of research which refers to tagging of document with keywords, key-phrases or topics. For text documents, the keyword assignment techniques have been developed under two sub-topics: automatic keyword extraction (AKE) and automatic key-phrase abstraction. However, the approaches developed in the literature for full text documents cannot be used to assign keywords to low text content documents like twitter feeds, news clips, product reviews or even short scholarly text. In this work, we point out several practical challenges encountered in tagging such low text content documents. As a solution to these challenges, we show that the proposed approaches which leverage knowledge from several open source web resources enhance the quality of the tags (keywords) assigned to the low text content documents. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on real world corpus consisting of scholarly documents with text content ranging from only the text in the title of the document (5 - 10 words) to the summary text/abstract (100 - 150 words). We find that the proposed approach not just improves the accuracy of keyword assignment but offer a computationally efficient solution which can be used in real world applications...|$|R
