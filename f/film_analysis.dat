500|$|A cult film or cult movie, also {{commonly}} referred to as a cult classic, is a film that has acquired a cult following. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate fanbase, an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and audience participation. [...] Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially box office bombs, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, transgressive films shunned by the mainstream. [...] The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art. [...] The term cult film itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies, though cult was in common use in <b>film</b> <b>analysis</b> for decades prior to that.|$|E
500|$|Modern cult films {{grew from}} 1960s {{counterculture}} and underground films, popular {{among those who}} rejected mainstream Hollywood films. [...] These underground film festivals {{led to the creation}} of midnight movies, which attracted cult followings. [...] The term cult film itself was an outgrowth of this movement and was first used in the 1970s, though cult had been in use for decades in <b>film</b> <b>analysis</b> with both positive and negative connotations. [...] These films were more concerned with cultural significance than the social justice sought by earlier avant-garde films. [...] Midnight movies became more popular and mainstream, peaking with the release of The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), which finally found its audience several years after its release. [...] Eventually, the rise of home video would marginalize midnight movies once again, after which many directors joined the burgeoning independent film scene or went back underground. [...] Home video would give a second life to box office flops, as positive word-of-mouth or excessive replay on cable television led these films to develop an appreciative audience, as well as obsessive replay and study. [...] For example, The Beastmaster (1982), despite its failure at the box office, became one of the most played movies on American cable television and developed into a cult film. [...] Home video and television broadcasts of cult films were initially greeted with hostility. [...] Joanne Hollows states that they were seen as turning cult films mainstream – in effect, feminizing them by opening them to distracted, passive audiences.|$|E

The thin films exhibited narrower band gaps compared with their bulk counterparts; gaps increased with increasing thickness of the thin <b>films.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the optical properties of the films showed that their refractive index is significantly decreased and their extinction coefficient is slightly increased compared with the bulk. With increasing thin film thickness, the refractive index decreased slightly and the extinction coefficient remained unchanged.
