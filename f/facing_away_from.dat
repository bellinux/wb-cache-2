5|$|Cockroaches use pheromones {{to attract}} mates, and the males {{practice}} courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{each other with}} their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species {{are known to be}} parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males.|$|E
5|$|Other less {{satisfactory}} materials than horn {{have been}} used for the belly of the bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, {{have been used}} {{on the back of the}} bow (the part <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the archer when shooting).|$|E
5|$|The layout {{was unique}} {{within the city}} of Napa, {{and may have been}} unique within California. The site {{differentiated}} from most agricultural sites by <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the road, with no distinct difference between middle-class and workers' houses, in size, finishing, or location. Many of the buildings shared walls or were built abutting each other, and two of the houses were built over a single basement.|$|E

5|$|Zethus Crater is {{the largest}} (diameter about 40km) crater on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter's moon Thebe. There are several bright spots at the rim of this crater. It {{is located on the}} far side of Thebe, <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Jupiter. It was {{discovered}} by the Galileo spacecraft. It is named for Zethus, the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Roofers {{replaced}} Davison's roof in 1960 and {{new windows}} were installed in 1980. A new staircase {{on the side}} of the dorm <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the quad was built in 2005. The dorm underwent a major renovation during the 2008–2009 school year, reopening at the beginning of the 2009–2010 academic year. The renovation included plans for upgraded accessibility, including an elevator and disabled-accessible bathrooms and doors, making it Vassar's first dorm to offer those features.|$|E

5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room to fire. The embrasures <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The main {{striking}} {{force of the}} Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers. Due {{to the cost of}} their equipment and armor, cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.|$|E

5|$|Originally, Entrance 2's {{escalator}} entrance was to {{be located}} inside the Yorkshire Towers apartment building at 305 East 86th Street, on {{the northeast corner of}} Second Avenue and 86th Street. In 2009, a Finding Of No Significant Impact by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) found this to be unfeasible, so the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) revised the plan to two separate sidewalk entrances in front of the building. During the planning process, it was determined that building a new entrance within the Yorkshire Towers would be too expensive and logistically unfeasible. The apartments directly above the entrance's location would have had to be structurally underpinned during construction, and the Food Emporium supermarket location would have had to close {{to make way for the}} new entrance. Of the three alternatives presented for moving the entrance, the MTA chose an alternative in which there would be two new escalator entrances on the north side of 86th Street, both flanking the semicircular driveway of Yorkshire Towers and <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the driveway. There was also a proposal to move the sidewalk escalator entrances to the south side of the street, as well as another proposal to build a new structure containing five elevators at the southeast corner of Second Avenue and 86th Street, in a manner similar to Entrance 3 of the adjacent 72nd Street station.|$|E
25|$|During production, great secrecy {{surrounded}} {{the fact that}} Darth Vader was Luke's father. The film includes a brief image of Vader with his mask off, <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the camera.

25|$|In February 2011, {{a lawsuit}} was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers at 86th Street over the {{location}} of two proposed Second Avenue Subway entrances that were located {{right in front of}} the building but <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its semicircular driveway citing quality of life issues. However, the lawsuit was later dismissed.|$|E

25|$|A {{ridging plough}} {{is used for}} crops, such as {{potatoes}} or scallions, which are grown buried in ridges of soil using a technique called ridging or hilling. A ridging plough has two mouldboards <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> each other, cutting a deep furrow on each pass, with high ridges either side. The same plough {{may be used to}} split the ridges to harvest the crop.|$|E

25|$|De Villiers has a {{reputation}} as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who {{was also one of the}} finest fielders of his generation.|$|E

25|$|Auxin induces shoot apical dominance; the {{axillary}} buds are inhibited by auxin, as a {{high concentration}} of auxin directly stimulates ethylene synthesis in axillary buds, causing inhibition of their growth and potentiation of apical dominance. When the apex of the plant is removed, the inhibitory effect is removed and the growth of lateral buds is enhanced. Auxin is sent to the part of the plant <b>facing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.|$|E
