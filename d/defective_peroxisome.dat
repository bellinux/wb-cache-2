40|$|SummaryOvernutrition {{activates}} {{a proinflammatory}} program in macrophages to induce insulin resistance (IR), but its molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, {{we show that}} saturated fatty acid and lipopolysaccharide, two factors implicated in high-fat diet (HFD) -induced IR, suppress macrophage CGI- 58 expression. Macrophage-specific CGI- 58 knockout (MaKO) in mice aggravates HFD-induced glucose intolerance and IR, which is associated with augmented systemic/tissue inflammation and proinflammatory activation of adipose tissue macrophages. CGI- 58 -deficient macrophages exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction due to <b>defective</b> <b>peroxisome</b> proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ signaling. Consequently, they overproduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to potentiate secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by activating NLRP 3 inflammasome. Anti-ROS treatment or NLRP 3 silencing prevents CGI- 58 -deficient macrophages from oversecreting proinflammatory cytokines and from inducing proinflammatory signaling and IR in the cocultured fat slices. Anti-ROS treatment also prevents exacerbation of inflammation and IR in HFD-fed MaKO mice. Our data thus establish CGI- 58 as a suppressor of overnutrition-induced NLRP 3 inflammasome activation in macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Zellweger {{syndrome}} (ZS) is a neonatal-lethal {{genetic disease}} that affects all tissues, and features neuropathology that involves primary developmental defects {{as well as}} neurodegeneration. Neuropathological changes include abnormal neuronal migration affecting the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum and inferior olivary complex, abnormal Purkinje cell arborisation, demyelination and post-developmental neuronal degeneration. ZS is caused by mutations in peroxisome biogenesis, or PEX, genes which lead to <b>defective</b> <b>peroxisome</b> biogenesis and the resultant loss of peroxisomal metabolic function. The molecular and cellular bases of ZS neuropathology are still not completely understood. Attempts to explain the neuropathogenesis have implicated peroxisomal metabolic dysfunction, and more specifically the loss of peroxisomal products, such as plasmalogens and docosahexaenoic, and the accumulation of peroxisomal substrates, such as very-long-chain-fatty acids. In this review, consideration is also given to recent findings that implicate other candidate pathogenetic factors, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, protein misfolding, aberrant cell signalling, and inflammation - factors that have also been identified as important in the pathogenesis of other neurological diseases.

The present investigation sought to advance our understanding of the communication between mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress in the onset of hepatic steatosis in male rodents with <b>defective</b> <b>peroxisome</b> proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) signaling. Genetic depletion of PPARalpha or perturbation of PPARalpha signaling by high-fructose diet compromised the functional activity of metabolic enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and induced hepatic mitochondrial stress in rats and mice. Inhibition of PPARalpha activity further enhanced the expression of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA and protein, which was associated with reduced mRNA expression of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), the induction of hepatic ER stress, and hepatic steatosis. Restoration of PPARalpha activity recovered the metabolic function of the mitochondria and ER, alleviated systemic hypertriglyceridemia, and improved hepatic steatosis. These findings unveil novel roles for PPARalpha in mediating stress signals between hepatic subcellular stress-responding machinery and in the onset of hepatic steatosis under conditions of metabolic stress...|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} peroxisomal disorders {{were considered}} to be extremely rare and the diagnostic procedures available for postanatal and prenatal diagnosis were not widely known. At present, 17 human disorders are linked to peroxisomal dysfunction. The clinical, biochemical and morphological peroxisome heterogeneity described in the different diseases illustrate that only combined analysis of all the different approaches will lead to a correct diagnosis and a coherent pathophysiological model to guide ongoing research. With the study of human peroxisomal disease, advances have been gained as to the function of the peroxisome in normal and pathological conditions. Genetic analysis of peroxisome biogenesis and research on peroxisomal targeting signals are now in progress. Peroxisomal disorders are usually classified according to the degree of biochemical impairment. In this paper, a tentative classification of peroxisomal disorders will be proposed, based on the degree of biochemical abnormalities combined with new data obtained on whether or not <b>defective</b> <b>peroxisome</b> assembly is involved: (1) disorders with peroxisome assembly deficiencies; (2) disorders with single enzyme deficiencies.

From a saturated forward genetic screen of 6. 7 × 105 mutagenized haploid genomes, we isolated 118 mutants with supersized intestinal LDs often reaching 10 μm. These mutants define nine novel complementation groups, in addition to four known genes (maoc- 1, dhs- 28, daf- 22, and prx- 10). The nine groups are named drop (lipid droplet abnormal) and categorized into four classes. Class I mutants drop- 5 and drop- 9, similar to prx- 10, are up-regulated in ACS- 22 -DGAT- 2 -dependent LD growth, resistant to LD hydrolysis, and <b>defective</b> in <b>peroxisome</b> import. Class II mutants drop- 2, drop- 3, drop- 6, and drop- 7 are up-regulated in LD growth, are resistant to LD hydrolysis, but are not <b>defective</b> in <b>peroxisome</b> import. Class III mutants drop- 1 and drop- 8 are neither up-regulated in LD growth nor resistant to LD hydrolysis, but seemingly up-regulated in LD fusion. Class IV mutant drop- 4 is cloned as sams- 1 and, different to the other three classes, is ACS- 22 -independent and hydrolysis-resistant. These four classes of supersized LD mutants should be valuable for mechanistic studies of LD cellular processes including growth, hydrolysis, and fusion...|$|R

Here, we describe the characterization {{of one of these}} mutants, per 8, and the cloning of the PER 8 gene. In either methanol or methylamine medium, conditions that normally induce the organdies, per 8 cells contain no peroxisome-like structures and peroxisomal enzymes are located in the cytosol. The sequence of PER 8 predicts that its product (Per 8 p) is a novel polypeptide of 34 kD, and antibodies against Per 8 p recognize a protein of 31 kD. Analysis of the primary sequence of Per 8 p revealed a 39 -amino-acid cysteine-rich segment with similarity to the C 3 HC 4 family of zinc-finger motifs. Overexpression of PER 8 results in a markedly enhanced increase in peroxisome numbers.

We cloned the gene encoding the second most abundant integral membrane protein of Trypanosoma brucei glycosomes. The 24 kDa protein is very basic and hydrophobic, with two predicted transmembrane domains. It is targeted to peroxisomes when expressed in mammalian cells and yeast. The protein is a functional homologue of Pex 11 p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae: pex 11 Delta mutants, which are <b>defective</b> in <b>peroxisome</b> proliferation, can be complemented by the trypanosome gene. Sequence conservation is significant in the N- and C-terminal domains of all putative Pex 11 p homologues known, from trypanosomes, yeasts and mammals.

40|$|Autophagy is a catabolic process used by {{eukaryotic}} {{cells for}} the degradation and recycling of cytosolic proteins and excess or defective organelles. In yeast, autophagy {{is primarily a}} response to nutrient limitation, whereas in higher eukaryotes it also {{plays a role in}} developmental processes. Due to its essentially unlimited degradative capacity, it is critical that regulatory mechanisms are in place to modulate the timing and magnitude of the autophagic response.

Aside from Atg 1, the proteins in this complex participate primarily in either nonspecific autophagy or specific types of autophagy, including the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathway, which operates under vegetative growth conditions, and peroxisome degradation. Accordingly, these proteins are prime candidates for factors that regulate the conversion between these pathways, including the change in size of the sequestering vesicle, the most obvious morphological difference.

Surprisingly, previous genome-wide screen performed in yeast demonstrated that a TBSV replicon RNA replicated as efficiently in yeast <b>defective</b> in <b>peroxisome</b> biogenesis as in the wt yeast (Panavas et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2005). To further test how the lack of peroxisomes could affect tombus{{virus replication}}, we used yeast cells missing either PEX 3 or PEX 19 genes, which are absolutely essential for peroxisome biogenesis. Confocal microscopy-based approach revealed that the wild-type tombusvirus p 33 replication protein accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in pex 3 Δ or pex 19 Δ yeast, suggesting that tombusvirus replication could {{take place on the}} surface of ER membrane. The activities of the isolated tombusvirus replicase preparations from wt, pex 3 Δ or pex 19 Δ yeasts were comparable, demonstrating that the assembly of the replicase was as efficient in the ER as in the authentic subcellular environments. The generation/accumulation of tombusvirus recombinants was similar in wt, pex 3 Δ and pex 19 Δ yeasts, suggesting that the rate of mistakes occurring during tombusvirus replication is comparable in {{the presence or absence of}} peroxisomes. Overall, this work demonstrates that a tombusvirus, relying on the wt replication proteins, can efficiently replicate on an alternative intracellular membrane.

This result suggests that these mutants have defects in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, because peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation {{plays an important role in}} producing sucrose from storage lipids during germination. Genetic analysis revealed that these mutants can be classified as carrying alleles at three independent loci, which we designated ped 1, ped 2, and ped 3, respectively (where ped stands for <b>peroxisome</b> <b>defective).</b> The ped 1 mutant lacks the thiolase protein, an enzyme involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation during germination and subsequent seedling growth, whereas the ped 2 mutant has a defect in the intracellular transport of thiolase from the cytosol to glyoxysomes. Etiolated cotyledons of both ped 1 and ped 2 mutants have glyoxysomes with abnormal morphology...|$|R
40|$|Background Bile salts are {{produced}} and secreted by {{the liver and}} are required for intestinal absorption of fatty food components and excretion of endobiotics and xenobiotics. They are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and transported back to the liver via the portal tract. Dedicated bile salt transporters in hepatocytes and enterocytes {{are responsible for the}} unidirectional transport of bile salts in the enterohepatic cycle. Aim To give an overview of the function and regulations of proteins involved in bile salt synthesis and transport. Methods Data presented are obtained from PubMed-accessible literature combined with our own recent research. Result Hepatocytes and enterocytes contain unique bile salt importers (sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, respectively) and exporters (bile salt export pump and organic solute transporter alpha-beta, respectively). Enzymes involved in bile salt biosynthesis reside in different subcellular locations, including the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, cytosol and <b>peroxisomes.</b> <b>Defective</b> expression or function of the transporters or enzymes may lead to cholastasis. The bile salt-activated transcription factor Farnesoid X receptor controls expression of genes involved in bile salt biosynthesis and transport. Conclusions Detailed knowledge is available about the enzymes and transporters involved in bile salt homeostasis and how their defective function is associated with cholestasis. In contrast, the process of intracellular bile salt transport is largely unexplore...|$|R
40|$|The {{peroxisome}} biogenesis disorders (PBDs) {{are currently}} difficult-to-treat multiple-organ dysfunction disorders {{that result from}} the <b>defective</b> biogenesis of <b>peroxisomes.</b> Genes encoding Peroxins, which are required for peroxisome biogenesis or functions, are known causative genes of PBDs. The human peroxin genes PEX 3 or PEX 16 are required for peroxisomal membrane protein targeting, and their mutations cause Zellweger syndrome, a class of PBDs. Lack of understanding about the pathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome has hindered the development of effective treatments. Here, we developed potential Drosophila models for Zellweger syndrome, in which the Drosophila pex 3 or pex 16 gene was disrupted. As found in Zellweger syndrome patients, peroxisomes were not observed in the homozygous Drosophila pex 3 mutant, which was larval lethal. However, the pex 16 homozygote lacking its maternal contribution was viable and still maintained {{a small number of}} peroxisome-like granules, even though PEX 16 is essential for the biosynthesis of peroxisomes in humans. These results suggest that the requirements for pex 3 and pex 16 in peroxisome biosynthesis in Drosophila are different, and the role of PEX 16 orthologs may have diverged between mammals and Drosophila. The phenotypes of our Zellweger syndrome model flies, such as larval lethality in pex 3, and reduced size, shortened longevity, locomotion defects, and abnormal lipid metabolisms in pex 16, were reminiscent of symptoms of this disorder, although the Drosophila pex 16 mutant does no...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} peroxisome {{assembly and}} human peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) such as Zellweger syndrome, thirteen different complementation groups (CGs) of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants <b>defective</b> in <b>peroxisome</b> biogenesis have been isolated and {{established as a}} model research system. Successful gene-cloning studies by a forward genetic approach utilized a rapid functional complementation assay of CHO cell mutants led to isolation of human peroxide (PEX) genes. Search for pathogenic genes responsible for PBDs of all 14 CGs is now completed together with the homology search by screening the human expressed sequence tag database using yeast PEX genes. Peroxins are divided into three groups: (1) peroxins including Pex 3 p, Pex 16 p and Pex 19 p, are responsible for peroxisome membrane biogenesis via classes I and II pathways; (2) peroxins that function in matrix protein import; (3) those such as three forms of Pex 11 p, Pex 11 pα, Pex 11 pβ, and Pex 11 pγ, are involved in peroxisome proliferation where DLP 1, Mff, and Fis 1 coordinately function. In membrane assembly, Pex 19 p forms complexes in the cytosol with newly synthesized PMPs including Pex 16 p and transports them to the receptor Pex 3 p, whereby peroxisomal membrane is formed (Class I pathway). Pex 19 p likewise forms a complex with newly made Pex 3 p and translocates it to the Pex 3 p receptor, Pex 16 p (Class II pathway). In matrix protein import, newly synthesized proteins harboring peroxisome targeting signal type 1 or 2 are recognized by Pex 5 p or Pex 7 p in the cytoplasm and are imported to peroxisomes via translocation machinery. In regard to peroxisome-cytoplasmic shuttling of Pex 5 p, Pex 5 p initially targets to an 800 -kDa docking complex consisting of Pex 14 p and Pex 13 p and then translocates to a 500 -kDa RING translocation complex. At the terminal step, Pex 1 p and Pex 6 p of the AAA family mediate the export of Pex 5 p, where Cys-ubiquitination of Pex 5 p {{is essential for the}} Pex 5 p exit...|$|R
40|$|Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored {{proteins}} (GPI-APs) play various {{roles in}} cell–cell and cell–environment interactions. GPI is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from phosphatidylinositol (PI) through step-wise reactions including transfers of monosaccharides and preassembled GPI is transferred en bloc to proteins. Cellular PI contains mostly diacyl glycerol and {{unsaturated fatty acid}} in the sn- 2 position, whereas mammalian GPI-APs have mainly 1 -alkyl- 2 -acyl PI and almost exclusively stearic acid, a saturated chain, at the sn- 2 position. The latter characteristic {{is the result of}} fatty acid remodeling occurring in the Golgi, generating GPI-anchors compatible with raft membrane. The former characteristic is the result of diacyl to alkyl-acyl change occurring in the third GPI intermediate, glucosaminyl-inositolacylated-PI (GlcN-acyl-PI). Here we investigated the origin of the sn- 1 alkyl-chain in GPI-APs. Using cell lines defective in the peroxisomal alkyl-phospholipid biosynthetic pathway, we demonstrated that generation of alkyl-containing GPI is dependent upon the peroxisomal pathway. We further demonstrated that in cells <b>defective</b> in the <b>peroxisome</b> pathway, the chain composition of the diacyl glycerol moiety in GlcN-acyl-PI is different from those in the first intermediate N-acetylglucosaminyl-PI and cellular PI, indicating that not only diacyl to alkyl-acyl change but also diacyl to diacyl change occurs in GlcN-acyl-PI. We therefore propose a biosynthetic step within GlcN-acyl-PI in which the diacyl glycerol (or diacyl phosphatidic acid) part is replaced by diradyl glycerol (or diradyl phosphatidic acid). These results highlight cooperation of three organelles, the ER, the Golgi, and the peroxisome, in the generation of the lipid portion of GPI-APs...|$|R
40|$|The {{cucumber}} anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum orbicuIare forms specialized cells called appressoria for host penetration. We {{identified a}} gene, FAM 1, encoding a novel peroxin protein {{that is essential}} for peroxisome biogenesis and that associates with Woronin bodies (WBs), dense-core vesicles found only in filamentous ascomycete fungi which function to maintain cellular integrity. The fam 1 disrupted mutants were unable to grow on medium containing oleic acids as the sole carbon source and were nonpathogenic, being defective in both appressorium melanization and host penetration. Fluorescent proteins carrying peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs) were not imported into the peroxisomes of fam 1 mutants, suggesting that FAM 1 is a novel peroxisomal biogenesis gene (peroxin). FAM 1 did not show significant homology to any Saccharomyces cerevisiae peroxins but resembled conserved filamentous ascomycete-specific Pex 22 -like proteins which contain a predicted Pex 4 -binding site and are potentially involved in recycling PTS receptors from peroxisomes to the cytosol. C. orbiculare FAM 1 complemented the peroxisomal matrix protein import defect of the S. cerevisiae pex 22 mutant. Confocal microscopy of Faml-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion proteins and immunoelectron microscopy with anti-Fam 1 antibodies showed that Fam 1 localized to nascent WBs budding from peroxisomes and mature WBs. Association of Fam 1 with WBs was confirmed by colocalization with WB matrix protein CoHex 1 (C. orbiculare Hex 1) and WB membrane protein CoWsc (C. orbiculare Wsc) and by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting with antibodies to Fa ml and CoHex 1. In WB-deficient cohex 1 mutants, Fam 1 was redirected to the peroxisome membrane. Our results show that Fam 1 is a WB-associated peroxin required for pathogenesis and raise the possibility that localized receptor recycling occurs in WBs. IMPORTANCE Colletotrichum orbicuIare is a fungus causing damaging disease on Cucurbitaceae plants. In this paper, we characterize a novel peroxisome biogenesis gene from this pathogen called FAM 1. Although no genes with significant homology are present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, FAM 1 contains a predicted Pex 4 -binding site typical of Pex 22 proteins, which function in the recycling of PTS receptors from peroxisomes to the cytosol. We show that FAM 1 complements the defect in peroxisomal matrix protein import of S. cerevisiae pex 22 mutants and that fam 1 mutants are completely <b>defective</b> in <b>peroxisome</b> function, fatty acid metabolism, and pathogenicity. Remarkably, we found that this novel peroxin is specifically localized on the bounding membrane of Woronin bodies, which are small peroxisome-derived organelles unique to filamentous ascomycete fungi that function in septal pore plugging. Our finding suggests that these fungi have coopted the Woronin body for localized receptor recycling during matrix protein import...|$|R
40|$|Many cell surface {{proteins}} in mammalian cells are {{anchored to the}} plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). The predominant form of mammalian GPI contains 1 -alkyl- 2 -acyl phosphatidylinositol (PI), which is generated by lipid remodeling from diacyl PI. The conversion of diacyl PI to 1 -alkyl- 2 -acyl PI occurs in the ER at the third intermediate in the GPI biosynthetic pathway. This lipid remodeling requires the alkyl-phospholipid biosynthetic pathway in <b>peroxisome.</b> Indeed, cells <b>defective</b> in dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) or alkyl-DHAP synthase express only the diacyl form of GPI-anchored proteins. A defect in the alkyl-phospholipid biosynthetic pathway causes a peroxisomal disorder, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), and <b>defective</b> biogenesis of <b>peroxisomes</b> causes Zellweger syndrome, {{both of which are}} lethal genetic diseases with multiple clinical phenotypes such as psychomotor defects, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. (jlr) Here, we report that GPI lipid remodeling is defective in cells from patients with Zellweger syndrome having mutations in the peroxisomal biogenesis factors PEX 5, PEX 16, and PEX 19 and in cells from patients with RCDP types 1, 2, and 3 caused by mutations in PEX 7, DHAP-AT, and alkyl-DHAP synthase, respectively. Absence of the 1 -alkyl- 2 -acyl form of GPI-anchored proteins might account for some of the complex phenotypes of these two major peroxisomal disorders. -Kanzawa, N., N. Shimozawa, R. J. A.

40|$|Peroxisomes play an {{indispensible}} role in ether {{lipid biosynthesis}} {{as evidenced by}} the deficiency of ether phospholipids in fibroblasts and tissues from patients suffering from a number of peroxisomal disorders. Alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase, a peroxisomal enzyme playing {{a key role in the}} biosynthesis of ether phospholipids, contains the peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 in a N-terminal cleavable presequence. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase, levels of this enzyme were examined in fibroblast cell lines from patients affected by peroxisomal disorders. Strongly reduced levels were found in fibroblasts of Zellweger syndrome and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata patients, indicating that the enzyme is not stable in the cytoplasm as a result of <b>defective</b> import into <b>peroxisomes.</b> In a neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient with an isolated import deficiency of proteins carrying the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1, the precursor form of alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase was detected at a level comparable to that of the mature form in control fibroblasts, in line with an intraperoxisomal localization. A patient with an isolated deficiency in alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) synthase activity had normal levels of this protein. Analysis at the cDNA level revealed a missense mutation leading to a R 419 H substitution in the enzyme of this patient. Expression of a recombinant protein carrying this mutation in Escherichia coli yielded an inactive enzyme, whereas a comparable control recombinant enzyme was active, providing further proof that this substitution is responsible for the inactivity of the enzyme and the phenotype. In line with this result is the observation that wild-type alkyl-DHAP synthase activity can be inactivated by the arginine-modifying agent phenylglyoxal. The enzyme is efficiently protected against this inactivation when the substrate palmitoyl-DHAP is present at a saturating concentration. The gene encoding human alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase was mapped on chromosome 2 q 3...|$|R
40|$|Peroxisomes {{are single}} membrane-bound organelles that {{function}} to compartmentalize certain metabolic reactions critical to {{plant and animal}} development. I have studied peroxisomal processes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, {{with a focus on}} the import of matrix proteins from the cytoplasm into the organelle matrix and the metabolism of the plant hormone indole- 3 -butryic acid (IBA). In this thesis, I describe my characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana <b>peroxisome</b> <b>defective</b> mutants isolated through forward and reverse genetic screens in physiological and biochemical assays. Peroxisome import depends on more than a dozen pero xin (PEX) proteins, with PEX 5 and PEX 7 serving as receptors that shuttle proteins bearing a peroxisome t argeting sequence (PTS) into the organelle. PEX 5 is the PTS 1 receptor, PEX 7 is the PTS 2 receptor, and in both plants and mammals, PEX 7 depends upon PEX 5 binding to deliver PTS 2 cargo into the peroxisome. I found a pex 7 missense mutation, pex 7 - 2, that disrupts PEX 7 -cargo binding and PEX 7 -PEX 5 interactions in yeast, as well as PEX 7 accumulation in plants. I examined localization of peroxisomally-targeted GFP derivatives in light-grown pex 7 mutants and, surprisingly, observed defects not only in PTS 2 import, but also in PTS 1 protein import. These PTS 1 import defects were accompanied by a decrease in PEX 5 accumulation in light-grown pex 7 mutants. Together, these data suggest that PEX 5 and PTS 1 import depend on the PEX 7 PTS 2 receptor in Arabidopsis and reveal a role for the environment in modulating peroxin function. Genetic evidence suggests that indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) is converted to the auxin indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) in Arabidopsis peroxisomes. The IBR 1, IBR 3, and IBR 10 proteins contain peroxisomal targeting signals and are candidates for catalyzing the various steps of IBA beta-oxidation. My analysis of the ibr mutants has provided evidence for the importance of the IBR enzymes and insight into the roles of IAA that derives from IBA beta-oxidation. In humans, deficiencies in peroxins underlie the peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, which are frequently lethal in early infancy. Advancing our understanding of peroxisome biogenesis and metabolism in a genetically distinct model system will allow the continued refinement of our understanding of these essential organelles...|$|R
40|$|Peroxisomes are organelles that {{sequester}} certain metabolic pathways; many {{of these}} pathways generate H 2 O 2, which can damage proteins. Little is known about how damaged or obsolete peroxisomal proteins are degraded. Developmentally timed peroxisomal content remodeling in Arabidopsis thaliana provides model substrates with which peroxisome-associated protein degradation can be elucidated. Isocitrate lyase (ICL) is a peroxisomal glyoxylate cycle enzyme necessary for early seedling development. A few days after germination, photosynthesis begins and ICL is degraded. ICL is stabilized when a peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and its membrane anchor are both mutated, suggesting that matrix proteins might exit the peroxisome for ubiquitin-dependent cytosolic degradation. To identify additional components needed for peroxisome-associated matrix protein degradation, seeds expressing GFP-ICL, which is degraded similarly to endogenous ICL, were mutagenized and persistent GFP-ICL fluorescence (pfl) mutants were identified. I have identified the defective genes in 17 pfl mutants. One pfl mutant is missing the peroxisomal 3 -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase encoded by the <b>PEROXISOME</b> <b>DEFECTIVE</b> 1 (PED 1 /At 2 g 33150) gene, one pfl mutant has a novel lesion in the MULTIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN (MFP/At 3 g 06860) gene, three pfl mutants have mutations in a peroxisomal GLUTAMATE:GLYOXYLATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (GGT 1 /At 1 g 23310) gene that results in truncated proteins, and two pfl mutants novel mutations in a PEROXISOMAL NAD+ TRANSPORTER (PXN/At 2 g 39970) gene. Four pfl mutants are defective in autophagy-related genes, ATG 2 /At 3 g 19190 and ATG 7 /At 5 g 45900. Three pfl mutants are defective in PEROXIN 14 (PEX 14 /At 5 g 62810), which encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein that assists in importing proteins into the peroxisome matrix. One pfl mutant displays normal matrix protein import carries a novel lesion in PEROXIN 6 (PEX 6 /At 1 g 03000), which encodes a peroxisome-tethered ATPase that is involved in recycling matrix protein receptors back to the cytosol. Two pfl mutants are defective in peroxisomal membrane proteins containing RING-finger domains, PEROXIN 2 (PEX 2 /At 1 g 79810) and PEROXIN 10 (PEX 10 /At 2 g 26350). The pfl screen has provided a rich source for novel peroxisome-defective mutants, including several that have not emerged from previous screens. Characterization of these pfl mutants suggests that peroxisomal metabolism influences the rate of matrix protein degradation. The identification of pex 14 mutants indicates peroxisomal matrix proteins must enter the peroxisome for efficient degradation, and the isolation of pex 2 - 1, pex 6 - 2, and pex 10 - 2 as pfl mutants supports the hypothesis that matrix proteins can exit the peroxisome for cytosolic degradation. Beyond insights into the mechanisms of peroxisome-associated protein degradation, the pfl mutants have provided new tools for elucidating the components and mechanisms of peroxisome biogenesis in plants...|$|R
