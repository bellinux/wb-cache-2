40|$|From the {{analytical}} {{point of view}} we investigate evolutionary variational inequalities resulting from the application of the Baiocchi transformation to degenerate Stefan type problems with zero-specific-heat and space- and also time-dependent coefficients. With respect to the injection/compression moulding and the <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>machining</b> process as special application problems different boundary conditions and obstacles are considered. Beside the existence and uniqueness of the solution there is also discussed its regularity with respect to both time and space in the framework of the variational inequality theory. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract—In the MEMS and micro {{machining}} worlds, micro-hole {{making is}} among the most frequently performed operations. There are many machining processes such as electro-discharge machining (EDM), laser beam machining (LBM), <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>machining</b> (ECM) and ultrasonic machining (USM) etc., used for creating micro-holes. But each machining process has its advantages and disadvantages depending upon the hole diameter, aspect ratio and material used. In this research paper, micro-holes were produced using the laser machining process and these micro-holes were compared with micro-holes produced by micro-EDM. The comparison is done for MRR, dimensional accuracy (including diameter at the entrance and exit, overcut, taper angle and circularity) and surface topography of micro-holes. Index Terms—micro-holes, micro-EDM, LBM...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-traditional}} machining of particulate reinforced {{metal matrix}} composites is relatively new. However, researchers seem {{to pay more}} attention in this field recently as the traditional machining of particulate reinforced metal matrix composites is very complex. This research investigates different non-traditional machining, such as electro-discharge, laser beam, abrasive water jet, electro-chemical and <b>electro-chemical</b> discharge <b>machining</b> of this composite materials. The machining mechanism, material removal rate/machining speed and surface finish have been analysed for every machining process. This analysis clearly shows that vaporisation, melting, chemical dissolution and mechanical erosion are the main material removal mechanisms during non-traditional machining. The thermal degradation and the presence of reinforcement particles mainly damage the machined surface. The understanding of electro-discharge, laser beam and abrasive water jet machining is more developed than that of electro-chemical and <b>electro-chemical</b> discharge <b>machining</b> for particulate reinforced MMC...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{emphasized}} on {{the behavior}} of bubbles formed around the electrodes in <b>Electro-Chemical</b> Discharge <b>Machining</b> (ECDM) process as a factor of spark initiation. A finer observation on the voltage-current (V-I) characteristics prior to the discharge is made to investigate the bubble behavior. V-I characteristics are recorded and analyzed experimentally with different combinations of the electrolytes, tool diameter and tool depth. It has been clearly observed that there are three distinct regions in the V-I characteristics for alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolyte. Due to local turbulence at higher current density, the linear nature of V-Icharacteristic curve changes and decrease in cell resistance is noticed. However this local turbulence has little effect on critical voltage or critical current. The span of the region near to the spark onset is different for different electrolytes...|$|R
40|$|To {{successfully}} {{compete in}} today's global market, {{the need of}} rapid product development reducing the lead-time between the designs of the product to its arrival in the market is increasing day by day. Moreover the market demands are changing fast. To respond to fast changes in demands, development of new innovative products is required which requires several sophisticated manufacturing processes. New machining processes are required to machine the advanced difficult-to-machine materials that are replacing the conventional materials at a very fast rate. Recently, a new trend has been introduced to combine the features of different machining processes. Such machining processes are called as Hybrid <b>Machining</b> Processes (HMPs). <b>Electro-Chemical</b> Spark <b>Machining</b> (ECSM) is an evolving advanced hybrid machining process comprising the techniques of electrochemical machining (ECM) and electro discharge machining (EDM). ECSM is useful for both conducting and non-conducting materials. ECSM is a hybrid process, where the material removal is achieved by thermal and chemical processes. In this work, an experiment on machining of glass with ECSM with different tool materials was conducted. A detailed study was also conducted {{to find out the}} influence of different machining parameters on the ECSM machining of glass and developed a mathematical model of the same...|$|R

40|$|Freeform {{surfaces}} are replacing traditional surfaces and have significantly reduced volume and weight and highly improved performance in modern complex optic systems, bio-systems and other disciplines [1]. These high-precision freeform components are enabled by state-of-the-art micro-machining technologies, compromising mechanical methods (diamond turning and polishing etc.), physical methods (laser beam and ion beam machining), and chemical methods (lithography, <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>machining</b> etc.). However, a fundamental pre-requisite {{to achieve the}} potential growth to these high-added value freeform components is to measure and characterize these components with the required accuracy such that their manufacturing quality can be controlled. The surface topography is a fingerprint of all process stages of the manufacturing process. Thus identifying and evaluating these topographical features on freeform surfaces left by production techniques are critically important in that they could present {{an indication of the}} manufacturing quality and offer feedback to the process control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Manufacture of micro {{holes in}} difficult-to-machine {{material}} is very difficult, <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>machining</b> (ECM) {{is one of}} the more appropriate approach. However, micro holes fabricated using ECM can have different diameters at the entrances and exits and such tapering effect is not localized. In this work, a new ECM method named electro-chemical micro drilling (ECMD) for machining high quality straight micro holes in difficult-to-machine material was introduced, and the micro-spherical electrode fabricated by a hybrid technique combining micro-ECM with one pulse electro discharge (OPED) was used in ECMD process. Micro-spherical electrode and ultra short pulses (tens of nanosecond scale) were used to locally dissolve the area with the effect of voltage, pulse width and pulse frequency on the localization distance being studied. High quality micro holes with a diameter of 42 µm in a 70 µm thick nickel foil were drilled using micro-spherical electrode with a sphere diameter of 30 µm...|$|E
40|$|Amidst all the {{evolutionary}} optimization algorithms Teaching–Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) {{seems to be}} a promising technique with relatively competitive performances. It outperforms some of the well-known metaheuristics regarding constrained benchmark functions, constrained mechanical design, and continuous non-linear numerical optimization problems. This dissertation presents the application of TLBO to various problems of mechanical engineering. Both constrained and unconstrained optimization has been performed on some manufacturing processes and design problems. Parametric optimization of three non-conventional machining processes namely electro-discharge machining, electrochemical <b>machining</b> and <b>electro-chemical</b> discharge <b>machining,</b> have been carried out and the results are compared with other evolutionary algorithms. Improvement in the existing TLBO algorithm has been incorporated in this dissertation using two schemes namely bit string mutation and replacement of worst solutions with fresh ones. Performance evaluation of these modifications have been presented in this dissertation by solving six optimization problems using original TLBO and proposed modifications. It has been found that better results are achieved in reaching the global optimal values by the use of these modifications. However, the results prefer the use of bit string mutation over scheme of replacing the worst solutions with fresh solutions in addition to the original logic of TLBO. The bit wise mutation and replacement of the worst solutions with fresh ones, proved an added advantage to the existing algorithm. Both these modifications resulted in a steeper convergence rate and finally provided global optimal solutions, and in some cases even better solutions than previously published results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a novel {{technique}} for the fabrication of Spiral grooves in a dynamic thrust bearing. The main scheme proposed in {{this paper is to}} fabricate the microgrooves using desktop forming system. This process has advantages compared to the conventional <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>machining</b> in the viewpoint of a higher productivity. For this reason, a new testing apparatus is designed and built for press forming microgrooves on a surface of the thrust bearing. The material used in this study is sintered Cu-Fe alloy.
