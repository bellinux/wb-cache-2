50|$|The <b>Fineness</b> <b>modulus</b> (FM) is an {{empirical}} figure obtained {{by adding the}} total percentage of the sample of an aggregate retained on each of a specified series of sieves, and dividing the sum by 100.

The same value of <b>fineness</b> <b>modulus</b> may therefore be obtained from several different particle size distributions. In general, however, a smaller value indicates a finer aggregate.

Sand deposits of varying gradation are available in different regions of the world. The prime use of sand, as fine aggregate is in the manufacture of concrete. As fine aggregate comprises up to 30 % of the total volume of concrete, consequently gradation and <b>fineness</b> <b>modulus</b> of sand are among principal factors affecting the performance of fresh and hardened concrete. For the purpose of this study, eight sand deposits were selected from various regions of Pakistan. The grain size distribution was compared with the ASTM gradation limits recommended for concrete. It was revealed that only two sands satisfy the ASTM gradation limits while all the others do not comply being on the finer side. For betterment of the construction industry, a sand optimization technique was developed. The optimization phase consisted of sieving the crusher fines and mixing different fractions of crusher fines with the natural sand in different combinations to get desired sand gradation. The optimized gradation curves matched with the ASTM limits and the optimized <b>fineness</b> <b>modulus</b> reached within the ASTM limits. The concrete made with optimized sands showed up to 39 % increase in compressive strength. The composition of mineral constituents was also evaluated through x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence, which indicated that the fine aggregate having higher silica content resulted in concrete with higher strength as compared to the one with higher calcium content.

In self-compacting concretes, finely-ground admixtures-microfillers are widely used for controlling technological properties.

Compressive strength, Tensile strength (cubes and cylinders) and Flexural strength up to 180 days of age were compared with those of concrete made with natural fine aggregates. <b>Fineness</b> <b>modulus,</b> specific gravity, moisture content, water absorption, bulk density, %voids, % porosity (loose and compact) state for sand (S) and SDA were also studied. The test results indicate {{that it is possible to}} manufac-ture concrete containing Sheet glass powder (SGP) with characteristics similar to those of natural sand aggregate concrete provided that the percentage of SGP as fine aggregate is limited to 10 - 20 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Glass is a {{transparent}} material produced by melting {{a mixture of}} materials such as silica, soda ash and Calcium carbonate at high temperature followed by cooling during which solidification occurs without crystallization. Glass is a unique inert material that could be recycled many times without changing its chemical properties. Using glass in concrete is an interesting possibility for economy on wastage disposals. The inclusion of fly ash in glass concrete reduces the alkali silica reaction and improves the workability and durability properties of concrete. Sheet glass aggregate used in concrete making leads to green environment. The objective of Present work {{is to find out}} the effectiveness of the fly ash and glass aggregate based concrete. In this investigation it was proposed that the use fly ash as cement replacement material and glass aggregate as fine aggregate material partially in concrete. Natural sand was partially replaced (10 % 20 % 30 %) with sheet glass aggregate. Compressive strength of cubes at 3 days, 7 days and 28 days of duration were studied. <b>Fineness</b> <b>modulus,</b> specific gravity, moisture content, water absorption was also studied. Based on the test results, the ideal percentage of mix which shows maximum compressive strength was identified...|$|E
40|$|Bottom ash is a coal plant {{by-product}} that {{is abundant}} and underutilized. There {{is the potential}} use of bottom ash as a fine aggregate replacement in concrete mixtures; however, the problems of water absorption and uniformity of quality of the material need to be overcome first. In this study, bottom ash was treated by sieve separation and pounding to smaller particle size {{for use as a}} sand substitute. The physical and chemical characteristics of bottom ash were tested after treatment including water absorption, sieve analysis, and <b>fineness</b> <b>modulus.</b> Highvolume fly ash (HVFA) mortar specimens were made and the compressive strength and flowability test using bottom ash after treatment are compared with that of the sand specimen. Low water to cementitious ratio was used to ensure higher strength from the cementitious paste and superplasticizer demand was determined for each treatment. The result showed that bottom ash can be used as fine aggregate replacement material. Sieve separation of the bottom ash could produce 75 % of the compressive strength compared with the control sand specimen, whereas pounded bottom ash could have up to 96 % of the compressive strength of the control specimen. A 28 -day compressive strength of 45 MPa was achievable with 100 % replacement of fine aggregate with bottom ash...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} fresh behaviour and mechanical properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) containing high volume of limestone, metakaolin, silica fume, zeolite, and viscosity modifying admixture. Two fine aggregates with different <b>fineness</b> <b>modulus</b> were also utilized {{to evaluate the}} effect of sand’s gradation on the mechanical and flow properties of SCC containing inert and pozzolanic powder. Slump flow, V-funnel for fresh concrete and 5 -minute-old concrete, J-ring, Orimet with and without J-ring, and L-box and U-box tests were performed on all 14 fresh concrete mixtures to examine the fresh properties of self-compacting concrete. Compressive strength of hardened specimens was measured at 7 and 35 days and tensile strength was also determined {{at the age of}} 28 days. The results show that sand grading significantly affects the fresh properties of SCC. It is also concluded that high volume of active powders including metakaolin, zeolite, and silica fume could not improve both the flow and mechanical properties of SCC at the same time. Limestone can be effectively used as filler in SCC in high volume content. A new set of limits for the L-box and U-box tests for SCC containing silica fume is also recommended as the existing criteria are not satisfactory...|$|E
