The supreme decision body is the University Council (CONSU), composed of all deans, plus several representatives from the academic community, students, administrative staff and the external community. The council meets roughly 4 to 5 times per year, ruling on high level administrative decisions such as approving the budget and has the final word in internal administrative processes.

5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> restart from the beginning.|$|E

After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> come after them.|$|E

5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E
5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on the topic <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> be done, but the key lesson to be learnt is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic.

5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by the dancing women that seek to entice him. The temptations {{overwhelm}} him {{to the point where he}} can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man wanting to have his way with her. It is revealed that the woman was Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin wanted to kill, and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins to haunt Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire.

5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E
5|$|The game cuts to September 1978, as Reza and his pacifist friend Babak Azadi (Omid Abtahi) watch crowds {{chanting}} {{about the}} revolution from a rooftop, and Reza takes photographs. The two then walk the streets, and {{arrive at a}} protest where revolution leaders are giving speeches. Reza's cousin Ali Shirazi (Nicholas Guilak) arrives and, when the protest is interrupted by soldiers and the crowd begins to disperse, he tries to convince Reza to throw rocks at the soldiers. Babak opposes, and Reza <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> decide whether to act aggressively and throw rocks, or act passively and voice his concerns instead. When the soldiers start threatening the crowds by firing, Reza and Babak flee into an alley, shortly followed by Ali and an injured Abbas (Ray Haratian), one of the revolution leaders who was stabbed in the commotion. After briefly being tended to, Abbas is escorted away by Ali and Bibi Golestan (Mozhan Marnò).|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer <b>is</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities and differences between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E

Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom {{for only a few}} seconds, to turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.|$|E

5|$|With Max Capricorn dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} highest authority, the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision.
