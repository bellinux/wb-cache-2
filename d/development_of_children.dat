Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|Whorf's views {{have been}} {{compared}} to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also {{been compared to}} the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, whose social constructivism considers the cognitive <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.|$|E
5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Rising {{rates of}} obesity and {{overweight}} {{is an increasing}} public health problem all over the world. Recent research has shown the importance of early life factors in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> overweight. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge there are no studies investigating the potential synergistic effect of early life factors and presence of parental overweight on the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> overweight. Methods The study was population-based and cross-sectional. The study population consisted <b>of</b> <b>children</b> who visited the Child Health Care (CHC) centers in Malmö for their 4 -year health check during 2003 - 2008 and whose parents answered a self-administered questionnaire (n = 9009 children). Results The results showed that having overweight/obese parents was strongly associated with the child being overweight or obese. Furthermore, there was an association between unfavorable early life factors (i. e., mother smoking during pregnancy, presence of secondhand tobacco smoke early in life, high birth weight) and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> overweight/obesity at four years of age, while breastfeeding seemed to have a protective role. For example, maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1. 47 (95 % CI: 1. 22, 1. 76) for overweight and 2. 31 (95 % CI: 1. 68, 3. 17) for obesity. The results further showed synergistic effects between parental overweight and exposure to unfavourable early life factors in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> overweight. Conclusions The present study shows the importance of early life factors in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> overweight and obesity, and thus puts focus on the importance of early targeted interventions. </p...|$|R

25|$|Jean Macfarlane {{founded the}} University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, {{formerly}} called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute {{was instrumental in}} initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> {{in terms of their}} socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.|$|E
