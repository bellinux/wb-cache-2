5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency.|$|E

5|$|The UN Charter {{stipulates}} that each primary {{organ of the}} United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E
5|$|Weinberg {{remained}} {{active in}} retirement. In 1992 {{he was named}} chairman of the International Friendship Bell Committee, which arranged for the installation of a Japanese bell in Oak Ridge. He also called for strengthening of the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency and systems to defend against nuclear weapons. His first wife, Margaret, died in 1969. He later married a stock broker, Genevieve DePersio, who died in 2004. His son David died in 2003. Weinberg died {{at his home in}} Oak Ridge on October 18, 2006. He was survived by his other son, Richard, and sister Fay Goleman.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons. In {{the face of the}} destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the nuclear arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons. The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an <b>international</b> <b>atomic</b> development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E
50|$|In 1897, the German Society of Chemistry, {{following}} a proposal by Hermann Emil Fischer, appointed a three-person working committee {{to report on}} atomic weights. The committee consisted of Chairman Prof. Hans H. Landolt (Berlin University), Prof. Wilhelm Ostwald (University of Leipzig), and Prof. Karl Seubert (University of Hanover). This committee published its first report in 1898, in which the committee suggested the desirability of an <b>international</b> committee on <b>atomic</b> weights. On 30 March 1899 Landolt, Ostwald and Seubert issued an invitation to other national scientific organizations to appoint delegates to the <b>International</b> Committee on <b>Atomic</b> Weights. Fifty-eight members were appointed to the Great <b>International</b> Committee on <b>Atomic</b> Weights, including Frank W. Clarke. The large committee conducted its business by correspondence to Landolt which created difficulties and delays associated with correspondence among fifty-eight members. As a result, on 15 December 1899, the German committee asked the International members to select a small committee of three to four members. In 1902, Prof. Frank W. Clarke (USA), Prof. Karl Seubert (Germany), and Prof. Thomas Edward Thorpe (UK) were elected, and the <b>International</b> Committee on <b>Atomic</b> Weights published its inaugural report in 1903 under the chairmanship of Prof. Clarke.|$|R

5|$|Baxter was {{recruited}} by the then-New South Wales University of Technology {{as a professor of}} chemical engineering in 1949. He {{became one of the most}} prolific public advocates of nuclear power for Australia. He served as chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1957 to 1972 and the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency from 1969 to 1970. He oversaw the construction of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) at Lucas Heights. He also founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and, as the chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust, brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E
5|$|From 1943 to 1945, he coordinated Manhattan Project work on {{plutonium}} purification and production. He also coordinated {{development of}} techniques to industrially refine polonium {{for use with}} beryllium in the triggers of atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project, part of which {{was conducted on the}} estate of his wife's family. Shortly before the war ended, he took over the management of the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948. Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise <b>international</b> <b>atomic</b> inspection, which culminated in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the National Security Council, and served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Secretary of State Dean Acheson {{appointed}} Thomas {{to serve}} on a panel with Robert Oppenheimer, David Lilienthal, Chester I. Barnard and Harry Winne to appraise <b>international</b> <b>atomic</b> inspection, culminating in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the Science Advisory Committee, an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning. In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to the National Security Council, {{and he was the}} U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, Thomas was part of a group that persuaded Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy to establish DARPA.|$|E

5|$|In August 1922, Marie Curie {{became a}} member of the newly created International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. In 1923, she wrote a {{biography}} of Pierre, entitled Pierre Curie. In 1925, she visited Poland, to participate in the ceremony that laid foundations for the Radium Institute in Warsaw. Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium; it was opened in 1932 and her sister Bronisława became its director. These distractions from her scientific labours and the attendant publicity caused her much discomfort but provided resources needed for her work. In 1930, she was elected a member of the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Weights Committee where she served until her death.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals {{associated with the}} UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), {{a contributor to the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter {{for his role in the}} organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an <b>international</b> <b>Atomic</b> Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
