5000|$|Although the WIFU was {{considered}} to be top league in Western Canada, the WCRFU remained as the governing body for football in Western Canada. In years past, the playoffs saw the Alberta and British Columbia champions play each other in one semi final while the champions of Manitoba and Saskatchewan would play in the other semi final. In 1936, there were still provincial unions in BC, Alberta and Saskatchewan and the WCRFU declared that these teams had the right to compete for the Western Championship.When the 1936 season began, the WIFU wasn't a member of the WCRFU yet and these teams were not eligible to compete in the playoffs. An early season meeting of the WCRFU resulted in the existing playoff format carrying over for one more season with one amendment. The Regina Roughriders and Winnipegs would face each other in a playoff to determine who would <b>fill</b> <b>hole</b> vacated by the MRFU. It was also decided that if the Calgary Bronks were to qualify for the WCRFU playoffs, they would have to do so as champions of the ARFU. The decisions effectively rendered the WIFU regular season irrelevant as the WIFU league games would not affect whether a team made the playoffs. To give the WIFU season some significance, it was decided that if two WIFU teams met in the WCRFU playoffs that the points differential in the WIFU standings would carry forward into the playoff series. Thus, when the Calgary Bronks met the Regina Roughriders in the WCRFU final, the Roughriders began the game with a 5-0 lead. (The maximum amount that could be carried forward was converted touchdown or six points) ...|$|E

The improvements are implemented by considering depth cue in the calculation of the priority term and the energy function, both of which are used for the best exemplar searching procedure.|$|E

30|$|For {{performance}} evaluation, we used six test sequences: ‘Akko’, ‘Ballroom’, ‘Exit’, ‘Flamenco 2 ’, ‘Race 1 ’, and ‘Rena’. The sequences include slow-, middle-, and fast-translational/rotational {{motions and}} camera panning. ‘Race 1 ’ is an outdoor sequence {{and the others}} are indoor sequences. The color format and dimension of all the sequences are 4 : 0 : 0 YUV and 640 × 480 pixels, respectively. In addition, performance of the proposed and conventional methods[4 – 6] was evaluated for not only original videos, but also decoded videos from H. 264 /AVC bitstreams. The bitstreams werecoded with JM 17.2. The frame rate for ‘Akko’, ‘Flamenco 2 ’, ‘Race 1 ’, and ‘Rena’ sequences is 15 fps and that for ‘Ballroom’ and ‘Exit’ is 12.5 fps. These sequences were used for video compression standardization. In our experiment, we used 50 frames for each sequence. We used four QP values (22, 27, 32, and 37). Two layers are used in the proposed hierarchical motion estimation based on the trade-off between complexity and motion estimation accuracy. The block size is set to 16 × 16 in all the layers and 7 × 7 in the bi-directional ME. In addition, the search range is set to ± 32 in the coarse layer and ± 16 in the fine layer. Hierarchical OBME/MC is conducted when a SAD value between two matched blocks is smaller than the threshold (6000). Otherwise, the block is set to a hole. For the hole, bi-directional interpolation is used when the normalized SAD is smaller than 10. Otherwise, the spatial linear interpolation is used to <b>fill</b> <b>hole</b> regions. All the thresholds are empirically determined. Computational loads are evaluated with the Intel dual core system.|$|E
40|$|This Final Report on the Monitoring Phase of {{the former}} Weeks Island Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil storage {{facility}} details the results of five years of monitoring of various surface accessible quantities at the decommissioned facility. The Weeks Island mine was authorized by the State of Louisiana as a Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil storage facility from 1979 until decommissioning of the facility in 1999. Discovery of a sinkhole over the facility in 1992 with freshwater inflow to the facility threatened {{the integrity of the}} oil storage and led to the decision to remove the oil, fill the chambers with brine, and decommission the facility. Thereafter, a monitoring phase, by agreement between the Department of Energy and the State, addressed facility stability and environmental concerns. Monitoring of the surface ground water and the brine of the underground chambers from the East <b>Fill</b> <b>Hole</b> produced no evidence of hydrocarbon contamination, which suggests that any unrecovered oil remaining in the underground chambers has been contained. Ever diminishing progression of the initial major sinkhole, and a subsequent minor sinkhole, with time was verification of the response of sinkholes to filling of the facility with brine. Brine filling of the facility ostensively eliminates any further growth or new formation from freshwater inflow. Continued monitoring of sinkhole response, together with continued surface surveillance for environmental problems, confirmed the intended results of brine pressurization. Surface subsidence measurements over the mine continued throughout the monitoring phase. And finally, the outward flow of brine was monitored as a measure of the creep closure of the mine chambers. Results of each of these monitoring activities are presented, with their correlation toward assuring the stability and environmental security of the decommissioned facility. The results suggest that the decommissioning was successful and no contamination of the surface environment by crude oil has been found...|$|E

We use a signed distance field (SDF) as an intermediate representation, which stores Euclidean signed distances from a voxel to the nearest point of the mesh model. Since the signs of a SDF become unstable around holes or gaps, we take a consensus of the signed distances of neighbor voxels by estimating the consistency of the SDF. Once we make the SDF consistent, we can efficiently <b>fill</b> <b>holes</b> and gaps. ...|$|R
