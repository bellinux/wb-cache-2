The primary objective {{of this study was}} to assess the change in hemoglobin levels in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) following treatment with biosimilar Retacrit® (<b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta).</b> Secondary objectives included changes in hematologic parameters and tolerability. Methods: This was a non-interventional, multicenter, long-term observational study that is part of an ongoing surveillance program for <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta.</b> Adult patients (N= 291) with solid tumors, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma, and chemotherapy-induced symptomatic anemia, who were eligible for treatment with biosimilar <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta,</b> were enrolled. Patients were evaluated at enrollment, 3 months, and 6 months. Results: Evaluable patients had lymphoma or myeloma (n= 30) or solid tumors (n= 260). At 3 months, patients with lymphoma and myeloma showed the greatest increase in mean (SD) hemoglobin from 9. 2 (0. 9) to 11. 0 (1. 8) g/dL, whereas patients with breast cancer showed the smallest increase from 10. 0 (1. 0) to 11. 1 (1. 2) g/dL. At 6 months, the greatest mean increase occurred in patients with lymphoma or myeloma from 11. 0 (1. 8) to 11. 7 (2. 3) g/dL, and the smallest in patients with other solid tumors from 10. 9 (1. 4) to 11. 1 (1. 5) g/dL. Patient evaluation of <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> therapy was positive, as most patients expressed satisfaction with <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> treatment during the study, compliance with treatment was high, and most indicated their willingness to be retreated if necessary. <b>Epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> was also well tolerated; overall, in 25 patients (8. 6 %), there were 31 adverse events. Conclusion: Despite variability among different disease groups, <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> was effective and well tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.

40|$|Aim: This {{observational}} {{clinical study}} tested {{the effect of}} injection frequency of the biosimilar <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> on the weekly dose needed to maintain stable hemoglobin levels in chronic kidney diseases (CKD) patients on intermittent high-flux hemodialysis (HD). Patients and Methods: CKD patients (n = 33) on regular HD therapy 3 times a week were treated for 18 months with <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> i. v. The hemoglobin levels, the weekly dose {{as well as the}} injection fre-quency of <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> were monitored at least every two weeks. Patients were followed in three time periods: 1) ex-tended follow-up (months 1 - 18); 2) intervention phase (months 19 - 21); and 3) post intervention observation phase (months 28 - 30). During extended follow-up the majority of patients (n = 21) received only one injection of <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> per week. During the intervention phase, injection frequency was increased to 3 injections per week in all patients accompanied by a reduction in weekly doses of approximately 20 %- 30 %. Following a 9 -month period of dose adjust-ment all parameters were monitored again in the post-intervention phase. Results: During the first 18 months of <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> therapy the mean hemoglobin level was stable between 11 and 12 g/dl. The mean weekly dose of <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> was 7939 IU/week in month 6 and 7909 IU/week in month 18 (p = not significant). The mean frequency (injections/week) was 1. 27 in month 6 and 1. 29 in month 18 (not significant). Compared to month 18, {{at the end of the}} observation at month 30, hemoglobin levels were stable, mean injection frequency increased to 2. 25 (p < 0. 001) and the mean weekl...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{requirements}} for the reimbursement of biosimilars and to compare the reimbursement status, market share, and reimbursement costs of biosimilars in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from the following CEE countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The requirements for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilars were reviewed for each country. Data on the extent of reimbursement of biologic drugs (separately for original products and biosimilars) in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected for each country, along with data on the total pharmaceutical and total public health care budgets. Results: Our survey revealed that no specific criteria were applied for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilars in the selected CEE countries; the price of biosimilars was usually reduced compared with original drugs and specific price discounts were common. Substitution and interchangeability were generally allowed, although in most countries they were at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment. Original biologic drugs and the corresponding biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed. The reimbursement rate of biosimilars in the majority of the countries was the same and amounted to 100 %. Generally, the higher shares of expenditures were shown for the reimbursement of original drugs than for biosimilars, except for filgrastim, somatropin, and <b>epoetin</b> (alfa and <b>zeta).</b> The shares of expenditures on the reimbursement of biosimilar products ranged from 8. 0 % in Estonia in 2014 to 32. 4 % in Lithuania in 2015, and generally increased in 2015. The share of expenditures on reimbursement of biosimilars in the total pharmaceutical budget differed between the countries, with the highest observed value for Slovakia and Hungary and the lowest—for Croatia. Conclusions: The requirements for the pricing and reimbursement of biosimilar products as well as the access of patients to biologic treatment do not differ significantly between the considered CEE countries. Biosimilar drugs significantly influence the reimbursement systems of these countries, and the expenditure on the reimbursement of biosimilars is increasing as they are becoming more accessible to patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{recombinant}} human erythropoietins and allied proteins (epoetin alfa, attempted copies and biosimilar variants of epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin delta, <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta,</b> epoetin theta, epoetin omega, darbepoetin alfa, and methoxy-polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) {{are among the}} most successful and earliest examples of biotechnologically manufactured products to be used in clinical medicine. This article charts a brief history of their use in clinical medicine, mainly dealing with chronic kidney disease, paying special attention to how these agents were introduced into clinical medicine and what has happened subsequently; in 2009, there were several developments that could be regarded as a “perfect storm ” in terms of the long-term use of these compounds in chronic kidney disease and oncology and, likely, elsewhere. We are now very much at a “crossroads, ” where mature reflection is required, because with the latest trials and meta-analyses, these therapies seem not only expensive but also very much a clinical tradeoff (increased risk of adverse effects versus a small gain in fatigue scores). How we arrived at this crossroads is a useful illustration of how easy it is, without properly designed randomized, controlled trials, to assume that clinical benefit must follow therapeutic interventions.

40|$|Anemia is a {{frequent}} complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to {{the inability of the}} kidneys to release sufficient erythropoietin to regulate the production of red blood cells. Administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is highly effective in correcting anemia of CKD. The ESAs currently approved in Italy are epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin theta, darbepoetin alfa, CERA and biosimilars epoetin alfa and <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta.</b> All the ESAs are effective in correcting renal anemia and increasing hemoglobin levels, but the choice of which to use should also take into account their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, their administration route, and economic issues. However, regarding the optimal use of ESAs an issue that remains controversial is the most appropriate dose conversion between epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa. In fact clinical experience demonstrates that the dose relationship between epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa is non proportional across the dosing spectrum. In this review is presented an update on the latest available evidence in the treatment of anemia in CKD patients, with particular reference to the definition of the correct conversion ratio EPO:DARB. </span...|$|E

Biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agents lower costs of supportive cancer treatment, and thus are particularly relevant in the elderly cancer population, which is growing rapidly worldwide. The goal of this subanalysis was to compare the tolerability and effectiveness of an epoetin biosimilar for treating CIA in patients < 70 years old vs patients ≥ 70 years old. Materials and methods: The ORHEO observational trial enrolled patients with CIA (hemoglobin [Hb] < 11 g/dL) in association with chemotherapy for solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma. Patients received an epoetin biosimilar and were evaluated at 3 and 6 months for response, defined as achieving target Hb without blood transfusions during the 3 weeks preceding measurement, Hb ≥ 10 g/dL, or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/dL since study enrollment. Secondary end points included changes in Hb level, treatment interruptions, transfusion rates, and adverse events. Results: Among the 2, 310 original patients, 1, 301 < 70 years old were compared to 1, 009  ≥ 70  years old. Almost all patients (99. 9 %) received the biosimilar <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta</b> (Retacrit). Patients in both groups responded well to treatment with biosimilar epoetin, with 79. 8 % and 84 % responding at 3 months and 86. 3 % and 86. 8 % at 6 months among younger and elderly cohorts, respectively. Biosimilar epoetin therapy was well tolerated, with adverse events reported in only 17. 6 % and 16. 4 % of younger and elderly patients, respectively. A greater number of thromboembolic events and a lesser rate of infections were reported in the elderly, but were still lower than reported in clinical registration trials. No treatment fatalities occurred in either group. Conclusion: Biosimilar epoetin was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for managing CIA in elderly cancer patients.

40|$|Background: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) {{increase}} {{red blood}} cell production in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA). In Europe, short-acting ESAs (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, <b>epoetin</b> <b>zeta,</b> and epoetin theta) and a long-acting ESA (darbepoetin alfa) are available to treat CIA. Objective: This systematic review aimed to determine potential dose efficiency {{associated with the use}} of different ESAs for the treatment of CIA according to European labeling. Methods: A systematic review of ESA studies with starting doses according to European labeling was conducted according to published methodology. Measures of dose efficiency were defined as mean weekly doses to achieve target hemoglobin level or final dose and dose adjustments (dose increase, decrease, or withheld). Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched up to July 2012. Data were selected for analysis using an evidence hierarchy and quantitatively analyzed to assess statistical homogeneity. Where pooling of data was not appropriate, a narrative summary with descriptive statistics (medians and ranges) was reported. Results: Fifty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five studies considered to represent the highest level of evidence were extracted and included in the analysis. The analysis showed a high degree of statistical heterogeneity, often precluding metaanalysis. The patients included in the analysis were representative of those encountered in clinical practice, and patient characteristics were similar between the short-acting and the darbepoetin alfa groups. Mean weekly doses appeared similar to 30 % lower with darbepoetin alfa versus short-acting ESAs (median, 136. 5 mu g or 27, 300 RI [range, 21, 560 - 38, 260 IU] vs 38, 230 IU [range, 31, 634 - 42, 714 RI], respectively), resulting in a mean weekly dose ratio of 1 : 280. Darbepoetin alfa patients appeared to need fewer dose increases compared with short-acting ESAs (pooled, 0. 75 %; I- 2 = 21 % vs median 26. 6 % [range, 7. 6 %- 44. 6 %]) and more dose decreases (median, 74 % [range, 57 %- 75 %] vs 22 % [range, 2. 8 %- 59 %]). A similar percentage of darbepoetin alfa and short-acting ESA patients required a dose to be withheld (20 % and 33 % [2 studies] vs median 33. 2 % [range, 12. 6 %- 51. 1 %]). Conclusions: Statistical heterogeneity between studies was high, although clinically the studies represented medical practice. Without randomized clinical trials directly comparing darbepoetin alfa and short-acting ESAs, these findings are tentative and future research is warranted.
