2500|$|One {{of these}} {{versions}} caused a major controversy in 1926, when photographer Edward Steichen purchased it and shipped {{it to the}} United States. Customs officers did not accept the Bird {{as a work of}} art and assessed customs duty on its import as an <b>industrial</b> <b>item.</b> After protracted court proceedings, this assessment was overturned, thus confirming the Bird's status as a duty-exempt work of art. The ruling also established the important principle that [...] "art" [...] does not have to involve a realistic representation of nature, and that it was legitimate for it to simply represent an abstract concept – in this case [...] "flight".|$|E

Their forged titanium products, such as discs and seamless rings for jet engines; hemispheres, elliptical closures and contoured seamless body sections were used in all U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles of the time, such as Atlas, Minuteman, Titan.

In order to identify those <b>industrial</b> <b>items</b> for which the seismic risk is high, a new approach based on a census data sheet and multi-criteria analysis taking into account both structural behaviour and industrial hazard is presented.

5000|$|Engineer Petras Vileišis {{established}} an ironwork workshop in 1900. It produced various <b>industrial</b> <b>items</b> (cisterns, caissons, parts for iron bridges, railroad switches, etc.) and smaller consumer products (fences, memorial crosses, lanterns, etc.).

It employed almost exclusively Lithuanian workers. It was located near the Vilnius Railway Station (present-day Paneriai Street) and had its own railway connection to transport the heavy products. In 1906, Jonas Basanavičius lent 19,000 rubles to Vileišis who offered his workshop as a security. Vileišis faced financial difficulties and had to sell the workshop which became {{the basis of the}} Vilija factory.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for a fast coarse 2 D- 3 D-registration of <b>industrial</b> <b>items</b> without any initial pose. The references {{will be some}} X-ray projections gained during a computer tomography. The shadow of the specimen is assumed to fit completely on the detector. This allows an approximation of the barycentre of the specimen. This point serves as translation and as center of rotation in the coarse registration. The coarse rotation is determined by checking the similarity of the reference and template images on an equidistant grid. Before that step the intensity images are transformed into attenuation images. These will be compared with simulated length projections. By this the distortion of the exponential attenuation is avoided and a linear relationship between the images is generated. The measure of similarity used for the coarse registration of these images is normalised cross correlation as it showed the best behaviour...|$|R
40|$|A seismic shift has {{occurred}} in the 21 st century. It {{is not so much a}} shift of the continental plates which organize the world's surface, but a shift in the relationships among the people of those land masses. These relationships were previously forged by the view that the many citizens of Asian countries were hard working but relatively poor. In the countries beyond Asia, the products of this hard work were familiar with such manufacturing designations as "Made in Japan," "Made in Korea," and "Made in China" adorning many household and <b>industrial</b> <b>items.</b> In the middle of the 20 th century, the notion that the citizens of these countries would become the tourists of the 21 st century was barely conceivable. By the end of the millennium, it was apparent that this was an old fashioned view. The world had indeed begun to welcome Asian tourists...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} <b>industrial</b> {{property}} <b>item</b> monetary evaluation {{within the framework}} of the cost approach and in view of the preparation of the item to further transfer is proposed. Unlike the existing ones, the proposed method permits to obtain a higher level of forecasting precision of economic cost elements as part of the first cost of an <b>industrial</b> property <b>item,</b> which allows using this method in long-term planning. This method provides an opportunity to account for the following: the existing adjusting economic and statistical indicators specially designed for such purposes (inflation indexes etc.); the state-approved values of specific economic cost elements (minimum wage, fuel and electric power etc.); other adjusting indicators subject to calculation, particularly the cost indexes (of proceeds and turnover) of an enterprise as well as the indexes of physical production volume, risk factors etc. It is advisable to apply the individual price indexes of the enterprise proposed in the article while using this method...|$|R

40|$|A high {{percentage}} of analogue integrated circuit designs use voltage domain signal processing techniques. Given the fact that integrated circuit current conveyors are high bandwidth current processing devices, often with superior RF performance compared to comparable voltage domain devices, {{it is surprising that}} the number of current mode integrated circuits available, as standard of-the-shelf <b>industrial</b> <b>items,</b> is so small. This paper introduces equation-deﬁned device and Verilog-A synthesis approaches to the macromodelling of current conveyor integrated circuits. To illustrate the proposed modelling techniques the properties of a number of modular behavioural level current conveyor macromodel cells are described and their performance compared. The material presented is intended for analogue device modellers and circuit designers who wish to simulate large signal current domain integrated circuit designs. It also demonstrates how synthesized Verilog-A modules can be derived from equation-deﬁned device and conventional subcircuits to form functional, computationally efﬁcient current conveyor macromodels. To illustrate the application of behavioural current conveyor macromodels the design of a six cell CCII+ instrumentation ampliﬁer is introduced and its performance discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} for {{this paper is}} the analysis of a cohort where not only the survival time of patients, or time to failure of <b>industrial</b> <b>items,</b> but also their level of degradation, classified into {{a finite number of}} states, is under study. The process is assumed to be semi-Markov in order to weaken the usual Markov assumption which is often too restrictive. The behavior of such a process is defined through the initial probabilities on the set of possible states, the direct transition probabilities between any two states and the sojourn times distributions in any state as functions of the actual state and the one reached from there {{at the end of the}} sojourn. Two models are considered: on one side the most usual model in this framework which is the independent competing risk (ICR) model and a general semi-Markov model (GSM) embedding (ICR). Based on an estimation of the direct transition probabilities in the general semi-Markov model (GSM) embedding (ICR), we derive a goodness of fit test for th...|$|R
