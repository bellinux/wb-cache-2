30|$|The {{variable}} restrictive <b>immigration</b> <b>policies</b> is a dummy {{equal to}} one if the potential migrant {{does not give}} up on migration if the <b>immigration</b> <b>policies</b> in the host countries become tight. Contrary to what one might expect, this variable has a significant and positive sign (Table 4, Columns 3 and 4). This means that tighter <b>immigration</b> <b>policies</b> enforced by the host countries {{have a positive effect}} on the propensity to migrate illegally. These policies deter those who are willing to migrate legally more than potential illegal migrants. This result suggests that restrictive <b>immigration</b> <b>policies</b> may be less effective in staving off illegal migration and can incite potential migrants to turn to illegal methods, such as paying a smuggler or corrupting officials to obtain legal documents.|$|R
5|$|After Labor's {{defeat at}} the 2001 federal election, Gillard {{was elected to}} the Shadow Cabinet under then-Labor Leader Simon Crean, where she was given {{responsibility}} for Population and Immigration. In February 2003, she was given additional responsibilities for Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs. In these roles, {{in the wake of the}} Tampa and Children Overboard affairs, which were partly credited with Labor's 2001 election loss, Gillard developed a new <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> for the Labor Party.|$|E

According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive <b>immigration</b> <b>policy,</b> similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E

5|$|Taft {{continued}} the policy against immigration from China and Japan as under Roosevelt.

5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> to be {{implemented}} in the UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{best known}} for his work in applied {{philosophy}} concerning refugees, <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> and genocide, Adelman published a major study entitled Early Warning and Conflict Management: Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda (1996) as part of the 5 volume study International Response to Conflict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience. In 1999, he co-edited The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire, already regarded a classic on the subject. Adelman served as an associate editor for the Macmillan three-volume Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity (2005). These efforts earned international acclaim.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about <b>immigration</b> <b>policy.</b> Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Bureau of Statistics {{forecast}} {{that the}} population may shrink to 3.1million by 2051, depending on actual birth rate {{and the level of}} net migration. The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7million, with exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars. The natural growth rate of the population is currently negative with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s. In recent years, the Croatian government has been pressured each year to add 40% to work permit quotas for foreign workers. In accordance with its <b>immigration</b> <b>policy,</b> Croatia is trying to entice emigrants to return.|$|E

Hong Kong maintains an international border with mainland China across 5 border control stations by land, 3 entry and exit points by sea and the International Airport. Applications for entry permits are, however, handled by Chinese Embassies for Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|With the {{republic}} suffering heavy losses after the war, Stalin allowed an open <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> in Armenia; the diaspora {{were invited to}} repatriate to Armenia (nergaght) and revitalize the country's population and bolster its workforce. Armenians living {{in countries such as}} Cyprus, France, Greece, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria were primarily the survivors or the descendants of the genocide. They were offered the option of having their expenses paid by the Soviet government for their trip back to their homeland. An estimated 150,000Armenians immigrated to Soviet Armenia between 1946 and 1948 and settled in Yerevan, Leninakan, Kirovakan and other towns.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} Kaifeng, the Jurchens went on {{to conquer}} the rest of northern China, while the Song Chinese court fled south. They took up temporary residence at Nanjing, where a surviving prince was named Emperor Gaozong of Song in 1127. Jin forces halted at the Yangzi River, but staged continual raids south of the river until a later boundary was fixed at the Huai River further north. With the border fixed at the Huai, the Song government would promote an <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> of repopulating and resettling territories north of the Yangzi River, since vast tracts of vacant land between the Yangzi and Huai were open for landless peasants found in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces of the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{railways}} {{would not}} build across the western frontier without settlement {{as it would}} be too costly to provide train service across a barren wilderness. The Clifford Sifton <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> encourages settlers to arrive. Western settlement began and immigration encroached across the Manitoba boundary into the North-West Territories, later to become Saskatchewan. Immigration settlement to the last best west and the highway early beginnings began in the southeast. The federal government survey crew reached this southeastern area of the District of Assiniboia, North-West Territories in 1880. In 1881, the province of Manitoba expanded to its present boundaries and land could be purchased for $10 an acre. U.S. President Lincoln's Homestead Act was passed in 1862 and lands there were taken. In 1872, Canada passed the Dominion Lands Act, attracting homesteaders to the West.|$|E
