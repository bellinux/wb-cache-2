40|$|International audienceAIM: To compare {{different}} methods of assessing dietary exposure to flavourings {{in the context}} of a stepwise approach. METHODS: The dietary exposure to four flavourings was determined: raspberry ketone, <b>glycyrrhizinic</b> <b>acid,</b> coumarin, and caffeine. When dietary exposure exceeded the safety limits, the need for more detailed assessment using less aggregated data was judged necessary. First, screening methods (Maximized Survey-Derived Daily Intake - MSDI, Single-Portion Exposure Technique - SPET and modified Theoretical Added Maximum Daily Intake - mTAMDI) were applied. Next, individual food consumption data were used for creating models with different levels of detail to identify the foods: a model based on food groups and models based on food items. Three food item models were developed: without improvements of the flavouring descriptor built in the software; with improvements; with use of non-specified flavour descriptors. Consumption data were collected from 121 Dutch adults using a computerized 2 x 24 h-dietary recall (EPIC-Soft) in the European Food Consumption Validation (EFCOVAL) study. RESULTS: Based on results of at least one of the three screening methods, refined assessment was necessary for raspberry ketone, <b>glycyrrhizinic</b> <b>acid</b> and caffeine. When applying the food group model, the need of refinement was indicated for the four flavourings. When applying the food item models, only <b>glycyrrhizinic</b> <b>acid</b> and caffeine presented dietary exposure above the safety limits. In the raspberry ketone case, dietary exposure increased when improvements in food description were considered. The use of non-specified flavour descriptors hardly changed the results.

40|$|SUMMARY Carbenoxolone (Biogastrone, Berk) {{has been}} shown to reduce the peptic {{activity}} and total acidity of gastric juice obtained from anaesthetized pylorus-ligated rats without affecting significantly the volume of gastric juice secreted or the K+ concentration. Glycyr-rhetinic acid was less potent in reducing peptic activity and caused no reduction in total acidity. Antipeptic activity of carbenoxolone has also been demonstrated in vitro using the pepsin plate technique and the haemoglobin pepsin assay. It is suggested that these actions of carbenoxolone may contribute to the increased rate of healing of peptic ulcer in patients treated with the drug.

In this study, we reinvestigated the effect of CBX on the induction of HSPs in HeLa and human neuroblastoma (A- 172) cells. CBX clearly induced not only Hsp 70 but also Hsp 90 (HSPC 1), Hsp 40 (DNAJB 1), and Hsp 27 (HSPB 1) at concentrations of 10 to 800  μM for 16  h incubation. At higher concentrations (more than 400  μM), however, CBX appeared to be toxic. Treatment of cells with CBX resulted in enhanced phosphorylation and acquisition of DNA-binding ability of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF 1).

Furthermore, thermotolerance was induced by CBX treatment, as determined by clonogenic survival.

When Onpito (TJ- 8117, Kampo medicine) containing licorice and rhubarb was administered orally to human subjects, we observed that the AUC (0 -lim) and Cmax of glycyrrhetic acid (GA) in plasma were lower than those treated with other Kampo medicines containing licorice. In this study, we demonstrate the pharmacokinetic interactions of GA derived from <b>glycyrrhizinic</b> <b>acid</b> (GL) in licorice and anthraquinones derived from rhubarb. To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the pharmacokinetic interactions between two herbs. When GL was orally co-administrated to rats with a non-effective dose of sennoside A having purgative activity, the AUC (0 -lim) and Cmax of GA decreased. In addition, sennoside A did not affect the metabolism of GL by the intestinal bacteria in vitro. In the examination using an in situ loop of rat colon, the remaining ratio of GA rose drastically by the co-administration of sennoside A, sennidin A and rhein. Observed inhibition activity of these anthraquinones on GA absorption depended on the concentration of the components added. The maximum inhibition ratio was approximately 75 % by rhein, 60 % by sennoside A and 25 % by sennidin A. We conclude that the decrease of the pharmacokinetic parameters of GA in human plasma observed in the clinical study of TJ- 8117 is attributable to an interactive action of absorption from the intestinal tract by anthraquinones contained in or derived from rhubarb. © 2005 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chronic {{hypokalemia}} is {{the main}} finding in patients with Gitelman's syndrome. Exogenous factors can trigger deterioration of the patient's condition and provoke clinical symptoms. We discuss the pathophysiology of and therapy for Gitelman's syndrome, {{with a focus on}} dietary factors which may aggravate the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 31 -year-old, previously apparently healthy Caucasian Swiss man who presented to our hospital with gait disturbance of subacute onset and a potassium level of 1. 5 mmol/L. A detailed medical history revealed that he had been consuming large amounts of licorice (in the form of Fisherman's Friend menthol eucalyptus lozenges). Despite discontinuing the intake of <b>glycyrrhizinic</b> <b>acid,</b> his potassium level remained low. Biochemical investigations showed refractory hypokalemia and secondary hyperaldosteronism, suggestive of Gitelman's syndrome. Despite treatment with supplementation of potassium and magnesium in combination with an aldosterone antagonist, further clinically symptomatic episodes occurred. Triggers could be identified only by repeated detailed history taking. In response to the patient's dietary excesses (ingestion of relevant amounts of alcohol, lemon juice and iced tea), his hypokalemia was aggravated and provoked clinical symptoms. Finally, vomiting and failure to replace salt led to volume depletion and hypokalemic crisis, with a plasma potassium level of 1. 0 mmol/L and paralysis with respiratory failure necessitating not only infusion of saline and potassium but also temporary mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Dietary preferences may have a much larger impact than any drug treatment on the symptoms of this chronic syndrome. Individual (mainly dietary) preferences must be monitored closely, and patients should be given dietary advice to avoid recurrent aggravation of hypokalemia with muscular weakness...|$|E

Simple statistics were used along with two-tailed Student’s t-test; P< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant before and after treatment. There were 70 eligible patients, of whom 62 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Age of subjects was 27. 8 ± 9. 5 years. At the time of the study, 100 % of the patients had HPV infection, 40 % were associated with LSIL, and only 16 % used a barrier contraceptive (condom) method. Resolution was achieved in all patients from 4 weeks of treatment initiation and improvement was achieved in the majority of patients at 12 weeks (74 %) (P< 0. 001).
