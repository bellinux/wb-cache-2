50|$|From July to September 1995 and {{in support}} of the active duty, both flying squadrons participated in the Air Mobility Command’s Atlantic and Pacific Expresses. These {{missions}} were patterned after the many flown during Desert Storm and incorporated the flying of mission <b>essential</b> <b>supply</b> parts on an expedited basis. The Atlantic Express flew out of Dover AFB, DE, through the Azores and into the Middle East theater. The Pacific Express started at Travis Air Force Base, California, and flew through Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, to Yokota Air Base, Japan. However, both express routes were canceled from the wing's list of taskings due to the extra day needed and the middle of the morning launches as it was hard for reservists to integrate their civilian schedules with the flight plans. Shortly after the express missions were canceled, the Wing picked up another shorter overseas mission which it flew regularly. It was the Thule mission. After spending the night at Dover Air Force Base, the crew flew to Thule, Greenland and back to either Wright-Patterson through either Dover or McGuire Air Force Base.|$|E
50|$|The Dutch-Swedish War, 1657-1660, was a Dutch {{intervention}} in the Northern Wars. When Charles X of Sweden {{had been unable to}} continue his hold on Poland — partly because the Dutch fleet relieved the besieged city of Danzig in 1656 — he turned his attention on Denmark, invading that country from what is now Germany. He broke a new agreement with Frederick III of Denmark and laid siege to Copenhagen. To the Dutch the Baltic trade was vital, both in quantity and quality. The Dutch had been able to convince Denmark, by threat of force, to keep the Sound tolls at a low level but they feared a strong Swedish empire would not be so complying. In 1658 they sent an expedition fleet of 75 ships, 3,000 cannon and 15000 troops; in the Battle of the Sound it defeated the Swedish fleet and relieved Copenhagen. In 1659 the Dutch liberated the other Danish Isles and the <b>essential</b> <b>supply</b> of grain, wood and iron from the Baltic was guaranteed once more.|$|E

50|$|Once again, Second World War {{had less}} {{military}} impact on South America than {{in many parts}} of the world, with the exception of Brazil. Because the country had joined the war on the Allies side and had allowed the United States to establish naval and air bases on its territory, it came under strong attack by Germany. The Axis powers were interested in disrupting the <b>essential</b> <b>supply</b> lines for the Allies in North Africa campaign. This supply line started in the Brazilian city of Natal.Therefore, Brazil suffered the only Axis attacks in South America. Over 35 Brazilian ships were sunk by German and Italian warships in the South Atlantic.In response to the attacks, the Brazilian Air Force and the Brazilian Navy sank over nine German submarines or U-boats. The following U-boats were sunk just of the coast of Brazil by Brazilian Armed Forces, U-164, U-128, U-590, U-513, U-662, U-598, U-199, U-591 and U-161. The unexpected success of the Brazilian Armed Forces against its U-boats, combined with a strong American presence in the Brazilian territory, made Germany abandon the South Atlantic after 1943.Brazil was also the only South American country to fight in the European war theater, deploying a 25,000 strong joint force - the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB). The Brazilian Army and Air Force fought in Italy and the Navy in the Atlantic Ocean. Just under a thousand Brazilian servicemen died during the conflict.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After {{conflict}} or {{breakdown of the}} state, successful democratic development will require an ample supply of leaders who have good reputations for responsible public service that can benefit all citizens. This <b>essential</b> <b>supply</b> of trusted democratic leadership can develop in responsible institutions of democratic local government, where successful local leaders can prove their qualifications to compete for higher office. If a transition to democracy begins with only national elections, however, then the winners will acquire a natural interest in centralizing power around themselves, and so political decentralization thereafter may become more difficult. Thus, those who would support {{the development of a}} new democracy need to recognize the potential advantages of decentralizing some power to elected local governments...|$|E

An empirical research was conducted, which enables a more descriptive and exploratory approach. The technique used in this research was semi-structured in depth interviews with key personnel from each firm. Lack of vertical integration is observed in the particular supply chain. Ephemeral dynamic collaborations prevail, not allowing information flow transparency. Multi fragmentation is evident in all levels of the supply chain. Most of the transactions are based on personal relations built with suppliers and customers, while e-communication and e-transactions act complementarily, if exist.

40|$|Abstract. Decentralization and {{democracy}} may improve {{the chances for}} successful economic development. The importance of local government {{and democracy}} {{is evident in the}} history of many countries, but democratic local government has been less common in Africa than elsewhere. Democratic political competition can improve governance only if voters have a choice among qualified candidates who have good reputations for exercising power responsibly in public service. This <b>essential</b> <b>supply</b> of trusted democratic leadership can develop best in responsible institutions of local government, where successful local leaders can prove their qualifications to become strong competitive candidates for higher office. Thus, a federal constitutional structure that devolves substantial powers to autonomously elected local governments can increase the chances for successful democratic development. Foreign assistance can help to increase this vital supply of leaders with good reputations for spending public funds responsibly if some share of foreign-assistance funding is distributed directly to local governments and other local public service agencies. 1...|$|E

The performance measures include average fulfillment rate, average stock cost, and average cycle time. Second, we conduct experiments on a multi-agent simulation platform to evaluate the supply chain performance affected by these factors under various order demand environments. Finally, results from experiments are analyzed to measure the effects of switching cost, trust, and information sharing on supply chain. Findings from this study can help managers better utilize switching cost and trust attributes to determine information sharing level in managing supply chain for B 2 B e-commerce. 1...|$|E
40|$|Matching {{electrical}} power supply to customer demand is an on-going problem for electricity distribution network operators and it is increasing {{with the growth of}} distributed renewable energy generation at the low voltage (LV) level. A battery energy storage system (BESS) has been suggested which would help the control of voltage levels, optimise renewable generation and supply the evening peak demand. In addition a BESS could offer ancillary support to the network including balancing services as well as deferring network asset upgrade, with ensuing financial advantages. Until now the cost of providing a BESS has been prohibitive except for the most isolated and <b>essential</b> <b>supply.</b> The main contribution of this paper will be to demonstrate that afterlife electric vehicle (EV) batteries can be used in BESS for the provision of such services with particular emphasis on peak shaving and upgrade deferral. The size of the BESS is calculated using a simulation based on a LV load profile and the effect on voltage is modelled and displayed graphically. Considering that the market penetration of EVs has been hampered by high cost of Li-ion batteries and with projections of the first set of used automotive batteries becoming available from 2019 an investigation into the afterlife usage of EV batteries is timely and economic. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Strengthened {{national}} health systems {{are necessary for}} effective and sustained expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART and its supply chain management in Uganda are largely based on parallel and externally supported efforts. The question arises whether systems are being strengthened to sustain access to ART. This study applies systems thinking to assess supply chain management, the role of external support and whether investments create the needed synergies to strengthen health systems. Methods This study uses the WHO health systems framework and examines the issues of governance, financing, information, human resources and service delivery in relation to supply chain management of medicines and the technologies. It looks at links and causal chains between supply chain management for ART and the national supply system for essential drugs. It combines data from the literature and key informant interviews with observations at health service delivery level in a study district. Results Current drug supply chain management in Uganda is characterized by parallel processes and information systems that result in poor quality and inefficiencies. Less than expected health system performance, stock outs and other shortages affect ART and primary care in general. Poor performance of supply chain management is amplified by weak conditions {{at all levels of}} the health system, including the areas of financing, governance, human resources and information. Governance issues include the lack to follow up initial policy intentions and a focus on narrow, short-term approaches. Conclusion The opportunity and need to use ART investments for an <b>essential</b> <b>supply</b> chain management and strengthened health system has not been exploited. By applying a systems perspective this work indicates the seriousness of missing system prerequisites. The findings suggest that root causes and capacities across the system have to be addressed synergistically to enable systems that can match and accommodate investments in disease-specific interventions. The multiplicity and complexity of existing challenges require a long-term and systems perspective essentially in contrast to the current short term and program-specific nature of external assistance. </p...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} water {{in urban areas}} and {{agricultural}} zones in arid and semi-arid coastal regions has urged planners and regulators to look for alternative renewable water sources. Seawater reverse osmosis desalination (SWRO) plants have become an <b>essential</b> <b>supply</b> source {{for the production of}} freshwater in such regions. However, the disposal of hypersaline wastes from these plants in many of these regions has not been fully and properly addressed. This study aims to develop and present a strategy for the analysis and design of an optimal disposal system of wastes generated by SWRO desalination plants. After current disposal options were evaluated, the use of multiport marine outfalls is recommended as an effective disposal system. Marine outfalls are a reliable means for conveying wastes from process plants, to include wastewater treatment and power plants, into the coastal waters. Their proper use, however, in conjunction with SWRO desalination plants is still in its beginning stage. A simulation-optimization approach is proposed to design a system for safe disposal of brine wastes. This disposal system is comprised of a marine outfall that is equipped with a multiport diffuser structure. A hydrodynamic model (CORMIX) is used to assess the initial dilution of hypersaline effluent discharged into coastal waters. A regression model is developed to relate the input and output parameters of the simulation model. This regression model replaces the simulation model. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model is then formulated to determine the design of the multiport marine outfall. The design parameters are the length, diameter and number of ports of the disposal system. Given the uncertainty of some parameter, such as current speed, wind speed and ambient temperature, a chance-constrained programming model is used to properly incorporate these stochastic parameters into the model. This simulation-optimization framework provides planners with effective tools that preserve a healthy coastal environment, meet environmental permitting requirements and restrictions, while achieving cost savings and adequate hydrodynamic performance. A case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|M Development and Management, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 {{is a tool}} used {{to redress}} the {{injustice}} {{of the past and}} ensure full economic participation of groups that where disadvantaged in the past. The main stream economy includes the fast–track of employment equity, ownership, skills development, preferential procurement, enterprise development, and socio–economic development. BEE is an inclusive and logical political process that is based on the national transformation programme of the country, for an example, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). Its purpose was to modify and change the inequalities of the past with transference of management, ownership and the control of economic and financial resources of South Africa to the majority of its citizens. The RDP sought to bring about full economic participation by the historically disadvantaged to accomplish prosperity and development that is sustainable. Public sector procurement is used by government as a mechanism to achieve certain broader policy objectives such as BEE, local economic development of small and medium sized business, skills transfer and job creation. The BEE programme was implemented in 2003. However, there are problems with the implementation of the programme. The theory (legislation) includes the Code of Good Practice, Sector Scorecards, and Public Sector Procurement Guidelines which span effective implementation of the BEE programme. According to the respondents, the major problem with the successful implementation of BEE, are the corrupt public officials who interfere with the process. The government officials responsible for the implementation of BEE practice nepotism and bribery on an extremely large scale. Moreover, political interference {{plays a major role in}} the lack/poor implementation of BEE.
