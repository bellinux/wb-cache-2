He is currently a senior assistant at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, University of Rijeka. Siniša Majkus’s works fall into {{the emergence of a}} new school of sculpture in Croatia during the 90s. This new wave of sculpture focused on appropriating everyday objects and materials in order to create an aesthetic of the everyday. Majkus adopted metal wire as his primary sculptural medium. Majkus then twists and morphs the wire into three-dimensional forms as a pencil would <b>draw</b> <b>line</b> and create shape on paper, and it is for this reason that his works are often described as a ‘sculptural drawings’.|$|E
50|$|Bresenham's line {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that determines {{the points of}} an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to <b>draw</b> <b>line</b> primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction and bit shifting, {{all of which are}} very cheap operations in standard computer architectures. It is an incremental error algorithm. It is one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. An extension to the original algorithm may be used for drawing circles.gWhile algorithms such as Wu's algorithm are also frequently used in modern computer graphics because they can support antialiasing, the speed and simplicity of Bresenham's line algorithm means that it is still important. The {{algorithm is}} used in hardware such as plotters and in the graphics chips of modern graphics cards. It can also be found in many software graphics libraries. Because the algorithm is very simple, it is often implemented in either the firmware or the graphics hardware of modern graphics cards.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Prestel system, {{designed for}} cost effectiveness and simplicity, employed a rudimentary graphic capability known as serial mosaics. Through juxtaposition {{of the special}} mosaic characters, crude but recognizable graphic representations could {{be made on the}} screen. This graphic scheme had its limitations. To change colors between two mosaic graphic characters or between any two characters in general, a color change command was required. This command signal, however, physically occupied a blank space on the screen.The French sought to overcome this limitation when they joined the videotex world in the mid-1970s. They called their system Antiope. While based on the same mosaic graphics that were employed by the British, Antiope added a new feature, parallel attributes, or the ability to change the color from one cell to another without the need for a blank space.At approximately the same time, the Canadians adapted standard computer graphic commands into a set of functions called alphageometrics. These alphageometric functions did away with the block mosaic graphics used by the British and French and replaced them with drawing instructions, such as: <b>DRAW</b> <b>LINE,</b> DRAW ARC, DRAW POLYGON, etc. Through use of these geometric commands much higher resolution could be achieved than with the mosaic commands. This alphageometric scheme was integrated into the Canadian videotex system which the Canadians referred to as [...] "Telidon".|$|E

5000|$|Production of Benjarong is {{a process}} known to only small {{communities}} of Thai artists which have passed down the knowledge from generation to generation. The artisan who makes Benjarong {{has to be very}} skillful and careful. The production process is needs a skilled labor. How the Benjarong is made and how the patterns are painted, are glamorous and all considered as the masterpieces. In the porcelain selection, only white porcelain (Bone China and Royal Porcelain) which had been fired at the proper temperature (1150-1280 degree Celsius) for many hours, are selected. White ware must not have any flaw. After we get all required white wares, cleaning is the next process. During this process, it is necessary to avoid oily surface from sweaty and dirty hand. In drawing process, we use hypodermic syringe or paint brush to <b>draw</b> <b>line.</b> The process begins with drawing the circular guide lines on the Thai porcelain on a turning wheel, which is manually controlled. While drawing on the design, the artist will keep the sample pattern in front of him so he can draw the pattern correctly. The initial pattern drawing is very crucial to how the design will turn out, so it will be done by the well-experienced artist (usually drawn by a master craftsman). This is the reason why the pattern is drawn in very fine lines on each Benjarong. In painting process, there are various colors of paint but basically we use five main colors (black, green, yellow, red and white). The specialized paint for Benjarong needs a skillful painter. The paint is made from mineral colors and must be well crushed and mixed with water in proper ratio. The crushing equipment is ceramic or equivalent material mortar. The paint should not be too thick or thin. If the paint is too thick, it will not be completely fired and the color will not be shown as expected. If the paint is too thin, the color will fade. Also, the paint must not overlap with any line of the other color. At the final stage of painting, the 18 karat gold might be added to the rims {{in order to make it}} look glamorous. The next step after painting is firing. Painted wares will be put in the kiln. The spaces between them are 0.5 - 1 cm unless you want the painted wares to touch each other and might get damaged to pattern that painted after firing. The temperature in the kiln is controlled between 800 to 1000◦C and takes about 10 hours firing time. The Benjarong must be put in the kiln five times. After finished firing, the Benjarong will be cooled down; then take it off from the kiln. Once the Benjarong has been fired, it can be seen as three dimensional bubble of paint on the surface, which is the reason why Benjarong is unique. At the end of production, there will a quality control. The slightest mistake in any process would ruin the design and fame of Benjarong. Any mistake is unacceptable. Benjarong supposed to be perfect in every respect. If the mistake is found, it will be sent back to the studio or might throw it away. In fact, this is very rare to happen because during each stage the artists take good care of each individual piece. (Blobiztar Company Limited) ...|$|E

In particular, our work is helpful for drawing attribute- (or dually object-) additive diagrams. ...|$|E

In more recent times, computer graphics are not simply an interface between human and computer but a tool for visualisation, expression and communication.

The dominant objective, however, has remained the attainment of realism. If we have truly realistic computer graphics we can create d [...] ...|$|E

Line-art illustrations are effective tools for conveying shapes and shading of complex objects. We present a set of new algorithms to render line-art illustrations of dynamic and specular (reflective and refractive) surfaces. We first introduce a real-time principal direction estimation algorithm to determine the line stroke directions on dynamic opaque objects using neighboring normal ray triplets. To render reflections or refractions in a line-art style, we develop a stroke direction propagation algorithm by using multiperspective projections to propagate the stroke directions from the nearby opaque objects onto specular surfaces. Finally, we present an image-space stroke mapping method to <b>draw</b> <b>line</b> strokes using the computed or propagated stroke directions.
