5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only {{a small percentage of the}} damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the case– was ineligible.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Godas' emissaries, Justinian detailed Cyril, {{one of the}} officers of the foederati, with 400 men, to accompany the invasion fleet and then sail on to Sardinia. Gelimer reacted to Godas' rebellion by sending the bulk of his fleet, 120 of his best vessels, and 5,000 men under his own brother Tzazon, to suppress it. The Vandal king's decision played a crucial role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the war, for it removed from the scene the Vandal navy, the main obstacle to a Roman landing in Africa, as well as a large part of his army. Gelimer also chose to ignore the revolt in Tripolitania for the moment, as it was both a lesser threat and more remote, while his lack of manpower constrained him to await Tzazon's return from Sardinia before undertaking further campaigns. At the same time, both rulers tried to win over allies: Gelimer contacted the Visigoth king Theudis (r. 531–548) and proposed an alliance, while Justinian secured the benevolent neutrality and support of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy, which had strained relations with the Vandals over the ill treatment of the Ostrogoth princess Amalafrida, the wife of Thrasamund. The Ostrogoth court readily agreed to allow the Roman invasion fleet to use the harbour of Syracuse in Sicily and establish a market for the provisioning of the Roman troops there.|$|E

25|$|Evening cricket is {{the least}} formal format of club cricket, and the route by which many new players are {{introduced}} to the game.

This version of the game also puts an emphasis on inclusivity, with rules such as each bowler being limited to 2 overs each, and batsmen retiring after reaching 25 runs being used to ensure that every player has a part to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the game.|$|E
