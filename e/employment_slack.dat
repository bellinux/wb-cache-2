30|$|We {{see from}} Table  1 that {{involuntary}} part-time employment increased {{in most countries}} during the crisis, in several countries rising by more than ten percentage points. Countries with a very large increase in involuntary part-time jobs, in particular Southern European countries, had in 2007 a below average part-time rate but already had an above average involuntary part-time rate. The rise in involuntary part-time employment coincided with an above average growth in part-time work in Italy, Cyprus, Spain, and Ireland. However, an increase in part-time work over the crisis period was not necessarily involuntary as figures for Malta, Austria, and the Netherlands indicate. Only in Germany and Belgium involuntary part-time employment decreased (Table  1). Especially countries that suffered most in the initial phase of <b>employment</b> <b>slack</b> after the financial crisis (Southern European countries, the Baltic States, and Ireland) witnessed a substantial growth in involuntary part-time employment (Leschke 2012). The timing and duration of the crisis also matters. For example, Table  1 indicates that in the Baltic States the increase in involuntary part-time employment is concentrated between 2007 and 2010, but then, the overall economic situation ameliorated {{and we see that}} between 2010 and 2013 the share of involuntary part-time work stabilized. In Spain and Greece on the other hand, involuntary part-time employment continued to grow.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{business}} situations {{where it might}} be necessary to keep the potential service level (preparedness) above requirements {{at least in some}} of the time intervals. For instance, a fleet of trucks (or cabs) or group of production machines, cannot be easily adjusted month by month and, therefore, during slack periods the potential service level may exceed requirements. In a manufacturing firm, there are certain functions to be performed, such as maintenance or clerical work (often overhead type functions), where again the potential service level is expensive to change. In fact, even in the case of production workers, the expense of hiring, training, firing, or the contractual obligations of guaranteed wage agreements may make it undesirable to change the level of <b>employment</b> during <b>slack</b> periods. The reader will readily find further illustrations of the type of planning problems we are describing here. ...|$|R
40|$|Following a recession, the {{aggregate}} labor market is <b>slack</b> <b>employment</b> remains below normal and recruiting efforts of employers, {{as measured by}} vacancies, are low. A model of matching frictions explains the qualitative responses {{of the labor market}} to adverse shocks, but requires implausibly large shocks to account for the magnitude of observed fluctuations. The incorporation of wage-setting frictions vastly increases the sensitivity of the model to driving forces. I develop a new model of wage friction. The friction arises in an economic equilibrium and satisfies the condition that no worker-employer pair has an unexploited opportunity for mutual improvement. The wage friction neither interferes with the efficient formation of employment matches nor causes inefficient job loss. Thus it provides an answer to the fundamental criticism previously directed at sticky-wage models of fluctuations. ...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{economy is}} in recession, with the {{recovery}} yet to be secured. GDP is more than 4 percent lower {{than it was in}} 2008 with output per capita now 14 percent below its pre-crisis trend. As a result of this stalled recovery, confidence remains weak and uncertainty high. The CBI forecast for growth has been revised down to minus 0. 3 percent in 2012 and 1. 2 % in 2013. Given the significant downside risks from the Eurozone – which now seems to be acting as a drag on the broader global economy – uncertainty continues to dampen business confidence. Although the labour market has continued to outperform expectations, overall fragility persists, with the performance we have seen in recent quarters expected to deteriorate. The CBI forecasts unemployment to continue to rise, averaging 8. 4 percent, or 2. 69 million people, in 2013. Productivity levels are yet to recover, with the risk that if productivity continues to fall employers will look to cut back on jobs in order to stem further declines. Pay restraint continues {{to play an important role}} in supporting <b>employment</b> and <b>slack</b> in the labour market is set to continue to bear down on wage growth meaning a cautious approach to the rate of the NMW will reflect wider labour market practice, with NM...|$|R
40|$|High labor {{intensive}} (HIMO) public works {{programs have been}} very popular {{in recent years in}} Madagascar. They {{have been one of the}} most common safety net programs used in Madagascar to address poverty and vulnerability. The objectives of these programs are to provide income support to the poor after natural disasters and during seasonal agricultural <b>employment</b> <b>slack</b> period (soudure), and to improve much needed local infrastructures. This paper assesses the effectiveness of HIMO interventions in addressing the needs of poor and vulnerable households using the data from 15 projects implemented between 2006 and 2008 by several agencies. The main finding of this study is that despite their great potential, HIMO projects have shown the following limitations in the Madagascar context: a) lack of coordination among projects implemented by different agencies; b) ineffective targeting and poor selection of projects; c) lack of monitoring and supervision. The paper identifies four areas for improvement: a) better harmonization and coordination of HIMO projects to ensure consistency of approaches among interventions; b) better geographical targeting and selection of projects; c) setting the wage rate according to the local socio-economic conditions to promote self selection of the poor; and d) better collection of information for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of projects.

60|$|There {{had long}} been a promise that Stephen should, in some time of <b>slack</b> <b>employment,</b> make a visit to his old comrade, Edmund Burgess, at York; and as some new tools and {{patterns}} had to be conveyed thither, a sudden resolution was come to, in family conclave, that Stephen himself should convey them, taking his uncle with him as a serving-man, {{to attend to the}} horses. The alderman gave full consent, he had always wished Stephen to see York, while he himself, with Tibble Steelman, was able to attend to the business; and while he pronounced Randall to have a heart of gold, well worth guarding, he still was glad when the risk was over of the King's hearing that the runaway jester was harboured at the Dragon. Dennet did not like the journey for her husband, for to her mind it was perilous, but she had had a warm affection for his uncle ever since their expedition to Richmond together, and she did her best to reconcile the murmuring and wounded Perronel by praises of Randall, a true and noble heart; and that as to setting her aside for the Cardinal, who had heeded him so little, such faithfulness only made her more secure of his true-heartedness towards her. Perronel was moreover to break up her business, dispose of her house, and await her husband's return at the Dragon.|$|R
60|$|But {{this is not}} {{the only}} avenue to {{beneficence}} which the war opens. We need but name the service of hospitals, the care and education of the freedmen,--for these are charities that have long been before the eyes of the community, and have employed thousands of busy hands: thousands of sick and dying beds to tend, a race to be educated, civilized, and Christianized, surely were work enough for one age; and yet this is not all. War shatters everything, and it is hard to say what in society will not need rebuilding and binding up and strengthening anew. Not the least of the evils of war are the vices which a great army engenders wherever it moves,--vices peculiar to military life, as others are peculiar to peace. The poor soldier perils for us not merely his body, but his soul. He leads a life of harassing and exhausting toil and privation, of violent strain on the nervous energies, alternating with sudden collapse, creating a craving for stimulants, and endangering the formation of fatal habits. What furies and harpies are those that follow the army, and that seek out the soldier in his tent, far from home, mother, wife and sister, tired, disheartened, and tempt him to forget his troubles in a momentary exhilaration, that burns only to chill and to destroy! Evil angels are always active and indefatigable, and there must be good angels enlisted to face them; and here is <b>employment</b> for the <b>slack</b> hand of grief. Ah, we have known mothers bereft of sons in this war, who have seemed at once to open wide their hearts, and to become mothers to every brave soldier in the field. They have lived only to work,--and in place of one lost, their sons have been counted by thousands.|$|R
40|$|Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment GuaranteeAct (MGNREGA) Programme {{is one of}} the {{flagship}} programmes of the Government of India to improve rural livlihood in the country, especially to provide <b>employment</b> during <b>slack</b> season of agrciultural activities, when unemployment is rampant in rural India. Until August 2014, the MGNREGA has generated 1760. 78 crores of mandays of work in rural areas with an expenditure of Rs. 2, 65, 727 croers, of which, nearly 70 % were distributed as wages. This paper examines the impact of MGNREGA in 10 semi-arid villages spread acrsoss Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra states. Our assessment finds that the implementation of MGNREGA in the 10 villages across the three states has varied experiences. In none of the villages the average working days under the programme was found to be more than 40 days per annum. The average wage received by the beneficiaries was well below the prevailing agricultural labor wage rate in the village. However, the works under the programme generally take place in the non-agricultural season. Hence, even the wage rate is below that of the agricutlural labor wages in the studied villages, the program has produced tremendous impact on fiancial stability of the program participating households. Though over the years the average wage rate (and the total income earned) under the programme has increased, the average days of employment provided had declined over the years across all the study areas (states), or remained stagnant along with the declining number of total beneficiaries. The latter is not the result of availibility of alternative employment opportunities for the households but the inadeqaute availibility of work in the villages. Most of the sampled housheolds belongs to the marginalised sections and are agricultural laboureres or marginal farmers. These program participants (beneficiaries) reported that they want the MGNREGA to provide them work for more than 100 days in a year and offer better wage rates or at least as that of the wage ratesprevailing in the agricultural sector. The beneficiaries used the money earned from MGNREGA mostly for meeting dometic expenses and education of their children, while acquisition of durable household assets was not reported at all. The program beneficiaries also appreciated the community wide benefits of the rural assets and infrastructure created under {{the flagship}} programme, eventhough it may not have any direct benefit to the labor housheolds, but they acknowledged the communtiy level benefits of these rural infrastrures created under the program. The study suggests for proper implementation of MGNREGA through better monitoring at local level, use of ITC technilogy for monitroing on performances of the work activities, implementation of work on regular basis across the years, and with good governance and participatory decision-making on selection of work activties to be under taken under the program...|$|R
