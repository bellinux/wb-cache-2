The frequency shift and dynamic instability of the resonator are studied experimentally. The mecha-nical vibration caused by ponderomotive effect has been controlled. This resonator can run stably at a RF power of 50 KW, frequency of 27 MHz, duty factor of l/ 6, and the maximum voltage gain {{is more than}} 1. 1 MV.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for polishing the thin electroplated lead coating used in Pb-Cu superconducting resonators {{which is much more}} effective than those available previously. Conventional polishing procedures cannot be used because their rapid action is inappropriate to the thin (10 μ) lead layer. A previous procedure, designed for very slow action, rounded sharp edges to a radius of curvature of approximately 1 μ. The new procedure provides nearly complete leveling of crystals 10 μ in size. Results of tests on a β = 0. 10 split loop accelerating resonator designed for the SUNYLAC Heavy <b>Ion</b> <b>Booster</b> will be reported. This resonator shows considerable improvement in performance over the previously tested cavity. On this basis, accelerator operation at an average field of 3 MV/m now seems feasible...|$|E
40|$|The {{polarized}} Medium energy Electron-Ion Collider (MEIC) envisioned at Jefferson Lab {{will cover}} {{a range of}} center-of-mass energies up to 65 GeV. The present MEIC design could also allow the accommodation of low energy electron-ion collisions (LEIC) for additional science reach. This paper presents the first design of the low energy ion collider ring which is converted from the large <b>ion</b> <b>booster</b> of MEIC. It can reach up to 25 GeV energy for protons and equivalent ion energies of the same magnetic rigidity. An interaction region and an electron cooler designed for MEIC are integrated into the low energy collider ring, {{in addition to other}} required new elements including crab cavities and ion spin rotators, for later reuse in MEIC itself. A pair of vertical chicanes which brings the low energy ion beams to the plane of the electron ring and back to the low energy ion ring are also part of the design...|$|E

After befriending Bit, {{it proved to be}} adept at close combat, using its superheated [...] "Strike Laser Claw" [...] attack to great effect in many battles. It was equipped with the CAS (usually Changing Armor System, also [...] "Conversion" [...] in parts of the dub) to allow switching to one of three incredible, mighty, and most powerful armors: Liger Zero Jager (German: hunter) unit and its <b>ion</b> <b>boosters</b> for speed and agility; Liger Zero Schneider (German: cutter) and its blades for close combat; and Liger Zero Panzer (German: armor/shield), with heavy armor, cannons, and missiles for beating multiple enemies at once. Over the course of the series, it is learned that the Liger Zero is {{one of a series of}} unique Ultimate X Zoids, equipped with an integrated Organoid system and possessing the ability to learn and adapt. This allows it to predict and react to enemy attacks far faster than regular Zoids.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{production of}} fullerenes likely means {{a release of}} these chemicals in the environment. Since soils and sediments are expected {{to act as a}} sink, analytical tools are needed to assess the presence of fullerenes in these matrices. In the present work, a method was developed for the determination of fullerenes at environmental relevant levels employing Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatograph coupled with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Chromatographic separation was achieved with a core–shell biphenyl stationary phase that provided fast analysis with complete baseline separation. <b>Ion</b> <b>Booster</b> Electro Spray Ionization (IB-ESI) resulted in higher ionization efficiency and was much less susceptible to adduct formation in comparison with standard ESI, whereas Quadrupole Time of Flight (QTOF) MS granted high resolution mass spectra used for accurate identification. The Instrumental method limits of detection (ILoD) and quantification (ILoQ) were 6 and 20 fg, respectively, for C 60 and 12 and 39 fg, respectively, for C 70. Matrix effects related to co-extractants were systematically investigated in soil and sediments extracts through standard addition method (SAM) and monitoring the signal response during the chromatographic run of these samples. Consequently, minor chromatographic modifications were necessary for the analysis of matrices with high organic carbon content. The method limit of detection (MLoD) ranged from 84 pg/kg to 335 pg/kg, whereas limit of quantification (MLoQ) ranged from 279 pg/kg to 1. 1 ng/kg. Furthermore, the method was successfully applied for the analysis of functionalized fullerenes (i. e. methanofullerenes). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical method for the analysis of fullerenes in soils and sediments that employ core–shell biphenyl stationary phase as well as IB-ESI-QTOF MS hyphenated with UHPLC...|$|E

50|$|The Semi-Hero packs in GB2 were a new {{addition}} to the packs used in filming. These packs were stripped-down versions of the heroes, merging constructional concepts from both the heroes and the stunt packs into a mid grade pack for wide shots. These packs were also constructed lighter for the actors. many of the metal parts from the Hero packs were cast in resin and attached to the shell, such as the HGA, injector tubes, beamline and filler tube. Other metal parts, such as the <b>Ion</b> Arm, <b>Booster</b> Tube (and frame), PPD, and N-Filter, were actually cast into the shell, much like the foam stunt packs from the first film. These packs also had fiberglass cast wands, instead of the metal ones from the first film.|$|R
40|$|Following is a {{calculation}} of the mean energy lost by various ions in the BTA stripping foils. The calculation {{is based on the}} known thickness and density of the foils; the known energy of the ions incident on the foil; and the known energy loss rates for protons in the foil material. The results of the calculation are in good agreement with the measured revolution frequencies at Booster extraction and AGS injection. 1 Booster Extraction Parameters The nominal parameters for various <b>ions</b> at <b>Booster</b> extraction are summarized in Table 1.

40|$|As part of {{the effort}} to {{increase}} the number of ions per bunch in RHIC, a new scheme for RF capture of EBIS <b>ions</b> in <b>Booster</b> at injection has been developed. The scheme was proposed by M. Blaskiewicz and J. M. Brennan. It employs a barrier bucket to hold a half turn of beam in place during capture into two adjacent harmonic 4 buckets. After acceleration, this allows for 8 transfers of 2 bunches from Booster into 16 buckets on the AGS injection porch. During the Fall of 2011 the necessary hardware was developed and implemented by the RF and Controls groups. The scheme is presently being commissioned by K. L. Zeno with Au 32 + ions from EBIS. In this note we carry out simulations of the RF capture. These are meant to serve as benchmarks for what can be achieved in practice. They also allow for an estimate of the longitudinal emittance of the bunches on the AGS injection porch...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} model-independent quantity, $L/G$, to {{characterize}} non-Gaussian tails in beam profiles observed with the Fermilab <b>Booster</b> <b>Ion</b> Profile Monitor.

40|$|The <b>Booster</b> <b>Ion</b> Profile Monitor (BIPM) was {{recently}} (April 1998) {{used in a}} test to study the feasibility of collecting the electrons instead of the more traditional ions. These electrons and ions are created by the ionization of the residual gas in the beam pipe by the proton beam. As a consistency check, the proton beam current is compared to the integrated area of the measured profile through the acceleration cycle. It was found necessary to include {{the effect of the}} proton beam energy upon ionization by means of the Bethe-Bloch equation in order to have satisfactory agreement. ...|$|R

Feasibility study of accelerating both O+ and O- ion beams simultaneously in the same RFQ was also performed. An ISR RFQ for accelerating oxygen ion beam up to 1 MeV was designed and constructed. Two superconducting cavities with China made niobium were successfully manufactured and tested by the RF Superconductivity group.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a concept for superconducting resonators for {{the acceleration of}} ions in the velocity range β=v/c= 0. 015 – 0. 04. Such a resonator operates in λ/ 4 mode with three loading elements and so {{can be thought of}} as a triple quarter wave resonator (3 -QWR) providing 4 accelerating gaps. The use of a column to support the three stubs provides a benefit beyond those of the two-stub design (2 -QWR). In the 3 -QWR, the rf mirror currents in the walls surrounding the stubs need only travel through 45 ° instead of the 90 ° in the 2 -QWR thus further reducing the current in the demountable joints. As in the 2 -QWR, the shape of the column allows control of the frequency splitting between the accelerating and other modes. The copper structure is designed to be coated by a thin superconducting film of niobium or lead for operation at 4. 3  K. The particular device reported here operates at 150  MHz with an optimum β of 0. 04. Its outer cylinder is the same size and shape as for the 2 -QWR structure reported previously, in order to minimize construction and cryostat costs. A simple transmission line model is presented and the results of microwave studio and other numerical analyses are discussed. The 3 -QWR resonators are appropriate for the upgrade of the low-velocity sections of the ANU Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility and other heavy <b>ion</b> accelerator <b>boosters...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the BNL {{requires}} the AGS to provide Gold beam with {{the intensity of}} 10 {sup 9 } ions per bunch. Over the years, the Tandem Van de Graaff has provided steadily increasing intensity of gold ion beams to the AGS Booster. However, the gold beam injection efficiency at the Booster {{has been found to}} decrease with the rising intensity of injected beams. As the result, for Tandem beams of the highest intensity, the Booster late intensity is lower than with slightly lower intensity Tandem beam. In this article, the authors present two experiments associated with the Booster injection efficiency and beam intensity. One experiment looks at the Booster injection efficiency by adjusting the Tandem beam intensity, and another looks at the beam life time while scraping the beam in the Booster. The studies suggest that the gold beam injection efficiency at the AGS Booster is related to the beam loss in the ring, rather than the intensity of injected beam or circulating beam. A close look at the effect of the lost gold <b>ion</b> at the <b>Booster</b> injection leads to the prediction that the lost gold ion creates large number of positive ions, and even larger number of electrons. The lost gold beam is also expected to create large numbers of neutral particles. In 1998 heavy ion run, the production of positive ions and electrons due to the lost gold beam has been observed. Also the high vacuum pressure due to the beam loss, presumably because of the neutral particles it created, has been measured. These results will be reported elsewhere...|$|R

The Space Electronic Test Engineering Branch is assigned electronic test engineering responsibility for the GRC Space Simulation, Microgravity, Cryogenic, and Combustion Test Facilities. While working with the Space Power and Propulsion Test Engineering Branch I am working on several different assignments. My primary assignment deals with an electrical hardware unit known as Sunny Boy. Sunny Boy is a DC load Bank that is designed for solar arrays {{in which it is}} used to convert DC power form the solar arrays into AC power at 60 hertz to pump back into the electricity grid. However, there are some researchers who decided {{that they would like to}} use the Sunny Boy unit in a space simulation as a DC load bank for a space shuttle or even the International Space Station hardware. In order to do so I must create a communication link between a computer and the Sunny Boy unit so that I can preset a few of the limits (such power, set & constant voltage levels) that Sunny Boy will need to operate using the applied DC load. Apart from this assignment I am also working on a hi-tech circuit that I need to have built at a researcher s request. This is a high voltage analog to digital circuit that will be used to record data from space <b>ion</b> propulsion rocket <b>booster</b> tests. The problem that makes building this circuit so difficult is that it contains high voltage we must find a way to lower the voltage signal before the data is transferred into the computer to be read. The solution to this problem was to transport the signal using infrared light which will lower the voltage signal down low enough so that it is harmless to a computer. Along with my involvement in the Space Power and Propulsion Test Engineering Branch, I am obligated to assist all other members of the branch in their work. This will help me to strengthen and extend my knowledge of Electrical Engineering...|$|R
