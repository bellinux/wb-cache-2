The CVE employs a P 2 P {{approach to the}} frequent real-time updates to the 3 D virtual worlds required by avatar movements (fellow students in the same room). This paper focuses on our extensions to support group viewing of lecture videos, called VECTORS, for Video Enhanced Collaboration for Team Oriented Remote Synchronization. VECTORS supports synchronized viewing of lecture videos, so the students all see “the same thing at the same time”, and can pause, rewind, etc. in synchrony while discussing the lecture via “chat”. We are particularly concerned {{with the needs of}} the technologically disenfranchised, e. g., whose only Internet access if via <b>dialup</b> <b>networking.</b> Thus VECTORS employs semantically compressed videos with meager bandwidth requirements. ...|$|E

Due to memory size, cost, and power considerations most palmtop computers support only limited form of point-to-point communication, namely, connection via a PSTN modem or a serial RS- 232 cable. Due to wired point-to-point nature of these interfaces, satisfactory solutions for multi-point communication and direct LAN connection do not yet exist. The BlueSky project aims at providing a low-cost, lowpower, indoor RF wireless networking solution for handheld devices. Our solution consists of two components; a BlueSky wireless attachment that plugs into the standard serial port of any palmtop device, and a LAN access point {{that acts as a}} layer 2 / 3 bridge between the wireless and the wired part of the network. Palmtop devices use <b>dialup</b> <b>networking</b> software and PPP to connect via BlueSky to the net [...] ...|$|E
50|$|Controlled vocabularies, {{such as the}} Library of Congress Subject Headings, are an {{essential}} component of bibliography, the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in library and information science. In the 1950s, government agencies began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Subsequently, for-profit firms (called Abstracting and indexing services) emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an online bibliographic database industry developed based on <b>dialup</b> X.25 <b>networking.</b> These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first full text databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library.|$|R
