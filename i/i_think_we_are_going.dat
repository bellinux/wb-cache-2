500|$|In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 {{following}} cardiac arrest. Three {{weeks after}} Jackson's death, celebrity news website TMZ.com (who were the first media outlet to report his death) obtained a 24-second snippet of a song entitled [...] "A Place with No Name", and released it on the Internet. At the time of the leak [...] there were news reports that there was a [...] "vast vault" [...] and [...] "dozens and dozens" [...] of unreleased Jackson songs that could be issued for several years to come. The curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, commented that any future Jackson releases would receive a significant amount of attention, stating, [...] "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here right now are selling in amazing numbers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on." ...|$|E

The plane is making jerky movements. I don't think the pilot is flying the plane. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> down.

2500|$|Moffat {{had always}} {{intended}} for Amy and Rory {{to get married}} [...] "from the off". Gillan stated, [...] "What I love about that relationship is that we really saw it develop {{to get to the}} stage where they were happy together. Because we started off at a point where Amy didn't want to be committed to him, and he absolutely did, and that just gave us somewhere to go with it, rather than just them being happy together. So it was interesting, and it evolved, and Rory really became a hero in the process". She was pleased that the audience was able to see Amy's life [...] "pan out", starting {{when she was a child}} and through her marriage and daughter. Gillan stated that the aftermath of [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] would [...] "change her in a big way for the long run and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get to see Amy in a really different light". According to Moffat, by the seventh series, Amy and Rory had become [...] "a crack team"; so used to being the Doctor's companions that instead of marvelling at him they [...] "treat him like a big kid they have to look after".|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you know, Aleck, I {{think we}} are making a mistake--that is, you are. I mean about the {{marriage}} business." [...] He sat up, fat and froggy and benevolent, like a bronze Buddha, and grew earnest. [...] "Consider--it's more than five years. You've continued the same policy from the start: with every rise, always holding on for five points higher. Always when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have some weddings, you see a bigger thing ahead, and I undergo another disappointment. I think you are too hard to please. Some day we'll get left. First, we turned down the dentist and the lawyer. That was all right--it was sound. Next, we turned down the banker's son and the pork-butcher's heir--right again, and sound. Next, we turned down the Congressman's son and the Governor's--right as a trivet, I confess it. Next the Senator's son {{and the son of}} the Vice-President of the United States--perfectly right, there's no permanency about those little distinctions. Then you went for the aristocracy; and I thought we had struck oil at last--yes. We would make a plunge at the Four Hundred, and pull in some ancient lineage, venerable, holy, ineffable, mellow with the antiquity of a hundred and fifty years, disinfected of the ancestral odors of salt-cod and pelts all of a century ago, and unsmirched by a day's work since, and then! why, then the marriages, of course. But no, along comes a pair a real aristocrats from Europe, and straightway you throw over the half-breeds. It was awfully discouraging, Aleck! Since then, what a procession! You turned down the baronets for a pair of barons; you turned down the barons for a pair of viscounts; the viscounts for a pair of earls; the earls for a pair of marquises; the marquises for a brace of dukes. NOW, Aleck, cash in!--you've played the limit. You've got a job lot of four dukes under the hammer; of four nationalities; all sound in the wind and limb and pedigree, all bankrupt and in debt up to the ears. They come high, but we can afford it. Come, Aleck, don't delay any longer, don't keep up the suspense: take the whole lay-out, and leave the girls to choose!" ...|$|E

5000|$|In December 2010 Telegraph reporters {{posing as}} {{constituents}} secretly recorded Business Secretary Vince Cable.

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to show up}} {{and kill}} the funding before anybody gets serious about what the next step is. -Hester, {{discussing}} Arkansas Works {{on the first day of}} the 2016 fiscal session [...] During the fiscal session, Governor Asa Hutchinson proposed [...] "Arkansas Works", an expansion of the private option using federal Medicaid money to assist over 267,000 low-income Arkansans to obtain private health insurance and to reduce costs at hospitals across the state. The measure also transfers funding to the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) necessary for AHTD to meet matching requirements to receive Arkansas's full allocation of federal highway funds. Hester became a vocal, leading opponent of Arkansas Works and led a [...] "rump" [...] group of state senators to block funding for the initiative. Although the measure gained the required simple majorities to pass (70-30 in the House and 25-10 in the Senate, with Hester opposed), rules to acquire funding for the measure require a three-fourths majority.|$|E
5000|$|Experts {{think that}} a new {{understanding}} of Egyptian funerary architecture and customs of the Middle Pharaonic Kingdom {{all the way to the}} Roman era could be learned from the exploration of the dozens of tombs encompassing the site near the Lahun, Egypt’s southernmost pyramid. [...] "The tombs were cut on the rock itself, and they vary in architectural designs," [...] said archaeologist Abdul Rahman Al-Ayedi, head of excavations at the site[...] Some of the tombs were erected on top of gravesites from earlier eras. Ayedi told reporters, [...] "The prevailing idea was that this site has been established by Senusret II, the fourth king of the 12th dynasty. But in light of our discovery, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to change this theory, and soon we will announce another discovery." [...] He said teams had made a discovery of an artifact that was dated earlier than the 12th dynasty, but did not include any specifics on the item and promised an official statement would be made within days.|$|E
