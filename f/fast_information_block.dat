40|$|The multifold turbo coding, {{designed}} to provide multiple extrinsic estimates and LLRs on a bit basis during decoding iterations, is introduced. Component encoders accept various combinations of information segments, which are obtained by equally dividing the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> prior to encoding. Grouped segments are then interleaved and encoded separately, while the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> is left uncoded. This novel sectionalization of the information sequence, combined with separate interleaving and encoding, bring the weight distribution closer to the binomial distribution of a random code.

30|$|The idea of coded-cooperative {{diversity}} {{was first}} introduced in [9]. In order to achieve the coded-cooperative diversity, many distributed coding schemes {{have been reported in}} the literature such as the convolutional codes [10, 11], distributed space-time coding [12, 13], distributed low-density parity-check codes (D-LDPC) [14, 15] and distributed turbo codes (DTC) [16, 17] and more recently the polar codes [18, 19]. However, the BER performance of binary turbo and the LDPC codes largely depends on the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size, the longer the better and vice versa, whereas for the short non-binary turbo and LDPC codes, reasonable performances under the iterative decoding are reported in [20, 21]. In many existing and emerging applications (such as device-to-device and sensor networks), it is possible to have scenarios, which may transmit small <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size. Thus, it provides one of the many motivations for our work to develop such a coded-cooperative scheme, which may be useful particularly for applications having small <b>information</b> <b>block</b> size and require low encoding and decoding complexity. For any communication system, there is and always will be a trade-off between the complexity and performance as suggested in [22].|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the BER {{performance}} of a parallel concatenated turbo-code improves roughly as 1 /N, where N is the <b>information</b> <b>block</b> length. However, it has been observed by Benedetto and Montorsi that for most parallel concatenated turbo-codes, the FER performance does not improve monotonically with N. In this report, we study the FER of turbo-codes, and the effects of their concatenation with an outer code. Two methods of concatenation are investigated: across several frames and within each frame. Some asymmetric codes are shown to have excellent FER performance with an <b>information</b> <b>block</b> length of 16384. We also show that the proposed outer coding schemes can improve the BER performance as well by eliminating pathological frames generated by the iterative MAP decoding process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In general, many {{real-world}} networks {{not only}} possess scale-free and high clustering coefficient properties, {{but also have}} a <b>fast</b> <b>information</b> transmission capability. However, the existing network models are unable to well present the intrinsic <b>fast</b> <b>information</b> transmission feature. The initial infected nodes and the network topology are two factors that affect the in-formation transmission capability. By using preferential attachment to high proximity prestige nodes and triad formation, we provide a proximity prestige network model, which has scale-free property and high clustering coefficien-t. Simulation results further indicate that the new model also possesses tun-able information transmission capability archived by adjusting its parameters. Moreover, comparing with the BA scale-free network, the proximity prestige network PPNet 05 achieves a higher transmission capability when messages travel based on SIR and SIS models. Our conclusions are directed to possible applications in rumor or information spreading mechanisms...|$|R
