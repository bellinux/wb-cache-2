5|$|The Lyceum {{production}} of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde {{was scheduled to}} close on September 29, after which Mansfield intended to stage other plays. Initially, he followed this plan, introducing productions of Lesbia and A Parisian Romance {{at the beginning of}} October. However, Mansfield soon reintroduced Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> and added performances between October 10 and October 20.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Affeldt joined CSN Bay Area as {{a studio}} analyst for Giants Pregame Live and Giants Postgame Live for the 2016 season. Affeldt also rejoined the Giants organization {{as a community}} ambassador. In mid-September 2016, during game radio broadcasts on KNBR, he provided commentary and opinion on-air with alternating Giants broadcasters, as regulars Jon Miller and Dave Flemming were away 'on assignment'. In February 2017 {{it was announced that}} Affeldt, along with Javier López, would be serving as fill-in color analysts on Giants telecasts during the 2017 season, due to regular analyst Mike Krukow reducing <b>his</b> <b>schedule.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and <b>his</b> <b>schedule,</b> making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E

5|$|During 1932 Cochet {{restricted}} <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> to {{appearances at}} Monaco Cups, the French Championships, Wimbledon, U.S. National Championships and the Davis Cup and a minor tournament in Paris. In Monaco the Butler Trophy were won by Cochet and Jacques Brugnon over the Czechoslovakian duo of Roderich Menzel and Ferenc Marsalek. The mixed doubles was granted to Cochet and Colette Rosambert following {{the retirement of}} Béla von Kehrling and Elizabeth Ryan prior to the match due to the leg pain of Ryan. After that good start Cochet was ranked number one by Pierre Gillou right ahead of Ellsworth Vines and Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Vogt, {{who played}} Peter, told the {{production}} {{team at the}} outset of filming that he only had a limited amount of time to dedicate to the project. Not all of his scenes were filmed by the time <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> ran out, and he left the production despite the fact that Peter was to play a pivotal role in the then-unrecorded climax. His lines in {{the last half of the}} film were given to Ellery, whose character is never introduced, explained, or addressed by name.|$|E
5|$|López {{announced}} his retirement on February 8, 2017. Soon afterwards, he re-joined the Giants as a special instructor during spring training. In February 2017 {{it was announced that}} Lopez, along with Jeremy Affeldt, would be serving as part-time color analysts on Giants telecasts throughout the 2017 season, due to regular analyst Mike Krukow reducing <b>his</b> <b>schedule.</b> On June 2, Lopez joined, for the first time, the other KNBR Giant's radio broadcasters during the after-game 'wrap-up' show.|$|E

5|$|Many vocalists were {{considered}} to perform on the album; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics, but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> meant {{he was unable to}} join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{commander}} of the Japanese XVIII Army, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, ordered Katagiri to launch another counterattack. The supply situation was acute by this stage, with ammunition running low and troops being limited to one-third of their daily rations, nevertheless the counterattack was scheduled for 23/24 November. However, the Australian occupation of Pabu and the threat it posed to the Japanese supply route, forced the Japanese commander to bring <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> forward, and to divert some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen and upon the Australian forces advancing towards Sattelberg in the south.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>schedule</b> in the Olympics was busy. Along {{with the}} decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high jump. The first {{competition}} was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy with school and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton and Jay were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, and Jay Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half a percentage point among Republican voters. A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 cash on hand from the $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E
5|$|Zemeckis and Gale {{wrote the}} script after Gale mused upon {{whether he would}} have befriended his father if they had {{attended}} school together. Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice {{for the role of}} Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. Now with more flexibility in <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.|$|E
25|$|Later in life, he also {{suffered}} constant minor ailments {{such as high}} blood pressure. Many of these symptoms were related to stress, but he never slowed down <b>his</b> <b>schedule.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{most visible}} voices of ESPN College Football Primetime {{over the years}} have been Mike Tirico, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso, but none remain in the booth, with Tirico and Herbstreit being {{promoted}} and Corso cutting back on <b>his</b> <b>schedule.</b> The current commentators are Dave Flemming on play-by-play and Laura Rutledge as field reporter along with a group of rotating ESPN analysts starting in 2017.|$|E
25|$|He {{wanted to}} do it but it {{conflicted}} with <b>his</b> <b>schedule</b> for Three Cornered Circle. Ashby pulled out of his deal with MGM, and Nicholson suggested that they team up on Last Detail.

The $2.3 million budget was low enough for him to get approved.|$|E
