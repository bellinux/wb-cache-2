However, the actual leadership <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> of a group represented in the various bureaux of the Central Committee.|$|E
500|$|A Channel Seven {{spokeswoman}} {{revealed that}} the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right {{not only for the}} series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{was one of}} {{the loudest}} voices of white dissent against the new constitution. He opposed its {{splitting}} of the heretofore non-racial, qualified electorate into graduated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] rolls, saying the proposed system had [...] "racialist" [...] connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a [...] "debased franchise". [...] "Our policy in the past <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> we would have a government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn't worry whether you were black or whether you were white," [...] he said. He also pointed out that the document did not actually guarantee Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon after to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the [...] "United Group", an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field's conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but almost immediately repudiated it and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.|$|E
500|$|Jam noted it was commonplace for Jackson to sing her vocals {{with the}} base track {{first and then}} {{have the rest of}} the song built around it in order to make her voice the center of the piece. [...] "Janet did all of her {{background}} vocals and not just the lead vocals. The idea with her <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> she does all of her own vocals, so that it's totally a Janet record." [...] On the title track [...] "Rhythm Nation", her vocals range from Bb3 to G5, climaxing within its middle eight. Musicologist Richard J. Ripani observed the album and title track showcased the variety of contemporary R styles, making [...] "use of elements across the R spectrum, including use of a sample loop , triplet swing, rapped vocal parts and blues notes (D naturals and G naturals)." [...] This style of music, known as new jack swing, was immensely popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though officially credited to the production techniques of Teddy Riley, Ripani theorized Riley was influenced by Jackson's 1986 single [...] "Nasty", which also features a distinctive triplet swing. Jon Pareles observed the album's diversity catered {{to a wide variety of}} radio formats, including pop, quiet storm, Adult contemporary and mainstream rock. [...] "Black Cat" [...] was a stand-out for the record, not only for being composed exclusively by Jackson, but for its stark departure from her general style of music, delving into hard rock. While Jellybean Johnson was elected to produce it, Dave Berry was recruited to play guitar for the song. It was recorded using a mixture of Rockman and Marshall amplifier to give the song a heavy metal sound.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{arguments}} against appointing an Australian, particularly a former politician, <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> they would <b>be</b> too closely involved with Australian personalities and issues to perform their constitutional role impartially.

2500|$|When Michael Carroll {{wrote an}} e-book novella about Rico in 2014, {{he dealt with}} this issue in the story. In an {{interview}} with Irish Comic News he explained: [...] "My argument <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> Rico’s badge should show his surname… like every other Street Judge in Mega-City One. Why should he {{be the only one}} to have his first name on his badge? ... But Gordon’s story “Judgement” makes a plot-point of Rico temporarily wearing a “Dredd” badge in order to fool Judge Kenner into thinking that he is Joe … So I had to make a choice. In my re-telling of the relevant scenes from “Judgement” I omitted the part about the badge-swap. So far, no one has complained!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} sociological {{aspect of}} tradition {{is the one}} that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see theories of rationality), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by Raymond Boudon in his book Action. In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> way". This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition (or argumentum ad antiquitatem), which takes the form [...] "this is right because we've always done it this way." [...] In most cases such an appeal can be refuted {{on the grounds that the}} [...] "tradition" [...] being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days of the home school movement, Dr. Cynthia Bower taught phonics classes to groups of home school mothers in the summer, and the school began {{providing}} the service of annual achievement testing. The school’s philosophical stand <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> parents are primarily responsible for the education of their own children. Believing this, CHA developed programs to equip parents to teach and to give them educational support. Out of this was born the Home School Satellite Program. The emphasis of the program has always been on preparation of the parent to teach, but there have been opportunities for students to participate in some school events and/or classes. Many of these students have found their way into the CHA day school program because of this association.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} said that they cannot fathom my motive. For the full period of my active life I have been a teacher of {{economics}} to the working classes, and my contention <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> capitalism is rotten to its foundations, and must give place to a new society. I had a lecture, the principal heading of which was [...] "Thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not kill", and I pointed out that {{as a consequence of the}} robbery that goes on in all civilised countries today, our respective countries have had to keep armies, and that inevitably our armies must clash together. On that and on other grounds, I consider capitalism the most infamous, bloody and evil system that mankind has ever witnessed. My language is regarded as extravagant language, but the events of the past four years have proved my contention.|$|E
2500|$|Clemens {{has been}} {{the focal point of}} several controversies. His {{reputation}} <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in , but he has been among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career and subsequently tapered off. Still, Clemens' reputation precedes him. After the 2000 ALCS game against the Mariners where he knocked down future teammate Alex Rodriguez and then argued with him, Seattle Mariners manager Lou Piniella called Clemens a [...] "headhunter." [...] His beaning earlier that year of Mike Piazza, followed by his notorious broken-bat throw at Piazza in the 2000 World Series, cemented Clemens' surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many. In 2009, former manager Cito Gaston publicly denounced Clemens as a [...] "double-talker" [...] and [...] "a complete asshole". Clemens was ranked 9th all-time in hit batsmen after the 2007 season.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement, agreed {{by the new}} {{government}} following the 2010 general election aimed to give MPs a free vote [...] "to express its view" [...] on repealing the Hunting Act 2004 when parliamentary time allowed, possibly in 'early 2012'. The prime minister explained in January 2012 [...] "I always thought the hunting ban was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation ... I {{think there should be}} a free vote in the House of Commons. I think the Commons should make its mind up about this. My problem <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> it was just taking the criminal law into an area of activity where it didn’t really belong."

2500|$|At 11:47pm on {{the night}} of 30 March, {{ambulance}} services were called to a park in Lismore, in the far north of New South Wales. They found Solon next to an open drain in the park, suffering from head injuries. She also had difficulty moving her legs. She had most likely sustained these injuries after falling into the drain, although some media reports speculated that she had been in a car accident. To this day she claims she was knocked off a pushbike by a passing car, but the medical view <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> she was physically assaulted [...] She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. She was soon moved to the psychiatric ward because she was behaving aggressively towards hospital staff, presumably due to her head injuries. A social worker Guing Coop who visited Solon at the hospital identified that she was of Filipino background, and suspected that she was an illegal immigrant. On this basis the social worker contacted the local branch of the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.|$|E
2500|$|Carmona's {{appointment}} to cabinet positions {{of members of}} Opus Dei, the Catholic organization, and of members of what The New York Times called [...] "a discredited conservative party" [...] concerned many democratic members of the anti-Chávez coalition, and made many of them feel [...] "they were being aced out of power by Carmona" [...] reported the Times. The military {{members of the coalition}} were also displeased that Carmona did not consult them on military appointments. Carmona also named two naval officers, but no army officers, to the cabinet, bypassing Vásquez and instead naming Adm. Hector Ramirez Perez as Minister of Defense.

2500|$|According to some scholars, {{these words}} {{mean that the}} whisperer whispers evil into the hearts of two kinds of people: the jinn and the men. If this meaning is admitted, the word nās would apply to both jinn and men. They say {{that this can be}} so, for when the word rijāl (men) in the Quran has been used for the jinn, as in Al-Jinn: 6, and when nafar can be used for the single of jinn, or human as in Al-Ahqaf: 29, men and jinn both can be {{included}} metaphorically in the word nās also. But this view is wrong, [...] because the words nās, ʾins and ʾinsān are even lexically contrary in meaning to the word jinn. The actual meaning of jinn is hidden creation and jinn is called jinn because he is hidden from man's eye. On the contrary, the words nās and ʾins are spoken for ʾinsān (man) only on the basis that he is manifest and visible and perceptible. In Surah Al-Qasas: 29, the word anasa has been used in the meaning of ra'a, i.e. [...] "the Prophet Moses saw a fire in the direction of Tur. [...] " [...] In Surah An-Nisa': 6, the word anastum has been used in the meaning of ahsastum or ra'aytum (i.e. if one perceives or sees that the orphans have become capable). Therefore, nās cannot apply to jinn lexically, and the correct meaning of the verse is: [...] "from the evil of the whisperer who whispers evil into the hearts of men, whether he be from among the jinn or from the men themselves." [...] In other words, whispering of evil is done by devils from among jinn as well as by devils from among men and the prayer in this surah has been taught to seek refuge from the evil of both. This meaning is supported by the Qur'an {{as well as by the}} Hadith. The Qur'an says: [...] "And so it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> We set against every Prophet enemies from among devils of men and devils of jinn, who have been inspiring one another with charming things to delude the minds."

2500|$|Yorke was {{initially}} unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He [...] commented to The Guardian in 2008, [...] "My standpoint <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> {{there has to}} be a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason." [...] However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that [...] "it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform". It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was [...] "a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas." [...] EastEnders worked closely with NSPCC when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced [...] "sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases. The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes. The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, ChildLine. A ChildLine director, Julie Crossan, said, [...] "Child sex abuse storylines on programmes such as EastEnders also encourage children to speak out. As a result, more children now understand what sexual abuse is and are increasingly willing to turn to ChildLine for help." ...|$|E
