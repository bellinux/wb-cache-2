5|$|During {{the night}} of 5–6 February, protesters {{continued}} to camp out in Tahrir Square and Alexandria. However, gunfire was heard in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day in Cairo. Banks temporarily reopened throughout the country amidst long queues, and people rushed to buy US dollars.|$|E

5|$|This contradicted Wright's earlier {{statement}} when stopped by {{police in the}} district in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning: he implied he was unaware {{he was in the}} red light district and was driving around because he could not sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in the red light area.|$|E
5|$|With {{construction}} finally proceeding once more, the Palace Hotel {{closed in}} June 1986. In April 1987, while the tower {{was still under}} construction, five men were arrested after illegally entering the site and parachuting {{from the top of}} the tower in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, 2013, the Alamogordo City Commission {{approved}} Fuel Industries, an Ottawa-based entertainment company, for {{six months}} of landfill access both to create a documentary about the legend and to excavate the burial site. On April 26, 2014, remnants of E.T. and other Atari games were discovered in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excavation.|$|E
50|$|The {{temple was}} {{established}} by a great devotee <b>of</b> Hanuman - <b>the</b> lagre baba. It is said that <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founder baba is still felt today during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning.|$|R
60|$|It was {{fortunate}} {{that the fire}} had not taken place at an <b>earlier</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, as the horses would have been weakened by want of food. As it was, they had had five hours to feed after their arrival.|$|R
60|$|The great Hall at Westminster {{was already}} thronged with people at an <b>early</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning, and <b>the</b> {{servants}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knight Marshal and <b>the</b> Lord Warden <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fleet had much ado {{to keep the}} crowd back with their tipstaves.|$|R
5|$|Realising {{that the}} 22nd Guards Brigade {{group would be}} {{vulnerable}} to German armoured counterattacks in the open ground around Bir Wair and Mussaid, Brigadier Gott withdrew it during the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning of 16 May. By 10:00, the infantry had taken up new positions back at Halfaya Pass, although the 7th Armoured Brigade group was ordered to remain west of Fort Capuzzo for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Remnants of E.T. {{and other}} Atari games were {{discovered}} in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excavation, as reported by Microsoft's Larry Hyrb. A team of archaeologists was present to examine and document the Atari material unearthed by excavation machinery: Andrew Reinhard (American School of Classical Studies at Athens), Richard Rothaus (Trefoil Cultural and Environmental), Bill Caraher (University of North Dakota), with support from video game historian Raiford Guins (SUNY - Stony Brook) and historian Bret Weber (University of North Dakota).|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{was born}} in Heraklion, {{the capital city of}} the Greek island of Crete. His {{favourite}} footballer growing up was Marco van Basten. Samaras was also a keen basketball fan and his father, Ioannis Samaras, often let him stay up until the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning so he could watch his hero Michael Jordan.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{a witness}} was called who {{testified that he}} found Muff Potter washing in the brook, at an <b>early</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning that the murder was discovered, and that he {{immediately}} sneaked away.

60|$|Bridge, the boy, and {{the girl}} shivered {{together}} in their soggy clothing upon <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bed, feeling now in the cold dawn <b>the</b> chill discomfort <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> excitement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night had rendered them unconscious.

60|$|Various and eventful, however, {{had been}} <b>the</b> peregrinations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worthy couple in and about <b>the</b> {{different}} tap-houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood during <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night.

5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw was a fourteen-year-old British schoolgirl who drowned while {{crossing}} a swollen stream on Dartmoor during training for Ten Tors in 2007. Her death, {{the first to}} occur in connection with Ten Tors or one of its training expeditions, made national news headlines in the United Kingdom. She was {{with a group of}} students from Edgehill College trekking the route of Ten Tors in training for the main event when the group got into difficulties {{crossing a}} stream. Shaw slipped into the water and was washed downstream. She was located 20 minutes later by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter and airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where she died in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next morning.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 15 November the ship was tugged away by a Croatian fishing ship to the nearby Nečujam cove, where the vessel was beached to prevent her from sinking. In the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same day, the {{remaining}} JRM ships opened fire in retaliation for damaging Mukos. As Yugoslav forces left the area, the ship was towed to an overhauling shipyard in Šibenik {{on the night of}} 17/18 November, after being salvaged by HRM divers with the help of Brodospas. The ship was repaired and renamed Šolta, entering service with the HRM on 15 May 1992 with Mile Tomas in command.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{private secretary}} {{of a federal}} senator {{was told that the}} bomb squad was waiting nearby at this <b>early</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning. That would suggest that they knew about the bomb. The government would not permit people from the bomb squad to be called as witnesses to the inquest.|$|R
6000|$|For the moment, Mrs. Gallilee was petrified. At {{his time}} of life, was this fat and feeble {{creature}} approaching her with conjugal endearments?

And {{was this the}} result? ...|$|R
60|$|Gus's actions puzzled me. If he {{was bound}} {{for a day}} to Coney Island what had {{brought him to the}} office at such an <b>early</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning? I knew that he disliked early rising, and was pretty well {{satisfied}} that even <b>the</b> delight <b>of</b> paying me off would not have induced him to leave his soft bed.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{morning of}} November 7, 1825, the very morning the {{legislature}} was to convene, Sharp was assassinated. Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, {{it became clear}} that the motivation for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil {{to prevent them from}} leaving their nest during the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material.|$|E
5|$|Perceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied {{in school}} and, {{at the age}} of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a {{derelict}} house in Montego Bay with transgender friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.|$|E
6000|$|...

An <b>hour</b> afterwards I look again: half the arch is gone, {{and the rest is}} faded. Still later, the stern sky denies that it ever wore so benign a symbol of hope." ...|$|R
60|$|For <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, <b>the</b> {{flashing}} <b>of</b> candles, and {{a general}} and noisy movement among the blacks, had denoted <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villa. But the activity had gradually subsided: and before the clock struck nine, {{the manner in which}} the lights were distributed, and the general silence, showed that the party, most probably fatigued with their journey, had already separated for the night. <b>The</b> clamor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negroes had ceased, and <b>the</b> quiet <b>of</b> deep sleep was already prevailing among their humble dwellings.|$|R
5000|$|The Second Carlist War, or <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Matiners or Madrugadores (Catalan and Spanish for [...] "early-risers," [...] {{so-called}} {{from the}} harassing action {{that took place}} at <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning), was a short civil war fought primarily in Catalonia by the Carlists under General Ramón Cabrera against <b>the</b> forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> Isabella II. <b>The</b> uprising began in September 1846 and continued until May 1849, spreading to Galicia.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
5|$|William {{was born}} in the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning on 21 August 1765 at Buckingham House, the third child and son of King George III and Queen Charlotte. He had two elder brothers, George and Frederick, and was not {{expected}} to inherit the Crown. He was baptised in the Great Council Chamber of St James's Palace on 20 September 1765. His godparents were his paternal uncles, the Duke of Gloucester and Prince Henry (later Duke of Cumberland), and his paternal aunt, Princess Augusta, then hereditary duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In the <b>early</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news {{with the loss of}} his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{reckless}} fellows {{tried it}} out of devilment, but were promptly put down by <b>the</b> strong hand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city marshal, whose sympathies were with the broken [...] "ring." [...] It had been evident at an <b>early</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day that <b>the</b> town <b>of</b> Rock River itself was divided. Amos Ridings and Robie had carried a strong following over into <b>the</b> camp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmers. A general feeling had developed which demanded a change.|$|R
60|$|Devoting myself {{once more}} to <b>the</b> elucidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impenetrable puzzle which my own {{position}} presented to me, I now tried to meet the difficulty by investigating it from a plainly practical point <b>of</b> view. <b>The</b> events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memorable night being still unintelligible to me, I looked a little farther back, and searched my memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birthday for any incident which might prove of some assistance to me in finding the clue.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> whole {{population}} <b>of</b> Rochester and <b>the</b> adjoining towns {{rose from}} their beds at an <b>early</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following morning, {{in a state}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> utmost bustle and excitement.
