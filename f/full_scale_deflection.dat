25|$|The meter {{movement}} in a moving pointer analog multimeter is practically always a moving-coil galvanometer of the d'Arsonval type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands {{to support the}} moving coil. In a basic analog multimeter the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the current drawn from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog multimeter is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low cost multimeter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1milliampere from a circuit at <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> <b>deflection.</b> More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) multimeters typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog multimeter.|$|E

The resulting configurations generate very high supercirculation lift {{in addition to a}} vertical component of the pneumatically deflected engine thrust. A series of small scale wind tunnel tests and <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> static thrust <b>deflection</b> tests are discussed which provide a sufficient data base performance. These tests results show thrust deflections of greater than 90 deg produced pneumatically by nonmoving aerodynamic surfaces, and the ability to maintain constant high lift while varying the propulsive force from high thrust recovery required for short takeoff to high drag generation required for short low speed landings...|$|R
30|$|Torque is an {{important}} parameter of a mechanical power system, which reflects transmission efficiency, transmission reliability, and operating conditions of equipment. Torque monitoring {{is very important for}} real-time control and fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment. A torque measurement method based on the theory of magnetic effect is proposed for multipoint torque monitoring in shafting. A model of the deflection angle of the magnetization vector and torque is established based on the theory of magnetic equivalent. A non-contact signal extraction circuit based on hall sensor is designed, a torque loading experimental device is set up, and the torque calibration experiment is completed. The experimental results show that the sensitivity of the torque measurement system is 17.7  mV/Nm, and the maximum nonlinear error is 0.77 % <b>full</b> <b>scale.</b> The <b>deflection</b> angle of the magnetization vector has a good linear relation with the torque, which can be measured indirectly by the deflection angle. This method has the advantages of a simple device, strong anti-interference ability, and non-contact measurement. Because {{it is not necessary to}} do special treatment to the elastic shaft, it is convenient to form a non-contact torque sensing node, which can realize real-time monitoring of multipoint torque of shafting.|$|R

In mid-2006 they entered the Sing Sing Studios to record their self-titled debut five-track Extended Play (EP), Mammal, which was sold {{independently}} at their live shows and on their website.

50|$|For {{an analog}} meter movement, DC voltage is {{measured}} with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A switch (usually rotary) allows greater resistance to be inserted in series with the meter movement to read higher voltages.

5000|$|The signal {{passes through}} an anti-aliasing, resampling, or {{reconstruction}} filter, which may increase peak amplitude slightly {{due to the}} Gibbs phenomenon (The Gibbs Phenomenon is a mathematical concept and only applies to one point so in practice it is irrelevant to real life circuits and devices). It is possible, for the analog signal represented by the digital data to exceed digital full scale even if the digital data does not, and vice versa. In the analog domain there is no peak/clipping problem unless the d/a analog circuitry was badly designed. In the digital domain there are no peaks created by these conversions. [...] In analog systems, full scale may be defined by the maximum voltage available, or the maximum deflection (<b>full</b> <b>scale</b> <b>deflection</b> or FSD) or indication of an analog instrument such as a moving coil meter or galvanometer.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{sensitivity}} of a meter might be, for instance, 100 microamperes full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated {{to read some}} other quantity that {{can be converted to}} a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called shunts, allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> <b>deflection.</b> When an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor.|$|E
