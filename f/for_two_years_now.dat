500|$|Prisoners of the Sun was {{the first}} of The Adventures of Tintin to be serialised in its {{entirety}} in the new Tintin magazine. On the magazine's launch day of 26 September 1946, readers who had been without Tintin <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> received two pages per week in full colour under the title [...] (The Temple of the Sun). It began on what is now page 50 of the previous book The Seven Crystal Balls and included two pages outlining the crystal ball mystery, presented {{as if it were a}} press cutting. With Jacobs, Hergé completed the cover of the first issue and finished off The Seven Crystal Balls prior to embarking on Prisoners of the Sun, although Hergé included both under the title of The Temple of the Sun. To lessen his workload, a portion of the two pages of Hergé's strip was an explanatory block of text about Inca society, titled [...] "Qui étaient les Incas?" [...] ("Who were the Incas?"). Covering issues such as geography, history, and religion, each block was signed in Tintin's name.|$|E

6000|$|After all he {{had gone}} through that night, it {{disturbed}} Fenn very little to find on the following morning that the professional cracksman had gone off {{with one of the}} cups in his study.

60|$|It {{was for a}} {{long while}} an ever-recurring but. And then, after the second child, another blonde, winsome {{touching}} little thing, not so proud and flame-like as Joyce--after Annabel came, then Egbert began truly to realize how it was. His wife still loved him. But--and now the but had grown enormous--her physical love for him was of secondary importance to her. It became ever less important. After all, she had had it, this physical passion, <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>now.</b> It was not this that one lived from. No, no--something sterner, realer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{look forward}} to a general rising. I warned you before, I think, [...] already in my last letter. The cause is always the same. The natives [...] are weary of the {{hitherto}} régime--transport labour, collection of [...] rubber, preparation of food stores for blacks and whites. Again for [...] three months I have had to fight with only ten days' rest. I have 152 [...] prisoners. <b>For</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> I have been carrying on war in this [...] neighbourhood. But I cannot say I have subjected the people.

6000|$|A glow {{spread over}} her spirit, and filled {{her eyes with}} brightness. Nevertheless, before she left the Museum she was very far from saying, even {{in the privacy of}} her own mind, [...] "I am in love with you," [...] and that {{sentence}} might very well never have framed itself. She was, indeed, rather annoyed with herself for having allowed such an ill-considered breach of her reserve, weakening her powers of resistance, she felt, should this impulse return again. For, as she walked along the street to her office, the force of all her customary objections to being in love with any one overcame her. She did not want to marry at all. It seemed to her that there was something amateurish in bringing love into touch with a perfectly straightforward friendship, such as hers was with Ralph, which, <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> had based itself upon common interests in impersonal topics, such as the housing of the poor, or the taxation of land values.|$|E
40|$|The latest EU-Russia-Summit on 27 th June 2008 marks a {{breakthrough}} in their relations.

50|$|Maraon {{has been}} {{inactive}} in boxing <b>for</b> almost <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> after beating Jay Mondejar via 6th-round TKO in May 2009.

60|$|I {{went out}} and {{looked up and down}} the line; two deserted goods trucks stood as if they {{sheltered}} under a footbridge. The grass poked out through their wheels.

No train has come into Arras <b>for</b> <b>two</b> long <b>years</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{was more}} and more {{interested}} by Rachel as the days went on. A man must be stupid who does not know that a woman is happy in his presence, and <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> and more I had met no one with a very strong personal feeling for me. And quite apart from that, her mind was extraordinarily interesting to me because it was at once so active and so clear and so limited by her entirely English circumstances. She had the prosperous English outlook. She didn't so much see the wide world as get glimpses of it through the tangle of Westminster and of West End and week-end limitations. She wasn't even aware of that greater unprosperous England, already sulking and darkling outside her political world, that greater England which was presently to make its first audible intimations of discontent in that remarkable anti-climax to King George's Coronation, the Railway Strike. India for her was the land of people's cousins, Germany and the German Dreadnoughts bulked far larger, and all the tremendous gathering forces of the East were beyond the range of her imagination. I set myself to widen her horizons.|$|E
