According to Bill Bampton, the Gardens included tennis courts and pavilion, a bandstand, a bowling green, a substantial house for the head gardener, a conservatory and associated works areas. Under inaugural curator Thompson (1909-27), and curators James Willan (1930-39) and Harold Gray (1939-50), the Gardens developed a reputation for its chrysanthemums and dahlias, attracting workers and their families, {{as well as other}} local residents. In 1953, the management of Sunshine Gardens was handed to the newly established City of Sunshine. At this time, it was renamed the H.V. McKay Memorial Gardens. In the 1990s, the garden was listed by the National Trust of Australia and in the Register of the National Estate. In 2007 the Friends of McKay Gardens was formed to help maintain the gardens.|$|R

It is shown that statistically significant gross profits can be generated by a naïve strategy for most of the considered holding periods ranging from 3 months to 18 months. However, after the deduction of generous transaction costs, the net profits are statistically significant only for the 6 -month holding period returns. The implications of the profits produced by calendar spread trading methodology on the efficiency of the BAB futures market are also addressed.

40|$|This paper studies {{tests of}} {{calendar}} effects in equity returns. It {{is necessary to}} control for all possible calendar effects to avoid spurious results. The authors contribute to the calendar effects literature and its significance with a test for calendar-specific anomalies that conditions on the nuisance of possible calendar effects. Thus, their approach to test for calendar effects produces robust data-mining results. Unfortunately, attempts to control for {{a large number of}} possible calendar effects have the downside of diminishing the power of the test, making it more difficult to detect actual anomalies. The authors show that our test achieves good power properties because it exploits the correlation structure of (excess) returns specific to the calendar effect being studied. We implement the test with bootstrap methods and apply it to stock indices from Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Bootstrap p-values reveal that calendar effects are significant for returns in most of these equity markets, but end-of-the-year effects are predominant.

40|$|X-linked {{intellectual}} disability (XLID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. During {{the past two}} decades in excess of 100 X-chromosome ID genes have been identified. Yet, a large number of families mapping to the X-chromosome remained unresolved suggesting that more XLID genes or loci are yet to be identified. Here, we have investigated 405 unresolved families with XLID. We employed massively parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons in the index males. The majority of these males were previously tested negative for copy number variations and for mutations in a subset of known XLID genes by Sanger sequencing. In total, 745 X-chromosomal genes were screened. After stringent filtering, a total of 1297 non-recurrent exonic variants remained for prioritization. Co-segregation analysis of potential clinically relevant changes revealed that 80 families (20 %) carried pathogenic variants in established XLID genes. In 19 families, we detected likely causative protein truncating and missense variants in 7 novel and validated XLID genes (CLCN 4, CNKSR 2, FRMPD 4, KLHL 15, LAS 1 L, RLIM and USP 27 X) and potentially deleterious variants in 2 novel candidate XLID genes (CDK 16 and TAF 1). We show that the CLCN 4 and CNKSR 2 variants impair protein functions as indicated by electrophysiological studies and altered differentiation of cultured primary neurons from Clcn 4 (-/-) mice or after mRNA knock-down. The newly identified and candidate XLID proteins belong to pathways and networks with established roles in cognitive function and {{intellectual disability}} in particular. We suggest that systematic sequencing of all X-chromosomal genes in a cohort of patients with genetic evidence for X-chromosome locus involvement may resolve up to 58 % of Fragile X-negative cases.

40|$|A five {{component}} negotiation model which structures {{the interaction}} of agents along different levels of increasing complexity is investigated: The lowest level introduces the possible message types. The protocol level links those messages together to create communicational contexts. The decision layer needs some criteria to rank and compare different scheduling proposals. The usage of those criteria implements the negotiation strategy of the strategic level. As an outline we sketch how a cooperation level emerges within the agent society and enforces cooperative behavior of the agents. The model is presented at the problem of appointment scheduling, {{because it is an}} inherently distributed problem which necessarily involves communication, negotiation, and cooperation mechanisms to resolve possible conflicts. COSMA agents (COoperative Schedule Management Agents) are designed to act as personal assistants to maintain their user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>calendar.</b> They are provided with competence to negotiate about the scheduling of appointments with other users. After describing the message types, the negotiation protocol is presented. The decision criteria are derived from a time model based on the association of time intervals and preferences.

An example finally shows the overall behavior of the agent society and will reveal and answer several questions about the technical details...|$|R

40|$|Shanghai's {{story was}} a unique {{experience}} of Chinese modernity. It was a stage for multiple dialogues between modernity and tradition. Because of its ideal geographical location, Shanghai proudly served as a window for the coming of western ideas and materials. People in Shanghai were also proud of its {{leading role in the}} development of different cultural and mass media, including novel, film, and art. Among these, calendar posters were one of the most popular and widespread media and were regarded as an icon of the popular art of Shanghai from the 1910 s to the 1930 <b>s.</b> <b>Calendar</b> posters represented the urban life style and the taste of the age. The beautiful female images portrayed in a large number of calendar posters were undoubtedly the most eye-catching features. By depicting the women's appearance, physical posture, life style and esthetics in a seemingly "modern" and "liberated" style, calendar posters were regarded as a symbol of Shanghai's modernity. By decoding the cultural codes of the different themes, namely modernity, sexuality, family concept, smoking, and outdoor activities, in the calendar posters, we can gain a better understanding of the importance of traditional elements still embedded in the modern images of China in the early 20 th century. As China's most exciting metropolis, Shanghai's charm has already inspired many fruitful scholarly works. This piece is a modest attempt at the study of Shanghai's modern culture. Its academic significance, however, lies in the reading of the cultural and visual language of the calendar posters from a historical perspective. It helps us to understand not only the miracle of Shanghai's modernity but also the path and experience of Chinese modernity in which the seemingly modern features were also heavily blended with elements from Chinese tradition...|$|R

The challenges, complexities, events, and issues that occurred were viewed {{from the perspective of the}} new president (the first year on a new campus) in order to understand how a new president perceives and interprets his or her experiences in an organization. The focus of this study included how the president initiated change, interacted and built relationships with various constituents, assimilated information or surprising events as they occurred, handled critical events and difficulties, the style of leadership employed to move the institution forward, and what insight the new president provided into the everyday experiences of such a diverse and demanding role. ^ The setting for the study was a small, state college in a rural midwestern community. The primary informant for this study assumed his position on May 1, 1991. This project emerged from a pilot project conducted in May 1991. The informant was interviewed during his first month in office regarding his perceptions of presidential roles, responsibilities, and career paths. ^ Data were collected primarily from January through June 1992. Data collection strategies included a series of interviews with the informant, repeated observations of his daily activities and administrative cabinet meetings, analysis of a four-month period of the president 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>calendar</b> and related documents (memos, publications), and analysis of the informant 2 ̆ 7 s taped diary.
