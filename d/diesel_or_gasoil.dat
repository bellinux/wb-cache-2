30|$|In {{the next}} step, the dyed oil (n-heptane <b>or</b> <b>gasoil)</b> was {{injected}} {{from the top}} of the column using a syringe pump while the water was displaced from the end of the column. The injection process continued until the water saturation reached the irreducible state. The transparency of the model and dyed oil allowed us to monitor the oilâ€“water interface during the oil flooding. Initial oil in place and the connate water saturation at this step were measured by volumetric balance.|$|R

40|$|In this work, a {{parametric}} {{cost-benefit analysis}} concerning {{the use of}} integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology (with and without carbon capture and storage) is carried out. For the analysis, the IPP optimization software is used in which the electricity unit cost from various power generation technologies is calculated. For comparison purposes, the Rankine cycle (with heavy fuel oil or coal as fuel) and the combined cycle (with natural gas <b>or</b> <b>gasoil</b> as fuel) technologies are also examined. The parametric study carried out, using a range of load factors from 50 % to 90 % {{and a range of}} efficiencies for IGCC technology between 40 % and 55 %, yields encouraging results for the viability of this emerging technology.
