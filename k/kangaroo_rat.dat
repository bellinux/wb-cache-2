5|$|Footdrumming is used widely as a {{predator}} warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. The banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> produces several complex footdrumming patterns {{in a number}} of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat. Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat,</b> and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E
50|$|Strong {{intraspecific}} competition and little interspecific competition occurs among Dipodomys species. In New Mexico, where Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are sympatric with Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> (D. merriamii), Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> were mostly captured in grassy microhabitats, and Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> were captured more often around creosotebush. Herbicide defoliation of shrubs (for rangeland improvement) reduced live canopy cover of creosotebush {{and resulted in}} an increase in bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri). After treatment, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> replaced Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> as the dominant rodent. This was suggested to be due to the change in habitat structure to open grass.|$|R

25|$|When on {{foraging}} trips, kangaroo rats hoard {{the seeds}} that they find. It {{is important for}} a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> to encounter more food items than are consumed, at least {{at one point in}} the year, as well as defend or rediscover food caches and remain within the same areas long enough to utilize food resources. Different species of <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> may have different seed caching strategies to coexist with each other, as is the case for the banner-tailed <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> and Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> which have overlapping ranges. Merriam's kangaroo rats scatterhoard small caches of seeds in numerous small, shallow holes they dig. This is initially done close to the food source, maximizing harvest rates and reducing travel costs, but later redistributed more widely, minimizing theft by other rodents. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats larderhoard a sizable cache of seeds within the large mounds they occupy. This could decrease their time and energy expenses; they also spend less time on the surface digging holes, reducing risk of predation. Being larger and more sedentary, they are better able to defend these larders from depredations by other rodents.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo rats live {{in complex}} burrow systems. The burrows have {{separate}} chambers for specific purposes like sleeping, living and food storage. The spacing of the burrows {{depends on the}} number of kangaroo rats and the abundance of food. Kangaroo rats also live in colonies that range from six to several hundred dens. The burrow of a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> is important in providing protection from the harsh desert environment. To maintain a constant temperature and relative humidity in their burrows, kangaroo rats plug the entrances with soil during the day. When the outside temperature is too hot, a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> stays in its cool, humid burrow and leaves it only at night. To reduce loss of moisture through respiration when sleeping, a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> buries its nose in its fur to accumulate a small pocket of moist air. The burrows of Merriam's kangaroo rats are simpler and shallower than those of banner-tailed kangaroo rats. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats also mate in their burrows, unlike Merriam's kangaroo rats.|$|E
50|$|Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> {{occur in}} {{communities}} on sandy soils, including semiarid grasslands, mixed-grass prairie, shrub- and scrublands, and pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands.

In Oregon, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> occur in big sagebrush (A. tridentata), western juniper (J. occidentalis), and greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.) communities. In Idaho, they are most abundant injuniper woodlands with rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.) and winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata) in the understory, but also occur on shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) range. In Utah, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> have an affinity for sagebrush, pinyon-juniper, and saltbush (Atriplex spp.) communities. In Nevada, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are associated with big sagebrush communities. In Colorado, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> comprised 19% of small mammal captures in pinyon-juniper forest, scattered pinyon-juniper, and pinyon-juniper in canyon habitats. In New Mexico, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are found inyucca (Yucca spp.), oak (Quercus spp.), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), saltbush, and creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities. They are particularly abundant in mesquite sand dunes. In Texas, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> occur in honey mesquite (P. glandulosa), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), yucca, sand shinnery oak (Q. havardii), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) communities. In southwestern Kansas, Ord's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are characteristic residents of sand sagebrush prairie.|$|R
25|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are {{generally}} solitary animals with little social organization. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> communicate during competitive interactions and courtship. They do cluster together in some feeding situations. Groups of <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> that exist are aggregations and colonies. There {{appears to be}} a dominance hierarchy among male <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> in competition for access to females. Male <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> {{are generally}} more aggressive than females and are more dominant over them. Females are more tolerant of each other than males are and have more non-aggressive interactions. This is likely in part because the home ranges of females overlap less than the home ranges of males. Linear dominance hierarchies appear to exist among males but it is not known {{if this is the case}} for females. Winners of aggressive encounters appear to be the most active individuals.|$|R

25|$|Kangaroo rats have a {{promiscuous}} mating system. Their {{reproductive output}} is highest in summer following high rainfalls. During droughts and food shortages, {{only a few}} females will breed. It appears that kangaroo rats can assess their local conditions and adjust their reproductive efforts accordingly. Merriam's kangaroo rats breed between February and May and produce two or three litters per year. Before mating, {{the male and female}} will perform nasal-anal circling until the female stops and allows the male to mount her. A Merriam's <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> female will allow multiple males to mount her in a short time, perhaps to ensure greater chances of producing offspring. Mating in banner-tailed kangaroo rats involve more chasing and foot drumming in the male before the females allows him to mate.

2500|$|<b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> are {{primarily}} seed eaters. [...] They will, however, sometimes eat vegetation at some {{times of the}} year and some insects, too. They have been seen storing the seeds of mesquite, creosote, bush, purslane, ocotillo and grama grass in their cheek pouches. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> will store extra seeds in seed caches. This caching behavior affects the range-land and croplands where the animals live. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>rats</b> must harvest as much seed as possible in as little time as possible.

500|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide are {{metabolic}} end products of oxidation of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Oxidising a gram of carbohydrate produces 0.60 grams of water; a gram of protein produces 0.41 grams of water; and a gram of fat produces 1.07 grams of water, {{making it possible for}} xerocoles to live with little or no access to drinking water. The <b>kangaroo</b> <b>rat</b> for example makes use of this water of metabolism and conserves water both by having a low basal metabolic rate and by remaining underground during the heat of the day, reducing loss of water through its skin and respiratory system when at rest. Herbivorous mammals obtain moisture from the plants they eat. Species such as the addax antelope, dik-dik, Grant's gazelle and oryx are so efficient at doing this that they apparently never need to drink. The camel is a superb example of a mammal adapted to desert life. It minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung, and is able to lose 40% of its body weight through water loss without dying of dehydration. Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey. Many other hot desert animals are nocturnal, seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows. At depths of more than [...] , these remain at between [...] regardless of the external temperature. Jerboas, desert rats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes, coyotes, jackals and snakes that prey on them. Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate, panting, sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with saliva. Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin. The arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size. Birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies, a form of adaptive insulation. The emperor penguin has dense plumage, a downy under layer, an air insulation layer next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on Earth.|$|E
