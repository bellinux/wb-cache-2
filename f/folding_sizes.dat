2500|$|Males {{and females}} have {{different}} vocal <b>fold</b> <b>sizes.</b> [...] Adult male voices are usually lower pitched due to longer and thicker folds. The male vocal folds are between 1.75cm and 2.5cm [...] (approx 0.75" [...] to 1.0") in length, while female vocal folds are between 1.25cm and 1.75cm (approx 0.5" [...] to 0.75") in length. The vocal folds {{of children are}} much shorter than those of adult males and females. The difference in vocal fold length and thickness {{between males and females}} causes a difference in vocal pitch. Additionally, genetic factors cause variations between members of the same sex, with males' and females' voices being categorized into voice types.|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} in vocal <b>folds</b> <b>size</b> {{between men and}} women means that they have differently pitched voices. Additionally, genetics also causes variances amongst the same sex, with men's and women's singing voices being categorized into types. For example, among men, there are bass, baritone, tenor and countertenor (ranging from E2 to even F6), and among women, contralto, mezzo-soprano and soprano (ranging from F3 to C6 and higher). There are additional categories for operatic voices, see voice type. This is not the only source of difference between male and female voice. Men, generally speaking, have a larger vocal tract, which essentially gives the resultant voice a lower-sounding timbre. This is mostly independent of the vocal folds themselves.|$|R

40|$|Vocal folds {{are used}} as sound sources in various species, but it is unknown how vocal fold morphologies are {{optimized}} for different acoustic objectives. Here we identify two main variables affecting range of vocal fold vibration frequency, namely vocal fold elongation and tissue fiber stress. A simple vibrating string model is used to predict fundamental frequency ranges across species of different vocal <b>fold</b> <b>sizes.</b> While average fundamental frequency is predominantly determined by vocal <b>fold</b> length (larynx <b>size),</b> range of fundamental frequency is facilitated by (1) laryngeal muscles that control elongation and by (2) nonlinearity in tissue fiber tension. One adaptation that would increase fundamental frequency range is greater freedom in joint rotation or gliding of two cartilages (thyroid and cricoid), so that vocal fold length change is maximized. Alternatively, tissue layers can develop to bear a disproportionate fiber tension (i. e., a ligament with high density collagen fibers), increasing the fundamental frequency range and thereby vocal versatility. The range of fundamental frequency across species is thus not simply one-dimensional, but can be conceptualized {{as the dependent variable}} in a multi-dimensional morphospace. In humans, this could allow for variations that could be clinically important for voice therapy and vocal fold repair. Alternative solutions could also have importance in vocal training for singing and other highly-skilled vocalizations...|$|R

40|$|Since the Bell Telephone Laboratories first {{succeeded in}} {{producing}} high-speed motion pictures of vibrating vocal folds in 1937, {{a number of}} modifications in the filming system and analysis technique have been reported. The analysis techniques have tended to follow one basic approach; the film is projected one frame at a time onto a screen, and measurements of the relative vocal <b>fold</b> <b>size</b> and mo-tion are made. These approaches have in common {{the fact that it}} is extremely difficult by purely visual means to retrieve and correlate all of the data that may be present in a single frame, even though the frame itself covers but a relatively short period. In most instances, accordingly, these approaches are used for measurement or quan-tification in relation to a single point on the vocal folds. Recently, in an endeavor to overcome some of these inherent drawbacks, Hayden and Koike (1972) reported a technique for frame-by-frame film analysis employing a PDP- 8 computer. Although the system they used greatly simplified frame-by-frame analysis, the measuring system nevertheless requires teletype key...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This letter {{reports on}} a new gas phase {{printing}} approach to deposit nanomaterials into addressable areas on a surface with 50 nm lateral accuracy. Localized fringing fields that form around conventional resist patterns (PMMA and SiO 2) with openings to a silicon substrate are used to direct the assembly of nanomaterials into the openings. Directed assembly was observed due to a naturally occurring inbuilt charge differential at the material interface which was further enhanced by corona charging to yield a field strength exceeding 1 MV/m in Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KFM) measurements. The assembly process is independent of the nanomaterial source and type – an evaporative, plasma, and electrospray source have been tested to deposit silicon and metallic nanoparticles. The results suggest a potential route to form nanolenses {{on the basis of}} charged resist structures – a 3 <b>fold</b> <b>size</b> reduction has been observed between the structures and the assembled particles. When combined with the nanolens effect, continued assembly resulted in threedimensional deposition of tower structures. Applications range from the integration of functional nanomaterial building blocks to the elimination of liftoff steps in semiconductor processing...|$|R
40|$|Content-based file-type {{identification}} schemes {{often use}} byte-frequency distri-bution as a feature and use statistical and data mining techniques to classify file types. Since those schemes use the entire file content to obtain byte-frequency distribution and use all possible byte patterns in file classification, they are inefficient and time-consuming. This paper proposes two techniques {{to reduce the}} classification time. The first method is a feature selection technique, which uses a subset of highly-occurring byte patterns in building the representative model of a file type and classifying files. To evaluate its effectiveness, we applied it to the six most popular classification algorithms (i. e. neural network, linear discriminant analysis, K-means, K-nearest neigh-bor, decision tree, and support vector machine). On average, the K-nearest neighbor method achieved the optimum accuracy of 90 % using only 40 % of byte patterns; this reduces 55 % of computation time. The second method is the content sampling technique, which uses {{a small portion of}} a file to ob-tain its byte-frequency distribution. It is effective for large size files where a relatively small sample can generate the representative byte frequency distri-bution. For instance, it reduces the sampling size of MP 3 files from 5 MB to 400 KB (without compromising the accuracy). This is a 15 <b>fold</b> <b>size</b> reduction...|$|R

To analyze nutritional status and tissue composition characteristics and determine the value of bioimpedance methods for complex examination of nutritional status in children after HSCT are {{the goal of this}} study.  Changes in nutritional status and tissue composition of 34 children during HSCT due to various malignant and non-malignant diseases were analyzed. Bioimpedance measurements and somatometry was used to assess tissue composition. Significant worsening of nutritional status, skeletal muscle mass loss with a relatively stable adipose tissue to day + 100 has been shown. A significant decrease of active cell mass and phase angle in all study phases were revealed. A high correlation between body fat mass index and skin-fat <b>folds</b> <b>size</b> over the triceps (r = 0. 86), as well as between skeletal muscle mass index and shoulder muscles circle size (r = 0. 82) was revealed.  It is concluded that in the early post-transplant period (up to 100 days) nutritional status significantly worsened and tissue imbalance developed with a relative predominance of fat component and somatic protein pool reduction. Importance of comprehensive evaluation and monitoring of nutritional status to develop a strategy for nutritional support in children after HSCT is discussed. </p...|$|R

Five vocal parameters were analyzed: mean F 0 (an acoustic correlate of vocal <b>fold</b> <b>size),</b> F 0 variation, intensity (loudness), utterance duration, and formant dispersion (D f, an acoustic correlate of vocal tract length). Parallel but separate ratings of speech transcripts served as controls for content. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the independent contributions of each of the predictors. Physical dominance was predicted by low F 0 variation and physically dominant word content. Social dominance was predicted only by socially dominant word content. Ratings of attractiveness by women were predicted by low mean F 0, low D f, high intensity, and attractive word content across cycle phase and mating context.

40|$|Abstract: This {{technical}} paper reports progress {{on two fronts}} on the proposed {{research in the field}} of Nanoxerography. Aspect 1 reports on a new nanolens approach on the basis of charged resist structures to print nanoparticles with high resolution – a 3 <b>fold</b> <b>size</b> reduction has been observed between the structures and the assembled particles. Directed assembly was observed due to a naturally occurring inbuilt charge differential at the material interface which was further enhanced by corona charging to yield a field strength exceeding 1 MV/m in Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KFM) measurements. The assembly process is independent of the nanomaterial source and type – an evaporative, plasma, and electrospray source have been tested to deposit silicon and metallic nanoparticles. Aspect 2 reports on a new approach to produce high resolution charge patterns using a process that can be scaled to large areas since prior processes were limited to cm 2 sized substrates. A new process was discovered that can potentially scale Nanoxerography to large area printing and possibly roll-to-roll processing. While an extension to roll-to-roll is outside of the scope of the proposed work we decided to include preliminary results on the process in this report. The process is called Nanocontact Electrification and uses forced delamination of insulating surfaces which result in uncompensated surface charges. The process produces charged surfaces and associated fields that exceed the breakdown strength of air leading to strong long range adhesive forces and force distance curves which are recorded over macroscopic distances. The process is applied to fabricate charge patterned surfaces for nanoxerography demonstrating 200 nm resolution nanoparticle prints and applied to thin film electronics where the patterned charges are used to shift the threshold voltages of underlying transistors...|$|R
