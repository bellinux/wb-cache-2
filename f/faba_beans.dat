It is a pest of <b>faba</b> <b>beans</b> (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out.

5|$|Once {{males and}} females are both sexually mature, mating is spread over a few weeks. Insects are active when {{temperature}} reaches 20°C; temperatures above 25°C are very favorable to their activity in the field whereas colder temperatures below 15°C and wet weather limit insect mobility. Once fertilized, females B. rufimanus lay eggs on developing pods of <b>faba</b> <b>beans.</b> Rain, wind and temperatures below 20°C put on hold the oviposition process. Eggs are laid predominantly on the lowest parts of the plant. Eggs are small (< 2mm diameter), white-yellowish. A maximum of ten eggs per pod is observed. Females lay between 50 and 100 eggs. Rain might increase egg mortality.|$|E

Among the biotic constraints, the emerging <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> gall disease, caused by Olpidium viciae, is the major and most destructive disease wherever <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> is grown. Field experiments were conducted at two locations (Farta and Tach Gayint districts) to evaluate the reaction of <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> varieties to <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> gall disease and to assess them for yield and yield components during the 2014 and 2015 main cropping seasons. Thirteen <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> varieties and one local check were planted in three replications using a randomized complete block design. The disease incidence and severity of <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> gall were recorded (on a 1 â 9 scale) five times at 10 -day intervals.

Here, intercropping of naked oat with two different <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars (determinate-high tannin and indeterminate-low tannin) was compared with sole crops of each species in 2006 - 2008.

This study investigated the potential of <b>faba</b> <b>bean,</b> narrow-leafed lupin and lentil as protein crops in southern Finland, where <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> is traditional but {{the other two are}} novel. RESULTS Early cultivars of narrow-leafed lupin and lentil matured adequately. Protein concentration in <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> was, at 32 %, higher than the world average of 29 %, while those of narrow-leafed lupin and lentil were close to their world averages. Protein yields decreased in the order <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> > narrow-leafed lupin > lentil. Lipid content of <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> and lentil was about 1. 2 % and that of narrow-leafed lupin about 5. 5 %, and fatty acid composition was largely oleic and linoleic in all three species. CONCLUSION Both lentil and narrow-leafed lupin can be added to the range of feed and food crops produced at high latitudes in Europe. While <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> produces the greatest protein yield and lysine concentration, the higher sulfur amino acid concentration in lupin, its oil content and its adaptation to acid, sandy soils not suitable for <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> make it an attractive alternative. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R

Using primers complementary to soybean ClpB/Hsp 100 gene, we analyzed the transcript expression profile of <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> ClpB/Hsp 100 gene in leaves of seedlings and flowering plants and in pollen grains. ClpB/Hsp 100 protein accumulation profile was analyzed in leaves of <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> seedlings using Arabidopsis thaliana cytoplasmic Hsp 101 antibodies. The transcript and protein levels of <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> ClpB/Hsp 100 were significantly induced in response to heat stress...|$|R
40|$|Summary Root {{growth is}} {{influenced}} by soil nutrients and neighbouring plants, but how these two drivers affect root interactions and regulate plant growth dynamics is poorly understood. Here, interactions between the roots of maize (Zea mays) and <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia <b>faba)</b> are characterized. Maize was grown alone (maize) or with maize (maize/maize) or <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> (maize/faba bean) as competitors under five levels of phosphorus (P) supply, and with homogeneous or heterogeneous P distribution. Maize had longer root length and greater shoot biomass and P content when grown with <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> than with maize. At each P supply rate, <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> had a smaller root system than maize but greater exudation of citrate and acid phosphatase, suggesting a greater capacity to mobilize P in the rhizosphere. Heterogeneous P availability enhanced the root-length density of maize but not <b>faba</b> <b>bean.</b> Maize root proliferation in the P-rich patches was associated with increased shoot P uptake. Increased P availability by localized P application or {{by the presence of}} <b>faba</b> <b>bean</b> exudation stimulated root morphological plasticity and increased shoot growth in maize in the maize/faba bean mixture, suggesting that root interactions of neighbouring plants can be modified by increased P availability...|$|R
