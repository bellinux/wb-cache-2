5000|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the English-speaking world, {{addresses}} in Australia put the street number—which may be a range—before the street name, and the placename before the postcode. Unlike addresses in most other comparable places, the city is not included in the address, but rather a much more fine-grained locality is used, usually referred to in Australia as a suburb or town - although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries. Because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or <b>delivery</b> <b>type,</b> the postcode serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address. As an example, there are around 8000 localities in Victoria (cf. List of localities in Victoria (Australia) and List of Melbourne suburbs), yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes. For certain large volume receivers or post offices, the [...] "locality" [...] may be an institution or street name. It is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address (unless this happens to be the name of the suburb), and doing so may delay delivery.|$|E

40|$|Association of <b>delivery</b> <b>type</b> with {{postpartum}} depression, {{perceived social}} support and maternal attachment Objective: There are contradictory findings in the literature {{about the effects of}} <b>delivery</b> <b>type</b> on postpartum depression and mother–infant interaction. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between delivery mode and postpartum depression, {{perceived social support}}, and maternal attachment. Method: Forty females, who had vaginal delivery (VD) and 40 females, who had cesarean delivery (CD) were recruited to participate in the study. Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to screen depressive symptoms and Maternal Attachment Scale (MAS) was used to detect maternal attachment. Social support was assessed by using Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Results: We found no significant differences in postpartum depression and perceived social support scores between the two groups. On the other hand, MAS scores were significantly lower in CD women. Discussion: Our findings support that delivery mode had no impact on the development of postpartum depression. However CD may have negative effect on maternal attachment.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the cost of childbirth in a teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain, including the costs of prenatal care, delivery and postnatal care (3 months). Costs were assessed by taking into account maternal origin and <b>delivery</b> <b>type.</b> Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of all deliveries in a teaching hospital to mothers living in its catchment area between October 2006 and September 2007. A process cost analysis based on a full cost accounting system was performed. The main information sources were the primary care program for sexual and reproductive health, and hospital care and costs records. Partial and total costs were compared according to maternal origin and <b>delivery</b> <b>type.</b> A regression model was fit to explain the total cost of the childbirth process as a function of maternal age and origin, prenatal care, <b>delivery</b> <b>type,</b> maternal and neonatal severity, and multiple delivery. Results The average cost of childbirth was 4, 328 €, with an average of 18. 28 contacts between the mother or the newborn and the healthcare facilities. The delivery itself accounted for more than 75 % of the overall cost: maternal admission accounted for 57 % and neonatal admission for 20 %. Prenatal care represented 18 % of the overall cost and 75 % of overall acts. The average overall cost was 5, 815 € for cesarean sections, 4, 064 € for vaginal instrumented deliveries and 3, 682 € for vaginal non-instrumented deliveries (p Conclusions Neither immigration nor prenatal care were associated with a substantial difference in costs. The most important predictors of cost were <b>delivery</b> <b>type</b> and neonatal severity. Given the impact of cesarean sections on the overall cost of childbirth, attempts should be made to take into account its higher cost in the decision of performing a cesarean section. </p...|$|E
40|$|Delivery of {{essential}} newborn care {{is key to}} reducing neonatal mortality rates, yet coverage of protective birth practices remains incomplete and variable, with or without skilled attendance. Evidence of changes over time in newborn care provision, disaggregated by care practice and <b>delivery</b> <b>type,</b> {{can be used by}} policymakers to review efforts to reduce mortality. We examine such trends in four areas using control arm trial data. We analysed data from the control arms of cluster randomised controlled trials in Bangladesh (27 553 births), eastern India (8 939), Dhanusha, Nepal (15 344) and Makwanpur, Nepal (6 765) over the period 2001 - 2011. For each trial, we calculated the observed proportion of attended births and the coverage of WHO essential newborn care practices by year, adjusted for clustering and stratification. To explore factors contributing to the observed trends, we then analysed expected trends due only to observed shifts in birth attendance, accounted for stratification, <b>delivery</b> <b>type</b> and statistically significant interaction terms, and examined disaggregated trends in care practice coverage by <b>delivery</b> <b>type.</b> Attended births increased over the study periods in all areas from very low rates, reaching a maximum of only 30 % of deliveries. Newborn care practice trends showed marked heterogeneity within and between areas. Adjustment for stratification, birth attendance and interaction revealed that care practices could change in opposite directions over time and/or between delivery types - e. g. in Bangladesh hygienic cord-cutting and skin-to-skin contact fell in attended deliveries but not home deliveries, whereas in India birth attendant hand-washing rose for institutional deliveries but fell for home deliveries.

40|$|It is {{recognized}} {{that the experience of}} childbirth can influence post-partum mothers’ adjustment. If a positive birth experience may facilitate mother-newborn first interactions, a stressful or negative experience may impair the mothers’ emotional and physical wellbeing and may relate to post-partum depression. Childbirth experience can be influenced by medical-obstetric variables, but also by women’s expectations towards labor and delivery. The present study aims to investigate whether women’s expectations related to childbirth, and specifically fear of childbirth, and some childbirth medical-obstetric variables (complications or problems during labor and <b>delivery,</b> <b>type</b> of delivery, use of epidural analgesia) predict the subjective experience of childbirth. 117 Italian first-time pregnant women completed the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (version A) between the 32 nd and 37 th week of pregnancy (time 1) and the Wijma Delivery Experience Questionnaire (version B) 30 - 40 days postpartum (Time 2). Furthermore, some information about <b>delivery</b> (<b>type</b> of delivery, labor duration, epidural analgesia) were obtained from the maternal ward birth records. Results revealed that women’s childbirth experience is significantly predicted by complications during labor and delivery and by the type of delivery (vaginal versus operative delivery/emergency cesarean section). Contrarily, neither the labor duration nor the use of epidural analgesia or women’s expectations towards childbirth predict the mothers’ subjective experience. Clinical implication will be discussed, with particular attention to the role that the birth experience can play in the mother-infant post-partum wellbeing...|$|E

40|$|Background: Neonatal {{weight and}} length at birth are {{important}} indexes of newborn health which can show {{not only the}} quality of intrauterine growth of he fetus but also the quality of maternal prenatal care. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the weight and length of newborn infants at birth and some of their risk factors at hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed from September 2003 to September 2004. 995 newborns were studied. Neonatal data included sex, gestational age, fetal presentation, existence of congenital anomalies collected from medical records. Maternal data contained age, gravidity, parity, history of abortion or infertility, placental position, history of chronic disease, and <b>delivery</b> <b>type</b> in interviews with the newborns' mothers. Neonatal weight and length were measured at birth. Findings: The mean weight and length was 3139 ± 542 g and 49. 33 ± 2. 62 cm respectively. There was significant statistical relation between the newborns mean weight or length and neonatal sex, gestational age, singleton pregnancy, maternal gravidity or parity. Maternal age, <b>delivery</b> <b>type,</b> history of maternal infertility, placental position, maternal chronic disease or neonatal congenital malformation had no significant effect on the mean neonatal weight or length.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that negative childbirth expectations adversely influence perinatal outcomes. The current research builds on this with Italian mothers-to-be. Objective: The present study (1) explored the influence of cognitive and emotional variables on labour and delivery outcomes and (2) examined how individual characteristics, couple adjustment, and medical factors influence the childbirth experience. Method: 121 Italian primiparous women participated in a prospective longitudinal study where participants completed a set of questionnaires between the 32 nd and 37 th week of pregnancy and again 30 – 40 days postdelivery. Results: Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that women with negative childbirth expectations were {{three times more likely to}} experience an emergency C-section or an instrumental vaginal delivery. Furthermore, childbirth expectations predicted subjective birth experience. This relationship between expectations and <b>delivery</b> <b>type</b> and the subjective childbirth experience was weak while other variables (such as anxiety, depression, couple adjustment) did not significantly influence <b>delivery</b> <b>type</b> or the subjective childbirth experience. Conclusions: The weak relationship between childbirth expectations and perinatal outcomes renders it necessary to question the nature of the relationship found in previous research, especially considering inconsistencies of the literature on the subject. The current research makes it clear that further research is needed to understand better the relationship between expectations and perinatal outcomes in order to better improve the well-being of mothers-to-be during labour and delivery...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{converging}} {{evidence that}} approximately 2 % of women fulfill PTSD criteria following childbirth. This {{study examined the}} presentation and symptom structure of PTSD after birth and key risk factors in women from internet and community samples. Methods: PTSD was measured in 1423 women after birth recruited via the community (n = 502) or internet (n = 921). Demographic, obstetric, and trauma history variables were also measured. Results: Full PTSD diagnostic criteria were endorsed by 2. 5 % of women from the community and 21 % of women on the internet. Many more endorsed individual PTSD symptom criteria, suggesting this might be inflated by postnatal factors. Samples differed on demographic and obstetric characteristics. Factor analysis found two PTSD symptom clusters of re-experiencing and avoidance (RA) and numbing and arousal (NA). PTSD cases were predicted by parity, <b>delivery</b> <b>type,</b> NA and RA symptoms, and the interaction between sexual trauma and <b>delivery</b> <b>type.</b> This correctly identified 60 % of PTSD cases. Limitations: Questionnaire measurement of PTSD means prevalence rates may be over-estimated. Differences between samples suggest that internet samples over represent symptomatic women.
