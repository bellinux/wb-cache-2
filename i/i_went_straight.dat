500|$|Alec Guinness was {{originally}} offered only four D'Ascoyne parts, recollecting [...] "I read [...] {{on a beach}} in France, collapsed with laughter on the first page, and didn't even bother to {{get to the end of}} the script. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, 'Why four parts? Why not eight!?' "; he eventually played nine parts.|$|E
2500|$|He said he {{was left}} {{exhausted}} and depressed by his dealings with Kasenetz and Katz. [...] "In the mornings I {{would go into the}} office and start writing and after I had finished one song in a day, which was very high output for me, they'd {{come up to me and}} say: 'Give us another song!' And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. The doctor told me: 'You are totally over-worked.' I don't think I've ever felt so depressed as I did when I came back from New York." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eggleston {{taught at}} Harvard in 1973 and 1974, {{and it was}} during these years that he {{discovered}} dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: [...] "It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, may <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out to {{the fields}} to-day?" [...] she asked. [...] "I know if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> along the Edgware Road I'll come to them soon. And I'll be home early." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You hear, de Mieville; {{bring the}} men on with all speed. I will gallop forward with my troopers and do what I can. Do <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> along the road?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> up?" [...] {{he asked}} the woman, who he thought was {{standing}} ostentatiously in the hall as if to bar his way. [...] "I desire to see M. le duc." ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> home to Po-Po's, {{and related}} my {{adventure}} to the doctor.|$|E
60|$|RUTH. Yes, I just {{managed to}} get away from him. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> to my friend. It was eight o'clock.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I did,' said Hartopp calmly. 'I wasn't even humorous {{about it}} as some clerics might have been. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> through and said naught.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I've {{got their}} goat," [...] the captain insisted. [...] "When trouble's hatching, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> {{to them and}} tell them what. They can't {{get the hang of}} it. Think I've got some {{powerful}} devil-devil medicine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{backed out}} from the Regulators, an' while the shut down lasts am goin' to see what I {{can do in the}} way of workin' the garden. Father's let me off from a floggin' if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> after this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, [...] "this is a bold stroke. I half {{expected}} it. Ughtred of Tyrnaus has courage at least. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> to St. Petersburg. I will give pledges of what I {{have promised to}} your Minister there." ...|$|R
60|$|With that we parted, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> home, {{in a hot}} temper, {{and found}} Uma trying {{on a lot of}} trade goods like a baby.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Now,' says I, `go there an' tell 'em what's took place. It'll be {{the better}} for {{yourself}} if you do.' An' then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> off to Brighton." ...|$|E
60|$|On the Sunday when I {{last saw}} you, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> to Lord John's {{with the letter}} you read. He was out of town, and I left it with my card.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it comes}} down to playing a straight, no-nonsense, face-melting shred guitar solo, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> to my PGM301. It is the easiest guitar to play in my whole collection, and still has the best balance of picking clarity and percussive thickness. Paul Gilbert ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my brother, Fate had now {{brought me}} within three miles of thee; and--but shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>{{straight}}</b> on, and tell thee all, Pierre? all? every thing? art thou of such divineness, that I may speak straight on, {{in all my}} thoughts, heedless whither they may flow, or what things they may float to me?" ...|$|R
60|$|MANGAN [gasping]. You little devil, you've done me. [On {{the point}} of {{collapsing}} into the big chair again he recovers himself]. Wait a bit, though: you're not so cute as you think. You can't beat Boss Mangan as easy as that. Suppose <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> to Mrs Hushabye and tell her that you're {{in love with her}} husband.|$|R
60|$|The {{dinner was}} over; {{there was the}} {{fragrance}} of cooked rhubarb in the room. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> to Emily, who was leaning back in her chair, and put the Salome before her.|$|E
60|$|Rousing myself {{after some}} minutes, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> to Sebastian's rooms, {{and told him}} in brief terms that Nurse Wade had {{disappeared}} at a moment's notice, and had sent a note to tell me so.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> to her house. I {{seemed to}} float rather than walk; I hardly felt the ground under my feet; I thought pernicious fever {{must be a}} great boon to make one feel so strong.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Pritchard announced; [...] "down {{here to see}} you, and for {{no other}} reason. Not but that the scenery isn't all it should be, {{and that sort of}} thing," [...] he went on, [...] "but I am not putting up any bluff about it. It's you I am here to talk to. Are you ready? Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> ahead?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give {{this letter}} to Madame," [...] Alvina said to Ciccio. [...] "I shall {{be at the}} hall by seven tonight. <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Philip, lad!" [...] he said gravely. [...] "Your mother thinks <b>I</b> be <b>gone</b> <b>straight</b> away to Farmer Woods to {{see about}} the colt, don't she?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> to the Residency, {{and though}} the attendants would have stayed me, I so insisted, both with words and with force, that they were {{constrained}} to show me directly into {{the presence of the}} Governor.|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} {{letter-box}} I came to I stopped and reaching into my breast-pocket I {{took out the}} letter--it was as if I were plucking out my very heart--and dropped it through the slit. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> on board.|$|E
60|$|Wemmick was out, {{and though}} he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> back to the Temple, where I found the terrible Provis {{drinking}} rum and water and smoking negro-head, in safety.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{either that}} boot comes back before sundown or I'll see the manager {{and tell him}} that <b>I</b> <b>go</b> right <b>straight</b> out of this hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll ask Glinda. <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> {{back to her}} {{and tell}} her that my magic tools have also disappeared. The good Sorceress will be greatly shocked, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jeff, <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> to my sister, and {{be first}} wi' the news," [...] said Captain Millet on landing. [...] "You said my Rosebud {{is with her}} just now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish we were. We {{came back}} {{last week and}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> down to the Cedars--Tom's place at Melton, you know. I don't think I've been warm since I landed in England. Just now I'm nearly frozen to death." ...|$|E
60|$|I confided all to my aunt when I got home; and {{in spite}} of all she could say to me, went to bed despairing. I got up despairing, and went out despairing. It was Saturday morning, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> to the Commons.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> up {{the hill}} and down the road to the manse where Dick lived with his old housekeeper, Mrs. Dodge. She came to the door when I knocked and I said, very politely, [...] "Can I see the Reverend Stephen Richmond, if you please?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really have}} a great deal of work to do," [...] he said, [...] "and I must write this notice for the Day. I think that <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> home." ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, as {{the case}} would be fully {{reported}} next morning in all the papers, I saw at once that <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> off and explain the matter without delay to Emily.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{tolerable}} in Vancouver; anyway, while <b>I</b> could <b>go</b> <b>straight</b> {{ahead and}} interest {{myself in the}} development of the mine. I began to expect a good deal from my English visit." ...|$|R
