25|$|The {{inability}} to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, is a core deficit in Autism. Children with Autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent any other way. They {{do not know}} <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with Autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal. Children with Autism require intensive intervention to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> their intent.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Outlook {{magazine}} published that Mukerji {{had established}} {{herself as the}} most successful actress of contemporary Hindi cinema. Her first film role that year was opposite Amitabh Bachchan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's highly acclaimed Black, a drama about an alcoholic man who dedicates his life to teach a blind and deaf girl <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate.</b> Bhansali wrote {{the part of the}} blind-deaf girl specifically for Mukerji, who was initially hesitant to take on the role due to its [...] "challenging" [...] subject matter. Once Bhansali enforced his faith in her, she agreed and began intensely studying sign language with professionals at the Helen Keller Institute in Mumbai. Black won several awards including two National Film Awards and eleven Filmfare Awards, and Richard Corliss of TIME featured it as the fifth best film of the year. Mukerji's performance met with unanimous acclaim; Empire called the performance [...] "astonishing", Filmfare included her work in their listing of Indian cinema's [...] "80 Most Iconic performances" [...] and wrote, [...] "Rani has left an indelible mark with this role that usually comes once in a lifetime for most". She became the only actress to win both the Best Actress and Best Actress– Critics trophies at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.|$|E

This suggests that to assess communicative language ability (Bachman 1990), teachers need <b>to</b> know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> meaningfully <b>communicate</b> in English as well as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> assess the construct of communicative competence (Morrow 2018).|$|R

500|$|After meeting U2 in 1987, Steinberg {{stayed in}} touch with Bono and when the group was putting the Zoo TV Tour {{together}} in 1992, the lead singer {{thought it would be}} good to have a choreographer to critique his moves on stage. Steinberg worked during the tour's pre-production to show the group <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> their ideas all the way to the last rows of a venue. Recognizing Bono was not a dancer, she focused on movements he could do, and sought to help him pace himself and not get lost visually in the show's enormous stage set. The group's hit [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] had featured a belly dancer in its music video, and the group decided to incorporate one in their on-stage performance of the song. The original dancer left when the tour moved to its outdoor stadium legs. According to Steinberg, having a belly dancer on the tour originated as [...] "a bit of a joke". Steinberg began by training the dancer, and when that dancer left the tour, a replacement was needed. Bono asked Steinberg if she would like to take over and she agreed, although she had never belly danced before and by her own description did not have the voluptuous body usually associated with the form.|$|E

Phillips explained that until the choreography is 100% certain, Madonna does not confirm the fashion or the designs, instead employed back-and-forth conversations regarding them. Michele also noted that Madonna [...] "doesn't just want to look beautiful– she cares more about the performance.

2500|$|Bonobos {{are capable}} of passing the mirror-recognition test for self-awareness, as are all great apes. They {{communicate}} primarily through vocal means, although the meanings of their vocalizations are not currently known. However, most humans do understand their facial expressions {{and some of their}} natural hand gestures, such as their invitation to play. The communication system of wild bonobos includes a characteristic that was earlier only known in humans: bonobos use the same call to mean different things in different situations, and the other bonobos have to take the context into account when determining the meaning. Two bonobos at the Great Ape Trust, Kanzi and Panbanisha, have been taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> using a keyboard labeled with lexigrams (geometric symbols) and they can respond to spoken sentences. Kanzi's vocabulary consists of more than 500 English words, and he has comprehension of around 3,000 spoken English words. Kanzi is also known for learning by observing people trying to teach his mother; Kanzi started doing the tasks that his mother was taught just by watching, some of which his mother had failed to learn. Some, such as philosopher and bioethicist Peter Singer, argue that these results qualify them for [...] "rights to survival and life"—rights which humans theoretically accord to all persons. (See great ape personhood) Afterwards Kanzi was also taught how to use and create stone tools in 1990. Then, within 3 years, three researchers—Kathy Schick, Nicholas Toth and Gary Garufi—wanted to test Kanzi's knapping skills. Though Kanzi was able to form flake technology, he did not create it the way they expected. Unlike the way hominids did it, where they held the core in one hand and knapped it with the other, Kanzi threw the cobble against a hard surface or against another cobble. This allowed him to produce a larger force to initiate a fracture as opposed to knapping it in his hands.|$|E
