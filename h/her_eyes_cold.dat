60|$|He {{had looked}} to see this girl of the effete and effeminate upper class swoon with terror before him; but to his intense astonishment she but stood erect and brave before him, her head high held, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>cold</b> and level and unafraid. And then she spoke again.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs. Easterfield {{went up to}} Olive's {{room she}} found <b>her</b> bathing <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in <b>cold</b> water.|$|R
60|$|He made no {{response}} to her lighter mood. The appeal in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> left him <b>colder</b> than ever.|$|R
60|$|He hid {{his face}} in his hands, crying miserably, while she, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> hard and <b>cold,</b> stepped past him and went out.|$|R
60|$|The taunt stopped her, and for {{a moment}} an evil light shone in <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mademoiselle Hennequin did not venture below, {{until she}} had gone into her own room. Here she wept freely {{for a minute or}} two, and then she bathed <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in <b>cold</b> water, and used the napkin in drying them. Owing to this circumstance, I was {{fortunately}} a witness of all that passed in her interview with her lover.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{described}} as [...] "small of stature, frail but erect", her face was narrow, <b>her</b> light-coloured <b>eyes,</b> <b>cold</b> and unmoving, and her lips thin. She was highly intelligent, but austere and self-righteous. Her speech was sharply sarcastic and vehement. Agrippa d' Aubigné, the Huguenot chronicler, described Jeanne as having [...] "a mind powerful enough to guide the highest affairs".|$|R
6000|$|... "I've seen my bride another's bride,-- [...] Have {{seen her}} seated by his side,-- [...] Have seen the infant which she bore, [...] Wear the sweet smile the mother wore, [...] When she and I in youth have smiled [...] As fond and faultless as her child:-- [...] Have seen <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> in <b>cold</b> disdain, [...] Ask if I felt no secret pain.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was giving}} him some {{excellent}} advice," [...] said the marquise, fixing <b>her</b> fresh, <b>cold</b> <b>eyes</b> upon our hero. [...] "It's {{for him to take}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would hate}} me whose evil fortune {{it was to}} draw you to death, and in life or out of it I should never forgive myself--never! never!" [...] and she covered <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with <b>her</b> <b>cold,</b> wet hand and sighed.|$|R
60|$|With a happy {{smile on}} her lips she opened the door. She was {{on the point of}} asking him playfully if he had felt {{surprised}} at her long absence--when the sight that met <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> turned <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> with terror in an instant.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{a longing}} to say: 'Part {{of one of}} my {{families}} under the rose.' As a fact it was {{the best part of the}} only one, but the temptation to multiply exceedingly was almost overpowering. He checked himself, however, and went on eating partridge, his secret irritation crimsoning his cheeks; and he watched <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> those <b>cold</b> precise and round grey eyes, noting it, and knew she was thinking: 'He eats too much.' ...|$|R
60|$|Eve had not {{misread the}} storm-signals. Her employer's mood was still {{as it had}} been earlier in the day. Dinner passed in almost {{complete}} silence. Mrs. Rastall-Retford sat brooding dumbly. <b>Her</b> <b>eye</b> was <b>cold</b> and menacing, and Peter, working his way through his vegetables, shuddered for Eve. He had understood her allusion to bridge, having been privileged several times during his stay to see his hostess play that game, and he hoped {{that there would be no}} bridge to-night.|$|R
6000|$|Mesa lifted <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and looked}} at them. [...] "I think it too much," [...] she said, [...] "but {{it is for the}} lady Baaltis to judge. Who am I that I should open my lips in the {{presence}} of the lady Baaltis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|That last stroke {{touched the}} woman's heart; <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> <b>eye</b> softened, <b>her</b> hard mouth relaxed, and pity {{was about to}} win the day, when prudence, {{in the shape of}} Miss Cotton, turned the scale, for that spiteful {{spinster}} suddenly cried out, in a burst of righteous wrath: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it seemed}} to him there was {{something}} metallic in her laughter, and that the light in <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> was <b>cold.</b> On {{the spur of the moment}} it reminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the North Pacific. And for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes--a gale at night, with a clear sky and under a full moon, the huge seas glinting coldly in the moonlight. Next, he saw the girl in the leper refuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had let him go.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Silk got up {{from her}} chair and stood confronting him with her hand {{grasping}} the back of it. <b>Her</b> <b>cold</b> <b>eyes</b> gleamed and <b>her</b> face worked with spite as she {{tried in vain to}} catch his eye. Of Mr. Nugent and his ingenuous surprise at her behaviour she took no notice at all.|$|R
60|$|The {{elevator}} boy smiled knowingly to himself. When he {{took her}} up, he had noted the sparkle in <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> the color in her cheeks. His little cage had quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness. And now, on the down trip, it was glacier-like. The sparkle and the color were gone. She was frowning, and what little he could see of <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> was <b>cold</b> and steel-gray. Oh, he knew the symptoms, he did. He was an observer, and he knew it, too, and some day, when he was big enough, {{he was going to}} be a reporter, sure. And in the meantime he studied the procession of life as it streamed up and down eighteen sky-scraper floors in his elevator car. He slid the door open for her sympathetically and watched her trip determinedly out into the street.|$|R
60|$|Bateman {{finished}} telling Isabel {{his long}} story. He had hidden nothing from her except {{what he thought}} would wound her or what made himself ridiculous. He did not tell {{her that he had}} been forced to sit at dinner with a wreath of flowers round his head and he did not tell her that Edward was prepared to marry her uncle's half-caste daughter the moment she set him free. But perhaps Isabel had keener intuitions than he knew, for as he went on with his tale <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> grew <b>colder</b> and <b>her</b> lips closed upon one another more tightly. Now and then she looked at him closely, and if he had been less intent on his narrative he might have wondered at her expression.|$|R
60|$|His {{daughter}} sat {{a little}} apart, daintily fresh and cool, {{in a long}} white dress, with the soft light of the lamp above her gleaming on her hair, which was of warm brown, and emphasizing the little sparkle in <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The <b>cold</b> of New York did not suit her, and she had accompanied her father to Cuba before. Opposite Harding, across the little table on which stood a flask of wine, sat a spare, olive‐faced officer, with a sword girt to his waist. He had keen dark eyes {{with a hint of}} sternness in them, and a straight, thin‐lipped mouth; while he was already known in that country as El Espada, Morales the Sword. His mission was to put down the insurrection in that district, and the means he employed were draconic.|$|R
6000|$|I {{cried the}} whole afternoon, cowering among my pillows. I {{never wanted to}} go out of that room again. I never wanted to see anybody again. I hated the thought of facing Aunt Philippa with <b>her</b> <b>cold</b> <b>eyes</b> and <b>her</b> miserable stories that seemed to strip life of all beauty and love of all reality. I could hear her scornful, [...] "That's the men for you," [...] if she heard what was in Mark's letter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Twere long to tell, and vain to hear, [...] The tale {{of one who}} scorns a tear; [...] And {{there is}} little in that tale [...] Which better bosoms would bewail. [...] But mine has {{suffered}} more than well [...] 'Twould suit philosophy to tell. [...] I've seen my bride another's bride,-- [...] Have seen her seated by his side,-- [...] Have seen the infant, which she bore, [...] Wear the sweet smile the mother wore, [...] When she and I in youth have smiled, [...] As fond and faultless as her child;-- [...] Have seen <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> in <b>cold</b> disdain, [...] Ask if I felt no secret pain; [...] And I have acted well my part, [...] And made my cheek belie my heart, [...] Returned the freezing glance she gave, [...] Yet felt the while that woman's slave;-- [...] Have kissed, as if without design, [...] The babe which {{ought to have been}} mine, [...] And showed, alas! in each caress [...] Time had not made me love the less.|$|R
6000|$|... "We go to Italy--we go to Naples." [...] She {{rose and}} stood silent a moment, {{looking down the}} valley. The figure of Prince Casamassima {{appeared}} in the distance, balancing his white umbrella. As <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> rested upon it, Rowland imagined that he saw something deeper in the strange expression which had lurked in her face while he talked to her. At first he had been dazzled by her blooming beauty, to which the lapse of weeks had only added splendor; then {{he had seen a}} heavier ray in the light of her eye--a sinister intimation of sadness and bitterness. It was the outward mark of her sacrificed ideal. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> grew <b>cold</b> as she looked at her husband, and when, after a moment, she turned them upon Rowland, they struck him as intensely tragical. He felt a singular mixture of sympathy and dread; he wished to give her a proof of friendship, and yet {{it seemed to him that}} she had now turned her face in a direction where friendship was impotent to interpose. She half read his feelings, apparently, and she gave a beautiful, sad smile. [...] "I hope we may never meet again!" [...] she said. And as Rowland gave her a protesting look--"You have seen me at my best. I wish to tell you solemnly, I was sincere! I know appearances are against me," [...] she went on quickly. [...] "There is a great deal I can't tell you. Perhaps you have guessed it; I care very little. You know, at any rate, I did my best. It would n't serve; I was beaten and broken; they were stronger than I. Now it 's another affair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The woman, who {{was none}} other than Mrs. d'Aubigne, /alias/ Edith Jones, /alias/ the Tiger, turned and entered the house {{accompanied}} by her servant, Ellen, and presently Mr. Quest heard the rustle of her satin dress upon the stairs. He stepped back into the darkness of the balcony and waited. She opened the door, entered, and closed it behind her, and then, a little dazzled by the light, stood for some seconds looking about for her visitor. She was a thin, tall woman, who might have been any age between forty and fifty, with the wrecks of a very fine agile-looking figure. Her face, which was plentifully bedaubed with paint and powder, was sharp, fierce, and handsome, and crowned with a mane of false yellow hair. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>cold</b> and blue, her lips thin and rather drawn, so as to show a double line of large and gleaming teeth. She was dressed in a rich and hideous tight-fitting gown of yellow satin, barred with black, and on her arms were long bright yellow gloves. She moved lightly and silently, and looked around her with a long-searching gaze, like that of a cat, and her general appearance conveyed an idea of hunger and wicked ferocity. Such was the outward appearance of the Tiger, and of a truth it justified her name. [...] "Why, where the dickens has he got to?" [...] she said aloud; [...] "I wonder if he has given me the slip?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She shuddered again--not in grief, but in terror--as she relived {{the vivid}} hour of self-chosen poverty which her dream had brought her. Yes, {{the magic of}} wealth had spoiled her for Sibley and the ranch. To go back there was impossible. [...] "I will try the East," [...] she said. [...] "The Mosses will help me." [...] And yet to return to Chicago--after having played the grand lady--would be bitterly hard. Suppose her friends should meet <b>her</b> with <b>cold</b> <b>eyes</b> and hesitating words? Suppose they, too, had loved her money and not herself? Suppose even Joe, who seemed as true as Williams, should {{prove to be a}} selfish sycophant. Ah yes, it would be a {{different}} city with the magic of Haney's money no longer hers to command.|$|R
60|$|The {{change had}} been a shock for which Laura had not been prepared. Amy, who had seen him look so much worse, had not thought of it, and it overcame Laura more than all her anxieties, lest his love should be forfeited. She sobbed inconsolably over the alteration, and it was long before Amabel could get her to hear that his face was much less thin now, {{and that he was}} {{altogether}} much stronger; it was fatigue and anxiety to-night, and to-morrow he would be better. Laura proceeded to brood over her belief that his altered demeanour, his settled melancholy, his not seeking <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> his <b>cold</b> shake of the hand, all arose from the diminution of his love, and his dislike to be encumbered with a weak, foolish wife, with whom he had entangled himself when he deemed her worthy of him. She dwelt on all this in silence, as she sat at her sister's feet, and Amy left her to think, only now and then giving some caress to her hair or cheek, and at each touch the desolate waste of life that poor Laura was unfolding before herself was rendered less dreary by the thought, 'I have my sister still, and she knows sorrow too.' Then she half envied Amy, who had lost her dearest by death, and held his heart fast to the last; not, like herself, doomed to see the love decay for which she had endured so long--decay at the very moment when the suspense was over.|$|R
6000|$|King Eochaid ran, [...] Toward peopled Tara, nor {{stood to}} draw his breath [...] Until he {{came before the}} painted wall, [...] The posts of {{polished}} yew, circled with bronze, [...] Of the great door; but though the hanging lamps [...] Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows, [...] Nor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise, [...] Nor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound [...] From well-side or from plough-land, was there noise; [...] And {{there had been no}} sound of living thing [...] Before him or behind, but that far-off [...] On the horizon edge bellowed the herds. [...] Knowing that silence brings no good to kings, [...] And mocks returning victory, he passed [...] Between the pillars with a beating heart [...] And saw where {{in the midst of the}} great hall [...] Pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain [...] Sat upright with a sword before her feet. [...] Her hands on either side had gripped the bench, [...] <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>cold</b> and steady, her lips tight. [...] Some passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot [...] She started and then knew whose foot it was; [...] But when he thought to take her in his arms [...] She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke: [...] 'I have sent among the fields or to the woods [...] The fighting men and servants of this house, [...] For I would have your judgment upon one [...] Who is self-accused. If she be innocent [...] She would not look in any known man's face [...] Till judgment has been given, and if guilty, [...] Will never look again on known man's face.' [...] And at these words he paled, as she had paled, [...] Knowing that he should find upon her lips [...] The meaning of that monstrous day.|$|R

60|$|The {{little girl}} {{was looking at him}} when he awoke. Like a wild animal, all of him was awake the instant he opened his eyes. The first he saw was the parasol, strangely obtruded between him and the sky. He did not start nor move, though his whole body seemed {{slightly}} to tense. His eyes followed down the parasol handle to the tight-clutched little fingers, and along the arm to the child's face. Straight and unblinking he looked into <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and she, returning the look, was chilled and frightened by his glittering <b>eyes,</b> <b>cold</b> and harsh, withal bloodshot, and with no hint in them of the warm humanness she had been accustomed to see and feel in human eyes. They were the true prison eyes--the eyes {{of a man who had}} learned to talk little, who had forgotten almost how to talk.|$|R
