40|$|The {{application}} of matched filtering {{to the problem}} of very low frequency (VLF) radio <b>signals</b> <b>ducted</b> between magnetically conjugate points on the Earth by ionospheric plasma structures has been examined theoretically and implemented in recent field experiments. With accurate knowledge of the source VLF emissions, the subionospheric component of the received waveform can be effectively removed and the characteristics of the remaining <b>ducted</b> <b>signal</b> accurately estimated. Although the technique has been shown not to produce strictly consistent estimates of the subionospheric and <b>ducted</b> <b>signal</b> amplitudes, it is able to efficiently recover the transit delays and amplitudes of ducted man-made whistler-mode emissions for reasonable values of the relevant signal to noise ratios. This is substantiated by the use of matched filtering to analyze data collected by radio receivers placed at the conjugate ends of a magnetic field line, thereby recovering the amplitudes and transit delays of <b>ducted</b> <b>signals</b> with time-resolution as small as 30 seconds. An arbitrary degree of accuracy can be obtained in these measurements through the use of bit stream extraction and comparison...|$|R

40|$|The {{background}} of VLF wave-particle experiments from Siple Station, Antarctica, including wave-induced precipitation is briefly reviewed. Single frequency <b>ducted</b> <b>signals</b> that exceed a certain 2 ̆ 7 threshold 2 ̆ 7 intensity are observed at the conjugate point (Roberval, Quebec) to be amplified 30 - 50 dB, with temporal {{growth rates of}} 30 - 200 dB/s. Following saturation, variable frequency emissions are triggered. When a second signal {{is added to the}} first, with a frequency spacing Df< 100 Hz, signal growth is reduced and sidebands are generated at frequencies separated from the carriers by integer multiples (up to seven) of Df. The sidebands are attributed to short emissions triggered by the beats between the two input carriers. Mid-latitude magnetospheric hiss is crudely simulated by a sequence of 10 ms pulses whose frequencies are chosen randomly within a 400 Hz band. Results show that certain combinations of 10 ms pulses link together to form chorus-like elements, suggesting a common origin for hiss and chorus. Under conditions of strong echoing, emissions may form into lines; a recent example, started by the Siple Station transmitter, exhibits interline spacings of about 45 Hz. These lines, called magnetospheric line radiation (MLR), vary slowly in frequency and show no simple connection to the harmonics of the Canadian power grid.

As a result of this work, {{it will be possible to}} use lightning activity data sets to estimate globally induced precipitation flux rates and thus determine the lightning-induced effect on the radiation belts more accurately. Four study days were selected, during which a high proportion of the lightning activity occurring near the east coast of North America produced observable Trimpi effects on VLF transmitter signals propagating in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula (similar toL = 2 - 2. 5). The lack of lightning in Antarctica gives this location a unique advantage for this study. The functional dependence of the relative scattered field amplitude with the return stroke peak current of the lightning discharge suggests that during these events diffusion conditions are occurring near the precipitating radiation belt particles loss cone due to strong whistler wave fields, probably caused by <b>ducted</b> <b>signals.</b> The range of observed Trimpi scatter amplitude of - 10 to - 35 dB was produced by precipitation bursts with energy fluxes estimated to range over 6. 5 - 0. 4 x 10 (- 3) ergs cm(- 2) s(- 1). The largest fluxes were found to be driven by lightning currents of about 250 kA, while the smallest detectable fluxes relate to lightning currents of 70 kA. Although 3 of the 4 study days showed a high degree of consistency between the levels of lightning return stroke peak current required to produce any given perturbation scatter amplitude value, conditions were significantly different on 23 April 1994. On this day, observed Trimpi signatures were 6 - 7 dB greater for any given lightning intensity than on the other study days.

Here, we show in mice that bile ducts arise through a novel mechanism of tubulogenesis involving sequential radial differentiation. Notch signaling is activated in a subset of liver progenitor cells fated to become ductal cells, and pathway activation is necessary for biliary fate. Notch signals are also required for bile duct morphogenesis, and activation of Notch signaling in the hepatic lobule promotes ectopic biliary differentiation and tubule formation in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, activation of Notch signaling in postnatal hepatocytes causes them to adopt a biliary fate through a process of reprogramming that recapitulates normal bile duct development. These results reconcile previous conflicting reports about the role of Notch during liver development and suggest that Notch acts by coordinating biliary differentiation and morphogenesis.

Following three cycles of single cell cloning, mPAC cells consisted of two subtypes, a null cell, and a double-positive cell that co-expressed cytokeratin, a marker of ductal epithelium, and A 2 B 5, a neuroendocrine ganglioside expressed in developing islet cells. Two islet cell genes, encoding somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide, were transcribed at low levels in most mPAC clones, whereas the insulin and glucagon genes were not. Upon inoculation of mice, mPAC cells rapidly formed well-differentiated ductal adenocarcinomas that expressed cytokeratin but not the islet cell markers. The mPAC phenotype may result from a specific dedifferentiation of juvenile islet cells or ductal epithelium induced by middle T protein.

The MaSp-NTDs are highly pH-responsive and undergo a structural transition in the physiological pH range of the spider duct. Tryptophan fluorescence of the MaSp-NTDs reveals a change in conformation when pH is decreased, and the pH at which the transition occurs is determined by the amount and type of salt present.

EGF signaling along the ventral midline specifies the salivary duct fate for cells {{in the center of the}} primordium, while cells farther away from the source of EGF signal adopt a secretory cell fate. EGF signaling works, at least in part, by repressing expression of secretory cell genes in the duct primordium, including fork head (fkh), which encodes a winged-helix transcription factor. FKH, in turn, represses trachealess (trh), a duct-specific gene initially expressed throughout the salivary gland primordium. trh encodes a basic helix–loop–helix PAS-domain containing transcription factor that has been proposed to specify the salivary duct fate. In conflict with this model, we find that three genes, dead ringer (dri), Serrate (Ser), and trh itself, are expressed in the duct independently of trh. Expression of all three duct genes is repressed in the secretory cells by FKH. We also show that SER in the <b>duct</b> cells <b>signals</b> to the adjacent secretory cells to specify a third cell type, the imaginal ring cells.

The objective is to investigate roles of activation of the Akt and ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinase pathways, as well as Ca 2 + mobilization, in IMCD cells isolated from rat kidney. The V 2 receptor-selective vasopressin analog dDAVP increased the state of Akt activation (increased phosphorylation at T 308 and S 473) and decreased the state of ERK 1 / 2 activation (decreased phosphorylation at T 202 and Y 204).

Calcium reduced the AVP-induced accumulation of cAMP, but this did not occur by increased degradation of cAMP by phosphodiesterases or by direct inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Notably, the effect of extracellular calcium on AVP-dependent aquaporin- 2 expression was prevented by inhibition of calmodulin.

Microdissected tubules (2 mm/sample, permeabilized with 0. 5 % Triton X- 100) or purified AQP-CHIP standards (0 - 200 fmol) were utilized in a fluorescence ELISA protocol after covalent immobilization on epoxy-activated Sepharose beads. The lower limit of detection was 2. 4 fmol of AQP-CHIP. Preabsorption with excess purified AQP-CHIP or use of nonimmune serum eliminated the signal. In proximal segments, the measured AQP-CHIP was linearly related to tubule length (1 - 10 mm).

Demeclocycline's mechanism of action, which is poorly understood, is studied here. In mouse cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cells, which exhibit deamino- 8 -d-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) -dependent expression of endogenous AQP 2, demeclocycline decreased AQP 2 abundance and gene transcription but not its protein stability. Demeclocycline did not affect vasopressin type 2 receptor localization but decreased dDAVP-induced cAMP generation and the abundance of adenylate cyclase 3 and 5 / 6. The addition of exogenous cAMP partially corrected the demeclocycline effect. As in patients, demeclocycline increased urine volume, decreased urine osmolality, and reverted hyponatremia in an SIADH rat model.

In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that demeclocycline mainly attenuates hyponatremia in SIADH by reducing adenylate cyclase 5 / 6 expression and, consequently, cAMP generation, AQP 2 gene transcription, and AQP 2 abundance in the renal inner medulla, coinciding with a reduced vasopressin escape response in other collecting duct segments...|$|R

The VHS algorithm defines a time varying phase space simulation box covering the trans-equatorial nonlinear trapping region and a segment of parallel velocity space centred on the local resonance velocity. The simulation particles have F defined as a constant on their trajectories by Liouville's theorem. At each time step F is interpolated from the particles onto the fixed phase space grid, allowing resonant particle current to be calculated. The VHS method is extremely efficient since at each step particles leaving the phase box are discarded, and fresh particles are embedded into the phase fluid where the latter flows into the phase box. Succesful numerical triggering of emissions by Omega is shown, and examples of risers, fallers and hooks are shown. The integrated linear trans-equatorial amplification of ~ 10 dB agreed well with figures calculated by Bell from HYDRA data. These successful simulations of Omega emissions with highly anisotropic distribution functions confirm that non linear trapping of cyclotron resonant electrons in the geomagnetic field is the root plasma physical mechanism behind the triggering of VLF emissions...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: Evaluation {{of the use}} {{of black}} tea as {{negative}} oral contrast agent in MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). "nPatients and Methods: Thirty-five patients (mean age, 50. 3 &plusmn; 19. 2 years), who were referred for MRCP, entered in this study. MRCP was performed before, after 5 minutes and after 15 minutes following consumption of 300 ml of black tea. Depiction of the gall bladder, cystic duct, proximal and distal parts of the common bile duct (CBD), intra hepatic ducts, ampula of Vater, main pancreatic <b>duct</b> (MPD) and <b>signal</b> loss of the stomach and three different segments of the duodenum were investigated according to VAS and Lickert scores. "nResults: Regarding visibility of seven different anatomical parts of the pancreatobiliary tree (gall bladder, cystic duct, CBD, common hepatic duct, intrahepatic duct, ampula of Vater and MPD), the post procedure images were better visualized only in the distal part of CBD, ampula of vater and MPD both in Lickert and VAS scoring (all Ps&le; 0. 001). "nThere {{was no significant difference between}} the images 5 and 15 minutes after tea consumption. Regarding the obliteration of high signal in the stomach and three different parts of the duodenum, all post tea images of the mentioned parts showed significant disappearance of high signal in Lickert and VAS scoring systems (all Ps&le; 0. 001). "nConclusion: Black tea is an affordable, cheap, available, safe, and efficient oral negative contrast agent for MRCP which reduces the signal intensity of fluids in the gastrointestinal tract and is also efficient for better depiction of MPD, distal part of CBD and ampula...|$|R
40|$|The Doppler shift, one-hop group {{travel time}} and arrival {{direction}} of whistler mode {{signals from the}} NAA (24 kHz) and NSS (21. 4 kHz) VLF transmitters in eastern U. S. A. have been measured in the conjugate region, at Faraday Station, Antarctica (65 °S 64 °W, L= 2. 3). Two identical narrow-band receivers of the type described by N. R. THOMSON (J. Geophys. Res., 86, 4795, 1981) were used. The technique enables cross-L plasma drifts and flux tube filling and emptying rates in the inner magnetosphere to be inferred continuously with a time resolution of 15 min. <b>Ducted</b> whistler mode <b>signals,</b> of typical strength ∿ 1 μVm^ from both transmitters were observed every night during February-March 1986,usually with multi-duct structure evident. Such structure was generally similar for the two transmitters, indicating propagation along {{a common set of}} ducts. This permitted the determination of the L-values of the ducts without reference to natural whistler data. Typical one hop group travel times were in the range 300 - 900 ms and Doppler shifts in the range - 500 mHz to + 500 mHz. Most ducts could be tracked for several hours, and during the night their associated group travel times often exhibited a steady decrease followed by a steady increase, suggesting a change from inward to outward cross-L drifting under the action of east-west electric fields of magnitude ∿ 0. 3 mVm^. This drift reversal occurred at ∿ 02 LT and was accompanied by a rapid change from positive to negative Doppler shifts...|$|R
40|$|Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a multi-functional {{cytokine}} with a well-described role in {{the regulation}} of tissue fibrosis and regeneration in the liver, kidney and lung. Submandibular gland (SMG) duct ligation and subsequent deligation in rodents is a classical model for studying salivary gland damage and regeneration. While previous studies suggest that TGF-β may contribute to salivary gland fibrosis, the expression of TGF-β signaling components has not been investigated in relation to mouse SMG duct ligation-induced fibrosis and regeneration following ductal deligation. Following a 7 day SMG duct ligation, TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 3 were significantly upregulated in the SMG, as were TGF-β receptor 1 and downstream Smad family transcription factors in salivary acinar cells, but not in ductal cells. In acinar cells, duct ligation also led to upregulation of snail, a Smad-activated E-cadherin repressor and regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, whereas in ductal cells upregulation of E-cadherin was observed while snail expression was unchanged. Upregulation of these TGF-β signaling components correlated with upregulation of fibrosis markers collagen 1 and fibronectin, responses that were inhibited by administration of the TGF-β receptor 1 inhibitors SB 431542 or GW 788388. After SMG regeneration following a 28 day <b>duct</b> deligation, TGF-β <b>signaling</b> components and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers returned to levels similar to non-ligated controls. The {{results from this study}} indicate that increased TGF-β <b>signaling</b> contributes to <b>duct</b> ligation-induced changes in salivary epithelium that correlate with glandular fibrosis. Furthermore, the reversibility of enhanced TGF-β signaling in acinar cells of duct-ligated mouse SMG after deligation indicates that this is an ideal model for studying TGF-β signaling mechanisms in salivary epithelium as well as mechanisms of fibrosis initiation and their resolution...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in 5 / 6 -nephrectomized rats. The 5 / 6 nephrectomy model is used to study pathogenetic mechanisms underlying chronic renal failure. We previously demonstrated that increased mesangial cell proliferation and glomerular PDGF B-chain expression precede glomerulosclerosis in this model. In the present study we have assessed the concomitant changes in the cortical tubulointerstitium. A wave of tubular and interstitial cell proliferation (as determined by immunostaining for PCNA) occurred at week 1 after 5 / 6 nephrectomy. This wave preceded the peak glomerular cell proliferation by one week. Tubulointerstitial cell proliferation decreased thereafter and reached control values by week 10. In situ hybridization and immunostaining for PDGF B-chain and β-receptor in sham-operated controls showed labeling of distal tubules and collecting <b>ducts,</b> while no <b>signal</b> was present in the interstitium. PDGF B-chain mRNA and protein expression was markedly increased in tubules at weeks 2 and 4 after 5 / 6 nephrectomy and in the interstitium (particularly in areas of inflammatory infiltrates) at weeks 2 to 10. Similar changes occurred with PDGF receptor β immunostaining. Interstitial expression of desmin and α-smooth muscle actin (markers of myofibroblasts) progressively increased after week 1. Interstitial influx of monocytes/macrophages with focal accentuation started at week 2. Counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets showed only minor changes. In parallel to the monocyte/macrophage influx, progressive interstitial accumulation of collagens I and IV, laminin, and fibronectin occurred. All of these changes were correlated {{with the increase in}} serum creatinine, proteinuria and an index of tubulointerstitial damage. We conclude that tubulointerstitial changes after 5 / 6 nephrectomy show similarities with those observed in the glomeruli. Tubular and interstitial overexpression of PDGF B-chain and its receptor {{may play a role in}} mediating fibroblast migration and/or proliferation in areas of tubulointerstitial injury...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBranching {{morphogenesis}} is a molecularly conserved {{mechanism that}} is adopted by several organs, {{such as the}} lung, kidney, mammary gland and salivary gland, to maximize the surface area of a tissue within a small volume. Branching occurs through repetitive clefting and elongation of spherical epithelial structures, called endbuds, which invade the surrounding mesenchyme. In the salivary gland, lumen formation takes place alongside branching morphogenesis, but in a controlled manner, so that branching is active at the distal ends of epithelial branches while lumen formation initiates at the proximal ends, and spreads distally. We present here data showing that interaction between FGF signaling and the canonical (β-catenin dependent) and non-canonical branches of Wnt signaling coordinates these two processes. Using the Axin 2 lacZ reporter mice, we find Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity first in the mesenchyme and later, {{at the time of}} lumen formation, in the ductal epithelium. Gain and loss of function experiments reveal that this pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on salivary gland branching morphogenesis. We have found that endbuds remain devoid of Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity, a hallmark of ductal structures, through FGF-mediated inhibition of this pathway. Our data also show that FGF signaling has {{a major role in the}} control of lumen formation by preventing premature hollowing of epithelial endbuds and slowing down the canalization of presumptive <b>ducts.</b> Concomitantly, FGF <b>signaling</b> strongly represses the ductal marker Cp 2 l 1, most likely via repression of Wnt 5 b and non-canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in endbuds by FGF signaling occurs at least in part through sFRP 1, a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling and downstream target of FGF signaling. Altogether, these findings point to a key function of FGF signaling in the maintenance of an undifferentiated state in endbud cells by inhibition of a ductal fate...|$|R
