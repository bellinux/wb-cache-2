50|$|Although brothels {{were set}} up as a sexual outlet for men, not all men were allowed to enter them. Clerics, married men, and Jews were prohibited. Often, foreigners such as sailors and traders were {{the main source of}} revenue. Local men who frequented the brothels mainly {{consisted}} of single men; laws restricting the patrons were not always enforced. Government officials or police would periodically <b>do</b> <b>searches</b> of the brothels {{to cut down on the}} number of unpermitted customers. However, since the government was so closely related to the church, common punishments were minor. These restrictions were put in place to protect the wives of married men from any sort of infection.Multiple restrictions were placed on the residents of brothels. One limitation prohibited prostitutes from borrowing money from her brothel keeper. Prostitutes paid high prices for the basic necessities of life: room and board, food, clothes, and toiletries to the brothel keepers. Room and board was often a price set by the local government but the price for everything else could add up to a common woman's entire earnings. Prostitutes were sometimes prohibited from having a special lover. Some regulations put on prostitutes were made to protect their clients. A woman was kicked out if she was found to have a sexually transmitted disease. Also, the prostitutes were not allowed to pull men into the brothel by their clothing, harass them in the street, or detain them over unpaid debts. Clothing worn by prostitutes was regulated as well and had to be distinguishable from that of respectable women. In some places a prostitute had to have a yellow stripe on her clothing while in others red was the differentiating color. Other towns required harlots to don special headdresses or restricted the wardrobe of proper women. All restrictions placed on prostitutes were put in place not only to protect them but nearby citizens as well.|$|E

With 3. 0 fb- 1 of data analyzed at CDF, and at DO, the 95 % C. L. upper limits on Higgs boson production are {{a factor of}} 1. 2, 1. 0 and 1. 3 higher than the SM cross section for a Higgs boson mass of m_{H}=$ 165, 170 and 175 GeV, respectively. We exclude at 95 % C. L. a standard model Higgs boson of m_H= 170 GeV. Based on simulation, the ratios of the corresponding median expected upper limit to the Standard Model cross section are 1. 2, 1. 4 and 1. 7. Compared to the previous Higgs Tevatron combination, more data and refined analysis techniques have been used. These results extend significantly the individual limits of each experiment and provide new knowledge on {{the mass of the}} standard model Higgs boson beyond the LEP direct searches.

40|$|The use of {{discourse}} markers in speech is {{an indicator of}} fluency. Misuse, underuse, or non-use {{of discourse}} markers can mark a speaker as non-native {{and make it more}} difficult for that speaker to interact meaningfully within a speech community. EFL students do not always have access to native speakers from whom they can acquire discourse markers. Additionally, EFL teachers may not be aware of the uses of discourse markers or know the parameters of their use. Online public corpora may be useful tools for TESOL teachers to find examples of authentic speech that include discourse markers and exemplify their actual use. For this project, the discourse marker “like” and the quotative “be like” were searched for and analyzed in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) and the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE) in an attempt to answer the following questions: What kinds of results <b>do</b> <b>searches</b> for discourse markers yield?, Do the results clearly show the form and function of the markers?, and How might the searches and results be applied in the EFL classroom? The search results yielded clear examples of the uses of discourse marker “like” and quotative “be like” that support the findings of previous studies and show some areas in which new research can be performed, such as the nuances in meaning of quotative “it 2 ̆ 7 s like. ” The results provide examples that can be used in the classroom as input or modified into assignments or activities...|$|E

Com isso, se faz necessário a inserção das pessoas idosas no contexto de desenvolvimento das novas tecnologias da informação e comunicação. O presente estudo buscou {{investigar}} se os participantes fazem buscas sobre saúde na internet e como estas buscas influenciam na qualidade de vida da pessoa idosa, relacionando as doenças que os mesmos relataram ter, considerando a perspectiva do campo CTS e abrangendo a área da gerontologia. Neste sentido, o objetivo deste estudo foi analisar o acesso e uso de informação em saúde através de um recurso tecnológico, por um grupo de pessoas idosas de um programa de inclusão digital, neste caso o Programa de Inclusão Digital (PID) da Fundação Educacional de São Carlos (FESC) que é uma entidade governamental criada para promover e desenvolver questões de ordem educacional para todas as idades. O estudo foi desenvolvido em sete etapas, sendo a coleta de dados subdividida em três fases. Na primeira fase de coleta de dados, após aprovação do Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa, foi feito o convite aos participantes, comparecendo 19 pessoas idosas, sendo 8 do sexo masculino e 11 do sexo feminino, tendo respondido a um questionário semiestruturado. Para a segunda fase 8 pessoas idosas participaram de um estudo dirigido, no qual foram abordadas questões sobre o acesso à informação em saúde através da internet. Na terceira fase a coleta de dados foi realizada por grupo focal, divididos em 2 homens e 4 mulheres. Os principais resultados apontam que a idade média dos idosos é de 67 anos, com nível superior completo e renda de até três salários mínimos em sua maioria as pessoas idosas participantes não fazem busca de informação sobre saúde na internet mas consideram importante saber fazer e que essa busca influencia na qualidade de vida dos mesmos. Scientific {{and technological}} advances bring {{individual and collective}} psychosocial implications.

The present study investigated whether participants <b>do</b> <b>searches</b> about health on the internet and how these searches influence the life quality of the elderly, relating the reported diseases, considering the CTS field perspective and the area of gerontology. In this sense, the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the access and use of health information through a technological resource, by a group of elderly people from a program of digital inclusion, in this case the Programa de Inclusão Digital (PID) of the Fundação Educacional de São Carlos (FESC) which is a government entity created to develop and promote educational programs for all ages. The study was conducted in seven steps, been the data collection divided into three phases. In the first phase of data collection, after the approval of the Committee of research ethics, an invitation to participants was done, having attended 19 elderly people, 8 male and 11 female on which they answered a semistructured questionnaire. For the second stage 8 elderly people participated in a directed study, in which issues of access to health information through the internet were addressed. In the third phase the data collection was done through a focus group divided into 2 men and 4 women. The main results show that the average age of the elderly is 67 years old, with college degree and earning up to three minimum wages, from the participants only 1 doesnt have a computer with internet access at home and those who own <b>do</b> <b>searches</b> for information and news.
