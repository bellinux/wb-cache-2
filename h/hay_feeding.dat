40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial patterns of adult stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), emergence from six sites where large round baled hay had been provided to pasture cattle as winter feed were studied using emergence traps. The substrate at these sites, consisting of waste hay mixed with bovine manure and urine, provided an excellent developmental habitat for immature stable flies. Stable flies were the most frequently collected fly emerging from these sites with a yearly average of 1, 581 emerging per square meter. Stable fly emergence from these sites began in early May (235 annual accumulated Day-Degree 10 °C [DD 10]), peaked in late June and early July (400 - 900 DD 10) and then dropped to very low levels in late July (3 ̆e 900 DD 10). The temporal pattern of stable fly emergence from the <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> sites differed from that of adult populations measured with sticky traps. Adult populations increased in the spring before significant emergence from the <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> sites was observed, dipped in midsummer soon after the <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> sites became nonproductive, and then rebounded {{in the late summer}} when emergence from the <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> sites was very low. The drop in productivity of the <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> sites appeared to be because of endogenous factors associated with decomposition of the substrate rather than temperature or precipitation.

Overall, the inner most 2 -m annulus of the <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> sites was the most productive, however, spatial variation among sites was observed. The sex ratio of emerging flies did not differ from 1 : 1 and the temporal pattern of emergence was similar for males and females.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess four winter feeding programs of spring-calving brood cows that may improve profitability to ranching operations of the Harney Basin, Oregon. The four feeding strategies include strip grazed rake-bunched hay, supplemented range grazing, strip grazed meadow pasture, and baled <b>hay</b> <b>feeding.</b> These first three alternatives were compared to baled <b>hay</b> <b>feeding,</b> the preferred practice of the region, in terms of profitability to the operation and management requirements. To evaluate the alternatives a deterministic biophysical-economic simulation model was constructed. The biophysical model simulates relationships between (1) the physiological status and nutritional requirements of mature gestating cows, (2) the forage base being utilized, and (3) {{the effects of the}} physical environment upon the nutritional requirements of cows and their ability to forage successfully for food. The biological simulation is designed to provide, as output, measures of cow reproductive performance and forage utilization. This information is integrated into herd and pasture management subroutines to yield measures of herd production, and pasture and feed utilization. An economic subroutine uses results from the herd production and forage utilization subroutines to estimate costs and net returns to each feeding strategy. Risk is introduced into the simulation by varying the climatic components of the physical environment. Four winter scenarios are represented, ranging from mild to very severe. Probabilities are assigned to each winter scenario for each feeding program. The probabilities under each alternative {{for each of the four}} climate scenarios are combined to yield estimates of the expected net return of the feeding strategy. Analysis of the results indicate that raked-bunched hay is the best alternative to baled <b>hay</b> <b>feeding.</b> Returns are substantially higher as a result of reduced wintering costs. Cow performance factors remain nearly identical to hay fed cows, and management of the winter operation is simplified. In addition, there appears to be little risk associated with management of the raked hay alternative. The range grazing program also yields superior economic results to the operation when compared to baled <b>hay</b> <b>feeding.</b> Although there is considerable variation in net returns to the alternative over the climate scenarios, the expected return to range grazing is substantially higher than the baled hay strategy. Variability in net returns to range grazing is due to effects of ground snow depth levels which may prevent cows from feeding on range forages. When these conditions occur emergency <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> is required. Management of the operation is intensified, increasing with the severity of the winter. Based upon the economic results of the simulation it appears that range grazing is a promising alternative to baled hay. However, because empirical data are limited regarding the adaptability of this alternative in the Harney Basin, more information is needed regarding (1) ground snow depth level effects upon the feeding success of cows, and (2) reproductive performance of cows following severe winters. The results of the meadow grazing alternative indicate that this strategy is not a viable alternative to baled <b>hay</b> <b>feeding.</b> Returns to the operation are reduced as the result of poor cow reproductive factors, and the vulnerability of this strategy to relatively shallow snow cover requiring large amounts of emergency feeding...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Environment and {{genetics}} influence {{the manifestation of}} recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), but the associations of specific factors with mild, moderate, and severe clinical signs are unknown. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that sire, feed, bedding, time outdoors, sex, and age are associated with clinical manifestations of mild, moderate, and severe lower airway disease. ANIMALS: Direct offspring of 2 RAO-affected Warmblood stallions (F 1 S 1, n = 172; F 1 S 2, n = 135); maternal half-siblings of F 1 S 1 (mHSS 1, n = 66); and an age-matched, randomly chosen control group (CG, n = 33). METHODS: A standardized questionnaire {{was used to assess}} potential risk factors and to establish a horse owner assessed respiratory signs index (HOARSI 1 - 4, from healthy to severe) according to clinical signs of lower airway disease. RESULTS: More F 1 S 1 and F 1 S 2 horses showed moderate to severe clinical signs (HOARSI 3 and HOARSI 4 combined, 29. 6 and 27. 3 %, respectively) compared with CG and mHSS 1 horses (9. 1 and 6. 2 %, respectively; contingency table overall test, P <. 001).

The in vitro [...] digestibility of the extrusa material collected from each cow was used as an. index of pasture selection and {{used in conjunction with}} chromic oxide to estimate pasture intake and substitution. The mean in vitro digestibilities ofthepasture selected by the cows grazingm-the low level of available pasture with and without hay and at the higher level of pasture availability with and without haywere 78. 1, 76. 8, 64. 4 and 65. 2 % DOM (LSD = 5. 2; P<O.

The estimates of digestible organic matter intake were 5. 75, 6. 65, 4. 27 and 4. 80 kg DOM/cow/day (LSD = 0. 88; PxO. 05) for the respective treatments of low pasture availability with and without hay and high pasture availability with and without hay.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} in this thesis is based on data collected on three organic dairy farms in southern Jutland in Denmark. Two of these farms supplied feedstuff analyses of their hay, and one additional farmer besides these three took part {{in an interview on}} their use of <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> and production of haymilk. The sale of dairy products made of haymilk has increased substantially in Austria {{over the past few years}} to 4, 200 tons of cheese sold in 2011. Haymilk based dairy products are currently being sold in Germany and the interest is increasing in Switzerland. 83 tons of haymilk based cheeses were sold in Denmark in 2011, and there appears to be a market potential haymilk based dairy products in Denmark. The main objective of this thesis was to improve the decision basis for farmers considering switching from silage feeding to <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> of their lactating dairy cows. A semi-structured group interview with four haymilk producing farmers showed that they had been inspired by other farmers abroad, who produce haymilk, and motivated by a belief in hay being healthier for their cows as well as the ability to obtain a premium for their milk. The interview furthermore showed that their workload was increased in summer and decreased in winter, although the overall workload was more enjoyable now. No clear effect of conservation method on chemical composition of hays and silages were found, although a trend for lower CP and higher NDF content per kg of DM were seen in hay compared with silage. Structural properties measured with peNDF and CT was found to be more related to TCL and season, which was indicated by cutting number, than used conservation method. The analysis of lactation curves, which was based on data obtained from three of the haymilk producing farmers, showed that DH cows in parity one and parity three or greater had achieved a higher persistency by switching to <b>hay</b> <b>feeding,</b> albeit their peak yields were reduced with 1. 1 and 0. 4 kg ECM per day respectively. No difference was found for DH cows in parity two and Jersey cows in parity one and parity two, but Jersey cows in parity three or greater had their peak yield reduced by 1. 1 kg ECM per day. Fat and protein percentage increased for DH cows in parity one and parity three or greater. Protein percentage furthermore increased for Jersey cows in parity one whereas no difference was found for the other groups of cows. The feeding software NorFor predicted hay fed cows to have a lower DMI and ECM production per day when compared with silage fed cows. This clear effect could not be confirmed in the literature as both an increasing and decreasing as well as an unchanged effect was seen. The somatic cell count was decreased for all groups of cows by switching to <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> except for DH cows in parity three or greater, which increased, and DH cows in parity one where no difference was found. The cost of producing one FU of hay was estimated to be 0. 70 kroner larger compared with silage (2. 77 versus 2. 07 kroner per FU). This resulted in a difference in feed cost between 0. 19 and 0. 56 kroner per kg ECM depending on the ration and the assumed effect of switching to <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> on DMI and daily ECM production. The simulated difference between hay and silage feeding was between a loss of 0. 01 and a gain of 0. 04 kroner per kg ECM across six scenarios tested on seven different types of herds or between - 161 and 450 kroner per annual cow...|$|E

40|$|Milk {{coming from}} <b>hay</b> <b>feed</b> cows {{are being used}} to produce a range of artisanal cheeses in Europe. Hay-milk {{contains}} low number of anaerobic Clostridium spores that can be detrimental to cheeses late in the ripening period. The forage composition has in the literature been correlated with elevated contents of plant derived aroma compounds (terpenes) in cheese. Hard cheese was made using milk from three Danish dairy-farms (A, B and C) where the cows had been feed with three different types of <b>hay</b> (<b>Feed</b> 1, 2 and 3) made from forage containing varying amount of herbs. The cheese was produced over three production periods (I, II and III) with all combinations of dairy-farmer and hay-type. A control cheese was made in all three production periods using normal bulk milk, where the cows were feed primarily with silage. No differences were seen in the content of plant derived aroma compounds in the experimental milk compared to the control milk. The cheeses had similar moisture content and pH development throughout the 12 months ripening period and no differences was seen in the number of starter and non-starter organisms. The control cheeses contained significantly higher cell numbers of Lactobacillus casei within the first 4 weeks of ripening as compared to the experimental cheese. There was a strong correlation between production period and the content of aroma content in the cheeses, but no differences in the aroma content could be related to the type of feed or dairy-farm.

40|$|Kangaroos regurgitate and re-chew digesta on an {{occasional}} basis; the behaviour has been termed ‘merycism’. Merycism {{is distinct from}} rumination, as it is non-essential for digestive activity, significantly varies in rhythm and frequency, and causes seeming distress. Triggering mechanisms and potential benefits of this behaviour remain unknown. Although often reported, detailed descriptions of macropod merycism are lacking. We performed a systematic evaluation {{of a series of}} anecdotal observations of five western grey (Macropus fuliginosus) and one red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) in a feeding situation on two different diets in captivity. We recorded 14 videos with lucerne pellets and 3 videos with chopped lucerne <b>hay</b> <b>feeding,</b> covering a total of 4 h 23 min of footage with 23 regurgitation events. A characteristic merycism sequence consisted of retreat from the feeding trough, pumping abdominal contractions, slurping, re-chewing and re-swallowing. Individual kangaroos performed different behavioural features, apparently to support the abdominal contractions including throwing back their head (64 ± 40 (SD) %) or, rarely, pumping movements of the forelimbs. Additionally, instead of keeping digesta within the oral cavity and re-swallowing it, it was sometimes spilled (35 ± 40 % of the cases). We confirmed characteristic features of merycism previously reported, including the clear distinction to rumination. We hypothesize that the purpose of merycism is the grinding of not sufficiently chewed food particles that trigger specific contractions of the forestomach beyond voluntary control. The numerically higher frequency of this behaviour during pellet compared to <b>hay</b> <b>feeding</b> could support this hypothesis, as pellets were often gobbled hastily. In accord with observations in the literature, we hypothesize that merycism happens more frequently in captivity, as the type of food, fixed feeding times and limited feeding spots make rapid ingestion of food, possibly without proper mastication (i. e. gobbling), more likely...|$|E
