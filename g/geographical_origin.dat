30|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} a high-resolution 15 Tesla Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry coupled with a reverse-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) system for determining the <b>geographical</b> <b>origins</b> of raw propolis samples. The UPLC/FT-ICR MS-based high-resolution platform was validated on the ethanol-extracted propolis (EEP) from various propolis raw materials originating from different countries (i.e., Argentina, Brazil, China, and Korea) to determine the <b>geographical</b> <b>origins</b> of the propolis and the origin-specific key compounds. Based on approximately 8000 molecular features extracted from UPLC/FT-ICR MS datasets, a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) plot showed distinct separations among propolis samples from four different origins. Key propolis components contributing to the discrimination of Korean propolis from Brazilian and Chinese propolis were identified and classified into five subgroups (i.e., flavonoids, phenols, terpenoids, fatty acids, and others). This analysis revealed the characteristic features of the different propolis samples, and this analytical platform can be further {{used to determine the}} <b>geographical</b> <b>origins</b> and to assess the quality of the commercial products.|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to establish the <b>geographical</b> <b>origin</b> of Ankylosauridae at present. There {{is a mix of}} basal ankylosaurids from both North America and Asia, which carries on through accepted cladistic analyses. It appears that in the mid-Cretaceous, Asian nodosaurids were replaced by ankylosaurine ankylosaurids. Some researchers postulate that Ankylosaurines migrated into North America from Asia between the Albian and Campanian, where they diversified into a clade of ankylosaurines characterized by arched snouts and flat cranial bone plates (caputegulae). There is no evidence for ankylosaurids in Gondwana.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 a {{published}} study by Mathieson et al. test several individuals from two Neolithic sites in northwest Anatolia, {{the results showed}} that Haplogroup T1a-M70, previously found in LBK sites from Germany, was not present in Barcin nor Mentese Neolithic settlements. This fact together with the absence of the mtDNA lineages carried by both of the T1a individuals from Karsdorf and the occurrence of G2a and the mtDNA lineages carried by all of these G2a individuals, could mean that the Early European Neolithic T1a-M70 had a different migration pattern and, therefore, a different <b>geographical</b> <b>origin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yeast consumes {{the sugar}} in the grapes and {{converts}} it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the <b>geographical</b> <b>origin</b> and permitted varieties of grapes, {{as well as other}} aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and elderberry.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of {{surnames}} are locative, related to the <b>geographical</b> <b>origin</b> of a person, such as {{the name of a}} village, town, city, land, river.

A surname such as Leão (lion) may mean that an ancestor came from the old Iberian kingdom of León (Northwestern Spain) or the French city of Lyon.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Northwest region – {{primarily}} Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia – {{has been}} host {{to a growing}} scene of doom, sludge, and stoner metal since the 1990s, influenced by the <b>geographical</b> <b>origin</b> of grunge music and a sound pioneered in part by Washington band The Melvins. Common visual themes include the region's cold, rainy, forested climate, and many bands utilize psychedelic imagery influenced by bands like Sleep, Karp and Harkonen. Musical styles often share crossover features with atmospheric/ambient black metal, drone metal, and post-metal as seen in Oregon's YOB, Agalloch, Witch Mountain, Red Fang, Washington's Lesbian, Earth, Sunn O))), Vancouver's Anciients, Astrakhan, and Aaron Turner project Sumac, among various others.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue is}} whether Richard was indeed using the same {{specimen}} as Lamarck; the <b>geographical</b> <b>origin</b> {{is said to be}} different, and the descriptions do not match; for example in Lamarck's Cephalanthus chinensis the inflorescences are axillary whereas in Richard's Anthocephalus they are terminal. If specimens were the same, then Anthocephalus is a synonym of the Madagascan Cephalanthus and cannot be a generic name for the Asian kadam tree. If they were different (in spite of Richard's claim that they were the same) then Anthocephalus could be a generic name for the kadam tree. Based on the latter view, the name Anthocephalus chinensis has been widely used for the kadam tree.|$|E

25|$|L. donovani is now {{considered}} to be a complex species as indicated by different pathological symptoms occurring in different geographical areas where the species of the vector sandfly are also different. However, none of the parasites are morphologically distinguishable, except by molecular analysis. Molecular data show that genotype is strongly correlated with <b>geographical</b> <b>origin.</b> DNA sequencing of different geographical strains indicates that the protozoan complex can be classified into two valid taxons, L. donovani and L. infantum. The genus Leishmania most likely originated in South America, from where it migrated to Asia. L. donovani and L. infantum diverged ~1 Mya, with further divergence of infraspecific genetic groups between 0.4 and 0.8 Mya.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} with exact classification of the Khazar language. One {{of the basic}} issues is the vague nature of the name Khazar itself. It {{has not yet been}} determined whether it refers to a specific Turkish tribe, or if it had a political and <b>geographical</b> <b>origin</b> that was not ethnolinguistic. The Khazar realm was a polyglot (multi lingual) and polyethnic (multicultural) state, with Iranian, Finnic, Ugric, Slavic, and North Caucasian languages. According to anthropological data, it was ruled by Inner Asian Mongoloid (with some Europoid somatic elements) core tribes that accompanied the dynasty. The Turkic tribes probably spoke a number of Turkic languages. Scholars considered it a possibility that the term Khazar denoted one or even several languages; however, the sources cannot determine the extent of its use.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a rapid method for discriminating the <b>geographical</b> <b>origins</b> {{and age of}} roasted Torreya grandis seeds by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic analysis and pattern recognition. 337 samples were collected from three main producing areas and produced {{in the last two}} years. The objective of <b>geographical</b> <b>origins</b> analysis is to discriminate the seeds from Fengqiao with a protected geographical indication (PGI) from those of another two provinces. Age classification is aimed to detect the old seeds produced in the last year from the freshly produced ones. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was used to develop classification models, and the influence of data preprocessing methods on classification performance was also investigated. Taking second-order derivatives of the raw spectra proves to be the most proper and effective preprocessing method, which can remove baselines and backgrounds and reduce model complexity. With second derivative spectra, the sensitivity and specificity were 0. 939 and 0. 871 for age discrimination, respectively. Perfect classification was obtained, and both sensitivity and specificity were 1 for discrimination of <b>geographical</b> <b>origins...</b>|$|R

40|$|Different <b>geographical</b> <b>origins</b> {{and species}} of Paris {{obtained}} from southwestern China were discriminated by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with multivariate analysis. The NIR parameter settings were scanning (64 times), resolution (4 cm(- 1)), scanning range (10, 000 cm(- 1) ∼ 4000 cm(- 1)) and parallel collection (3 times). NIR spectrum was optimized by TQ 8. 6 software, and the ranges 7455 ∼ 6852 cm(- 1) and 5973 ∼ 4007 cm(- 1) were selected {{according to the}} spectrum standard deviation. The contents of polyphyllin I, polyphyllin II, polyphyllin VI, and polyphyllin VII and total steroid saponins were detected by HPLC.
