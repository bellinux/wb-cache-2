All {{members of the}} North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types <b>is</b> <b>evident.</b> Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.|$|E
5|$|High in fiamme, {{the third}} tuff layer {{differs from the}} second in that it has even higher {{phenocryst}} content, but poor lithics. In the fiamme, phenocrysts constitute between 5 and 15 percent of the rock, increasing to 25 to 30percent near the caldera. In the younger emplacements, clinopyroxene <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> along {{with an increase in}} mafic content.|$|E
