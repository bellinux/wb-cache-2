5|$|On 1 December 2010, {{the bridge}} was closed {{for the first time}} due to heavy snow. After several {{accidents}} meant snowploughs were unable to clear the carriageways, {{the bridge was}} closed in both <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> 6.40a.m. and remained closed for several hours. As part of celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's operation, artist Kate Downie was commissioned to create a print of the bridge and hold an exhibition of works portraying it.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> individual and group levels.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of refraction, the light's <b>direction</b> <b>at</b> emission is generally not the same as its <b>direction</b> <b>at</b> reception. In refractive media, the light's path generally deviates from the straight distance between the points of emission and reception. The Doppler effect depends on the component of the emitter's velocity parallel to the light's <b>direction</b> <b>at</b> emission, and the component of the receiver's velocity parallel to the light's <b>direction</b> <b>at</b> absorption. This does not contradict Special Relativity.|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 July, former Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Federal Religious Affairs Minister Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq {{declared}} that peace negotiations via loudspeaker and mobile phone had failed. Within minutes, the Special Service Group were issued orders to storm the mosque. Pakistan Army spokesman Waheed Arshad said troops began by attacking and breaching the mosque {{from the south and}} assaulted it from three <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> 4:00am (23:00 GMT). The forces immediately came under gunfire from heavily armed militants hunkered down behind sandbagged positions on the roof and from holes in the walls of the mosque. The SSG quickly cleared the mosque's ground floor, amid explosions coming from the mosque. About 30 women and children ran toward the advancing SSG operators and managed to escape unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army was {{scheduled}} to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> 3:00 pm and had orders {{to take control of}} Vilnius, Kaunas, Raseiniai, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai. The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. The Soviets came in great numbers clogging Lithuanian roads. They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance. Writer Ignas Šeinius claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes making the same flight over and over again to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces.|$|E
5|$|This {{changed in}} 1859 when James Clerk Maxwell contributed {{significantly}} to the field, more specifically, to the kinetic theory of gases, by presenting work where he assumed the gas particles move in random <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> random velocities. The kinetic theory of gases and statistical physics continued to be developed {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, with work done chiefly by Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Gibbs, which would later have an influence on Albert Einstein's model for Brownian movement.|$|E

5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia. While the 2/6thInfantry Battalion made a demonstration on the right, the 2/5thInfantry Battalion, reinforced by part of the 2/7thInfantry Battalion, attempted to follow up the 16thInfantry Brigade's attack, with {{the remainder of the}} 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade had become too tired and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some of the blame, for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E
5|$|In {{making his}} {{terrestrial}} globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> sea) and pilots (navigational handbooks). He {{is known to}} have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590. He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians. It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the terrestrial globe. Raleigh came by the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E

5|$|Specifically, the HPP lattice gas model {{consists}} of particles moving at unit velocity {{in the four}} axis-parallel directions. When two particles meet on the same line in opposite directions, they collide and are sent outwards from the collision point on the perpendicular line. This system obeys the conservation laws of physical gases, and produces simulations whose appearance resembles the behavior of physical gases. However, it was found to obey unrealistic additional conservation laws. For instance, the total momentum within any single line is conserved. As well, the differences between axis-parallel and non-axis-parallel directions in this model (its anisotropy) is undesirably high. The FHP lattice gas model improves the HPP model by having particles moving in six different <b>directions,</b> <b>at</b> 60 degree angles to each other, instead of only four directions. In any head-on collision, the two outgoing particles are deflected at 60 degree angles from the two incoming particles. Three-way collisions are also possible in the FHP model and are handled {{in a way that}} both preserves total momentum and avoids the unphysical added conservation laws of the HPP model.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{is always}} {{synthesized}} in the 5' to 3' direction. Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented in opposite <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> the replication fork, {{a major issue}} is how to achieve synthesis of nascent (new) lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to {{the direction of the}} growing replication fork.|$|E
25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main ebb and flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow {{direction}} and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along {{the ebb and}} flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, with the primary and secondary <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E

25|$|Bypassing 30th Street Station {{by using}} the New York-Pittsburgh Subway would allow trains to skip a {{time-consuming}} stop and reverse of <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> 30th St Station and allow fast service between New York and Harrisburg. Historically, the PRR fast trains going to NY from the west would bypass 30th St Station, and passengers for Philadelphia would change trains at North Philadelphia. One study suggested two daily electric-train round-trips between New York and Harrisburg with stops in North Philadelphia and Ardmore, a routing last used by Keystone trains in 1994.|$|E

25|$|This {{asymmetric}} phospholipid distribution {{among the}} bilayer {{is the result}} of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent phospholipid transport proteins. Proteins called “Flippases” move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while others called “floppases” do the opposite operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy dependent manner. Additionally, there are also “scramblase” proteins that move phospholipids in both <b>directions</b> <b>at</b> the same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy independent manner. There is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.|$|E
