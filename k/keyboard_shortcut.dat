5|$|Windows 10 {{provides}} heavier {{integration with}} the Xbox ecosystem. Xbox SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox app, which {{allows users to}} browse their game library (including both PC and Xbox console games), and Game DVR is also available using a <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcut,</b> allowing users to save the last 30 seconds of gameplay as a video that can be shared to Xbox Live, OneDrive, or elsewhere. Windows 10 also allows users to control and play games from an Xbox One console over a local network. The Xbox Live SDK allows application developers to incorporate Xbox Live functionality into their apps, and future wireless Xbox One accessories, such as controllers, are supported on Windows with an adapter. Microsoft also intends to allow cross-buys and save synchronization between Xbox One and Windows 10 versions of games; Microsoft Studios games such as ReCore and Quantum Break are intended as being exclusive to Windows 10 and Xbox One.|$|E
25|$|In Microsoft Windows menus, labels, {{and other}} captions, the {{ampersand}} {{is used to}} denote the <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcut</b> for that option (Alt + that letter, which appears underlined). A double ampersand is {{needed in order to}} display a real ampersand. This convention originated in the first WIN32 api, and is used in Windows Forms, and is also copied into many other tookits on multiple operating systems.|$|E
2500|$|On Microsoft Windows, Œ and œ can {{be entered}} using the Alt codes 0140 and 0156, i.e. by holding down the Alt key while typing the number 0140 for Œ and 0156 for œ {{respectively}} on the numeric keypad. In Microsoft Word, œ can additionally be entered using the <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcut</b> [...] then [...] in quick succession. Moreover, Microsoft Word {{and some other}} word processors can also automatically correct French words like [...] to , but in most other applications (e.g. an instant messenger, or a browser) the word will not be corrected.|$|E

2500|$|Windows NT {{has offered}} {{the ability for}} users to [...] "lock" [...] their {{computers}} by displaying a login window, which requires that the active user's password be entered to re-gain access to the system. Since Windows XP, the lock function has also been bound to the <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcut</b> [...] On Windows 8, the lock screen was re-designed to closer resemble those used by mobile operating systems; users can choose a distinct wallpaper for use on the lock screen, which now also displays a clock, calendar events, and notifications from other apps. The screen can be dragged upwards with a mouse or touchscreen to unlock the device.|$|E
2500|$|The Menu key or Application key {{is a key}} {{found on}} Windows-oriented {{computer}} keyboards. It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only. [...] This key was created {{at the same time}} as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcut).</b>|$|E

In this study we investigate the use of <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b> further and explore reasons why they are underutilized by users.

40|$|Graphical {{interfaces}} allow {{users to}} issue commands using pull-down menus, icon toolbars, and <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts.</b> Menus and icon toolbars {{are easier to}} learn, whereas <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b> are more efficient. It would seem natural for users to migrate {{from the use of}} easy-to-learn menu and icon methods to the more efficient method of key-board shortcuts as they gain experience. To investigate the extent to which this transi-tion takes place, 251 experienced users of Microsoft Word were given a questionnaire assessing their choice of methods for the most frequently occurring commands. Con-trary to our expectations, most experienced users rarely used the efficient <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts,</b> favoring the use of icon toolbars instead. A second study was done to verify that <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b> are, indeed, the most efficient method. Six participants per-formed common commands using menu selection, icon toolbars, and keyboard short-cuts. The <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b> were, as expected, the most efficient. We conclude that even experienced users are inefficient in their use of graphical interfaces. One possible way to improve user efficiency is for training programs to provide a roadmap for users to make the transition from using pull-down menus and clicking icon toolbars to issu-ing <b>keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts.</b> 1...|$|R
