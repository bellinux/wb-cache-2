5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E

5|$|The most {{influential}} retelling, {{which according to}} many commentators ensured that the Mary Celeste affair would never be forgotten, was {{a story in the}} January 1884 issue of the Cornhill Magazine. This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, then a 25-year-old ship's surgeon. Doyle's story, entitled J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship Marie Celeste, the captain's name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, another passenger, a fanatic named Septimus Goring with a hatred of the white race, has suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, the rest of the ship's company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> be taken seriously, but Sprague, still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar, was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.|$|E

25|$|On April 5, 1880, an African American cadet at West Point, Johnson Chesnut Whittaker, {{was found}} bruised and beaten in his cot.

25|$|While conceiving {{and writing}} the first series in 2012, Broadchurch creator and lead writer Chris Chibnall {{designed}} <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> be told as a trilogy.

The first series had to be self-contained, he felt, in case the show did not do well in the ratings and a second series was not commissioned. When Chibnall pitched series one to ITV in the autumn of 2012, he also pitched series two and three at the same time.|$|E

25|$|In context, the {{epigraph}} {{refers to}} a meeting between Dante and Guido da Montefeltro, who was condemned to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII, who wished to use Guido's advice for a nefarious undertaking. This encounter follows Dante's meeting with Ulysses, who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent. According to Ron Banerjee, the epigraph serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock's intent. Like Guido, Prufrock had never intended <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> be told, and so by quoting Guido, Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock's love song.|$|E

Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.|$|E
