50|$|The {{killing of}} <b>horses</b> <b>for</b> human {{consumption}} is widely opposed {{in countries such}} as the U.S., UK and Australia. where horses are generally considered to be companion and sporting animals only. Almost all equine medications and treatments are labeled as being not intended for human consumption.

French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent years crusading against the eating of horse meat.

40|$|Transport {{of horses}} by road is {{extremely}} common and even air transport, though {{nowhere near as}} common, is considered routine. However transport is an unusual experience <b>for</b> <b>horses</b> and presents them with many potential stressors, including separation, noise, movement, space restriction, reduced air quality, reduced access to feed and water and an elevated head position. By far the majority of published information on transport relates to the sport or racehorse {{and in many cases}} to populations of animals acclimatised to transport. Much less has been published relating to the transport of <b>horses</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Under these circumstances the animals being transported may be old and or ill or injured. They are usually transported with less concern that animals with a higher economic value and the level of stressors to which they are exposed may be higher resulting in failure to eat and drink sufficiently during transport. Other animals bred specifically for human consumption may have limited or no prior experience of transport. Transport has the potential to adversely affect almost all body systems, but it is the musculoskeletal, GI and respiratory tracts that are most commonly affected. An understanding of the effects of transport on the horse can permit the adoption of management practices that can improve the health and welfare of horse during transport. vo...|$|R

50|$|In most {{countries}} where <b>horses</b> are <b>slaughtered</b> <b>for</b> food, they are processed {{in a similar}} fashion to cattle, i.e., in large-scale factory slaughter houses (abattoirs) where they are stunned with a captive bolt gun and bled to death.

5000|$|Horses in the United States are not bred or {{raised for}} meat. Nearly all equine {{medications}} and treatments are labeled, [...] "Not <b>for</b> <b>horses</b> intended <b>for</b> human consumption." [...] Meat from American horses raises {{a number of}} potential health concerns, primarily due to the routine use of medications banned in food animals {{and a lack of}} tracking of such use. Unlike livestock raised for food (where all potential medications are tested for withdrawal times and vigilantly tracked), {{there is no way to}} guarantee which medications have been used in a particular horse. During November and December 2010 inspections of EU-regulated plants in Mexico which <b>slaughtered</b> <b>horses</b> <b>for</b> human consumption, the European Commission Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) uncovered violations. Most American <b>horses</b> destined <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> are transported to EU-regulated plants in Mexico and Canada. Horses, unlike traditional food animals in the United States, are not raised (or medicated) with the intent of becoming human food. Because American horses are not intended for the human food chain, they often receive medications banned by the Food and Drug Administration for use in food animals. Concern also exists that horse meat will be mixed with ground-beef products and sold improperly labeled in the US, as occurred during the European 2013 horse meat scandal.|$|R
5000|$|Anthropomorphism {{and ignorance}} of the horse, on the other hand, are real {{obstacles}} to a proper consideration of animal welfare, as many people wrongly believe themselves to be acting for the [...] "good" [...] of the horse. One example is the proliferation of the [...] "horse rescues via the internet". Calls for donations permit the purchase of <b>horses</b> destined <b>for</b> <b>slaughter,</b> but the people acquiring them do not always have the knowledge or the financial means to ensure their welfare over the long term. These animals are thus condemned to a [...] "slow death". Another example the [...] "false good idea" [...] to ban the slaughter of horses, {{which has led to}} even more of the suffering that it was meant to prevent.

50|$|In most {{countries}} where <b>horses</b> are <b>slaughtered</b> <b>for</b> food, they are processed in industrial abattoirs similarly to cattle. Typically, a penetrating {{captive bolt gun}} or gunshot is used to render the animal unconscious.

500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the feral horse herds became {{the target of}} local ranchers looking to limit grazing {{competition}} for their livestock. Many horses were rounded up, and either used as ranch <b>horses,</b> sold <b>for</b> <b>slaughter,</b> or shot. From the 1930s through the 1950s, federal and state agencies worked with ranchers to remove horses from western North Dakota. [...] However, when Theodore Roosevelt National Park {{was established in the}} 1940s, during construction, a few bands of horses were accidentally enclosed within the Park fence, and by 1960 these bands were the last remaining feral horses in North Dakota. Nonetheless, the park sought to eliminate these horses. The National Park Service was declared exempt from the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 that covered free-roaming horses and burros on other federal lands. This allowed them to view the herds as nuisances and deal with them as such, including sending many to slaughter.|$|R

The ban is no longer in place, but it had the effect of killing the horse-slaughter industry in the U.S.|$|R
25|$|One {{model of}} horse {{domestication}} starts with individual foals being kept as pets while the adult <b>horses</b> were <b>slaughtered</b> <b>for</b> meat. Foals {{are relatively small}} and easy to handle. Horses behave as herd animals and need companionship to thrive. Both historic and modern data shows that foals can and will bond to humans and other domestic animals to meet their social needs. Thus domestication may have started with young horses being repeatedly made into pets over time, preceding the great discovery that these pets could be ridden or otherwise put to work.|$|R
25|$|Secondary {{effects of}} racing have also {{recently}} been uncovered. A 2006 investigation by The Observer in the UK found that each year 6,000–10,000 <b>horses</b> are <b>slaughtered</b> <b>for</b> consumption abroad, {{a significant proportion}} of which are <b>horses</b> bred <b>for</b> racing. A boom in the number of foals bred has meant that there is not adequate resources to care <b>for</b> unwanted <b>horses.</b> Demand has increased for this massive breeding programme to be scaled back. Despite over 1000 foals being produced annually by the Thorougbred horse industry, 66% of those bred for such a purpose were never entered into a race, and despite a life expectancy of 30 years, many are killed before their fifth birthday.|$|R

A panel of three 5th Circuit judges disagreed, saying that the Texas law still stood and was enforceable.

50|$|Conversely, Australia passed no laws {{related to}} its local wild horses {{introduced}} {{at the end of}} the 18th century in response to the needs of settlers, nor its donkeys. From the 1980s until 2013, the slaughter of these animals from helicopters caused outrage for many animal defenders. The meat of Brumbies was used to make dog food. Long bled alive, <b>horses</b> <b>slaughtered</b> <b>for</b> their meet in the West are now stunned with a captive bolt pistol, to prevent them from suffering. However, in 1983 Brigitte Bardot revealed to the public the conditions of transport of horses to Polish slaughterhouses, causing a stir. Since the 1990s equestrian centres, which accommodate the majority of riders, hid the sending of <b>horses</b> to slaughterhouses <b>for</b> fear of losing their clientele. The first rescue centres <b>for</b> abused <b>horses</b> or those under threat of being resold to slaughterhouses were created in the same era.

500|$|In 1976, Congress {{included}} {{a provision in}} the Federal Land Policy and Management Act that permitted the humane use of helicopters in capturing free-roaming horses on federal land, and for the use of motorized vehicles in transporting them to corrals. [...] When problems with the Adopt-a-Horse program emerged and the BLM was accused of allowing too many adoptions so as to deplete feral horse populations on federal land and allowing [...] "adopted" [...] <b>horses</b> to sell <b>for</b> <b>slaughter,</b> in 1978 Congress passed the Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA). The PRIA limited adoptions to only four horses a year per individual and allowed BLM to relinquish title to the horse after one year (during which inspections regarding the animal's treatment were to occur). The law also required BLM to inventory all feral horse herds, scientifically determine what constituted [...] "appropriate" [...] herd levels, and determine through a public process whether [...] "excess" [...] animals should be removed. Congress further amended PRIA in 1978 to require updated herd counts.|$|R
