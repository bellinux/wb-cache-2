40|$|The {{legislative}} {{decision to}} amend a statute and reduce a sentence {{but not to}} apply it retroactively to pending prosecutions or to finalized convictions is {{in accord with the}} principles of retroactivity, but contrary to legitimate goals of punishment, i. e. deterrence and retributivism. Genarlow Wilson, convicted at seventeen of aggravated child molestation, a felony, for consensual oral sex with a fifteen-year old classmate, was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of ten years. While his appeal was pending, the Georgia Legislature reclassified the conduct as a misdemeanor and reduced the sentence to a maximum of one year but decided not to apply the changes retroactively to him. I use the Genarlow Wilson case as a backdrop to examine the denial of the retroactive application of ameliorative sentencing changes that is manifested {{through the use of a}} legislative device known as the express saving clause or a <b>general</b> <b>saving</b> statute. Currently, in the majority, ameliorative sentencing changes are applied retroactively provided there is a clear expression of legislative intent. Dissatisfied with this approach, a minority of jurisdictions engage in retroactive amelioration routinely either judicially or legislatively. While the courts in these jurisdictions apply ameliorative changes retroactively despite the existence of a <b>general</b> <b>saving</b> statute in contravention of the rules of statutory construction thus bordering on what some may label as judicial activism, the legislatures have created an ameliorative amendment exception to the <b>general</b> <b>saving</b> statute. Each applies ameliorative sentencing changes retroactively but restricts the application of such changes to circumstances in which there is neither an express saving clause nor has final judgment been determined. In my proposed retroactive amelioration statute, I advocate for ameliorative sentencing changes to be applied to pre-final judgment defendants adopting the current minority legislative practice and to those with finalized convictions through an administrative sentence readjustment process...|$|R

50|$|Savings {{banks in}} German-speaking {{countries}} are called Sparkasse (pl: Sparkassen). They work as commercial banks in a decentralized structure.

40|$|In jurisdictions {{where the}} criminalization of sodomy has been invalidated by {{judicial}} order, this {{has generally been}} achieved through a determination that an identified right is infringed {{and that there is}} justification for that infringement. However, in Jamaica, a modified approach is required owing to the existence of the <b>General</b> <b>Savings</b> Law Clause (GSLC), which shields laws existing before the entry into force of the Constitution of Jamaica from invalidity with the fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution. The sodomy law is one such existing law. Accordingly, it is advisable to begin the analytical process with the <b>general</b> <b>savings</b> law clause. Therefore, my thesis presents two arguments for obviating the clause. The first is an argument that the sodomy law is inconsistent with the constitutional principle of rule of law (as opposed to a provision). Accordingly, the GSLC does not apply here because the clause only saves laws inconsistent with constitutional provisions but does not speak to constitutional principles. The thesis then presents a case for a substantive conception {{of the rule of law}} and discusses whether the rule of law includes a conception of equality which requires invalidation of prohibitions of consensual anal intercourse between consenting adults. The second argument is that a reinterpretation of the GSLC could enable a successful challenge to the criminalization of sodomy by permitting the court to modify the law that criminalizes it. This argument relies on the use of a clause in the Constitution (Order in Council) that mandates the modification of existing laws in particular circumstances. I propose that, by this method of modification, the court could decriminalize anal intercourse between consenting adults. This thesis is not available in ORA...|$|R

30|$|With {{regard to}} demand structure, the <b>general</b> <b>savings</b> rate will decrease. With the {{stimulus}} during financial crisis phasing out, the investment rate {{will return to}} its normal level {{in the next decade}} and then continue to decrease. International trade tends to be balanced with rising cost of factors like labor and land. A lower trade deficit and investment rate and an increased urbanization level and household income will lead to a higher proportion of consumption. The simulation results show that household consumption will account for 42 % of GDP, while government spending will account for 15 %. The two items add up to 55 %, but the proportion of household consumption will increase to 46 % by 2020. However, despite this development model, the percentage of consumption in China’s GDP in 2020 will still be lower than that of other countries at the same level of development.|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} effects of {{demographic}} changes on current accounts. The analysis (based on panel least squares and weighted least squares models) shows substantial demographic effects on population ageing and current account balances in OECD countries. First, {{the negative impact of}} population ageing on <b>general</b> <b>savings</b> results in deteriorating current account balances. This result suggests that current account balances increase with the relative size of the working-age population and decrease when the elderly dependency ratio rises. This paper specifically distinguishes between two groups: the ageing society and the aged society. Empirical results indicate that demographic changes, such as dependency ratios, have no effect on current account balances in the ageing society group, but have a definite effect on current account balances in the aged society group, as previous research findings suggest. Therefore, current accounts will be positively benefited by encouraging birth rates and immigration from other countries in the long run...|$|R

40|$|Increasing current Individual Retirement Account (IRA) limits {{would lead}} to {{substantial}} increases in tax-deferred saving according to evidence in the paper, based on the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances. For example, the recent Treasury Plan would increase IRA Contributions by about 30 percent. The primary focus of the paper, however, {{is the effect of}} limit increases on other saving. How much of the IRA increase would be offset by reduction in non-tax-deferred saving? The weight of the evidence suggests that very little of the increase would be offset by reduction in other financial assets, possibly 10 to 20 percent. The estimates suggest that 45 to 55 percent of the IRA increase would be funded by reduction in expenditure for other goods and services, and about 35 percent by reduced taxes. The analysis rests on a savings decision structure recognizing the constraint that the IRA limit places on the allocation of current income; it is a constrained optimization model with the IRA limit the principle constraint. The evidence also suggests substantial variation in saving behavior among segments of the population. In addition, it appears that IRAs do not serve as a substitute for private pension plans. Thus the legislative goal of disproportionately increasing retirement saving among persons without pension plans is apparently not being realized.
