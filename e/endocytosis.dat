5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and <b>endocytosis</b> processes. <b>Endocytosis</b> refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} <b>endocytosis,</b> phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5|$|Class IV: LDLR {{bound to}} LDL does not {{properly}} cluster in clathrin-coated pits for receptor-mediated <b>endocytosis</b> (pathway step 2).|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment; viruses {{penetrate}} the host cell by <b>endocytosis</b> or by fusion with the cell.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated <b>endocytosis.</b> Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by <b>endocytosis.</b> Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and <b>endocytosis.</b> ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein <b>endocytosis</b> by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 entry, {{as well as}} {{entry of}} many other retroviruses, has long been {{believed}} to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane. More recently, however, productive infection by pH-independent, clathrin-dependent <b>endocytosis</b> of HIV-1 has also been reported and was recently suggested to constitute the only route of productive entry.|$|E
5|$|The endosymbiotic {{relationship}} of mitochondria with their host cells was popularized by Lynn Margulis. The endosymbiotic hypothesis suggests that mitochondria descended from bacteria that somehow survived <b>endocytosis</b> by another cell, and became {{incorporated into the}} cytoplasm. The ability of these bacteria to conduct respiration in host cells that had relied on glycolysis and fermentation would have provided a considerable evolutionary advantage. This symbiotic relationship probably developed 1.7 to 2 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|The virus enters cells by {{receptor}} mediated <b>endocytosis</b> {{and form}} a vesicle known as an endosome. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating {{a difference in the}} calcium concentration. This causes the breakdown of VP7 trimers into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).|$|E
5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated <b>endocytosis.</b> The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated <b>endocytosis.</b> Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the type}} of {{metabolic}} process they employ, the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes. The Planctomycetes are the exception (as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that Gemmata obscuriglobus is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles <b>endocytosis,</b> the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.|$|E
5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 <b>endocytosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated <b>endocytosis</b> or {{membrane}} fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by <b>endocytosis</b> or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. <b>Endocytosis</b> and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Endocytosis</b> and {{exocytosis}} {{are both}} forms of bulk transport that move materials {{into and out}} of cells, respectively, via vesicles. In the case of <b>Endocytosis,</b> the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell. The ingested particle becomes trapped within a pouch, known as a vesicle, inside the cytoplasm. Often enzymes from lysosomes are then used to digest the molecules absorbed by this process.|$|E
25|$|The {{pertussis}} toxin {{does not have}} a specific receptor, and binds to sialylated glycoproteins. After <b>endocytosis,</b> {{pertussis toxin}}'s mechanism is the same as cholera toxin.|$|E
25|$|Viruses {{lacking a}} viral {{envelope}} often have complex mechanisms {{for entry into}} the host cell. MPyV capsid protein VP1 binds to sialic acids of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b on the cell surface. The functions of VP2 and VP3 are less well understood, but at least VP2 {{has been reported to}} be exposed upon <b>endocytosis</b> of the viral particle and may be involved in releasing the virus from the endoplasmic reticulum. MPyV has been reported to enter cells through both a caveolae-dependent <b>endocytosis</b> mechanism and by an independent mechanism through uncoated vesicles.|$|E
25|$|Most cell types take up iron {{primarily}} through receptor-mediated <b>endocytosis</b> via transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and GAPDH. TFR1 has a 30-fold higher affinity for transferrin-bound iron than TFR2 {{and thus is}} the main player in this process. The higher order multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) also acts as a transferrin receptor. Transferrin-bound ferric iron is recognized by these transferrin receptors, triggering a conformational change that causes <b>endocytosis.</b> Iron then enters the cytoplasm from the endosome via importer DMT1 after being reduced to its ferrous state by a STEAP family reductase.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{released}} from the anterior pituitary gland binds the TSH receptor (a Gs protein-coupled receptor) on the basolateral membrane of the cell and stimulates the <b>endocytosis</b> of the colloid.|$|E
25|$|This {{accounts}} for the re-uptake of synaptic vesicles in the full contact fusion model. However, other studies have been compiling evidence suggesting {{that this type of}} fusion and <b>endocytosis</b> is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|In vitro, NEDD4 {{has been}} shown to bind and ubiquitinate a number of ion {{channels}} and membrane transporters resulting in their subsequent <b>endocytosis</b> and degradation by the proteasome, including the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), voltage-gated calcium and voltage-gated sodium channels.|$|E
25|$|A {{high rate}} of <b>endocytosis</b> is {{necessary}} to counter the {{high rate of}} exocytosis during sustained neurotransmitter release at ribbon synapses. Synaptic vesicles need to be recycled for further transmission to occur. These vesicles are directly recycled and because of their mobility, quickly replenish the neurotransmitters required for continued release.|$|E
25|$|As discussed, each {{molecule}} {{interacts with}} several others {{in order to}} induce the <b>endocytosis</b> of the anthrax toxin. Once inside, the complex is transferred to an acidic compartment, where the heptamer, still in the non-membrane-spanning pre-pore conformation, is prepared for translocation of EF and LF into the cytosol.|$|E
25|$|Oocytes can be {{unusually large}} cells in species for which {{embryonic}} development takes place {{away from the}} mother's body. Their large size can be achieved either by pumping in cytosolic components from adjacent cells through cytoplasmic bridges (Drosophila) or by internalization of nutrient storage granules (yolk granules) by <b>endocytosis</b> (frogs).|$|E
25|$|Entry {{into the}} host cell is {{achieved}} by attachment of the viral envelope protein E to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated <b>endocytosis.</b> Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Humans, mammals, mosquitoes, and ticks serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are zoonosis and bite.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment to host receptors, which mediates <b>endocytosis.</b> Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of replication. Translation takes place by leaky scanning and RNA termination-reinitiation. Humans and other mammals serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and contamination.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment to host receptors, which mediates <b>endocytosis.</b> Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription, using an unknown model of subgenomic RNA transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting. Vertebrates serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{replication}} is nuclear, and is lysogenic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment of the viral glycoproteins to host receptors, which mediates <b>endocytosis.</b> Replication follows the dsDNA bidirectional replication model. DNA templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning. The virus exits the host cell by , and budding.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the cell}} membrane, {{cholesterol}} also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol {{is essential for}} the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent <b>endocytosis.</b> The role of cholesterol in <b>endocytosis</b> of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed {{to be part of the}} basis for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Ales et al. {{showed that}} raised {{concentrations}} of extracellular calcium ions shift the preferred mode of recycling and synaptic vesicle release to the kiss-and-run mechanism in a calcium-concentration-dependent manner. It {{has been proposed}} that during secretion of neurotransmitters at synapses, the mode of exocytosis is modulated by calcium to attain optimal conditions for coupled exocytosis and <b>endocytosis</b> according to synaptic activity.|$|E
25|$|The hydrolyzed {{chylomicron}}s are {{now called}} chylomicron remnants. The chylomicron remnants continue circulating the bloodstream until they interact via apolipoprotein E with chylomicron remnant receptors, found chiefly in the liver. This interaction causes the <b>endocytosis</b> of the chylomicron remnants, which are subsequently hydrolyzed within lysosomes. Lysosomal hydrolysis releases glycerol and fatty acids into the cell, {{which can be}} used for energy or stored for later use.|$|E
25|$|Actin’s {{cytoskeleton}} {{is key to}} {{the processes}} of <b>endocytosis,</b> cytokinesis, determination of cell polarity and morphogenesis in yeasts. In addition to relying on actin these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which all have a high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules. Together these elements allow a spatially and temporally modulated assembly that defines a cell’s response to both internal and external stimuli.|$|E
25|$|The virus enter cells by {{receptor}} mediated <b>endocytosis</b> {{and form}} a vesicle known as an endosome. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating {{a difference in the}} calcium concentration. This causes the breakdown of VP7 trimers into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).|$|E
25|$|Entry into host {{cells is}} thought to occur by {{attachment}} of virions to cellular receptors and subsequent <b>endocytosis.</b> Nucleocapsids are introduced into the cytoplasm by pH-dependent fusion of the virion with the endosomal membrane. Subsequent to release of the nucleocapsids into cytoplasm, the complexes are targeted to the ER-Golgi Intermediate compartments (ERGIC) through microtubular associated movement resulting {{in the formation of}} viral factories at ERGIC.|$|E
25|$|SubAB's {{target is}} in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum of the cell and is brought into the cell through clathrin-mediated <b>endocytosis.</b> The glycan receptor for SubAB usually ends with an α2-3-linked N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). SubAB has an A subunit where it acts as a serine protease and cleaves Bip/GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone. The cleavage of this chaperone causes cellular stress through protein inhibition, and consequently death of the cell.|$|E
