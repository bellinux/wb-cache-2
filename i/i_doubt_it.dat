There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

He received numerous awards, including Southeastern Conference (SEC) Player of the Year (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second Team All-American selection. Later, Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the Birmingham Post-Herald.|$|E

500|$|Fischer was {{a master}} of playing with, and against, the Sicilian Defense. The next most common defense against Fischer's 1.e4 was the Caro-Kann Defense (1.e4 c6), against which Fischer had a good record. Fischer's worst record was against the French Defense (1.e4 e6), {{especially}} the [...] (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4). Fischer maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black's kingside, and that, in his view, [...] "Black was trading off his good bishop with 3...Bb4 and...Bxc3." [...] Later on Fischer said: [...] "I may yet be forced {{to admit that the}} Winawer is sound. But <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it!</b> The defense is anti-positional and weakens the K-side." ...|$|E

In it, Barkley quipped, [...] "Of {{all the people}} in sports I'd like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly's not one of them. It's a shame though, skinny white boys look real aerodynamic." [...] In 2002, Barkley released the book I May Be Wrong, But <b>I</b> <b>Doubt</b> <b>It,</b> which included editing and commentary by close friend Michael Wilbon. Three years later, Barkley released Who's Afraid of a Large Black Man?, which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.|$|E

Well, this week's episode, titled 'Us,' was not exactly slow, but <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> will draw the crowds to the water cooler this morning either.

It {{has been there for}} one thousand years. And every educated fellow, the elite of our society, goes around saying that we are above caste. This is telling lies. Read the matrimonial columns in the papers. Yes, they don't indulge in crude forms of casteism – not allowing someone to drink out of the same glass – but will they allow a Dalit to come and sit at their table and eat with them? <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> very much. Of course, marriage is out of the question. This thing is so deeply rooted in our psyche, this Manusmriti, this Chaturvarna , {{to get out of it}} will take a thousand years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} the album and concluded: [...] "The numbers offer {{a lot of}} variety. The most immediate thing I noticed was the arrangements - which included some solid bass work that would have done justice to Led Zeppelin. Next, there's the use of backup vocals, something Slade haven't used {{too much in the}} past. Finally, there's the pace, lots of it. It's not an album of singles - it does present tracks that are a lot deeper than I expected. You're right lads, you're nobody's fools!" [...] New Musical Express wrote: [...] "Well if this album is an accurate representation of their album-making ability <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>it</b> very much. Oh, Slade are an exciting band. Plenty of kick and grit, and their unrefined charm which has been captured from their live performances in the studio environment, but though superficially the music here is of reasonable standard, there's not a lot of depth. Really the album is just a collection of hooky little singles." [...] Music Week wrote [...] "A cracking album, the group is now playing better than ever. Slade has matured {{to the point of being}} able to convert an older audience to their cause." ...|$|E
