The pair <b>easily</b> held the <b>opening</b> three games, before Federer launched his first assault on Murray's serve at 2-1 up; he could not, however, convert his one break point opportunity. Federer eased through next service game, and broke Murray {{for the first}} time at 3-2 following a succession of errors from Murray. Federer fired another series of big serves in the seventh game, and then broke Murray to win the first set, 6-2, in twenty-seven minutes. Murray lost the first two games of the second set, meaning that Federer had won a cumulative total of six games in a row. Murray immediately broke back though, and appeared to have steadied himself by winning the next game, allowing Federer only one point. Federer failed to hit any successful first serves in the next game, and Murray gained three consecutive break points at 0-40. Federer won the next three points, despite, on evidence of a replay, having clearly hit one of his shots long. Because Murray did not stop the point, he could not challenge the call; after the match, when Murray was asked about this, he said he was disappointed, but thought that the rules were correct in not allowing retrospective challenges. Both players comfortably held the next four games, although some minor threats presented themselves for Federer at 4-4, 0-15 and 30-30 (Murray hit backhands long both times). Murray was aided in the next game, when he was serving to stay in the set, as Federer hit four unforced errors, all going long. Federer won the next game, and then seized his final opportunity on a Murray service game, winning the final game of the second set to love.Federer began to overpower his opponent in the third set; Murray was broken to love twice as Federer raced ahead to a 5-0 lead, with Murray winning only four points up to that point. He did, however, win the next two games. Federer broke the game after though, winning on his second championship point in a point that required three smashes from the defending champion. The match lasted one hour and fifty-one minutes, thirteen minutes fewer than it took to complete the women's final. The only players that Federer had not surpassed, in terms of US Open wins, at this point in his career were: Richard Sears, who had won seven straight, Bill Larned, who won seven overall, and Bill Tilden with six straight and seven overall (all three of these players played before the open era).

40|$|A central {{aspect of}} {{contemporary}} international education policy debates concern {{the need for}} {{improving the quality of}} teachers as one of the primary ways of increasing student results in international tests and evaluations. Such reforms, aimed at increasing the effectiveness or status of teachers in general, are often framed as being geared towards processes of teacher professionalization. However, the concept of professionalism, and consequently the desired outcomes of processes of professionalization, is not <b>easily</b> defined, <b>opening</b> room for political struggles over the meaning ascribed to it in different contexts. It is the overall intention of this paper to critically examine such political struggles over definitions of these concepts in the context of contemporary Swedish education policy making. Even if the paper draws on the case of Sweden, the discussion has wider implications as the political and institutional arrangements affecting the way education policies are currently framed are becoming increasing similar between countries, due to the fundamental influence of intergovernmental organizations such as the European Union (EU) or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on national policy making in the area of education. The introduction of ‘professional’ terminology in relation to teachers in Sweden was not introduced by teachers themselves or their organizations, but was imposed upon them {{as an integral part of}} the political process of educational decentralization and deregulation. However, as the traditional bureaucratic hierarchies of the welfare system were dismantled the possibility of adopting professional terminology became available to occupations, and occupational organizations, not normally considered full-fledged professions. This led to an expansion of the use of professional terminology on behalf of a number of public service occupations (e. g. teachers, nurses, social worker) previously referred to as semi-professional. This transformation of the system of welfare provision constitutes a precondition for the Swedish Teacher Unions to adopt and use a professional discourse as a strategy for trying to improve the conditions of their members in different ways. This paper summarizes the results of a Ph. D-project aimed at analyzing how Sweden’s two Teacher Unions construct their own versions of teacher professionalism in relation to two recent Swedish education reforms, intended to increase the professionalism of teachers. Using theories from the sociology of professions coupled with an institutional approach to the study of organizations the paper analyzes how the Teacher Unions construct professional projects in relation to each other as well as in relation to the reforms of the current Ministry of Education. Viewing professionalism as an institutional logic, it investigates the different strategies employed by the two Unions and considers their effects on the overall professional ambitions of Swedish teachers. By doing so it highlights the complexities facing occupational organizations – such as unions – as they engage in political struggles over how the meaning ascribed to concepts like professionalism is to be decided. In this sense, the Unions are considered as a kind of institutional actors using the idea of professionalism in order to promote their own ideas of how the future development of the teaching profession may best serve the interests of their members. The unions’ focus on processes of professionalization is also considered as a kind of identity-work aimed at providing Swedish teachers with a clearly defined occupational identity within the framework of a transformed welfare system. Methodology, Methods, Research Instruments or Sources Used The study is based on analyses of public union documents, as they are considered the best way to access the "public voice" of the two organizations. The primary material consist of referrals in which the Unions are responding to the suggestions of governmentally appointed public commissions suggesting how certain political initiatives are to be realized. These commission reports are, after the referrals have been taken into account, transformed into green papers to be decided by parliament. In addition to these formal statements, debate articles by (primarily) the Union chairs are also included into the analyses in order to provide a kind of narrative sense of how the Unions place their policies in relation to the overall education policy debates of Sweden. The textual analyses draws on the ideas of "policy sociology" as sociological concepts are used to interpret and understand the policies of the Unions. It is not an analysis for policy, in the sense that it is aimed to provide the Unions with strategies for how the are best to accomplish their policy objectives, but rather a critical analysis of the policies they employ and how they can be understood in the context where they arise. In this sense the study is critical in its ambition to problematize the Unions' use of professional terminology. The analysis is guided by an abductive approach as the interpretations have been developed in a continuous process where theory has provided new insights in relation to the empirical material at the same time as that same material has required new theoretical tools to be put in use in order to provide reasonable explanations. Conclusions, Expected Outcomes or Findings The overall conclusion to be drawn from the study is that the idea of teacher professionalization in the context of Swedish education policy making is a decidedly political process, somewhat removed or de-coupled from the everyday practice of Swedish teachers. ￼ A central argument of the study is that the fact that Swedish teachers are organized in two different unions are complicating the formulation of a common professional project on behalf of Swedish teachers in general. This is because the two unions, though united in their wish to turn teaching into a "proper" profession, are constructing their professional projects from very opposing points of departure, resulting in a process of intraprofessional boundary-work dependent upon the historical tension between different teacher categories. As a result of the internal struggles between the two Teacher Unions the position of Swedish teachers in general becomes weak in relation to national education policy makers. As the unions are forced to compete for political influence in order to gain support for their own policies, the professional projects of Swedish teachers are becoming very dependent upon the political system in general. As a result the autonomy of Swedish teachers, as an occupational group, is restricted, seriously limiting the prospects for teachers to become "professionals" in any traditional understanding of the term...|$|R

Specifically, the aims were: 1) to review the potential for beef cattle genetic improvement in sub-Saharan Africa, 2) to describe the state of institutional framework supporting Boran breeding in Kenya while considering the different categories of Boran cattle farmers, 3) to investigate the genetic and economic merit of alternative breeding programmes based on improved Boran, the unimproved Boran and the possibilities of expanding an inclusive breeding programme for these two strains of Boran cattle, 4) to discuss the feasibility of alternative breeding strategies {{within the context of a}} formal breeding programme in Kenya. 	The methodological approach entailed a review of the literature on cattle production and genetic improvement strategies for sub-Saharan Africa. This was done by identifying previous and on-going breeding activities among indigenous cattle breeds based on their regional distribution in Africa. An institutional framework analysis to characterise the Boran breeding sector in Kenya was also performed. Open questions were presented to the Boran cattle Breeders? Society of Kenya through an online survey to ascertain the structure of the society in terms of membership, cattle populations and animal breeding activities. The production systems, cattle types and breeding objectives were also sought from previous studies on Boran cattle in the process of developing appropriate breeding programmes. Design and evaluation of nucleus breeding programmes (genetically and economically) was done with the ZPLAN computer programme by defining the breeding objectives and selection criteria traits, describing breeding and commercial populations, describing selection groups as well as their reproduction performance parameters. The costs of the breeding programme included fixed costs and costs of animal recording. To account for genetic gain and the flow of animal genetics, a gene transmission matrix was defined utilising the selection groups alongside genetic and phenotypic parameter matrices. The information sources for the selection criteria were mainly parental selection groups and halfsibs of animal. The number of animals forming the selection groups and information sources was calculated in the NBILD and NUMBER subroutines of the ZPLAN. The interest rates for returns and costs were 8 % and 6 % respectively while the investment period was set at 25 years. The scope of the study was limited to two classes of farmers keeping Boran, the commercial beef ranchers and the market-oriented low-input beef producers that interact with commercial beef ranchers. Three breeding objectives were evaluated, 1) conventional breeding objectives with market (economic) values derived from bio-economic modelling, namely: direct sale weight, dressing percentage, consumable meat percentage, cow weaning rate, cow survival rate, cow weight, age at first calving, milk yield, feed intake and post weaning survival rate, 2) a combination of selected conventional target traits in addition to traits important to low-input farmers to exploit the ongoing informal interaction between the large scale ranchers and low-input systems, and 3) trait preferences for low-input farmers derived from conjoint analysis studies namely; sale weight, calving interval, temperament, tick resistance, trypanotolerance and lactation milk yield. To evaluate the benefit of perceived trypanotolerance in unimproved low-input herds, strategic recording for trypanotolerance for offspring of nucleus sires born in these herds was assumed. Closed and open-nucleus types were evaluated and variations on the nucleus size (5 %, 10 % and 25 %). proportion of gene transfer to commercial herds (25 %, 50 %, 70 %) and the proportion of gene importation into the nucleus (10 %, 20 % and 30 %) were tested. 	The results from the institutional framework analysis showed that the Boran sector is structured with a section of the farmers being large scale commercial ranchers keeping approximately 17 % of a total population of 580, 000 heads of cattle. The rest were Boran farmers operating in low-input production systems keeping over 80 % of the total population. The large scale commercial ranchers were found to be divided into two groups, about 52 % of these farmers were elite breeders that record with the Kenya Stud Book and the rest were mainly commercial. The large scale commercial ranchers keep the improved Boran while the low-input farmers keep the unimproved Boran. The large scale commercial ranchers were organised into a breed society, namely, the Boran Cattle Breeders Society (BCBS), incorporating both the elite breeders and the commercial group. The BCBS was identified as a key stakeholder in the breeding of Boran cattle because of their informal role as suppliers of breeding stock. 	The results from the evaluation of alternative open and closed-nucleus breeding programmes utilising the Boran cattle populations were obtained with the ZPLAN computer programme. For the elite breeders?, where a total population of 52, 000 cows with a breeding unit of 25 % was assumed, the overall monetary genetic gain was KSh 86 per cow while the profit per cow was KSh 361 under the conventional breeding objective. The breeding programme with the entire BCBS group where a population of 99, 972 cows was assumed obtained a higher monetary genetic gain and profit than the elite group per cow of KSh 93 and KSh 431 respectively under the same breeding objective. The results revealed the effect of a larger effective population size on performance of breeding programmes. The breeding programme based wholly on market oriented low-input producers was evaluated using farmer trait preferences as the breeding objective. This breeding programme posted a negative gain for milk yield of - 1. 1 kg, which improved when restrictions on growth and adaptation were applied. The introduction of the combined breeding objective that included adaptation and disease tolerance traits resulted in a drop in sale weight gain by almost 2 kg. However, post-weaning survival rate improved from 0. 4 % to 1 % and trypanotolerance gained 20 % packed cell volume within this breeding objective. There was reduction in feed intake under the combined breeding objective, which is desirable considering the prevailing limitations on land, feed and climatic conditions. This may induce a change in focus from the continuous improvement in sale weight. The gains in post weaning survival rate would support this objective. The results from the expanded breeding programme may be beneficial to both the low-input farmers and the commercial ranchers because of the advantages conferred from the improvement in adaptation traits. The benefits of extra recording for trypanotolerance in the commercial herds of the expanded programme were not realised. In general, the open-nucleus programmes were superior genetically while the closed-nucleus programmes were superior economically. The larger nucleus sizes (25 %), higher gene contributions to commercial herd (70 %) and limiting <b>nucleus</b> <b>opening</b> to 10 % were most profitable. 	The limitations of the study were observed from the online interviews with respect to the amount of information that could be retrieved from key persons. Similarly, information on the legal framework of the breeding sector was scarce since Kenya has no active livestock breeding policy. The design and evaluation of the breeding programmes was possible with ZPLAN, however, in this study, genetic variance for traits, which normally diminishes with selection and inbreeding, was not account for. This may have had implications related to overestimation of genetic response and economic returns. Nonetheless, the potential of the Boran for both beef production and fitness traits coupled with the presence of institutional support for animal recording in Kenya were evaluated as strengths of the system. This study has shown the possibilities of combining market and non-market traits useful in breeding programmes for cattle utilised in different production systems. This approach is useful in cases where interactions exist between different categories of farmers. To benefit from advantages offered by open-nucleus breeding, recording may be avoided in the commercial herds and selection be done under criteria that are acceptable by the farmers. Further investigations on farmer organisations and comprehensive livestock breeding policies may aid the process of establishing co-ordinated breeding programmes for Boran cattle in Kenya.
