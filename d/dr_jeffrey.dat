5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{begins a}} few moments after Dracula ends. Count Dracula has just been {{destroyed}} by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is taken by police to Scotland Yard, where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because {{he had already been}} dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder.

Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and can live as a human. When this fails, she turns to psychiatry and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Jeffrey</b> Garth. When his efforts fail, she kidnaps Janet, the woman Jeffrey loves, and flees with her to Transylvania in an attempt to bind Jeffrey to her. She is foiled and destroyed when her jealous manservant shoots her with an arrow.|$|E

5|$|In November 2006, Jolie {{expanded}} {{the scope of}} the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals. She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & <b>Dr.</b> <b>Jeffrey</b> Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a trip to a Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.|$|E

During field excavations at the Maya coastal site of Vista Alegre, <b>Drs.</b> <b>Jeffrey</b> Glover and Dominique Rissolo recovered a high volume of sherds comprising a number of vessel type-varieties and forms. Vessel fragments collected from the Vista Alegre assemblage are comprised largely of ambiguous unslipped plain and unslipped striated sherds. This study explores distinct diagnostic attributes associated with these unlipped plain and unslipped striated sherds such as paste composition, texture, color, rim forms, and handle styles.

6000|$|I don't {{think that}} Lord Ragnall quite liked it, but {{fortunately}} Lady Longden was a talkative person. First she conversed about her {{cold in the}} head, sneezing at intervals, poor soul, and being reduced to send for another handkerchief after the entrées. Then she got off upon business matters; to judge {{from the look of}} boredom on her host's face, I think it must have been of settlements. Three times did I hear him refer her to the lawyers--without avail. Lastly, when he thought he had escaped, she embarked upon a quite vigorous argument with <b>Dr.</b> <b>Jeffreys</b> about church matters--I gathered that she was [...] "low" [...] and he was [...] "high"--in which she insisted upon his lordship acting as referee.|$|R
60|$|I bowed, {{not knowing}} what to say. Lord Ragnall laughed and vanished, leaving us together. Dinner was announced. Presently we were wending in the centre of a long and {{glittering}} procession across the central hall to the banqueting chamber, a splendid room with a roof like a church that was said to have been built in the times of the Plantagenets. Here Mr. Savage, who evidently had been looking out for her future ladyship, conducted us to our places, which were upon the left of Lord Ragnall, who sat {{at the head of the}} broad table with Lady Longden on his right. Then the old clergyman, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Jeffreys,</b> a pompous and rather frowsy ecclesiastic, said grace, for grace was still in fashion at such feasts in those days, asking Heaven to make us truly thankful for the dinner we were about to consume.|$|R
