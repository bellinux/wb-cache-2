500|$|Another step to {{move the}} game from the {{apparent}} hip-hop nature was through its song selection. Jackson felt the first game was weighted too heavily to the genre, with about 60% of the songs being hip-hop. The songs in DJ Hero 2 represent {{a wider variety of}} music, including dance, drum and bass, and techno, along with some contributions from hip-hop. Jackson noted {{that they were able to}} work better with artists and publishers for DJ Hero 2, after the successful launch of the first game; with artists and publishers now knowing what to expect, [...] "there is more understanding, so it has opened the doors to us <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> more popular music", according to Jackson. [...] However, licensing for such music remained a difficult barrier. Mixes for DJ Hero 2 are made first through computer-aided mixing of the two song tracks combined with effects noises, with simultaneous authoring of the gameplay markers. Noise for the scratching sections are filled in by recording the sounds of the tracks actually scratched on a DJ deck.|$|E

Rebel Heart Tour was led by Live Nation Entertainment's Global Touring Division, helmed by Arthur Fogel. It was Madonna's fifth collaboration with Live Nation. Fogel commented that the leak had helped in bring more attention to Madonna's music {{and it was a}} positive scenario for the world tour. [...] "It's kind of strange how it all came about, but it certainly hasn't been a negative <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> people engaged with the new music.

2500|$|When the Citizens Assembly {{recommended}} {{an alternative}} Single Transferable Vote system, Carr felt strongly {{that this was}} the wrong system for BC stating: [...] "It's rock bottom <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> women elected. And it still leaves too many voters frustrated by their votes not counting. It's not truly proportional." [...] However, after that initial outburst, Carr put her personal opinion aside and at the Green Party's Annual Convention following the Citizens Assembly's decision she supported a resolution that her party officially take a neutral stance letting candidates decide for themselves whether or not to support the Citizens Assembly's proposal. Almost all Green Party candidates actively campaigned for the electoral reform referendum in the 2005 election. Prior to that election Nik Loenen, [...] "the father of electoral reform in BC" [...] and a big STV supporter, had urged political parties not to take a stance. He felt in particular that the Green Party's endorsement might alienate potential supports in mainstream parties [...] Since the defeat of the BC-STV referendum in 2005 (58% - short 2% of the 60% level needed to pass) after a trip to Australia to see how STV worked there, Carr changed her view and supported the government-sponsored referendum on the BC-STV, as did the BC Green Party in the May 2009 general election.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 March 1985, the Jesus and Mary Chain {{played a}} gig at the North London Polytechnic {{in front of}} one of their largest crowds up to that point. The {{organizers}} had overbooked the venue, leaving hundreds of fans locked outside. When Gillespie and Hart attempted to break the locks, the police were called. Support band Meat Whiplash had stirred up violence before the Mary Chain set foot onto the stage when singer Paul McDermott threw an empty wine bottle into the audience, prompting four members of the crowd to attack him, leading to their set being abandoned. Second act The Jasmine Minks got through their set without incident, but the Jesus and Mary Chain then kept the audience waiting for over an hour before taking the stage, and then left the stage after playing for less than twenty minutes. Members of the audience began throwing cans at where the band were hiding behind the stage curtains, before mounting the stage to smash the equipment that remained there. The violence continued for some time before police eventually took control. The venue blamed the band's late appearance and two equipment breakdowns, while McGee issued a statement saying that [...] "the audience were not smashing up the hall, they were smashing up pop music", going on to say [...] "This is truly art as terrorism". The violence soon started to become a hindrance to the band, with people attending concerts simply for the violence rather than the music, William commenting [...] "I hate it, I despise it. It gets in the way <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> more gigs, and it gets in the way of our image". Many performances were cancelled during the remainder of 1985, with promoters or local councils not prepared to risk a riot. The violence flared up again at a performance at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town in September, with bottles thrown at the band while they played, and a section of the audience smashing up the amplification equipment and smashing the lights afterwards, with several people injured by flying glass. A major factor in the audience reaction was the length of the band's sets at the time, which lasted less than twenty-five minutes, Jim explaining this with [...] "there's never been a group good enough to play any longer". Lack of songs was also a factor, according to Jim: [...] "We've only got enough songs to play for that long".|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{customer}} value {{has attracted a}} lot of interest among scholars, marketing resear- chers and many marketing practitioners over last two decades. A lot has been written <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> customer value definition and quite a few research studies have been conducted in this area focusing on various aspects of the value construct. The concept of customer value is discussed in many streams of marketing literature including relationship marketing, customer relationship ma- nagement (CRM) pricing, consumer behaviour, in total quality management as well as in strategy literature. It has become an important factor in attracting and retaining customers and a fundamen- tal basis in competitive strategies. The paper discusses various conceptual models of customer value found in the literature. Based on the literature study, it presents findings of the research focused on the concept of customer value, its attributes in clothing retailing. For the purpose of the research, a framework presented by Simova (2007) was used. Customer value was defined and measured <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> (benefits) and give (sacrifice) components. The concept of customer value based on price and quality di- mensions was broadened by adding another value dimensions composing customer values such as functional, social, and emotional aspects of value in relation to perceived sacrifices. The term „sacrifice“ was perceived <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> both, monetary and non-monetary costs instead of price only. Multivariate data analysis, In particular, factor analysis was used to identify the main elements of customer value in clothing retailing. Five components with eigenvalues larger than one were extracted for benefit attributes of customer value (psychological aspects, physical appearance of merchandise, quality of merchandise and shopping, environment and communication, personnel) three components (price and discounts, shopping incentives, effort made when shopping) were extracted for sacrifice attributes of customer value...|$|R
