This distinction is based on the derivation of the two codes: the <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> is derived from the Joint Ore Reserves Committee, an independent mineral industry body formed from industry professional associations; The NI 43-101 is a code derived from the Canadian Securities Authorities.

5000|$|Two main {{regulatory}} documents exist {{depending on}} the national jurisdiction the company is filed with. In Canada, the National Instrument 43-101 report details requirements of reporting mineralized findings. In Australia, the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (<b>JORC</b> <b>Code),</b> and South Africa mandates the South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (SAMREC).

50|$|The {{technical}} information required in a Reserve declaration under the NI 43-101 exceeds {{that within the}} <b>JORC</b> <b>Code,</b> primarily by stipulating that certain geological parameters of the mineral reserve must be presented within a report, published in full, and presented in a particular way. Conversely, JORC Compliant technical reports are not commonly published in full upon the Australian Stock Exchange as this is not required by Australian regulatory authorities. Therefore, often {{a summary of the}} key points is published, which can often preserve commercially sensitive information, and often this could allow deleterious information to remain out of the public forum.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, NI 43-101 and <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> {{technical}} reports are considered inter-changeable {{and may be}} accepted by either regulatory body in cases of dual listed entities and, indeed, are accepted as the de facto industry reporting standard by many other jurisdictions which lack similar rigorous reporting standards or internationally recognized industry professional bodies. The LSE, for instance, accepts CPRs, Qualified Person's Reports (QPRs), and Mineral Resource Statements, compiled using JORC, SAMREC and SAMVAL, or NI 43-101, when accompanied by a NI51-101 Valuation Form, for listing on the LSE. Likewise, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange accepts reports prepared in accordance with NI 43-101,SAMREC or JORC.|$|E
50|$|The National Instrument 43-101 is broadly {{comparable}} to the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (<b>JORC</b> <b>Code)</b> which regulates the publication of mineral exploration reports on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).

The reporting codes are, however, not entirely congruent in practice, in that NI 43-101 is more prescriptive {{in terms of the}} manner in which mineral exploration reporting is presented, although the content of the technical reports, and the scientific rigors to which the mineral resource classifications within them are put, are often very similar.|$|E

The Government published reserve figures for its major PGM holdings at the Norilsk Nickel complex in 2005. Based on an independent audit carried out by Micon International Co. Ltd. according to the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (<b>JORC)</b> <b>Code,</b> Norilsk Nickel’s reserves of combined proven and probable reserves of all six platinum group elements (iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium and ruthenium) at Norilsk Nickel’s holdings in East Siberia as of December 31, 2004, were reported to be 81.791 million troy ounces. Proven and probable reserves were reported to be 62.183 million troy ounces of palladium and 15.993 million troy ounces of platinum with ore grades that ranged from 5.5 grams per metric ton (g/t) to 11.1 g/t. Measured and indicated mineral resources were reported to be an additional 141 million troy ounces of palladium and 40 million troy ounces of platinum. These reserves are adequate for Norilsk Nickel to maintain current levels of palladium and platinum production for more than 20 years.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 20,000 Russian mineral {{deposits}} {{have been}} explored, {{and more than}} one-third of these have been mined. The Ministry of Natural Resources cited serious problems in the sector, which included the depletion of reserves and the low discovery rate of new reserves. The system of reporting reserves in the Soviet Union (and which Russia very often employed for its resource reporting) was based on establishing drilling parameters to ascertain the certainty of reserves. Unlike the method used in market economy countries, this method does not include the use of market-based economic criteria to establish the feasibility of developing these resources using current technology at prevailing market conditions. Thus, reserve data based on the Soviet method cannot be compared to market economy definitions of reserves. Furthermore, Soviet data on reserves for many mineral resources was either kept secret or was difficult to obtain, and {{the same holds true for}} Russian mineral resource data. By 2005, however, Russian companies had begun to seek exposure to Western markets and stock exchanges to raise money in larger quantities and more cheaply than in Russia. A number of state secrecy laws were repealed, which has led some Russian companies to start reporting their reserves and resources according to the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (<b>JORC)</b> <b>code</b> of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.|$|E

The JORC (Joint Ore Reserves Committee) has handed down the following guidelines to the ASX which AIG News reproduces below (with kind permission).

40|$|The mining {{industry}} is {{a major contributor to}} the Australian economy. The value of mining and exploration shares traded on the Australian Stock Exchange are contingent on the estimates of mineral deposits, which are disclosed publically in accordance with a reporting code maintained by the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (the <b>JORC</b> <b>Code).</b> Expert resource geologists, known as Competent Persons, provide classified estimates of mineral endowment that underpin these public statements. The <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> requirements for qualifying as Competent Persons are membership of an approved professional association and a minimum of five years’ relevant experience. This research set out to address a primarily practical issue: How do the {{mining industry}}, mining companies and individuals cooperate to develop resource geologists with sufficient competency to provide expert recommendations for public reporting of mineral resources? A corollary to this is ‘Are the current standards sufficient to identify the competency expectations placed on Competent Persons?’ It is challenging to place the subsequent research in any one discipline as the study draws on multiple theories across multiple domains to facilitate a relevant description of the practicebased competency development. To properly understand the the practice of resource geologists operating in a sub-sector within the <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> system, the research needed to explore and consolidate diverse theories such as theories on social structures, workplace learning theories and statistical reasoning education theories. In addition, as a mixed methods study, the research draws {{on a wide range of}} tools from qualitative iterative coding and theming techniques to the more rigorous statistical tools of t-tests, paired t-tests, ANOVA and the philosophically different Rasch Analysis method. This study reflects a broad curiosity in diverse concepts and theories that is combined with the researcher’s desire to provide a meaningful practical contribution to the mining industry. The practical outcome of this research is a revised set of criteria to meet Competent Persons status under the <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> that is supported by a competency development model. These models are generalised to reflect a revised competency model, based on the dual expectations of practice exposure and reasoning ability, and an associated competency development model, which synthesises contributions of workplace learning experiences. The contributions to the theory include a revised theory of workplace learning networks emerging from the practice context of transient professional workers. These networks are enduring, transient and egocentric and operate beyond organisational confines...|$|E

40|$|Estimation {{of mineral}} {{resources}} and reserves with low values of error {{is essential in}} mineral exploration. The {{aim of this study}} is to estimate and model a vein type copper deposit using ordinary kriging method. After studying of variograms in different directions it was found out that the ore deposit has no anisotropy. The best fitted variogram model was considered for ordinary kriging estimation. Cross-validation was used to evaluate the accuracy of the variogram model for kriging. After trial and error a variogram with the best summary statistics was chosen. Model consists of a pure nugget effect with 0, 30 amplitude plus a spherical scheme with sill 1. 10 and range 30 m. The cross validation results showed that the correlation coefficient between estimated and real data was 0. 829. The resource was classified based on calculated estimation errors by <b>JORC</b> <b>code.</b> Results showed that ordinary kriging can be used to model and estimate the vein type deposit. Consequently a three dimensional model of estimated value and error estimated value was provided by ordinary kriging to divide the ore into an economic and uneconomic part...|$|E
40|$|The Code of Joint Ore Resources Committee (the <b>JORC</b> <b>Code)</b> {{is widely}} adopted be mining {{industry}} for the compiling of mineral resources and reserves reporting. The results of information transfer from one system to another {{will depend on}} the nature of deposit and complexness of its geological construction of mineral extraction tax base. The basis for placing the resources on the State Balance Sheet in Russian Federation are the opinion letters of the state expert appraisal bodies, according to which, the licenses are granted to the users of subsurface resources. For the purpose of taxation, the chapter 26 of the Tax Code of Russian Federation accepted the “multicomponent complex ores”. However, this term is interpreted in different ways, which complicates the definition of the taxation objects. The author of this article proposed to state the whole list of minerals, in the production license. It is proposed to exclude the “multicomponent complex ores ” term from the chapter 26 of the Tax Code of Russian Federation, for the purpose of non-admission of interpretation of this term in different ways.

40|$|The often complex, erratic, and {{localized}} {{nature of}} gold {{is a common}} feature of many vein-style gold deposits. This style of mineralization {{is often referred to}} as being nuggety or possessing a high-nugget effect. As a result of these complexities resource estimation is difficult and in general, only Exploration Results can be provided or an Inferred Mineral Resource estimated from surface drilling data alone. Underground development, further drilling, and probably bulk sampling will be required to delineate Indicated and Measured Resources. Tonnages can generally be estimated from diamond drill and development information with a reasonable degree of confidence. Grade is much more difficult to define with confidence because it is commonly highly erratic and discontinuous in nature. The dependency of higher confidence Resource categories on development information may create a Catch 22 situation, with funding for such development often depending on the prior definition of at least Indicated Resources. There are no easy solutions to these challenges posed by high-nugget effect deposits, and it is important when classifying and reporting not to downplay the uncertainties often associated with Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates for such deposits. However, in common with all deposit types, if the principles that underpin the estimation, classification, and reporting procedures are borne in mind and common sense applied, most issues can be satisfactorily resolved. This paper discusses the classification and reporting of Mineral Resources for high-nugget effect gold vein deposits within the framework of the <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> (JORC, 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of the CRISCO family of International reporting Codes {{is a response to}} a number of mining industry “bubbles” e. g. Poseidon Nickel Boom and Bust of 1969 / 70 and Bre-X Scandal of 1997. Although the USA and Australians had started developing their codes (1988 and 1989 respectively), the international initiative to standardise reporting definitions for mineral resources and mineral reserves began at the 15 th Council of Mining and Metallurgical Institutions (CMMI) Congress at Sun City, South Africa in 1994. The ad-hoc International Definitions Group (later to become CRIRSCO) was provided with the primary objective of developing a set of international standard definitions for the reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves. Deliberations continued with agreement being reached for the definitions of the two major categories, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, and their respective sub-categories Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, and Proved and Probable Mineral Reserves under the Denver Accord in 1997. Following these agreements, an updated version of the <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> was released in Australia in 1999 and the first SAMREC Code was issued in 2000. In 2002, the Combined Reserves International Reporting Standards Committee (CRIRSCO, now known as the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards) was formed, replacing the CMMI International Definitions Group, with the mission to continue coordination between member countries of the {{development of}} international standards for the definition and reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. Subsequently various other codes have been developed based on the CRIRSCO template. These now include eight national representative organisations (NROs); namely Australasia (JORC), Canada (CIM), Chile (National Committee), Europe (National Committee PERC), Mongolia (MPIGM), Russia (NAEN), South Africa (SAMREC) and the USA (SME). The combined value of mining companies listed on the stock exchanges of these countries accounts for more than 80 % of the listed capital of the mining industry (CRIRSCO website) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this master thesis is to develop {{geometric}} and qualimetric 3 D-models the Hessjø deposit, located in Holtålen, Norway, using data acquired in the 1970 s. This includes a thorough evaluation of the data in terms of quality and applicability to 3 D-modelling, a comparison between geostatistics and implicit modelling, in addition to performing a qualitative resource classification of the deposit with regards to drillhole spacing and data quality. The depositional and deformational history of the Hessjø deposit has also been reviewed. The modelling and data evaluation will focus on lens A of the deposit. The 3 D implicit modelling software Leapfrog Geo {{has been used to}} generate the geometric and qualimetric models of the deposit. When the geostatistical method of kriging is implemented as an interpolation, it is known as dual kriging, which is comparable to the Fast Radial Basis Functions used in implicit modelling. Examples of drillhole spacing from feasibility studies that are JORC compliant are presented, together with the primary <b>JORC</b> <b>Code</b> principals. By reviewing relevant literature, the Hessjø deposit is inferred to be a Cu-Zn-type VMS deposit, of a likely bimodal-mafic subclassification, and shows signs of characteristic zonation patterns inherent to VMS deposits. It is located within the Fundsjø Group, which has been proposed to have been deposited in an immature arc/marginal basin setting. Lens A in the Hessjø deposit has been subjected to deformation and upper greenschist-facies metamorphism. The data inherent to the Hessjø deposit is partially incomplete, and of questionable quality. Through the evaluation of the data, necessary modifications and assumptions were made, prior to the generation of the geometric model of lens A together with the surrounding geology. The results from the qualimetric modelling of lens A showed that, when applying various cut-off values, the output volumes of especially zinc, were significantly lowered. The block modelling provided mean grade estimates of copper and zinc at values of 0. 92 % and 1. 19 %, respectively, which is significantly lower than the historical estimates. As the data from the Hessjø deposit is of questionable quality, it is unlikely that it could be classified as anything higher than an Exploration Target or Inferred Resource in terms of the JORC standards and classification scheme...|$|E
