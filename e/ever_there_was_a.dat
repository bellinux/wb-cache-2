She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
500|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft's {{most popular}} {{book in the}} 1790s. It sold well and was {{reviewed}} positively by most critics.

500|$|In his Wisden obituary, Jardine was {{described}} as one of England's best captains, while Jack Hobbs rated him the second best captain after Percy Fender.

During the tour, Megadeth played Rust in Peace in its entirety. Prior {{to the start of the}} tour, original bassist Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. In an interview for Classic Rock, he stated that Shawn Drover contacted him, informing him that bassist LoMenzo was leaving the band, saying [...] "if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> time for you and Dave [...] to talk, now is it".|$|E
500|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft's {{most popular}} {{book in the}} 1790s—it sold well and was {{reviewed}} favorably by most critics. Wollstonecraft's future husband, philosopher William Godwin, wrote: [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears {{to me to be}} the book." [...] It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic. While the book initially inspired readers to travel to Scandinavia, it failed to retain its popularity after the publication of Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1798, which revealed Wollstonecraft's unorthodox private life.|$|E
500|$|Herriman died in {{his sleep}} in his home near Hollywood on April 25, 1944, after a long illness. An incompletely inked penciling of a week's worth of daily strips was found on his drawing board. On his death certificate, {{the cause of death}} was listed as [...] "non-alcoholic {{cirrhosis}} of the liver", and despite his mixed-race heritage, he was listed as [...] "caucasian". The New York Journal-American ran a front-page obituary. His funeral at Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Memorial Park was attended by few. [...] Cartoonist Harry Hershfield spoke at the funeral, saying, [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> saint on earth, it was George Herriman". According to his request, his body was cremated and his remains were scattered over Monument Valley.|$|E

500|$|Seltzer and the Press later {{received}} harsh {{criticism for}} their {{handling of the}} case. Federal district judge Carl A. Weinmann, in his 1964 ruling that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial, partially blamed the media, particularly the Press: [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> trial by newspaper, {{this is a perfect}} example. And the most insidious example was the Cleveland Press. For some reason that newspaper took upon itself the role of accuser, judge and jury". The United States Supreme Court ruled on June 6, 1966 in Sheppard v. Maxwell that Sheppard did not receive a fair trial because of the negative publicity he received in the press. F. Lee Bailey, one of Sheppard's lawyers, later wrote that [...] "Seltzer used his newspaper like a club, ordering politicians around like minions and intimidating everyone who disagreed with him. If Seltzer was roused, he would spread a personally penned editorial across eight columns of his newspaper, seeking to grind some unfortunate dissident under his heel".|$|E
500|$|The {{line was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics and Stefani was appreciated for taking fashion seriously {{even though she}} is a celebrity. Fern Mallis of IMG praised the line and Stefani as well and said, [...] "the L.A.M.B. line is clearly at the top of these lines and is as unique and individual as Gwen herself." [...] The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, [...] " ... these shoes aren't for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani's music and fashion - sense." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "L.A.M.B.'s embellished tracksuits, Rasta-inspired knits, and gaucho-heel combos deliver the edge" [...] Nicole Phelps of Style.com said, [...] "The collection, which looked like the sixties as seen by someone {{who grew up in the}} eighties, was altogether more wearable and on trend." [...] Fashion journalist Cathy Horyn of The New York Times differed and said, [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reason for a pop star to concentrate on her vocal skills, it was Gwen Stefani's fashion meltdown." ...|$|E
500|$|Gradually, Wollstonecraft {{returned}} to her literary life, becoming involved with Joseph Johnson's circle again, in particular with Mary Hays, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears {{to me to be}} the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration." [...] Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, they moved into two adjoining houses, known as The Polygon, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.|$|E

500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now... if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> time when it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now." [...] The members of the populist Tea Party movement have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.|$|E

2500|$|On March 27, 2014, Hakamada was {{released}} from prison and granted a retrial by the Shizuoka District Court. A statement from the court said there was reason to believe evidence had been fabricated in the original trial and that keeping the 78-year-old jailed while waiting on the retrial would have been [...] "unbearably unjust". Amnesty International remarked, [...] "Time is running out for Hakamada to receive the fair trial he was denied more than four decades ago. If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> case that merits a retrial, this is it." [...] A prosecution appeal of the decision to release Hakamada was denied. [...] Hakamada is the sixth Japanese death row inmate to be granted a retrial. [...] Four of the previous five were eventually acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|Godwin {{first met}} Mary Wollstonecraft {{at the home}} of their mutual publisher. Joseph Johnson was hosting a dinner for another of his authors, Thomas Paine, and Godwin remarked years later that on that evening he heard too little of Paine and too much of Wollstonecraft; he did not see her again for some years. In the interim, Wollstonecraft had lived in France to witness the Revolution for herself, and had had a child, Fanny Imlay, with an American adventurer. In pursuit of Gilbert Imlay's {{business}} affairs, Wollstonecraft had travelled to Scandinavia, and soon afterwards published a book based on the voyage. Godwin read it, and later wrote that [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book." ...|$|E

The show was debuted in a preview on September 18, 1993, and officially premiered the following morning, to join Nickelodeon's Sunday morning animation block. On September 18, the series' first night of airing, Rocko's Modern Life received a 3.0 in ratings. By January 31, 1994 the series' audience grew by 65%. Rocko's Modern Life {{was at the time}} the network's highest-rated cartoon launch <b>ever.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> brief period in 1993 when the network received numerous complaints from members of a religious group that Ren & Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life were too adult-oriented to be shown to kids on Sunday mornings. They wanted the shows moved to a different time slot. The network was polite but did not make the programming change.|$|E

[...] It featured fifteen new songs. Strait's long-time friend and songwriter, Dean Dillon co-wrote two of the songs on the album. It received generally positive reviews from critics. People, in their four-star review, remarked that [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> natural in country music, it's Strait," [...] while USA Today raved that [...] "he continues to make such consistent quality look easy".

2500|$|Leigh's cricketing {{career and}} first class stats might be {{considered}} average {{but he was a}} popular choice as President of the MCC in its first centenary year in 1887 and the Golden Jubilee year of Queen Victoria.

[...] "I will say that the old cricketer stood up bravely in bumpy grounds in spite of awkward knocks and ugly bruises." [...] Wisden acknowledged him as an excellent [...] "long-stop" [...] who [...] "will let a ball go through him rather than by him" [...] and his style of batting was awkward, but he is a fine hitter forward and to leg.
