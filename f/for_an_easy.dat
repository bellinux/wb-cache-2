5|$|Saladin {{launched}} his last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> victory over a presumably demoralized Mas'ud, but failed {{due to the}} city's unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas'ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, but under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|Tracy is an overachieving {{high school}} junior, {{preparing}} <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> {{election to the}} office of student body president after three years of extracurricular toil. Her assumptions of an unopposed victory are dashed when two unexpected challengers enter the race: friendly and popular athlete Paul Metzler, sidelined from the football team by a skiing accident, and Paul's younger adopted sister Tammy, a moody, sarcastic rebel. Paul has been coaxed into running by election supervisor Jim McAllister, a well-liked civics teacher nursing a deep resentment towards Tracy since her affair with Jim's best friend and fellow teacher cost the man his job and family.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking {{the lead in the}} straight apparently poised <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E
5|$|Anchored by {{defensive}} stalwart Russell, {{the tough}} Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either {{passed it on}} to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> slam dunk or layup. Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later succeeded in by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and rebounding champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.|$|E
5|$|The story depicts how {{suffering}} {{is essential to}} completing one's destiny. Southey's purpose in Thalaba, however, is to describe {{as many of the}} various myths and superstitions that he can, and this interferes with the resolving of moral problems within the story. Instead, the moral lessons are formulaic and the events focus on awards given to those who are obedient. Southey's emphasis on the actual mythic incidents over the moral events are backed up with more than 80 pages of his own notes that describe the various references to traditional myths or mythic creatures that are incorporated into the story. In terms of structure, the unilateral plot keeps Thalaba does not allow <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> flow into various mythic incidents. Instances of the plot being supplanted by the myths can be found during the descriptions of the story of Irem, Haruth and Maruth, or others.|$|E

25|$|In a {{time when}} defense was defined as “an individual's effort to stop or stymie the {{opposing}} team's counterpart”, Toyota's playing style {{was considered one of}} the most glamorous and worthy to watch. With team defense hardly known back then, Toyota was a typical run-and-gun team that depended heavily on their rebounding prowess. Hence, when you have an Andrew Fields, Bruce King, John Irving, Abe King, Ramon Fernandez and even a Bobby Jaworski collaring the rebounds, the most common (and very entertaining) spectacle was to see a baseball pass by the rebounder to a streaking player on the break <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> twinner. Notables among the recipients of the baseball pass over the years in the Toyota lineup included Segura, Cortez, Tuadles, Arnaiz, and Legaspi. In the halfcourt, it was not uncommon to see a similar play that Fernandez and Jaworski employed in the recent Crispa-Toyota reunion game where Fernandez would post up, Jaworski would stay at the top of the arc and wait for Fernandez to be double-teamed. Once the double team is consummated, Jaworski either waits at the 3 point line or makes a straight cut in the middle of the lanes waiting for the blind pass of Fernandez <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> two. Another common sight was to see Jaworski mapping out the play, cuts in the middle and makes the interior defense commit to him. He then throws a behind-the-back blind pass to cutting slotmen like Fernandez or King <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> layup or throws it back to good buddy Arnaiz for a long range bomb shot from the arc. Hence, it wasn't a surprise to see Jaworski, Arnaiz and Fernandez (in that order) being the first 3 PBA players to dish off 2,000 assists in their careers.|$|E
25|$|The orange-spotted {{trevally}} has {{a silvery}} grey- to brassy-coloured body, becoming paler to a silvery white ventrally. Many conspicuous orange to yellow spots {{occur on the}} sides of the fish, giving the species its name, and make <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> way to identify the fish in the field. An entirely yellow variant has been reported, although the fish is thought to be able to rapidly change between its normal colour configuration and this colour. The colour of the fins ranges from hyaline to lemon yellow, and no dark opercular spot is present.|$|E
25|$|According to Pina, the Portuguese {{spent about}} a week raising a {{fortified}} siege camp on a hill west of Tangier. In a decision that was later to prove fateful, Henry ordered that the palisade protecting the Portuguese siege camp encircle the camp completely. This went against King Edward's advice to ensure the palisade extended down to the beach, to offer the Portuguese besiegers protected access to the anchored ships. But given the unpopularity of the expedition, Henry probably calculated {{it was necessary to}} deprive the reluctant Portuguese levies of the temptation <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> retreat back to the ships.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{response}} to a bouncer is for the batsman simply to duck underneath it, but this requires fast reflexes and a strong nerve and the batsman is sometimes hit in any case. The natural reflex is to attempt to defend one's head with a straight bat but this should be suppressed if possible as the likely result {{of this will be}} that the ball flies off the bat at an uncontrolled angle making <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> catch. Most batsman have panicked and lost their wickets in this fashion several times in their career after prolonged spells of bouncers.|$|E

25|$|It seemed Hunt was on <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> win, but as {{the track}} began to dry he started to lose positions. He only needed a fourth place to win the title, because of Lauda's retirement. On lap 62 Hunt fell behind Depailler and Andretti, but two laps later Depailler's left rear tyre started to deflate {{and he had to}} pit. Andretti took the lead, but then Hunt had a similar tyre problem. Hunt pitted, dropped to fifth and set off after Depailler, Alan Jones and Regazzoni. Depailler overtook both drivers on lap 70 and on the next lap Hunt did the same and won the World Drivers' Championship, to his surprise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), {{and other}} related architectures, enjoy a growing {{popularity}} {{in the field of}} Data Mining. These neural network algorithms provide a topology-preserving mapping from high-dimensional data to a lower dimension, which allows <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> interpretation of complex data. For visualisation of trained maps, a lot of different techniques have been developed. However, convenient and practical methods for describing the (normally) rectangular maps have not yet been subject of intensive research, and are still missing. In this paper, new shapes for self organising architectures, which allows <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> explanation, will be presented. These map layouts are oriented on shapes well-known to readers, as for example country or continent maps, or geometrical shapes. ...|$|R

25|$|India's {{fortunes}} {{were immediately}} endangered after a stunning defeat to the underdogs Bangladesh in its opening group match. Sourav Ganguly top-scored with 66, {{but he was}} criticised for scoring at a slow run rate. Although Indian batsmen amassed more than 400 runs <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> win over the newcomers Bermuda in their second match, Ganguly scoring 87, the media still severely criticised the team leadership and the players. India faced a must-win situation as it faced-off against Sri Lanka in its final group match. Sri Lanka scored more than 250 runs to set a challenging target for the Indian batting order, which failed dramatically. For all practical purposes, India's World Cup campaign ended with its defeat to Sri Lanka, {{although it was not}} formally eliminated until Bangladesh achieved its predicted victory over Bermuda in the final group match.|$|E
25|$|Len Hutton (80) and Bill Edrich (20) saw England {{though to}} stumps {{and took the}} score to 60 the next morning before the first wicket fell. Cowdrey (79) added 99 with Hutton looking certain for a century before he smashed the ball into Alan Davidson's back, where it lobbed up <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy,</b> if painful, catch. Colin Cowdrey and Denis Compton (44) took the score to 230/3 {{by the end of}} the day and England were {{confident}} of a first innings lead, but they both fell early next morning and though the lower middle order all got going the tail collapsed again and the last four wickets fell for 20 runs and the last seven wickets for 111. Still 341 was England's highest score so far in the series and gave them a slim 18 run lead, the leg-spinner Richie Benaud (4/120) doing most of the work.|$|E

However, he {{was caught up in}} a multiple bike collision at the start in Barcelona, missing the restart and losing championship ground to Hayden. Though he was knocked out in this horrendous looking accident, he did not suffer serious injuries beyond significant bruising. He returned for the next round, but a run of less competitive results saw him slip to fifth in the standings before the race at Brno. He started second, took the lead at the start, and pulled away from the field <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> victory. He attributed this to a late setup change that the team believed could be applied to the bike at all circuits. He moved up in the championship standings to finish third overall, after taking second at the final race behind stand-in teammate Troy Bayliss.|$|E
