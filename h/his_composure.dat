5|$|Agent Lang visits Mahone {{and offers}} him a deal: {{eight years in}} a St. Louis prison in {{exchange}} for testifying against {{the government in the}} Lincoln Burrows conspiracy, or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate. Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed Shales, and that guilt made him turn to drugs. Because he is unable to maintain <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> while testifying, Mahone's testimony is dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, he saw {{his first}} combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta, from Filipino rebels known as Insurrectos. In the initial moments of the assault, his first {{sergeant}} was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> and led his Marines {{in pursuit of the}} fleeing enemy. By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E

After a slow ascent through {{the lower levels of}} the Phillies' minor league system, he made his MLB debut in 2007, and {{was a member of the}} starting rotation of the 2008 World Series Champion team.|$|E
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose <b>his</b> <b>composure.</b> In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010â€“11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when they watch him play.|$|E

5|$|Tanev {{played a}} major role in the 2016 IIHF World Championships team which {{captured}} gold against Finland. He was praised for <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> and defensive play by Team Canada head coach Bill Peters, and was named the best player of the game in Canada's 7-1 victory over Hungary. In the tournament semifinal versus the United States, Tanev robbed a scoring chance from the Americans late in the third period, which would have resulted in the tying goal. After accidentally breaking his stick in the American zone, he raced back to the Canadian end, intercepting a pass and blocking a shot without the use of his stick.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he {{essentially}} functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him {{to hold up the}} ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E

He later visits her at the hotel, and she shares her disappointment with her friends and followers on social media for having abandoned her. She commends Shiv for <b>his</b> <b>composure,</b> as he explains the five stages of grief to her.|$|E

5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert. Arrogant and overconfident, he soon cracks {{under the}} stress of the failed {{incursion}} into the Alien hive. Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain <b>his</b> <b>composure.</b> He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through a floor grate by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E
5|$|Rivera is {{regarded}} within baseball {{as one of}} the most dominant relievers in major league history. Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25games in 15consecutive seasons and posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21ERA and 1.00WHIP are the lowest in the live-ball era among qualified pitchers. Fellow players credit him with popularizing the cut fastball across the major leagues. Along with his signature pitch, Rivera was known for his precise control, smooth pitching motion, and for <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> and reserved demeanor on the field. In 2013, the Yankees retired his uniform number 42; he was the last major league player to wear the number full-time, following its league-wide retirement in honor of Jackie Robinson. Rivera has been involved in philanthropic causes and the Christian community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. He is considered to be a strong candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame once he is eligible.|$|E
5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling and his ability to read the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.|$|E

5|$|Although not gifted with pace, stamina, physicality or notable {{defensive}} skills, work-rate, or tackling abilities, Pirlo {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> in possession, and drew praise for his touch, technique, balance, close control, and dribbling ability, {{as well as his}} flair and creativity in beating players with feints during one-on-one situations, in order to retain the ball and create space. As a playmaker, he is highly regarded by pundits for his outstanding vision, awareness, and football intelligence, as well as his movement, inventive play, anticipation, ability to read the game, and his wide range of distribution, which enabled him to play the ball first time and rarely relinquish possession, even when put under pressure; in addition to being capable of playing precise, short exchanges to teammates, he was also known for frequently attempting riskier and more difficult passes and is renowned in particular for his extremely accurate long-range passing, both on the ground or in the air, with either foot, despite being naturally right footed. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best passers in the history of the sport, and is also known for his accurate striking ability from distance. These characteristics allowed him to contribute to his team's offensive play with goals and assists.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Waters {{suggested}} a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd â€“ The Wall. With {{the onset of}} the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining <b>his</b> <b>composure.</b> After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His preferred position was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4â€“4â€“2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able to play in this free role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for <b>his</b> <b>composure</b> in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick technique was described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking technique was thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or even just outside the area, and to have the ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E

The fight was awarded Fight of the Night honours.|$|E

Misbah holds the record of the fastest test half century and shares the record for second fastest test century with Sir Vivian Richards.|$|E
