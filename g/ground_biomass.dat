2500|$|This {{high rate}} of {{decomposition}} {{is the result of}} phosphorus levels in the soils, precipitation, high temperatures and the extensive microorganism communities. In addition to the bacteria and other microorganisms, there are an abundance of other decomposers such as fungi and termites that aid in the process as well. Nutrient recycling is important because below ground resource availability controls the above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> and community structure of tropical rainforests. These soils are typically phosphorus limited, which inhibits net primary productivity or the uptake of carbon. The soil contains microbial organisms such as bacteria, which break down leaf litter and other organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon usable by plants through a process called decomposition. During the decomposition process the microbial community is respiring, taking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. The decomposition rate can be evaluated by measuring the uptake of oxygen. High temperatures and precipitation increase decomposition rate, which allows plant litter to rapidly decay in tropical regions, releasing nutrients that are immediately taken up by plants [...] through surface or ground waters. [...] The seasonal patterns in respiration are controlled by leaf litter fall and precipitation, the driving force moving the decomposable carbon from the litter to the soil. Respiration rates are highest early in the wet season because the recent dry season results in a large percentage of leaf litter and thus a higher percentage of organic matter being leached into the soil.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} {{environmental benefit}} of greens roofs {{is the ability}} to sequester carbon. Carbon is the main component of plant matter and is naturally absorbed by plant tissue. The carbon is stored in the plant tissue and the soil substrate through plant litter and root exudates. A study on green roofs in Michigan and Maryland found the above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> and below ground substrate stored on average between 168 g C m−2 and 107 g C m−2 [...] Variations occurred among the different species of plant used. [...] Substrate carbon content averaged 913 g C m−2 and after the subtraction of the original carbon content the total sequestration was 378 g C m−2. The sequestration can be improved by changing plant species, increasing substrate depth, substrate composition, and management practices. In a study done in Michigan above ground sequestration ranged from 64 g C m−2 to 239 g C m−2 for S. acre and S album. Also, by increasing the substrate depth would allow for more area of carbon storage and diversify the types of plants with greater potential of carbon storage. The direct carbon sequestration techniques and methods can be measured and accounted for. Green roofs also indirectly reduce CO2 given off by power plants through their ability to insulate buildings. Buildings in the US account for 38% of the total carbon dioxide emissions. A model supported by the U.S. Department of Energy found a 2 percent reduction in electricity consumption and 9-11% reduction in natural gas when implementing green roofs.|$|E

40|$|Open Access Journal; Published online: June 15, 2017 Tropical montane forests {{provide an}} {{important}} natural laboratory to test ecological theory. While it is well-known that {{some aspects of}} forest structure change with altitude, little is known {{on the effects of}} altitude on above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> (AGB), particularly with regard to changing height-diameter allometry. To address this we investigate (1) the effects of altitude on height-diameter allometry, (2) how different height-diameter allometric models affect above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> estimates; and (3) how other forest structural, taxonomic and environmental attributes affect above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> using 30 permanent sample plots (1 -ha; all trees ≥ 10 cm diameter measured) established between 1250 and 2600 m asl in Kahuzi Biega National Park in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Forest structure and species composition differed with increasing altitude, with four forest types identified. Different height-diameter allometric models performed better with the different forest types, as trees got smaller with increasing altitude. Above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> ranged from 168 to 290 Mg ha- 1, but {{there were no significant differences}} in AGB between forests types, as tree size decreased but stem density increased with increasing altitude. Forest structure had greater effects on above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> than forest diversity. Soil attributes (K and acidity, pH) also significantly affected above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass.</b> Results show how forest structural, taxonomic and environmental attributes affect above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> in African tropical montane forests. They particularly highlight that the use of regional height-diameter models introduces significant biases in above <b>ground</b> <b>biomass</b> estimates, and that different height-diameter models might be preferred for different forest types, and these should be considered in future studies.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, the crop simulator CropSyst was evaluated against crop data collected on rice varieties grown in Northern Italy. The need of model re-parameterization became apparent after investigating new field data, as inconsistencies in the simulation of {{leaf area index}} emerged for Indica-type varieties. Key parameters (specific leaf area, stem-leaf partition, extinction coefficient, light-to-biomass conversion efficiency) derived from field measurements (respectively, 27 m 2 kg- 1, 3. 6 m 2 kg- 1, 0. 53, 3. 2 g MJ- 1) considerably differed from those previously obtained via calibration (39 m 2 kg- 1, 1. 5 m 2 kg- 1, 0. 50, 3. 0 g MJ- 1). Such new parameters are informative for suitable modelling of rice systems. The agreement between simulated and observed above <b>ground</b> <b>biomasses</b> was similar with both parameter sets: average general standard deviation = 25 % (previous) and 26 % (new); average modelling efficiency = 0. 90 (previous) and 0. 87 (new). Such comparisons demonstrate as the accumulation of aerial biomass in crop models can be depicted in different ways and reasonable estimations {{can be achieved by}} different pathways (not all acceptable). A check on parameters like the one performed here (field measurements versus calibrated parameters) is worth to give protection against spurious conclusions while indicating whether the parameterization is conceptually consistent and related to reality.

40|$|Significant {{amounts of}} plant biomass and fixed N are {{incorporated}} into soil as roots, nodules and root exudates during the growth of grass-clover, which consequently is exposed to soil microbial degradation when the field is ploughed. This has major implications for {{our understanding of the}} potential contributions of legumes in the N economics and losses in grass-clover cropping systems. We have studied the effects of grass-clover pasture age and cutting frequency (simulated grazing) {{on the development of the}} above ground as well as the below <b>ground</b> plant <b>biomass,</b> with emphasis on below-harvest contribution to the total N 2 fixation. ...|$|R
50|$|Zostera novazalendica {{relies on}} {{photosynthesis}} for “food”. The species growth habits {{are restricted to}} {{where it can be}} provided with sunlight. Photosynthesis is “the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water.” However, the loss of photosynthetic tissue has been proven to not have any significant negative effect on patch expansion. The species can recover from loss of photosynthetic tissue, because a significant portion of its total <b>biomass</b> rests below <b>ground.</b> This <b>biomass</b> acts as a nutrient store and rapidly produces new shoots in response to the loss.|$|R
