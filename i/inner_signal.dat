The present study sought to explore the beneficial effects of the peonidin, a common aglycone form of anthocyanin, on the MNU induced photoreceptor degeneration via topographic measurements. Methods: The MNU administrated mouse received peonidin or vehicle injections, and then they were examined by electroretinography (ERG), multi electrode array (MEA), histological and immunohistochemistry studies. Results: The protective effects of peonidin on the MNU administrated retinas were systematically verified and quantified by topographic measures. The peonidin treatment could protect the photoreceptor against the MNU toxicity both functionally and morphologicaly. The most sensitive zone to peonidin therapy was sorted out, indicating that different rescuing kinetics existed between the retinal hemispheres and retinal quadrants. Moreover, the hyperactive spontaneous firing response and the debilitated light induced response in MNU administrated retinas could be partially reversed by peonidin treatment. To our knowledge, this was the first study to explore the pharmacological effects of peonidin on the electrophysiological {{properties of}} <b>inner</b> visual <b>signal</b> pathways.

40|$|We {{introduce}} new spatial filtering methods in the spherical harmonics domain for constraining magnetoencephalographic (MEG) multichannel measurements to user-specified sphericalregions of interests (ROI) inside the head. The main {{idea of the}} spatial filtering is to emphasize those signals arising from an ROI, while suppressing the signals coming from outsidethe ROI. We exploit a well-known method called the signal space separation (SSS), whichcan decompose MEG data into a signal component generated by neurobiological sourcesand a noise component generated by external sources outside the head. The novel methodspresented in this work, expanded SSS (exSSS) and generalized expanded SSS (genexSSS) utilize a beamspace optimization criterion in order to linearly transform the <b>inner</b> <b>signal</b> SSScoefficients to represent the sources belonging to the ROI. The filters mainly depend on theradius {{and the center of}} the ROI. The simplicity of the derived formulations of our methodsstems from the natural appropriateness to spherical domain and orthogonality properties ofthe SSS basis functions that are intimately related to the vector spherical harmonics.

40|$|A {{biological}} signal is transmitted by interactions between signaling molecules in the cell. To date, {{there have been}} extensive studies regarding signaling pathways using numerical simulation of kinetic equations {{that are based on}} equations of continuity and Fick's law. To obtain a mathematical formulation of cell signaling, we propose a stability kinetic model of cell {{biological signal}}ing of a simple two-parameter model based on the kinetics of the diffusion-limiting step. In the present model, the signaling is regulated by the binding of a cofactor, such as ATP. Non-linearity of the kinetics is given by the diffusion fluctuation in the interaction between signaling molecules, which is different from previous works that hypothesized autocatalytic reactions. Numerical simulations showed the presence of a critical concentration of the cofactor beyond which the cell signaling molecule concentration is altered in a chaos-like oscillation with frequency, which is similar to a discontinuous phase transition in physics. Notably, we found that the frequency is given by the logarithm function of the difference of the outside cofactor concentration from the critical concentration. This implies that the outside alteration of the cofactor concentration is transformed into the oscillatory alteration of cell <b>inner</b> <b>signaling.</b> Further, mathematical stability kinetic analysis predicted a discontinuous dynamic phase transition in the critical state at which the cofactor concentration is equivalent to the critical concentration. In conclusion, the present model illustrates a unique feature of cell signaling, and the stability analysis may provide an analytical framework of the cell signaling system and a novel formulation of biological signaling...|$|R

The sites of signals, however, do not represent {{the activity of the}} gene transcription in the nuclei. To differentially localize genes in active and inactive states, the effect of nuclease digestion prior to in situ hybridization using PCR products of DNA fragments from human X-chromosome, as a probe DNA, was examined in female neutrophils. According to the conventional protocol for chromosomal in situ hybridization, we detected two dot signals in the nucleus. However, the use of Ca/Mg-dependent endonuclease, which extracts inactive gene DNA, resulted in the loss of the one signal of the outer region of the nucleus, but not that of the inner one. In contrast, when exogenous DNase I, which extracts active gene DNA, was used in place of Ca/Mg-dependent endonuclease, the <b>inner</b> <b>signal,</b> but not the outer one, was almost lost in neutrophils. Considering that the outer signal represents inactive X-chromosome DNA in the site of female neutrophil nuclei, these results indicate that the use of our modified protocol may enable us to discriminate the signals of active and inactive genes in interphase cells by in situ hybridization...|$|E

On the MR images, {{the characteristics of the}} Baker’s cysts, meniscal tears, and the quantity of joint effusions were evaluated.

The cell membrane is precisely described {{thanks to a}} level set function, whose motion is due to specific signalling pathways. The aim is to model the chemical interactions between the cell and its environment, {{in the process of}} invadopodia or pseudopodia formation. The model consists of Laplace equation with Dirichlet condition inside the cell coupled to Laplace equation with Neumann condition in the outer domain. The actin polymerization is accounted for as the gradient of the <b>inner</b> <b>signal,</b> which drives the motion of the interface. We prove the well-posedness of our free boundary problem under a sign condition on the datum. This criterion ensures the consistency of the model, and provides conditions to focus on for any enrichment of the model. We then propose a new first order Cartesian finite-difference method to solve the problem. We eventually exhibit the main biological features that can be accounted for by the model: the formation of thin and elongated protrusions as for invadopodia, or larger protrusion as for pseudopodia, depending on the source term in the equation. The model provides the theoretical and numerical grounds for single cell migration modeling, whose formulation is valid in 2 D and 3 D.

The b-wave implicit time was decreased only at high stimulus intensities (> 10 − 2 cd/m). Blocking bradykinin receptors specifically decreased rod b-wave implicit time for all intensities, while its amplitude remained unaffected.

40|$|To {{measure the}} {{performance}} of electronic components when stressed by High Power Microwave signals a setup was designed and tested which allows a well-defined voltage signal to enter the component during normal operation, and to discriminate {{its effect on the}} component. The microwave signal is fed to the outside conductor of a coaxial cable and couples into the <b>inner</b> <b>signal</b> line connected to the device under test (DUT). The disturbing HF-signal is transferred almost independent from frequency to maintain the pulse shape in the time domain. The configuration designed to perform a TEM-coupling within a 50 Ohm system prevents the secondary system from feeding back to the primary system and, due to the geometrical parameters chosen, the coupling efficiency is as high as 50 – 90 %. Linear dimensions and terminations applied allow for pulses up to a width of 12 ns and up to a voltage level of 4 – 5 kV on the outside conductor. These pulse parameters proved to be sufficient to upset the DUTs tested so far. In more than 400 measurements a rectangular pulse of increasing voltage level was applied to different types of CMOS and TTL until the individual DUT was damaged. As well the pulse width (3, 6 or 12 ns) and its polarity were varied in single-shot or repetitive-shot experiments (500 shots per voltage at a repetition rate of 3 Hz). The state of the DUT was continuously monitored by measuring both the current of the DUT circuit and that of the oscillator providing the operating signal for the DUT. The results show a very good reproducibility within a set of identical samples, remarkable differences between manufacturers and lower thresholds for repetitive testing, which indicates a memory effect of the DUT to exist for voltage levels significantly below the single-shot threshold...|$|E
