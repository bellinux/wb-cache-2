40|$|SUMMARY Two-dimensional {{echocardiography}} {{can provide}} serial cross-sectional {{images of the}} left ven-tricular cavity. We examined whether such serial images from steady-state ejecting hearts would allow three-dimensional reconstruction and accurate volume estimation without major geometric assumptions. Cross-circulated, paced dog hearts were suspended in a blood-filled tank. Serial cross-sectional images were taken at 3 -mm intervals along the vertical axis. Left ventricular cavity and muscle areas of each image were planimetered with a light-pen system and summated for volume: total volume = z (areas X 3 mm). Direct left ventricular volume was measured through the cardiac cycle with a volumetric chamber connected to a balloon in the ejecting left ventricle. In six hearts, 67 separate direct volume measurements (range 9. 5 - 54. 7 ml) from various points in the cardiac cycle were compared with the simultaneous <b>echo</b> <b>volume</b> measurements. By least squares linear regression, <b>echo</b> <b>volume</b> = 1. 01 (direct volume) - 0. 44 ml; r = 0. 972, SEE = 2. 93 ml. Provided accurate cross-sectional localization is available, these studies suggest that extremely accurate steady-state left ventricular volume can be determined noninvasively in the ejecting heart from multiple cross-sectional im-ages.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} population based regional {{provision of}} echocardiography provision within New Zealand (NZ) public hospitals. The {{relationship between the}} cardiac sonographer workforce size, demographics and capacity will be explored {{to better understand the}} regional provisions. METHODS: In March 2013 surveys were distributed to 18 public hospitals with a sonographer led echocardiography service, return rate was 100 %. Questions related to sonographer workforce size and demographics, workflow processes and <b>echo</b> <b>volumes.</b> Information on District Health Board (DHB) population was obtained from government public access websites. Multivariable linear regression was performed using DHB population characteristics and workforce demographics to determine their potential contribution to echocardiogram volume. Workforce capacity was calculated from scan duration, annual scan volumes, workforce size and availability and compared to predictions using international models. RESULTS: There are 84 cardiac sonographers in NZ, 14 of them trainees. The total full-time equivalent (FTE) of cardiac sonographers is 70. 4; echo FTE was 61. 9 with 75 % of the workforce performing echo as the only component of their role. Thirty-one (44. 3 %) qualified sonographers and 10 trainees (71. 4 %) are titled cardiac sonographer or echocardiographer. Sixty-eight (81 %) cardiac sonographers have a cardiac physiology background. Thirty-five (50 %) qualified cardiac sonographers hold Australasian echo qualifications. Significant regional differences in echocardiogram volumes per 100, 000 population were seen amongst DHBs but not between surgical and regional centres (surgical median 1802, regional median 1658, p= 0. 18). There were also wide regional differences in the workforce size (FTE) per 100, 000 of population served unrelated to centre type (median 1. 4, range 0. 9 - 2. 7). In multivariable modelling, the population based scan volumes were predicted by DHB demographics (socioeconomic status, Māori/Pacific ethnicity and age) and workforce demographics (workforce size, centre type, trainee proportion). There were regional differences in both population-based clinical capacity and scan duration, with no clear relationship to centre type. The NZ workforce capacity is similar to predictions using a UK model, and consistently less than the USA model for all scan types. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates regional differences in the provision of echocardiography services in NZ by population-based <b>echo</b> <b>volumes.</b> The <b>echo</b> <b>volumes</b> are impacted by both DHB demographics and the cardiac sonographer workforce size, demographics and clinical capacity. This study also provides an update on the cardiac sonographer workforce which will be essential for planning the future growth...|$|R

40|$|Data {{from the}} Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) Integrated Project I (IP 1) network of polarimetric X-band radars {{are used to}} observe a {{convective}} storm. A fuzzy logic hydrometeor identification algorithm is employed to study microphysical processes. Dual-Doppler techniques are {{used to analyze the}} 3 D wind field. The scanning strategy, sensitivity, and low-level scanning focus of the radars are investigated for influencing bulk hydrometeor identification and dual-Doppler wind retrievals. Comparisons are made with the nearby S-band polarimetric Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) prototype radar (KOUN), for consistency. Lightning data are used as an independent indicator of storm evolution for comparison with radar observations. A new methodology for retrieving the vertical wind utilizing upward and variational integration techniques is employed and shown to illustrate trends in mean wind, with particularly good results at low levels. IP 1 observations of a case on 10 June 2007 show the development of the updraft, subsequent graupel <b>echo</b> <b>volume</b> evolution, and a descending downdraft preceded by significant graupel in the midlevels, with updraft and graupel volumes leading the onset of lightning. Many of these trends are corroborated by KOUN. The high temporal resolution of three minutes and near-ground sampling provided by IP 1 is integral to resolving upand downdrafts, as well as hydrometeor evolution. IP 1 coverage of the upper levels is diminished compared to KOUN, impacting the quality of the dual-Doppler derived vertical winds and ice <b>echo</b> <b>volumes,</b> although the low-level coverage helps to mitigate some errors. However, IP 1 coverage of the low- to midlevels is demonstrated to be comparable or better than coverage by KOUN for this storm location. 1...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{tested a}} newly {{developed}} 4 -dimensional (4 D) right ventricular (RV) analysis method for computing RV volumes for both 3 -dimensional (3 D) ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. BackgroundAsymmetry and the anatomical {{complexity of the}} RV make accurate determination of RV shape and volume difficult. MethodsThirty patients, 14 with grossly normal cardiac anatomy and 16 with major congenital heart disease, were studied at the same visit with both 3 D echocardiography (echo) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for RV size and function. Ultrasound images were acquired on a Philips 7500 system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts) with a matrix-array transducer (real-time 3 D <b>echo)</b> with full <b>volume</b> sweeps from apical and subcostal views. Sagittal, 4 -chamber, and coronal views were derived for contour detection (all 12 to 24 slices). The MR images were acquired with a 3 -T MRI magnet with segmented cine-loop gradient echo sequences in short- and rotated long-axis views to cover the RV inflow, body, and outflow tract. The RV volumes were analyzed with the new software applicable to 3 D echo MR images. ResultsNew software aided delineation of the RV free wall, tricuspid valve, RV outflow tract, and apex on 3 D <b>echo</b> <b>volumes.</b> Although there was a slightly higher variability measuring right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and volumes obtained by US compared with MRI, both imaging methods showed closely correlated results. The RVEF was measured with 4 % variability for US and 5 % variability for MRI with a correlation coefficient of r = 0. 91. The RV end-diastolic volume was measured at 70. 97 ± 15. 0 ml with 3 D US and at 70. 06 ± 14. 8 ml with MRI (r = 0. 99), end-systolic volume measured 39. 8 ± 10. 4 ml with 3 D US and 39. 1 ± 10. 2 ml with MRI (r = 0. 98).

40|$|Key {{points that}} this {{analysis}} {{will begin to}} address are: 1) What physically {{is going on in}} the cloud when there is a jump in lightning? - Updraft variations, ice fluxes. 2) How do these processes fit in with severe storm conceptual models? 3) What would this information provide an end user (i. e., the forecaster) ? - Relate LJA to radar observations, like changes in reflectivity, MESH, VIL, etc. based multi-Doppler derived physical relationships 4) How do we best transistionthis algorithm into the warning decision process. The known relationship between lightning updraft strength/volume and precipitation ice mass production can be extended to the concept of the lightning jump.

40|$|PURPOSE: The goal of {{the present}} study was to use a {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) gradient <b>echo</b> <b>volume</b> in combination with a fat-selective excitation as a 3 D motion navigator (3 D FatNav) for retrospective correction of microscopic head motion during high-resolution 3 D structural scans of extended duration. The fat excitation leads to a 3 D image that is itself sparse, allowing high parallel imaging acceleration factors - with the additional advantage of a minimal disturbance of the water signal used for the host sequence. METHODS: A 3 D FatNav was inserted into two structural protocols: an inversion-prepared gradient echo at 0. 33 [*]×[*] 0. 33 [*]× 1. 00 [*]mm resolution and a turbo spin echo at 600 μm isotropic resolution. RESULTS: Motion estimation was possible with high precision, allowing retrospective motion correction to yield clear improvements in image quality, especially in the conspicuity of very small blood vessels. CONCLUSION: The highly accelerated 3 D FatNav allowed motion correction with noticeable improvements in image quality, even for head motion which was small compared with the voxel dimensions of the host sequence.

40|$|Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS), 2012 IEEE International, 7 - 10 October 2012, Dresden The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the merit of using temporal cross-correlation between subsequent <b>echo</b> <b>volumes</b> for discriminating blood and myocardial tissue, to facilitate automated segmentation of 3 D echocardiographic images over the entire cardiac cycle. Because of poor echogenicity contrast between blood and myocardial tissue in some regions and the presence of speckle noise, automated segmentation is challenging. For patients with a congenital heart disease, segmentation should rely on echo features solely as incorporation of a priori knowledge of the shape of the heart is undesirable. Therefore, we analyzed the performance of a 3 D iterative cross-correlation algorithm to obtain optimal contrast of maximum cross-correlation (MCC) values between blood and myocardial tissue in all phases of the cardiac cycle. Both contrast and boundary-gradient quality measures were assessed to optimize the MCC-values with respect to signal choice (radiofrequency (RF) data or envelope data) and axial window size.

A study was initiated in the Summer of 1996 to determine how total (in-cloud plus ground) lightning observations might provide added knowledge to the forecaster in the determination and identification of severe thunderstorms and weather hazards in real-time. The Melbourne Weather Office was selected as a primary site to conduct this study because Melbourne is the only site {{in the world with}} continuous and open access to total lightning (LDAR) data and a Doppler (WSR- 88 D) radar. A Lightning Imaging Sensor Data Applications Demonstration (LISDAD) system was integrated into the forecaster's workstation during the Summer 1996 to allow the forecaster to interact in real-time with the multi-sensor data being displayed. LISDAD currently ingests LDAR data, the cloud-to-ground National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) data, and the Melbourne radar data in f real-time. The interactive features provide the duty forecaster the ability to perform quick diagnostics on storm cells of interest.

40|$|Although rats are {{commonly}} used to study left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, measurement of LV mass and dimensions has required killing the rat. To determine the accuracy of echocardiography in rats, blinded crossectional area (CSA) and LV mass measurements using either the cube function (LVM) or an elliptical model (LVMel) from high resolution M-mode echocardiograms were compared to necropsy LV weight (0. 28 to 1. 5 g), in 41 normotensive (body weight 116 to 762 g) and 17 hypertensive rats (350 to 560 g). Postmortem chamber volumes in 28 normal rats (0. 02 to 0. 19 mL) were also compared to echocardiographic volumes derived from the elliptical model. Correlation with LV weight was r = 0. 87 for LVM, 0. 90 for CSA and 0. 93 for LVMel (all P less than. 00001). Comparison of hypertensive and body-weight-matched normotensive rats revealed the upper normal limit for both LVMel and CSA to have 89 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for detection of post mortem LV hypertrophy. Necropsy LV volumes were {{more closely related to}} systolic echocardiographic volumes than to diastolic volumes (r = 0. 78 v 0. 71, both P less than. 00001), compatible with the effects of post mortem contracture.

The 8 June event evolved from a tornadic hailstorm to a larger multicellular system that produced 21 observed positive sprites in 2 h. The majority of sprites occurred during a lull in convective strength, as measured by total flash rate, flash energy, and radar <b>echo</b> <b>volume.</b> Mean flash area spiked multiple times during this period; however, total flash rates still exceeded 60 min(sup 1), and portions of the storm featured a complex anomalous charge structure, with midlevel positive charge near 20 degC. The storm produced predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning. All sprite-parent flashes occurred on the northeastern flank of the storm, where strong westerly upper level flow was consistent with advection of charged precipitation away from convection, providing a pathway for stratiform lightning. The 25 June event was another multicellular hailstorm with an anomalous charge structure that produced 26 positive sprites in less than 1 h. The sprites again occurred during a convective lull, with relatively weaker reflectivity and lower total flash rate but relatively larger mean flash area. However, all sprite parents occurred in or near convection and tapped charge layers in adjacent anvil cloud. The results demonstrate the sprite production by convective ground strokes in anomalously charged storms and also indicate that sprite production and convective vigor are inversely related in mature storms...|$|R

The feasibility of this hybrid imaging and the precision of image fusion were evaluated. Materials and Methods: Ultrasound imaging was achieved using a clinical US scanner modified to be MR compatible, whereas MRI was achieved on 1. 5 - and 3 -T clinical scanners.

This enables continuous recording of a large <b>echo</b> <b>volume</b> of 70 mm in length and a sector angle of 120 °. The presentation of the volume-reconstructed data is made with a time lag of < 100 ms. The frame rate is up to 20 Hz. In addition to conventional imaging, the observer can obtain a stereoscopic image of the structures examined with red/blue goggles. ResultsIt was shown in vitro on ventricle- and aorta-form agar models and in vivo that the system enables excellent visualization of the 3 D structures. Shape, spatial orientation, and the navigation of various catheters (e. g., EPS-catheter, Swan-Ganz-catheter), stents, or atrial septal defect occluders could be recorded on-line and stereoscopically depicted. The size of the echo sector enables a wide field of view without changing the position of the probe.

40|$|Summary A 2013 {{survey of}} NZ public {{hospital}} echocardiography services demonstrates unequal regional distribution relating to regional population size and demographics (age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status). Additionally there are regional {{differences in the}} distribution, population-based size and demographics of the cardiac sonographer workforce. This is the first study to describe {{the relationship of the}} cardiac workforce distribution to regional echo service provision. Abstract Aim Healthcare may be unevenly distributed based on geographic location. This study aimed to identify whether regional differences in echocardiography provision exist and, if so, to explore key causes. Method Method In March 2013, 18 public hospitals with a sonographer-led echocardiography service were surveyed, all of which provided data. Questions related to characteristics of the sonographer workforce, echocardiogram volumes and workflows. Information on District Health Board (DHB) population was obtained from public access websites. Multivariable linear regression was performed using the following variables: ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, type of centre, sonographer full-time equivalent (FTE) and number/proportion of trainees to determine their potential contribution to echocardiogram volume. Results 1748 echocardiograms were performed per 100, 000 population (mean) with significant differences seen amongst DHBs but not between tertiary surgical and regional centres (surgical median 1802, regional median 1658, p= 0. 18). Regional disparity in the population-based cardiac sonographer workforce size was observed and the number of scans performed per sonographer was higher in larger centres. In multivariable modelling, the DHB population-based scan volume was predicted by: socioeconomic status (top two quintiles of deprivation status increased scans by 75 per 100, 000 population, p= 0. 02) and age (age 20 to 65 years increased scans by 131 per 100, 000 population, p= 0. 06).

40|$|Background—Quantitative {{assessment}} and validation of left ventricular (LV) volumes and mass in neonates and infants with complex {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) is important for clinical management but has not been undertaken. We compared matrix-array 3 D echocardiography (3 D <b>echo)</b> measurements of <b>volumes,</b> mass, and ejection fraction (EF) with those measured by cardiac MRI in young patients with CHD and small LVs because of either young age or LV hypoplasia. Methods and Results—Thirty-five patients aged 4 years (median, 0. 8 years) undergoing MRI were prospectively enrolled. Three-dimensional echo was acquired immediately after MRI, and volume, mass, and EF measurements, using summation of discs methodology, were compared with MRI. Three-dimensional <b>echo</b> end-diastolic <b>volume</b> (24. 415. 7 versus 24. 846. 4 mL; P 0. 01; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0. 96) and end-systolic volume (12. 38. 6 versus 9. 66. 8 mL; P 0. 001; ICC, 0. 90) correlated with MRI with small mean differences (0. 49 mL [P 0. 6] and 2. 7 mL [P 0. 001], respectively). Three-dimensional echo EF was smaller than MRI by 9. 3 % (P 0. 001), and 3 D echo LV mass measurements were comparable to MRI (17. 310. 3 versus 17. 612 g; P 0. 77; ICC, 0. 93), with a small mean difference (1. 1 g; P 0. 28). There was good intra- and interobserver reliability for all measurements. Conclusions—In neonates and infants with CHD and small LVs (age appropriate or hypoplastic), matrix-array 3 D echo measurements of mass and volumes compare well with MRI, providing an important modality for ventricular size an...|$|R

However, targets usually refer to point scatterers and clutter to extended scatterers (covering many range, angle, and Doppler cells).

In principle, all that is required to estimate the radar return (backscatter) from a region of clutter is a knowledge of the volume or surface illuminated and the <b>echo</b> per unit <b>volume,</b> η, or per unit surface area, σ° (the backscatter coefficient).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a novel model-based {{approach}} for 3 D underwater scene reconstruction, i. e., bathymetry, for {{side scan sonar}} arrays in complex and highly reverberating environments like shallow water areas. The presence of multipath <b>echoes</b> and <b>volume</b> reverberation generates false depth estimates. To improve the resulting bathymetry, this paper proposes and develops an adaptive filter, based on several original geometrical models. This multimodel approach {{makes it possible to}} track and separate the direction of arrival trajectories of multiple echoes impinging the array. Echo tracking is perceived as a model-based processing stage, incorporating prior information on the temporal evolution of echoes in order to reject cluttered observations generated by interfering echoes. The results of the proposed filter on simulated and real sonar data showcase the clutter-free and regularized bathymetric reconstruction. Model validation is carried out with goodness of fit tests, and demonstrates the importance of model-based processing for bathymetry reconstruction...|$|R

A [...] "version" [...] is a record with the vocals removed, the alternative cut of a song made for the DJ to toast over. These [...] "versions" [...] were used as the basis of new songs by rerecording them with new elements. The instrumental tracks are typically drenched in sound effects such as echo, reverberation, with instruments and vocals dropping {{in and out of the}} mix. Another hallmark of the dub sound is the prominent use of bass guitar. The music sometimes features other noises, such as birds singing, thunder and lightning, water flowing, and producers shouting instructions at the musicians. It can be further augmented by live DJs. The many-layered sounds with varying <b>echoes</b> and <b>volumes</b> are often said to create soundscapes, or sound sculptures, drawing attention to the shape and depth of the space between sounds as well as to the sounds themselves. There is usually a distinctly organic feel to the music, even though the effects are electronically created.|$|R

There is little information {{in the literature on}} the LVR analyzed with three-dimensional echocardiography (3 D ECHO). OBJECTIVE: To analyze, with 3 D ECHO, the geometric and volumetric modifications of the left ventricle (VE) six months after AMI in patients subjected to percutaneous primary treatment. METHODS: Prospective study with 3 D ECHO of 21 subjects (16 men, 56 ± 12 years-old), affected by AMI with ST segment elevation. The morphological and functional analysis (LV) with 3 D <b>ECHO</b> (<b>volumes,</b> LVEF, 3 D sphericity index) was carried out up to seven days and six months after the AMI. The LVR was considered for increase > 15 % of the end diastolic volume of the LV (LVEDV) six months after the AMI, compared to the LVEDV up to seven days from the event. RESULTS: Eight (38 %) patients have presented LVR. Echocardiographic measurements (n = 21 patients) : I- up to seven days after the AMI: 1 - LVEDV: 92. 3 ± 22. 3 mL; 2 - LVEF: 0. 51 ± 0. 01; 3 - sphericity index: 0. 38 ± 0. 05; II- after six months: 1 - LVEDV: 107. 3 ± 26. 8 mL; 2 - LVEF: 0. 59 ± 0. 01; 3 - sphericity index: 0. 31 ± 0. 05.

40|$|Abstract—The {{development}} of a geometric invariant audio watermarking scheme without degrading acoustical quality is challenging work. This paper proposes a multi-bit spread-spec-trum audio watermarking scheme based on a geometric invariant log coordinate mapping (LCM) feature. The LCM feature is very robust to audio geometric distortions. The watermark {{is embedded in the}} LCM feature, but it is actually embedded in the Fourier coefficients which are mapped to the feature via LCM, so the embedding is actually performed in the DFT domain without interpolation, thus eliminating completely the severe distortion resulted from the non-uniform interpolation mapping. The wa-termarked audio achieves high auditory quality in both objective and subjective quality assessments. A mixed correlation between the LCM feature and a key-generated PN tracking sequence is proposed to align the log-coordinate mapping, thus synchronizing the watermark efficiently with only one FFT and one IFFT. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed audio watermarking scheme is not only resilient against common signal processing operations, including low-pass filtering, MP 3 recompression, <b>echo</b> addition, <b>volume</b> change, normalization, test functions in the Stirmark benchmark, and DA/AD conversion, but also has conquered the challenging audio geometric distortion and achieves the best robustness against simultaneous geometric distortions, such as pitch invariant time-scale modification (TSM) by 20 %, tempo invariant pitch shifting by 20 %, resample TSM with scaling factors between 75 % and 140 %, and random cropping by 95 %. This is mainly contributed by the proposed geometric invariant LCM feature. To our best knowledge, audio watermarking based on LCM has not been reported before.
