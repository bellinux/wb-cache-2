Likely due to their socio-cultural importance to indigenous people, these forests have been conserved {{over the past several}} hundred years and {{play a significant role in}} conservation of local biodiversity. To reveal the effects of human disturbance on fengshui forests, we compared the species composition and diversity of understory woody plants among three fengshui forests with similar topographic situation and identical origin under different degrees of disturbance intensity in Dalingshan Town of Dongguan City, Guangdong Province. The low, medium and high disturbance level of fengshui forest stands were identified according to impact factors such as road length, agricultural land, residential area, factory area, cutting degree and garbage cover. Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) analysis showed that the composition of understory woody species (P = 0. 001, A = 0. 3886) differed among forest stands. Meanwhile, the proportion of mesophytes decreased with disturbance and the proportion of <b>heliophytes</b> increased. Though not statistically significant (P > 0. 05), diversity indices consistently showed the following trend: high disturbance > medium disturbance > low disturbance. Jaccard coefficients of understory species similarity among the three fengshui stands declined with increasing intensity of human disturbance, indicating that species replacementoccurred. Two-way cluster analysis of the relationships between plant species and forest stands indicated that the spatial distribution of understory species differed among stands. Indicator species analysis (ISA) identified species that were indicative (importance value ≥ 60) of the three forest stands studied, and therefore potential indicators of different disturbance regimes. We conclude that human disturbance of fengshui forests appeared to alter understory species composition, and favor the establishment and growth of <b>heliophytes,</b> but failed to affect species diversity. Furthermore, identification of candidate understory indicators which capture key ecological responses to human disturbance may have significant implications for improving biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management of fengshui forests...|$|R
40|$|Historians {{claim that}} European colonizers of the {{northern}} coast of Rio de Janeiro State found vast herbaceous fields when arrived in this region.

The partial replacement of forest by field vegetation in the first episode was probably caused by floods of the lower areas during the development of the Holocene lagoon phase. During the second episode, successions of vegetational patterns occurred due to lowering of the sea level. Drying and enlarging of the coastal plain have allowed its colonization by herbs and <b>heliophyte</b> plants.

30|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that light intensity {{plays an important}} role in plant growth and photosynthetic capacity (Gottschalk 1994). Insufficient light may stress plant growth by limiting photosynthesis, while high light levels may damage the photosynthetic apparatus (Tang et al. 2015). The present study demonstrated that shading had significant negative effects on leaf and total biomass production of C. paliurus coppices, while full light condition resulted in the highest growth for all the components, indicating that C. paliurus is a <b>heliophyte.</b> The observed growth response of C. paliurus to light intensity was similar to that of many tree species growing under various light intensities (Poorter 1999; Cai et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2015; Tang et al. 2015). The present study also indicated that leaf biomass ratio of C. paliurus increased at lower light intensity, whereas full sunlight increased the root and stem biomass ratios, respectively (Table  6). The reason might be that higher transpiration rate leads to increasing root biomass allocation in order to improve water uptake ability under full sunlight conditions, in agreement with that reported on Rauvolfia species, Anoectochilus formosanus Hayata, and freshwater macrophytes (Cai et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2010; Cronin and Lodge 2003).|$|E

K., a shrub {{or small}} {{tree in the}} Bignoniaceae, is a widely {{distributed}} polymorphic complex of the Western Hemisphere tropics and subtropics, and is commonly planted as an ornamental throughout the tropical world. Winter temperature limits its poleward distribution. The species is characteristic of rocky slopes, often limestone outcrops, but also alluvial and other substrata as long as drainage is excellent. In arid regions it occurs in climax xerophytic shrub or thorn forest communities, while in humid areas it is common mainly in deforested and other disturbed sites since it behaves as a <b>heliophyte.</b> The large yellow funnel-form flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds and perhaps also by some insects.

Excavation of skeleton roots and observation of fine roots of seven species including the Euphorbiaceae, Theaceae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae and Fagaceae families was carried out. The results showed that: (1) Pioneer tree roots in the first stage of natural succession were of two types, one characterized by taproot system with bulky plagiotropic branches; the other characterized by flat root system with several tabular roots. The late mesophilous tree roots were characterized by one obvious taproot and tactic braches roots up and down. Shrub species roots were characterized by heart fibrous root type featured both by horizontally and transversally growing branches. Root shapes varied in different dominant species at different stages of succession. (2) Roots of the different species varied in the external features—color, periderm and structure of freshly cut slash. (3) In a set of successional stages the biomass of tree roots increased linearly with the age of growth.

40|$|In the dry {{forest of}} Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica, the {{understory}} shrub Jacquinia nervosa presents an inverse pattern of phenology that concentrates vegetative growth and reproduction {{during the dry}} season. In this study, we tested the "escape from herbivory" hypothesis as a potential explanation for the inverse phenological pattern of J. nervosa. We monitored leaf, flower and fruit production in 36 adult plants from October 2000 to August 2001. Leaves of six randomly selected branches per plant were marked and monitored every two weeks to measure the cumulative loss in leaf area. To analyze pre-dispersal seed predation we collected 15 fruits per plant and counted {{the total number of}} healthy and damaged seeds, as well as the number and type of seed predators found within the fruits. Leaf, flower, and fruit production occurred during {{the first part of the}} dry season (end of November to February). The cumulative herbivory levels were similar to those observed in other tropical dry forest tree species that concentrate leaf production during the wet season, and were concentrated on young leaves, which lost an average of 36. 77 % of their area (SD= 34. 35 %, N= 195). Chewing beetles of the genus Epicauta (Meloidae) were the most important herbivores. In mature leaves, most of the damage was caused by the beetle Coptocycla rufonotata (Chrysomelidae). Fruits took 4 months to develop during the dry season (January-March 2001) but continue increasing in size well into the first 3 months of the wet season (May-July). Average seed number per ripe fruit was 9 (SD = 5, N = 500). Seed predation in mature fruits was 42  % (SD = 47  %, N = 122). Most seeds were damaged by moth larvae of the family Tortricidae. Only 3  % of the flowers became fruits. This was influenced by the low level of flower synchrony (0. 38 ± 0. 26, N = 36 plants), but neither leaf synchrony (0. 88 ± 0. 06, N = 36 plants) nor plant size influenced fruit numbers. The significant damaged produced by insect herbivores in young leaves, fruits, and seeds, as well as the low reproductive index observed in J. nervosa, shows that the inverse leafing phenology of this species is not consistent with the "escape hypothesis" since J. nervosa was considerably attacked during the dry season. Considering the strong seasonality of the tropical dry forest and the <b>heliophyte</b> character of J. nervosa, it is more likely that this phenological strategy evolved in response to seasonal fluctuations in light availability, light quality, and daylength.

40|$|For centuries, people {{continuously}} {{increased the}} rate of biological invasions {{and there is no}} sign of slowing down. From the depth of the Ocean to the crest of Himalayas, they are occupying pristine and semi-natural ecosystems at an alarming rate, threatening human, animal, plant as well as ecosystem health. Efforts to avoid or eradicate them are not achievable except for very few cases. Currently, therefore, their management aims at controlling invaders and mitigating their impact rather than eradication. Limitation of resources forces land managers to carefully plan and prioritize interventions only in areas most severely affected by invaders. Hence, information on the actual and potential distribution of invaders is considered crucial for their management. It has long been recognized that remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) could contribute to help solving this problem. Remote sensing has so far been applied predominantly to invasive species that dominate the canopy of the ecosystem. The large majority of invasive species do however not show up in the canopy and thus remain difficult to detect by remote sensing in a direct and straightforward manner. Techniques for mapping such cryptic invaders have not been developed so far. In this thesis we explored methods to map the distribution of Chromolaena odorata (L.) RM King & H Robinson, one of the world's worst invasive species. This cryptic <b>heliophyte</b> originating from central America invaded the understorey of many tropical forest ecosystems throughout the world. C. odorata is a cryptic invader hidden under the forest canopy in the Terai of Nepal. It occurs predominately in opened up forest, with increased light intensity. The approach to map its distribution was to develop first remote sensing techniques to map forest canopy density and light intensity reaching the understorey and next relate these radiation maps to various aspects of the life history of C. odorata. To set the scene we reviewed in chapter 2 existing methods to map the distribution of invasive species. Next, we explored the quality of four alternative methods to predict forest canopy density (Chapter 3). This comparative study revealed that an artificial neural network best explained canopy density in terms of variance explained and bias. A Landsat ETM+ image processed through a neural network predicted 81 % of light intensity reaching the understorey. The resulting radiation map was the environmental data layer that was subsequently used to map the distribution of C. odorata. This study revealed that in the Nepalese Terai C. odorata failed to produce seed below a light intensity of 6. 5 mJ m - 2 day - 1, and that light intensity determined 93 % of the variation in log 10 seed production per plant (Chapter 4). This enabled us to map its distribution in Nepal based on under-canopy light intensities. C. odorata invades new areas by generative reproduction (wind dispersal of pappus-bearing achenes). Once established, clonal propagation through underground corms enhances further expansion of populations. We have discovered (Chapter 5) that the age of corms can be determined using corm rings in cross sections. While individual corms survive for only five years, we obtained evidence that multi-corm genets, which must have been much older, had developed in forests with opened canopy. We furthermore demonstrated that light intensity positively related to {{the rate of}} clonal growth. The light dependence of the expansion rate of plants is apparently a key attribute explaining the invasion success of this species. Any disturbances in forest canopy density leading to increased light intensities would ultimately trigger its clonal growth.   The canopy in tropical forest ecosystems in Nepal is severely degraded offering light conditions suitable for C. odorata. The degradation of the forest canopy was attributed to a series of interrelated causes including human dimensions and government policies (Chapter 6). Herbarium records revealed that C. odorata invaded southern Nepal shortly after the initiation of malaria control. We furthermore demonstrated that this was followed in Chitwan district by an influx of migrants, land use changes and degradation of the forests. It was therefore argued that the species invaded because of canopy degradation, which was caused by change in land use and demography and triggered by malaria control. This process of malaria control followed by migration increased human population growth rates that we described for Chitwan district occurred in tropical regions all over Nepal. Hence, we suggest that it must have contributed to the rapid spread of C. odorata in the lowland Terai forest belt. Field observations revealed that C. odorata did not invade the tropical forests in the west of Nepal below 83 ° 45 ' east longitude. We were unable to explain this distribution pattern with simple climatic indicators. However, a bioclimatic indicator, the length of the growing season predicted the absence from west Nepal remarkably well. This suggests that C. odorata requires a minimum length of the growing period to accumulate sufficient resources to establish and persist. We thus conclude that an agro-ecological modeling approach yielded a better prediction than the commonly used bioclimatic approach (Chapter 7). Since, deforestation and forest degradation are a point of concern for management of both biological invaders and native biota, there is a need to more closely monitor biological conservation areas because of the potentially irreversible impacts of deforestation and forest degradation. In chapter 8 we assess the rate of deforestation and the current degree of forest degradation in the Terai of Nepal. Forest canopy density class was predicted with 82 % overall accuracy. Data analysis revealed that the forested area reduced from 21774 km 2 in 1958 to 12649 km 2 in 2000 corresponding to an annual rate of decline of 1. 38 %. Our analysis further revealed that 70 % of the forested area outside conservation areas had canopies with density below 60 %, thus confirming widespread degradation. More surprisingly, 50 % percent of the forested area inside protected areas had such opened canopies. This indicates that canopy degradation is also very common inside protected areas. These areas play a special role in the conservation of internationally threatened forest communities, for instance Nepalese tropical rain forests. Our analysis revealed that canopy opening prevailed as well in these communities. We argue that from a biodiversity point of view conservation effort should focus on the preservation and restoration of these forest types. The forest degradation maps presented in this chapter could serve as a start to prioritize such interventions. In this thesis, we demonstrated how the impressive developments in computational performance, the rapid growth of remote sensing and GIS technologies for spatial data acquisition and analysis could be used beyond their traditional application in mapping canopy-dominant invasive species. We have shown how a few of these cost-effective mapping techniques can reliably be up scaled to the national level to map the distribution of even those invasive species that do not dominate the canopy of forest ecosystems. This thesis emphasizes the importance of site-specific microclimatic variation and empirical observations of the species' ecology, while applying remote sensing techniques in invasion studies. This could significantly reduce the uncertainties and the degree of "erroneous prediction". Maps displaying seed-producing sites could be used to significantly reduce the costs of controlling C. odorata infestation by providing information on the spatial segregation of source and sink populations. These will support efficient habitat ranking to restore invaded areas and protect non-invaded ecosystems. Such an approach may prove particularly valuable when implementing control measures under circumstances of limited capital and labour. This thesis also showed the necessity to understand the connection between the human historical, socio-economic, and cultural context with the environmental conditions and the ecology of the invader. It facilitates conceptualising the situation and hopefully it also helps in translating research results into appropriate policy measures...|$|E

Total carbon, pollen and plant macrofossils are used to synthesize a vegetation-stack, which is used together with the stacks from seasonal varve formation, flood layers, eolian dust content and volcanic tephra layers to define Landscape Evolution Zones (LEZ). LEZ 1 encompasses the landscape dynamics of the last 6000 years with widespread human influence. The natural oak and hazel forests of the early Holocene back to 10, 500 b 2 k define LEZ 2. LEZ 3, the late glacial between 10, 500 and 14, 700 b 2 k, shows the development of a boreal forest with abundant grass and shallow water biomass in the lakes. The maximum of the last glaciation (LEZ 4 : 14, 700 - 23, 000 b 2 k) was characterized by sparse vegetation of moss and characeae. These sediments are generally devoid of clay and sand and reveal no indication of snow-meltwater events. Accordingly, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) must have been extremely arid in central Europe. The sediments of the subsequent LEZ 5 from 23, 000 - 28, 500 b 2 k preserve distinct layers of clay and coarse sand, which indicates running water with clay in suspension and ephemeral coarse-grained fluvial sediment discharge. Abundant Ranunculaceae macroremains (used for 14 C dating), insects, moss and fungi sclerotia reflect a tundra environment during a time of frequent strong snowmelt events. Total carbon content, Betula-Pinus pollen and diatoms reach increased concentrations during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 interstadials that occurred between 28, 500 and 36, 500 b 2 k (LEZ 6). The entire MIS 3 interstadials are well documented in the organic carbon record from the Auel dry maar. The main paleobotanical indicators of MIS 3 are, however, grass pollen and <b>heliophytes,</b> which indicate a steppe environment with scattered/patchy trees during the interstadials. The stadial phases inferred during LEZ 6 reveal initiation of eolian dust deflation. The change of the early MIS 3 forested landscape to a steppe occurred with the LEZ 7 -LEZ 6 transition. This is when modern man spread in central Europe. The principle vegetation change to a steppe at 36, 500 b 2 k must have favoured the spread of horses, an important hunting prey of modern humans. We propose accordingly that the migration of the modern humans into central Europe might have been at least partly driven by climate and associated vegetation change. The LEZ 7 encompassed the time interval 36, 500 to 49, 000 b 2 k and was characterized by a boreal forest with high abundance of pine, birch, as well as spruce during the interstadial events. Abundant charcoal fragments indicate that this taiga was under frequent drought stress with regular burning. The most unexpected finding, but corroborated by all our maar records is the dominance of thermophilous tree taxa from 49, 000 to 55, 000 b 2 k (LEZ 8). Greenland interstadials 13 and 14 were apparently the warmest of MIS 3 according to the Eifel pollen records. The preceeding LEZ 9 from 55, 000 to 60, 000 b 2 k is also dominated by spruce, but thermophilous trees were sparse. A warm early MIS 3 appears plausible, because summer insolation (at 60 ° N) was higher in the early MIS 3 than today, ice cover was low in Scandinavia and sea-surface temperatures of the North Atlantic were almost comparable to modern values during GI- 14...|$|R
