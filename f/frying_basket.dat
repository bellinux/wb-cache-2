30|$|Dried shrimp {{crackers}} {{were obtained}} from a local market in Songkhla, Thailand. They had an average diameter of 5  mm with thickness of 1.5  mm. Crackers were fried using an electric deep fryer containing 4  L of frying oil. Palm oil used as a frying medium was preheated to 180  °C before frying. Samples {{were placed in the}} <b>frying</b> <b>basket</b> and immersed into the oil for 30  s until samples are completely puffed. Thereafter, fried samples were placed on the screen to drain the oil for 5  min. The fried shrimp cracker was blotted with paper towels to remove an excess oil on the surface and allowed to cool at room temperature (26 – 28  °C), approximately 15  min before being packaged.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying is {{done with}} a deep fryer, a pan such as a wok or chip pan, a Dutch oven, or a {{cast-iron}} pot. Additional tools include <b>fry</b> <b>baskets,</b> which are used to contain foods in a deep fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature. Tongs, slotted spoons, wooden spoons, and sieves {{may be used to}} remove or separate foods from the hot oil.|$|R
50|$|Restaurant fryers are {{available}} with {{a wide array of}} accessories and options. There are countertop models, single floor models, and “fryer batteries” with multiple floor fryers, a filtration system, and holding stations all built together as one large floor fryer system. Individual fryers may have one or more tanks. Commercial floor-model fryers can be fitted with casters for easier maintenance and cleanup. <b>Fry</b> <b>baskets</b> also come in various shapes and sizes, from taco salad bowls to onion loaf baskets, with or without heat resistant handles.|$|R
5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner <b>Basket,</b> <b>Fried</b> Chicken Dinner <b>Basket,</b> and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a <b>Fried</b> clam <b>Basket.</b> The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{chicken in}} a <b>basket,</b> <b>fried</b> chicken {{on a bed of}} chips, was a popular dish in pubs and modest {{restaurants}} from the late 1960s through the 1970s.|$|R
2500|$|After {{a person}} had ordered, McDonald's advised that wait times were between 10–15 minutes. When {{the food was}} ready, trained crew ('hosts') brought the food to the customer's table. Instead of McDonald's usual {{cardboard}} and plastic packaging, CYT food was presented on wooden boards, <b>fries</b> in wire <b>baskets</b> and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery. A higher price applied.|$|R
60|$|The hostess, a tall creature, haggard and grim, shrugged her shoulders. Her jaws were toothless, {{and when}} she spoke it was {{difficult}} to understand. I tied Aguador to a manger and took off his saddle. The old women stirred themselves at last, and one brought a portion of chopped straw and a little barley. Another with the bellows blew on the cinders, and the third, taking eggs from a <b>basket,</b> <b>fried</b> them on the brasero. Besides, they gave me coarse brown bread and red wine, which was coarser still; for dessert the hostess went to the door and from a neighbouring tree plucked oranges.|$|R
5000|$|Pierrot is {{burdened}} {{with a large}} <b>frying</b> pan, a <b>basket</b> full of eggs, a bundle of sticks, and a fishing rod. He is jealous of Harlequin, to whom Cassander wants to give his daughter. Without Harlequin's seeing him do it, he annoys him with his fishing line. Thinking Cassander is to blame, Harlequin punches the old man, knocking him to the ground. Columbine, indignant, slaps Harlequin's face. Pierrot, after having helped Cassander up, tries to goad Harlequin into a fight. The latter refuses. [...] "I don't fight with a valet", he says. And to calm Cassander, he gives him an enormous watch. Cassander softens, and shushes Pierrot, who wants to swoop down on his rival. In {{the midst of this}} brawl, Cassander receives the blows of the two combatants. Columbine, to calm Pierrot, whom she loves, gives him her flower without being seen by Harlequin.|$|R
