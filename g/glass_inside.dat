5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval <b>glass.</b> <b>Inside,</b> only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E
25|$|This {{renovation}} {{was more}} extensive and visibly changed the church. The Romanesque front was added {{and the windows}} changed to stained <b>glass.</b> <b>Inside</b> the vaulted ceiling was added, as well an enlarged organ. Central heating and new lecture rooms were also added.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>inside</b> a {{cylinder}} {{is usually a}} black glossy substance. All this work (in the United Kingdom) is done using hot cell systems. Sugar is added to control the ruthenium chemistry and to stop {{the formation of the}} volatile RuO4 containing radioactive ruthenium isotopes. In the West, the glass is normally a borosilicate glass (similar to Pyrex), while in the former Soviet bloc it is normal to use a phosphate glass. The amount of fission products in the glass must be limited because some (palladium, the other Pt group metals, and tellurium) tend to form metallic phases which separate from the glass. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes, which are then buried underground. In Germany a vitrification plant is in use; this is treating the waste from a small demonstration reprocessing plant which has since been closed down.|$|E

50|$|Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves is a {{platform}} stealth video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. It {{is the third}} game in the Sly Cooper franchise. Sly 3 has optional 3-D stages, and comes {{with a pair of}} 3-D <b>glasses</b> <b>inside</b> the manual. The game received generally positive reviews from the gaming press.|$|R
500|$|The oldest {{window is}} to {{the east side of}} the porch, on the south wall, which dates from about 1400; it has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by a mullion) topped by trefoils, set in a rectangular window frame. [...] It is echoed by a 19th-century window on the same wall, set slightly higher to illuminate the pulpit. [...] The north wall has two rectangular windows, one with a pair of lights topped by cinquefoils, the other a single light with a trefoil at the top. One of the windows has been inserted into an opening previously used as a doorway. The east window, which has three lights, dates from the latter part of the 15th century, and is the only window to contain stained <b>glass.</b> <b>Inside,</b> the division between nave and chancel is marked with a pointed arch, dating from about 1400. Seating is provided in the form of painted box pews, dating from the 19th century, and possibly installed at the time of the restoration work in 1823.|$|E
2500|$|The CIA Memorial Wall {{is located}} at CIA {{headquarters}} in Langley, Virginia. It honors CIA employees {{who died in the}} line of duty. As of June 13, 2017, there were 125 stars carved into the marble wall, [...] each one representing an officer. A majority of these were paramilitary officers. A black book, called the [...] "Book of Honor", lies beneath the stars and is encased in an inch-thick plate of <b>glass.</b> <b>Inside</b> this book are stars, arranged by year of death, and the names of 91 employees who died in CIA service alongside them. The other names remain secret, even in death.|$|E
2500|$|Excavations {{carried out}} in 1934-35 in the Sittanvasal village have {{revealed}} many Megalithic burial sites near the hill, which are {{in the form of}} both cist and urn burials. These are located {{on both sides of the}} road leading from the monuments to the main road, after about [...] from the Ezhadippattam; more are seen on the left side of the road leading to Pudukkottai. Antiquaries collected from the sites also include specimens of garnet, red jasper and rock crystal at the foot of the hill have been picked up near the foot of the hill, pottery pieces with coating of molten and coloured <b>glass</b> <b>inside,</b> and also small pieces of coloured glass; all these are indicative of glass manufacturing in the area.|$|E

We are working up towards a part of the reef where I think there may be a passage. Anyhow I am gaining a good local knowledge of this place, and that saves time another year.|$|E

Let me say for myself that I had only fallen asleep on the sofa in the bedroom at past {{two in the morning}} from sheer fatigue. Mrs. Macallan was then awake. She was in one of her bad humors with me. I had tried to prevail on her to let me remove her dressing-case from her bed-table, after she had used it in making her toilet for the night. It took up a great deal of room; and she could not possibly want it again before the morning. But no; she insisted on my letting it be. There was a <b>glass</b> <b>inside</b> the case; and, plain as she was, she never wearied of looking at herself in that glass. I saw that she was in a bad state of temper, so I gave her her way, and let the dressing-case be. Finding that she was too sullen to speak to me after that, and too obstinate to take her composing draught from me when I offered it, I laid me down on the sofa at her bed foot, and fell asleep, as I have said.|$|E

50|$|Some use {{was made}} in the past of {{searchlight}} signals; these have one lamp, in front of which is placed either a red, yellow or green glass to show the respective aspect. For double-yellow a second lamp is fitted, illuminated only for the double-yellow aspect. The last of the traditional searchlight signals (i.e. with moving <b>glasses</b> <b>inside)</b> were removed in the 1990s, but the concept has resurfaced in the 2000s with the advent of LEDs which can show three different colours.|$|R
25|$|In {{the past}} use {{was made of}} {{searchlight}} signals; these have a single lamp in front of which is placed either a red, yellow or green filter to show the respective aspect.

A few traditional searchlight signals (i.e. with moving <b>glasses</b> <b>inside)</b> remain in use in the Clacton area, but the concept had a renaissance in the 2000’s {{with the advent of}} LEDs which can show three different colours.|$|R
