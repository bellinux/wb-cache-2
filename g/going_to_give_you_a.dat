500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted {{that he would like to}} take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
2500|$|The Who Dey chant's {{first known}} use was by {{fans of the}} 1980 Cincinnati Bengals. While {{the origin of the}} chant is unsettled, one {{possible}} source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: [...] "Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!" [...] Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 2012, T.I. held an NYC {{listening}} session, {{during which}} he described {{the inspiration for the}} album: [...] "I've learned that one thing about my life that is certain is trouble...Be that as it may, I shall embrace that fact and not evade it. We all have faults. Before I let you stand on your high horse and point a finger back down at me, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> big, stiff 'Fuck you.'" [...] On Power 105's The Breakfast Club, T.I. hinted that Trouble Man could be his last album, explaining that he wanted to quit rapping, believing that it is not how it once was: ...|$|E

2500|$|Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of The Kooks all met as {{students}} at the BRIT School in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM (where they met Rafferty who was from Brighton) in 2002. The inspiration to form a band came to Pritchard as he and Garred were out shopping for clothes one day in Primark as a joke. Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together just on a whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> gig'", said Garred. However, the band was unable to make the performance as they were finishing off their demo at the time.|$|E
