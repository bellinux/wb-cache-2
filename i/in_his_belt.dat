At the Ottoman command's request, Wegner was eventually arrested by the Germans and recalled to Germany. While some of his photographs were confiscated and destroyed, he nonetheless succeeded in smuggling out many images of the Armenian persecution by hiding the negatives <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1915 Patton was {{assigned}} to border patrol duty with A Company of the 8th Cavalry, based in Sierra Blanca.

His firearm discharged accidentally one night in a saloon, so he swapped it for an ivory-handled Colt Single Action Army revolver, a weapon that would later become an icon of Patton's image.|$|E

Beginning in 1916, a series of [...] marble {{monument}}s commemorating the Mullan Road were erected in Montana and Idaho. [...] Each monument consists of an obelisk atop a square concrete base. On {{the front of the}} obelisk, in high relief, is an image of Mullan wearing his traditional moccasin boots and buckskins. He stands contrapposto, a pistol tucked <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belt</b> and his right hand holding flintlock rifle. The monuments were designed by artist Edgar Samuel Paxson, a resident of Missoula, and were a project of the Society of Montana Pioneers (a private organization of white men who settled in Montana prior to establishment of the Montana Territory). Seven statues were erected in Montana, and six in Idaho. Another 11 monuments, varying in shape and size from pyramidal cairns to slabs of granite, were erected in Washington state. These do not depict Mullan but mention his name.|$|E

There he stood, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belted</b> Holland blouse, a light cap covering his head, which undress costume suited him. He was looking down the lane, not in the direction of his cousin's approach. She stopped, withdrawing a little behind a willow, and studied his appearance.|$|R

The latter was trying to force his protection racket on Short's White Elephant saloon but Luke rejected his offer. An infuriated Courtright stormed off the saloon, but later returned with two pistols visibly holstered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>belt.</b> He yelled for Luke Short to come out but Jake Johnson, a friend of both men, managed to calm Courtright down {{so that they can}} talk about the argument instead. Luke Short met with the two men outside and walked in the street while talking about their dispute. The group however, suddenly stopped at Ella Blackwellâ€™s Shooting Gallery. Luke Short was facing Courtright three to four feet apart when the latter suddenly went for his pistol, making the former draw his own in return. In the celebrated gunfight that followed, Short was the last man standing. In his own words, Short described what happened: ...|$|E
