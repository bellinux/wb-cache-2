5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E
5|$|Tongkonan are {{the center}} of Torajan social life. The rituals {{associated}} with the tongkonan are important expressions of Torajan spiritual life, and therefore all <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> impelled to participate, because symbolically the tongkonan represents links to their ancestors and to living and future kin. According to Torajan myth, the first tongkonan was built in heaven on four poles, with a roof made of Indian cloth. When the first Torajan ancestor descended to earth, he imitated the house and held a large ceremony.|$|E

Therefore, the non-EU <b>family</b> <b>member</b> should <b>be</b> able to demonstrate that the EU national <b>family</b> <b>member</b> <b>is</b> residing in the UK less than three months (the initial right of residence) and if more than three month, then they are in the UK as worker, self-employed, self-sufficient or student or they acquired the status of permanent residency after having resided in the UK for five years.|$|R
5|$|A few Gabrades also {{remained}} in the Pontus, where they entered {{the service of the}} Empire of Trebizond, established by the exiled Komnenoi shortly before the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204: most notably, {{a member of the family}} was governor of Sinope during the brief period when it was reclaimed from the Turks by Trebizond (ca. 1254 or 1258/9 – 1265 or 1267/8). Other <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> mentioned as landholders, mostly in the bandon (province) of Matzouka, south of Trebizond: Andronikos Gavras, probably in the 13th century; a George Gabras ca. 1344/5; Kosmas, a military leader (polemarchos) in the bandon of Matzouka ca. 1378; and Theodore Gabras in Gemora in the early 15th century.|$|E

McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy. His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate {{about the future of the}} Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Appliqué art, {{which is}} a stitching-based craft unlike embroidery, was pioneered by Hatta Maharana of Pipili. It is widely used in Puri, both for {{decoration}} of the deities and for sale. Maharana's <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> employed as darjis or tailors or sebaks by the Maharaja of Puri. They prepare articles for decorating the deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly coloured and patterned fabric {{in the form of}} canopies, umbrellas, drapery, carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri. The cloth used is made in dark colours of red, black, yellow, green, blue and turquoise blue.|$|E

Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and {{paid for by the}} CIA for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all of the charges against George Sr. In the general confusion, everyone except George Michael forgets Maeby's sixteenth birthday.|$|E
5|$|The last notable {{members of}} the family are {{mentioned}} in Constantinople during the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, as with Michael or Mozalos Gabras, active ca. 1555–65, or Cyril Gabras, megas skeuophylax of the Patriarchate in 1604. Other <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> attested in Crete and the Aegean islands. Thus an unnamed Gabras held lands in Santorini in the early 17th century; and numerous Gabrades are to be found at Chios and in Crete, especially around Siteia, until the early 19th century. For Crete in particular, it has been often supposed, although with no definitive evidence, that the local Gabrades came directly from the Pontus.|$|E
5|$|They {{possess a}} unique feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their oral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is distended, the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the kidneys are recommended regularly, and <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the kidneys in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on kidneys and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E

5|$|The video {{consists}} of multiple scenes with Carey and (now husband) Cannon, who plays her love interest. This is shown along with various behind-the-scenes footage of Carey at various promotional {{events in the}} United Kingdom. The video begins with grainy footage of a plane landing in the Bahamas, with Carey and Cannon exiting the aircraft with her dog. Throughout the video, scenes of Carey laying on a sofa, writing lyrics and tearing, {{as well as the}} singer in a darkened stage are shown. Several behind-the-scenes clips of Carey promoting the album in the United Kingdom are shown, as she arrives at a CD signing, and connects with fans. Following the signing, Carey is shown at a fashion show, as well as modelling in several outfits. Other scenes that intermingle are of Carey looking out of her hotel suite window in London, as well as candles being put out. During the second verse, the couple is seen spending time together on the island, spending time with friends at a small gathering at the pool, as well as moments of Carey modeling for her bikini photo shoot for the June issue of Vibe. The video's final segment is of Carey performing the song at a concert in a large theatre, while several photos are sporadically shown. Photographs of several of Carey's deceased friends and <b>family</b> <b>members</b> <b>are</b> shown, including her dog, Jack, her father Alfred Roy, her grandmother, David Cole, Luciano Pavarotti, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Luther Vandross, all of whom Carey had collaborated with during her career. Critics complimented the inclusion of the photos with both Pavarotti and Vandross, and considered it Carey's way of honoring them. The music video peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart.|$|E
