40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>indoramin,</b> a {{selective}} alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, on ECG time intervals in normal man was studied. Significant prolongation of QTc was observed after <b>indoramin</b> 100 mg, with {{no change in}} QRS duration.

40|$|The cardioregulatory {{properties}} of the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blocker <b>indoramin</b> have been {{compared with those of}} prazosin in the anaesthetized rat. The effects of autonomic blockade on heart rate responses evoked by these two agents and their effects on blood pressure and heart rate after peripheral or central administration have been compared. Cumulative administration of <b>indoramin</b> (0. 8 - 25. 6 mg kg- 1 i. v.) evoked significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and a concomitant bradycardia. Pithing or autonomic blockade, by pretreatment with a combination of practolol and bilateral vagotomy, prevented the bradycardia evoked by <b>indoramin</b> (0. 8 - 3. 2 mg kg- 1 i. v.). Atropine sulphate pretreatment abolished the bradycardia until a cumulative dose of 25. 6 mg kg- 1 (i. v.) of <b>indoramin</b> had been reached. Bilateral vagotomy, intravenous administration of atropine methylnitrate or practolol pretreatment attenuated the bradycardia. Prazosin (0. 02 - 0. 64 mg kg- 1 i. v.) evoked a fall in arterial blood pressure of similar magnitude to that observed following <b>indoramin.</b> A bradycardia was evoked only at a relatively high dose (0. 64 mg kg- 1 i. v.). Intracisternal injection of <b>indoramin</b> or prazosin evoked bradycardia and hypotension at a dose which had no effect after intravenous injection (25 micrograms). Intracerebroventricular injection of <b>indoramin</b> (25 micrograms) had no significant effect on heart rate or blood pressure compared to control values, whereas prazosin (25 micrograms) evoked a significant tachycardia and hypotension. It is concluded that the bradycardia evoked by <b>indoramin</b> in the rat is not due to a direct action on the heart except possibly at high doses. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|To {{confirm the}} {{presence}} of alpha 2 -mediated vasoconstriction in human vasculature, the effect of selective alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -agonists (methoxamine and B-HT 933) and antagonists (<b>indoramin</b> and Yohimbine) was studied in fourteen patients with mild, uncomplicated, essential hypertension. Drugs were infused, into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates, and concomitant changes in forearm blood flow were measured by strain gauge venous plethysmography. During control conditions, cumulative infusions either of methoxamine or B-HT 933 caused dose-related vasoconstriction, while both <b>indoramin</b> and yohimbine doubled forearm blood flow. Subsequently, the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction produced by methoxamine was shown to be completely blocked by <b>indoramin</b> pretreatment, and to be left unchanged by yohimbine. The alpha 2 -vascular stimulation by B-HT 933 was antagonized by previous yohimbine but not by <b>indoramin</b> pretreatment, thus fulfilling the pharmacological requirements for identification of distinct alpha-adrenoceptor mediated excitation-contraction pathways. The data provide {{further evidence of the}} existence of alpha 2 -mediated vasoconstriction in human forearm vessels...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{response}} of 31 migraine sufferers (20 women, 11 men) to intravenous tyramine (the tyraminedose) pressor response test). Patients were treated either with pacebo tablets or <b>indoramin,</b> and alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, in a double-blind crrossover trial. We found that patients with migraine required significantly less tyramine to increase their cystolic blod pressure by 30 mm Hg when compared with matched controls. <b>Indoramin</b> significantly increased the amount of tyramine needed to raise the systolic blood pressure among migraine suffers and reduced the incidence of posttyramine migraine for m 46 % while patients were on placebo tablets to 8 % when they were receiveing <b>indoramin.</b> There was no association between tyramine sensitivity {{and a history of}} premenstrual or dietary migraine, nor was there {{a significant difference in the}} indierenence in the incidence of post-tyramine migrain between men women.

40|$|The {{actions of}} the α 1 -adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} <b>indoramin</b> have been examined against the contractions induced by noradrenaline in the rat vas deferens and aorta taking into account a putative neuronal uptake blocking activity of this antagonist which could result in self-cancelling actions. <b>Indoramin</b> behaved as a simple competitive antagonist of the contractions induced by noradrenaline in the vas deferens and aorta yielding pA 2 values of 7. 38 ± 0. 05 (slope= 0. 98 ± 0. 03) and 6. 78 ± 0. 14 (slope= 1. 08 ± 0. 06), respectively. When the experiments were repeated {{in the presence of}} cocaine (6 [*]μM) the potency (pA 2) of <b>indoramin</b> in antagonizing the contr{{actions of the}} vas deferens to noradrenaline was increased to 8. 72 ± 0. 07 (slope= 1. 10 ± 0. 05) while its potency remained unchanged in the aorta (pA 2 = 6. 69 ± 0. 12; slope= 1. 04 ± 0. 05). In denervated vas deferens, <b>indoramin</b> antagonized the contractions to noradrenaline with a potency similar to that found in the presence of cocaine (8. 79 ± 0. 07; slope= 1. 09 ± 0. 06). It is suggested that <b>indoramin</b> blocks α 1 -adrenoceptors and neuronal uptake in rat vas deferens resulting in Schild plots with slopes not different from unity {{even in the absence of}} selective inhibition of neuronal uptake. As a major consequence of this double mechanism of action, the pA 2 values for this antagonist are underestimated when calculated in situations where the neuronal uptake is active, yielding spurious pKB values...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} equihypotensive single oral doses of <b>indoramin</b> (mean dose 67 mg), {{phenoxybenzamine}} (mean dose 50 mg), hydralazine (mean dose 133 mg) and placebo on arterial pressure {{and heart rate}} in the supine and standing position was studied in six normal volunteers. Observations were made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug administration. Plasma noradrenaline (NA) was measured at each time interval in the supine position, and after 4 min of standing. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured at each time interval after 30 min in the standing position. The three active drugs reduced systolic arterial pressure in the standing position to a similar extent (<b>indoramin,</b> - 24 mm Hg; phenoxybenzamine, - 23. 4 mm Hg; hydralazine, - 30. 4 mm Hg). The maximum effect of <b>indoramin</b> and phenoxybenzamine was observed at 4 h, and of hydralazine at 2 h after drug administration. The reductions of arterial pressure in the standing position were accompanied by increases in heart rate, plasma NA and PRA. Small increases were observed after <b>indoramin</b> (heart rate, + 9. 2 beats min- 1; plasma NA, + 126 pg/ml; PRA, + 0. 33 ng angiotensin 1 ml- 1 h- 1), greater increases after phenoxybenzamine (heart rate, + 20; plasma NA, + 210; PRA, + 0. 47), and the greatest increases after hydralazine (heart rate, + 26; plasma NA, + 250; PRA, + 1. 16). In the supine position, <b>indoramin</b> and phenoxybenzamine produced no effect on arterial pressure, heart rate or plasma NA. Hydralazine produced small reductions in diastolic pressure, which were accompanied {{by an increase in}} heart rate of 25. 5 beats min- 1 (P less than 0. 01 when compared to placebo) and in plasma NA of 223 pg ml- 1 (P less than 0. 05). Plasma NA, PRA and heart rate increased together and may be regarded as three interdependent indices of sympathetic activity. <b>Indoramin</b> reduced the degree of increase of plasma NA, PRA and heart rate per unit fall in pressure, when compared to phenoxybenzamine and hydralazine. The effect of phenoxybenzamine and hydralazine on the degree of increase was similar. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>indoramin</b> produces selective postsynaptic alpha 1 -adrenoceptor blockade in man, and therefore produces relatively less tachycardia and NA increase than does a non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist (phenoxybenzamine) or an arteriolar vasodilator (hydralazine) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>indoramin,</b> a {{selective}} alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, on exercise tolerance were studied in 15 patients using a random double blind crossover protocol.

Doses were chosen to give equivalent reductions of arterial pressure in the standing position. Observations were made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug administration. Plasma noradrenaline (NA) was measured at each time interval in the supine position, and after 4 min of standing. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured at each time interval after 30 min in the standing position. In the supine position, alinidine produced a significant reduction of systolic arterial pressure from 124. 0 +/- 3. 0 mm Hg to 104. 3 +/- 4. 1 mm Hg at 2 h (P less than 0. 01) and to 101. 7 +/- 2. 2 mm Hg at 4 h (P less than 0. 01).

Peripheral prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptor blockade was measured as the reversal of B-HT 933 -induced inhibition of an electrically evoked tachycardia in the pithed rat.

40|$|Though {{antihypertensive}} {{drugs have}} been in use for many decades, the mechanisms by which they act chronically to reduce blood pressure remain unclear. Over long periods, mean arterial blood pressure must match the perfusion pressure necessary for the kidney to achieve its role in eliminating the daily intake of salt and water.

Methods: This is {{a retrospective analysis}} of observational data from the General Practice Research Database (UK) (GPRD). The cohort contains 4500 patients experiencing BPH or lower urinary tract symptoms strongly suggestive of BPH, aged over 50 years, who were prescribed a 5 ARI (finasteride) or an alpha-blocker (alfuzosin, doxazosin, <b>indoramin,</b> prazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin) as their first BPH treatment between 1996 and 1999 inclusive.

These compounds were also competitive antagonists in the mesenteric and pulmonary arteries (except for 5 -methylurapidil in the pulmonary artery), (prazosin pA 2 9. 9 and 9. 7; WB 4101 pA 2 9. 8 and 9. 6; 5 -methylurapidil pA 2 7. 9 and pKB estimate 8. 0; benoxathian pA 2 8. 8 and 9. 3; <b>indoramin</b> pA 2 7. 2 and 7. 5, respectively). RS[*] 17053 was not a competitive antagonist in any blood vessel as Schild plot slopes were greater than unity. The pKB estimates for RS[*] 17053 were 7. 1 in aorta, 7. 0 in the mesenteric artery and 7. 7 in the pulmonary artery. The α 1 D-subtype selective antagonist BMY[*] 7378 appeared to be non-competitive with shallow Schild plot slopes. The data were better fitted with two lines in all tissues, with Schild plot slopes that were no longer different from unity, except in the pulmonary artery. The higher affinity site for BMY[*] 7378 in the aorta had a pA 2 of 9. 0, while it was 8. 8 and 8. 9 in the mesenteric and pulmonary arteries, respectively. MDL 73005 EF acted in a non-competitive manner in all three blood vessels, with shallow Schild plot slopes. The pKB estimates for MDL 73005 EF were 8. 4 in aorta, 7. 5 in the mesenteric artery and 8. 0 in the pulmonary artery. In all three blood vessels the functionally determined antagonist affinity estimates correlated best with published pKi values for their displacement of [3 H]-prazosin binding on membranes expressing cloned α 1 d-adrenoceptors compared with α 1 a- or α 1 b-adrenoceptors. The antagonist affinity estimates in the aorta, mesenteric and pulmonary arteries correlated highly with their previously published pA 2 values in rat aorta (α 1 D) and less well with those for α 1 A- and α 1 B-adrenoceptors mediating contraction of the rat epididymal vas deferens and rat spleen, respectively.

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{occurrence of}} features of intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) during cataract surgery in patients taking systemic alpha-antagonists (AA). Methods: We prospectively studied patients on AA and who underwent phacoemulsification. The following were recorded: pupil diameter preoperatively, iris flaccidity, iris prolapse and peroperative miosis. Results: We studied 40 eyes of 31 subjects. Mean age was 78 years. Overall, 14 eyes (13 patients) {{showed signs of}} IFIS: 9 / 13 (69 %) eyes of patients on tamsulosin, 1 / 18 (6 %) eyes in the doxazosin group, 2 / 2 prazosin patients, 1 / 4 eyes in the <b>indoramin</b> group, and 1 / 2 eyes in two patients {{on a combination of}} doxazosin and tamsulosin. Most cases (92 %) had only one or two signs of IFIS.

Conclusion: Most AA were associated with IFIS, but it tends to present as a spectrum of signs rather than full triad originally described. Tamsulosin was most likely to be associated with IFIS; however, its intake {{does not necessarily mean that}} IFIS will occur. For patients on AA, the behavior of the iris intraoperatively in one eye is a poor predictor of the other eye. Surgeons should anticipate the occurrence of IFIS in any patient on AA...|$|E
40|$|The α 1 -adrenoceptor {{population}} mediating contractile {{responses to}} noradrenaline (NA) in smooth {{muscles of the}} bladder neck from rabbit (RBN) has been characterized by use of quantitative receptor pharmacology. Experiments with several `key' α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists of varying subtype selectivities (RS- 17053, BMY 7378, <b>indoramin,</b> 5 -methylurapidil, prazosin, REC 15 / 2739, SNAP 5089, terazosin, WB 4101, tamsulosin, (+) -cyclazosin and RS- 100329) were conducted. Schild regression analyses yielded affinity (mean pKb) estimates of 7. 1, 6. 2, 8. 6, 8. 6, 8. 4, 9. 3, 7. 0, 7. 4, 8. 9, 10. 0, 7. 1 and 9. 3, respectively, although deviations from unit Schild regression slope question the robustness of data for RS- 17053 and SNAP 5089. The nature of antagonism by these agents and the profile of affinity determinations generated together suggest that a single α 1 -adrenoceptor subtype mediates contractile responses of RBN to NA. Additional studies with phenylephrine indicated also an agonist-independence of this profile. Pharmacologically, this profile was reminiscent of that described as `α 1 L'-adrenoceptor, which {{has been shown to}} mediate contractions of several tissues including lower urinary tract (LUT) tissues of man. Furthermore, a similarity was noticed between the `α 1 L'-adrenoceptor described here in RBN and the rabbit and human cloned α 1 a-adrenoceptor (based on data from both whole cell radioligand binding at 37 °C and [3 H]-inositol phosphates accumulation assays), characterizations of which have been published elsewhere.

40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} {{association}} between use of alpha-blockers and risk of hip/femur fractures. Design. Population-based case-control study. Setting. General Practice Research Database. Subjects. Cases were defined as men, aged 40 years and older with a first diagnosis for hip/femur fracture. Controls were matched 1 : 1 on gender, year of birth and general practitioner-practice. Results. In all, 4571 cases and {{an equal number of}} controls were identified. Current use of alpha-blockers (prazosin, doxazosin, <b>indoramin,</b> terazosin, alfuzosin and tamsulosin) was compared with non-use of alpha-blockers. Current use of alpha-blockers on the index date was associated with an increased risk of hip/femur fracture [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1. 9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 1 - 3. 0] in the overall analysis. The effect was particularly strong for first prescriptions within a treatment episode (adjusted OR 5. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 31. 7) and during the first month of treatment (adjusted OR 4. 1, 95 % CI: 0. 7 - 23. 9). Stratification according to indication of use showed that current use of alpha-blockers was not associated with hip/femur fracture in men with a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (adjusted OR 1. 0, 95 % CI: 0. 4 - 2. 5), but was associated in men who used alpha-blockers for cardiovascular disease (adjusted OR 2. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 5. 4). Conclusion. Current use of alpha-blockers was associated with an increased risk of hip/femur fracture and with {{the start of a new}} treatment episode. The effect seemed to be confined to patients who used alpha-blockers for cardiovascular disease. Caution with respect to first-dose effects related to the initiation of a new episode of alpha-blocker treatment is advise...|$|E

Methods: We prospectively studied patients on AA and who underwent phacoemulsification. The following were recorded: pupil diameter preoperatively, iris flaccidity, iris prolapse and peroperative miosis. Results: We studied 40 eyes of 31 subjects. Mean age was 78 years. Overall, 14 eyes (13 patients) {{showed signs of}} IFIS: 9 / 13 (69 %) eyes of patients on tamsulosin, 1 / 18 (6 %) eyes in the doxazosin group, 2 / 2 prazosin patients, 1 / 4 eyes in the <b>indoramin</b> group, and 1 / 2 eyes in two patients {{on a combination of}} doxazosin and tamsulosin. Most cases (92 %) had only one or two signs of IFIS. Bilateral cataract surgery was undertaken in 9 patients but only one patient (on tamsulosin) had features of IFIS in both eyes, while 4 patients (2 on tamsulosin and 2 on other AA) showed signs of IFIS in one eye only, and 4 patients did not show IFIS in either eye. Conclusion: Most AA were associated with IFIS, but it tends to present as a spectrum of signs rather than full triad originally described. Tamsulosin was most likely to be associated with IFIS; however, its intake {{does not necessarily mean that}} IFIS will occur. For patients on AA, the behavior of the iris intraoperatively in one eye is a poor predictor of the other eye. Surgeons should anticipate the occurrence of IFIS in any patient on AA.

40|$|Gonadal hormones {{regulate}} {{the expression of}} alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes in several tissues. The present study was carried out {{to determine whether or}} not cyproterone acetate, an anti-androgenic agent, regulates the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes that mediate contractions of the rat vas deferens in response to noradrenaline. The actions of subtype selective alpha 1 -antagonists were investigated in vas deferens from control and cyproterone acetate-treated rats (10 mg/day, sc, for 7 days). Prazosin (pA 2 ~ 9. 5), phentolamine (pA 2 ~ 8. 3) and yohimbine (pA 2 ~ 6. 7) presented competitive antagonism consistent with activation of alpha 1 -adrenoceptors in vas deferens from both control and treated rats. The pA 2 values estimated for WB 4101 (~ 9. 5), benoxathian (~ 9. 7), 5 -methylurapidil (~ 8. 5), <b>indoramin</b> (~ 8. 7) and BMY 7378 (~ 6. 8) indicate that alpha 1 A-adrenoceptors are involved in the contractions of the vas deferens from control and cyproterone acetate-treated rats. Treatment of the vas deferens from control rats with the alpha 1 B/alpha 1 D-adrenoceptor alkylating agent chloroethylclonidine had no effect on noradrenaline contractions, supporting the involvement of the alpha 1 A-subtype. However, this agent partially inhibited the contractions of vas deferens from cyproterone acetate-treated rats, suggesting involvement of multiple receptor subtypes. To further investigate this, the actions of WB 4101 and chloroethylclonidine were reevaluated in the vas deferens from rats treated with cyproterone acetate for 14 days. In these organs WB 4101 presented complex antagonism characterized by a Schild plot with a slope different from unity (0. 65 ± 0. 05). After treatment with chloroethylclonidine, the complex antagonism presented by WB 4101 was converted into classical competitive antagonism, consistent with participation of alpha 1 A-adrenoceptors as well as alpha 1 B-adrenoceptors. These results suggest that cyproterone acetate induces plasticity in the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes involved in the contractions of the vas deferens...|$|E
40|$|Three fully-defined α 1 -adrenoceptors (α 1 A, α 1 B and α 1 D) {{have been}} {{established}} in pharmacological and molecular studies. A fourth α 1 -adrenoceptor, the putative α 1 L-adrenoceptor, has been defined in functional but not molecular studies, and has been proposed to mediate contraction of human lower urinary tract tissues; {{its relationship to the}} three fully characterized α 1 -adrenoceptors is not known. In the present study, binding affinities were estimated by displacement of [3 H]-prazosin in membrane homogenates of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells stably expressing the human α 1 A-, α 1 B- and α 1 D-adrenoceptors and were compared with affinity estimates obtained functionally in identical cells by measuring inhibition of noradrenaline (NA) -stimulated accumulation of [3 H]-inositol phosphates. For the α 1 A-adrenoceptor, binding studies revealed a pharmacological profile typical for the classically defined α 1 A-adrenoceptor, such that prazosin, RS- 17053, WB[*] 4101, 5 -methylurapidil, Rec[*] 15 / 2739 and S-niguldipine all displayed subnanomolar affinity. A different profile of affinity estimates was obtained in inositol phosphates accumulation studies: prazosin, WB[*] 4101, 5 -methylurapidil, RS- 17053 and S-niguldipine showed 10 to 40 fold lower affinity than in membrane binding. However, affinity estimates were not ‘frameshifted', as tamsulosin, <b>indoramin</b> and Rec[*] 15 / 2739 yielded similar, high affinity estimates in binding and functional assays. In contrast, results from human α 1 B- and α 1 D-adrenoceptors expressed in CHO-K 1 cells gave antagonist affinity profiles in binding and functional assays that were essentially identical. A concordance of affinity estimates from the functional (inositol phosphates accumulation) studies of the α 1 A-adrenoceptor in CHO-K 1 cells was found with estimates published recently from contractile studies in human lower urinary tract tissues (putative α 1 L-adrenoceptor). These data show that upon functional pharmacological analysis, the cloned α 1 A-adrenoceptor displays pharmacological recognition properties consistent with those of the putative α 1 L-adrenoceptor. Why this profile differs from that obtained in membrane binding, and whether it explains the α 1 L-adrenoceptor pharmacology observed in many native tissues, requires further investigation...|$|E
