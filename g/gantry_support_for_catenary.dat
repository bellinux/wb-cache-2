50|$|The bridge crosses {{over the}} Columbia River and {{was built on}} {{concrete}} piers 85 ft above the water to provide clearance for any river traffic. The spans include 14 Warren deck trusses, one Parker through truss, and deck plate girders on the approaches. When the railroad electrified in the 1920s, <b>supports</b> <b>for</b> the <b>catenary</b> {{were added to the}} bridge.|$|R
2500|$|Notice how {{the visual}} {{impact of the}} {{overhead}} electrification has been minimised by placing the <b>supporting</b> towers <b>for</b> the <b>catenary</b> on the alternate centre lines of the viaduct's columns, thus maintaining symmetry of form.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{drivers were}} in {{training}} and accompanied by instructors. A passenger on the S-bahn train said he believed that his train had departed against a red signal. A bridge over a road was damaged and left in danger of collapse. [...] A crane {{was brought in to}} recover the derailed carriages, which were then removed by road. About 60 m of track was damaged, along with a number of <b>supports</b> <b>for</b> the <b>catenary.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{structure}} gauge, {{also called}} the minimum clearance outline, is the minimum height and width of tunnels and bridges {{as well as the}} minimum height and width of the doors that allow a rail siding access into a warehouse. In addition, the term may apply to the minimum distance to railway platforms (passenger or freight), buildings, electrical equipment boxes, railway signal equipment, third rails or to <b>supports</b> <b>for</b> overhead <b>catenaries</b> or overhead lines from the track. The width of a narrow cut can also affect the maximum loading gauge.|$|R
50|$|By mid-1949 further bespoke styles {{were being}} built. Burlingham had not built {{trolleybus}} bodies {{during the boom}} in popularity of such vehicles in the 1930s, but received a contract from Portsmouth Corporation to body 15 British United Traction (BUT) 9611T two-axle vehicles in 1949. These followed the operator's ideas on appearance and were generally less bold in outline than the Ribble-style double-deckers, but the operator's idea of enclosing the <b>support</b> <b>gantries</b> <b>for</b> the trolley-booms inside the roof-structure resulted in a top-heavy look, whilst the plentifully lined-out livery and features like an offside destination indicator added to their archaic aspect.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first use}} of {{weathering}} steel for architectural applications was the John Deere World Headquarters in Moline, Illinois. The building was designed by architect Eero Saarinen, and completed in 1964. The main buildings of Odense University, designed by Knud Holscher and Jørgen Vesterholt and built 1971-1976, are clad in weathering steel, earning them the nickname Rustenborg. In 1977, Robert Indiana created a Hebrew version of the Love sculpture made from weathering steel using the four-letter word ahava (אהבה, [...] "love" [...] in Hebrew) for the Israel Museum Art Garden in Jerusalem, Israel. In Denmark, all masts <b>for</b> <b>supporting</b> the <b>catenary</b> on electrified railways are made of weathering steel for aesthetic reasons.|$|R

40|$|The {{crossing}} of rivers in Katanga (Democratic Republic of Congo) by railway {{lines in the}} 1920 s and 1930 s gave Belgian engineers and contractors the opportunity to build record spans for railway bridges. The {{crossing of}} the Lualaba River at Bukama consists of four Vierendeel steel girders each with a 62 m span, which were the largest of their type {{at the time of}} their erection in 1925. The crossing of the Lualaba at Kongolo, built in 1937 – 1939, required a 495 m long reinforced concrete continuous beam bridge with 14 spans, the largest measuring 70 m. It was the first significant concrete beam bridge constructed with a travelling <b>gantry</b> <b>supporting</b> movable formwork. The crossing of the Lukaga River (1938 – 1939) is a three-span concrete bridge with the 70 m long central span built using the cantilever method, which makes this bridge the oldest of its type in the world. This paper highlights the landmark characteristic of these forgotten bridges. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

30|$|Here {{we report}} {{the results from}} a {{computational}} and experimental study that investigated the static responses of a RC frame that had side column loss. We also evaluated the effect of both tensile membrane action in the frame slabs and catenary action in the frame beams to assess the progressive collapse resistance of structures. A one-third scale structure was designed, built and tested. To get more detailed structural information during the progressive collapse, a non-linear numerical analysis was conducted using the LS-DYNA finite element software (Hallquist 2007). Based on experimental and computational results, the mechanism of progressive collapse resistance of RC frames at different stages is discussed further. With large deformations, a simplified calculation method <b>for</b> <b>catenary</b> action and tensile membrane action are proposed.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a concept of}} a {{integrated}} design environment is explained to support {{the development of new}} pantograph concepts. For improving the dynamic behaviour of the combined pantograph/catenary system control units and active elements are considered in the design process. The introduced environment enables new mechatronic approaches for concepts of the complete system as well as for certain components. Therefore the detailed simulation model of the pantograph is set up directly according to the design data. The control concept is adjusted using a design program for control units. Additionally, a specialized simulation program <b>for</b> <b>catenaries</b> was connected to a standard tool for multibody system analysis.

40|$|Catenary {{action in}} a precast {{concrete}} building structural system {{is one of the}} ways to avoid progressive collapse. The key <b>for</b> <b>catenary</b> action to work successfully depends on the strength performance of longitudinal ties, which closely depends on the bond performance between the ties and concrete. This paper investigates the effectiveness of deformed steel bar as catenary tie in precast concrete beam-column connection under column removal scenario. The main objective of the experimental work is to improve the bond performance between deformed steel bar and concrete topping. The parameter considered in the tests is the types of concrete for the topping. The different concrete mixes are normal concrete of Grade 40 and steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC). A series of pullout test specimens are conducted to investigate the bond behavior between the steel ties and the surrounding concrete. The results show the comparison of bond stresses of embedded deformed steel bars in two types of concrete mix. The deformed steel bar with concrete fiber provides higher bond strength as compared to bond in normal concrete. Therefore, it is more suitable <b>for</b> effective <b>catenary</b> tie in precast concrete beam-column connection for maximum efficiency and deformability in order to minimize progressive collapse...|$|R
