5|$|King Stephen sent Hilary {{to attend}} a church council at Reims in 1148 along with Robert de Bethune, who was the Bishop of Hereford, and William de Turbeville. Theobald of Bec was also present, even though the king had {{forbidden}} him to attend. The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury stated that Stephen wanted to weaken Theobald's standing with the papacy, but Stephen also would have wished to assert his authority over the English Church by <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right to limit papal contact with the English bishops, something that his predecessors had always done.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{call for}} {{automated}} transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; no changes were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> need to cut power to equipment {{in the event of}} a fire. Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered.|$|E
5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right {{to intervene in}} the boundary dispute, accepting arbitration in principle without <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation. Negotiations between the United States and Britain over the details of the arbitration followed, and Britain was able to persuade the US of much of its views, even as {{it became clear that the}} eventual report of the Boundary Commission would likely be negative towards the British claims. An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|E

Ōno <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> surrendering to <b>the</b> Tokugawa shogunate, whereas Ōishi and other retainers <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> defending <b>the</b> castle. However, Ōno <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> necessity of distributing remaining money according to annual earnings, while Ōishi <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> favoring those with lower incomes. It was distributed according to Ōishi's wish.|$|R

He met with Kosa Pan, now Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the new King Phetracha, but the meeting {{remained}} purely formal and led to nothing. He apparently kept <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a French fort in Tenasserim, with the effect that negotiations were broken off without any result.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} relations of Albania began to function {{on a state}} level after it was proclaimed independent and the first diplomatic efforts of its government were requests for the international recognition of the Albanian state. In December 1912, a delegation of Albania submitted a memorandum to the London Conference of 1913 <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ethnic rights of Albanians and requested an international recognition of the independent Albania composed of Kosovo, western Macedonia including Skopje and Bitola and the whole territory of Epirus up to Arta.|$|E
25|$|While the American {{public and}} {{leadership}} were {{not ready for}} war, the path to an eventual declaration of war had been set {{as a result of}} the sinking of the Lusitania. On 19 August U-24 sank the White Star liner , with the loss of 44 passengers and crew, three of whom were American. The German government, while <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy of its campaign against Allied shipping, disavowed the sinking of the Arabic; it offered an indemnity and pledged to order submarine commanders to abandon unannounced attacks on merchant and passenger vessels.|$|E

25|$|Wise {{returned}} to the United States in 1847, and resumed the practice of law. He identified with the Democratic Party, and was active in politics. A delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, Wise opposed any reforms, <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protection of slavery came first. In the statewide election of 1855, Wise was elected Governor of Virginia, defeating Know-Nothing candidate Thomas S. Flournoy. He was the 33rd Governor of Virginia, serving from 1856 to 1860. Wise County, Virginia, was named after him when it was established in 1856. One of his last official acts as Governor was to sign the death warrant of John Brown.|$|E
25|$|In his {{twenties and}} early thirties, von Braun worked in Nazi Germany's rocket {{development}} program, where he helped design {{and develop the}} V-2 rocket at Peenemünde during World War II. Following the war, von Braun worked for the United States Army on an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) program before his group was assimilated into NASA. Under NASA, he served {{as director of the}} newly formed Marshall Space Flight Center and as the chief architect of the Saturn V launch vehicle, the superbooster that propelled the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. In 1975, he received the National Medal of Science. He continued <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> human mission to Mars throughout his life.|$|E

The situation did not remain stable for long, when the Shan Federal Movement, started by Nyaung Shwe Sawbwa Sao Shwe Thaik (the first President of independent Burma 1948–52) and aspiring to a 'loose' federation, was seen as a separatist movement <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> government honouring the right to secession in 10 years provided for by the 1947 Constitution. Ne Win had already succeeded in stripping the Shan Sawbwas of their feudal powers in exchange for comfortable pensions for life in 1959.|$|E

25|$|The purely {{scientific}} side of Grimm's character developed slowly. He {{seems to}} have felt the want of definite principles of etymology {{without being able to}} discover them, and indeed even in the first edition of his grammar (1819) he often seemed to be groping in the dark. As early as 1815 we find August Wilhelm von Schlegel reviewing the Altdeutsche Wälder (a periodical published by the two brothers) very severely, condemning the lawless etymological combinations it contained, and <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> necessity of strict philological method and a fundamental investigation of the laws of language, especially in the correspondence of sounds. This criticism is said to have had a considerable influence on the direction of Grimm's studies.|$|E
25|$|When the Depression {{struck in}} 1930, the Scullin {{government}} split over its response. Lyons became the leading advocate {{within the government}} of orthodox finance and deflationary economic policies, and an opponent of the inflationary, proto-Keynesian policies of Treasurer Ted Theodore. Theodore {{was forced to resign}} over accusations of corruption in June 1930, and Scullin took over the Treasury portfolio in addition to the Prime Ministership. Lyons served as acting Treasurer from August 1930 to January 1931 while Scullin was in Britain for the Imperial Conference. In October 1930 Lyons announced his plan for recovery, <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> need to maintain a balanced budget and cut public spending and salaries, although also advising lower interest rates and the provision of greater credit for industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} the revolt {{are thought to have}} been religious. After al-Hawari's death, the Roman emperor Valens, an Arian heterodox, decided to {{disregard}} the requests of the Arabs for an orthodox bishop, <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> appointment of an Arian bishop instead. Mavia withdrew from Aleppo into the desert with her people, forming alliances with desert Arabs and gaining support throughout much of Arabia and Syria, in preparation for the fight against Roman rule. It is unclear as to whether Mavia herself was Christian at this time or not. Some historians report that it was during her military exploits that she met an ascetic monk who so impressed her that she converted to orthodox Christianity. All agree, however, that the conditions she set for any truce with Rome, was this monk's appointment as bishop over her people.|$|E

25|$|Joseph's reforms outraged nobles {{and clergy}} of Hungary, and the peasants of country grew {{dissatisfied}} with taxes, conscription, and requisitions of supplies. Hungarians perceived Joseph's language reform as German cultural hegemony, and they reacted by <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right to use}} their own tongue. As a result, Hungarian lesser nobles sparked a renaissance of the Hungarian language and culture, and a cult of national dance and costume flourished. The lesser nobles questioned the loyalty of the magnates, of whom less than half were ethnic Hungarians, and even those had become French- and German-speaking courtiers. The Hungarian national reawakening subsequently triggered national revivals among the Slovak, Romanian, Serbian, and Croatian minorities within Hungary and Transylvania, who felt threatened by both German and Hungarian cultural hegemony. These national revivals later blossomed into the nationalist movements of the 19th and 20h centuries that contributed to the empire's ultimate collapse.|$|E
25|$|By 1400, most English {{and some}} Scottish people used {{surnames}}, but many Scottish and Welsh {{people did not}} adopt surnames until the 17th century, or even later. Henry VIII (ruled 1509–1547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. In England and cultures derived from there, there {{has long been a}} tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband's family name. (See Maiden and married names.) The first known instance in the United States of a woman <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855; {{and there has been a}} general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage.|$|E
25|$|While the R.II was in storage, the Idflieg {{changed its}} {{requirements}} for the aircraft, requesting that the operational altitude be increased from , but hoping that even more altitude would be possible. Siemens-Schuckert responded that {{this would not be}} possible with the Mercedes engines recently approved for installation, and suggested three Benz D.IV engines inside the fuselage, augmented by two more of the same engine mounted pusher-fashion in the interplane gap. The Idflieg rejected this suggestion, <b>insisting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basic requirement of having the engines serviceable in flight. By the time that workers were available for the R.II again, in early 1917, Siemens-Schuckert had gained experience with the similar R.VII and attempted to meet the Idfliegs requirements by installing extra sections in the wing to extend it to six bays and thereby offset the extra weight of the new engines. The upper wings were replaced with a new design with greater chord, and the tail surfaces were enlarged. Finally, bomb racks were fitted to the wings that could carry either six 50-kg bombs or four 100-kg bombs.|$|E
