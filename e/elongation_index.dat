40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} from experimental and human epidemiological studies that many pollutants can disrupt lipid metabolism. In Arctic wildlife, {{the occurrence of}} such compounds could have serious consequences for seasonal feeders. We set out to study whether organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) could cause disruption of energy metabolism in female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Svalbard, Norway (n = 112). We analyzed biomarkers of energy metabolism including the abundance profiles of nine lipid-related genes, fatty acid (FA) synthesis and <b>elongation</b> <b>indices</b> in adipose tissue, and concentrations of lipid-related variables in plasma (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides). Furthermore, the plasma metabolome and lipidome were characterized by low molecular weight metabolites and lipid fingerprinting, respectively. Polychlorinated biphenyls, chlordanes, brominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoroalkyl substances {{were significantly related to}} biomarkers involved in lipid accumulation, FA metabolism, insulin utilization, and cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, the effects of pollutants were measurable at the metabolome and lipidome levels. Our results indicate that several OHCs affect lipid biosynthesis and catabolism in female polar bears. Furthermore, these effects were more pronounced when combined with reduced sea ice extent and thickness, suggesting that climate- driven sea ice decline and OHCs have synergistic negative effects on polar bears...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A lowered {{cerebral}} perfusion as {{a consequence}} of hemodynamic microcirculatory insufficiency is one of the factors underlying in Alzheimer's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to progressive cognitive impairment. Erythrocyte deformability {{is one of the major}} factors affecting the microcirculatory hemodynamics which is closely related to the oxidative damage. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the erythrocyte deformability, nitric oxide levels and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease. Methods: The blood samples of 30 elderly people in three groups consisting of healthy control and different severities of the disease (low and severe) were used. Then the erythrocytes were isolated and the deformability of erythrocytes was determined by Rheodyne SSD evaluating the <b>elongation</b> <b>indexes</b> of the erythrocytes under different shear stress. The catalase, glutathione peroxidase and plasma nitric oxide levels were measured spectrophotometric ally. Results: The plasma nitric oxide levels, catalase activities were found significantly higher and glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly lower in severe Alzheimer's disease patients compared to the control group. However, the deformability of erythrocytes was not significantly affected from these alterations. Conclusion: the oxidant-antioxidant status is dramatically changed in Alzheimer's disease patients with the severity of the disease and similar alterations were seen in the nitric oxide levels without any significant change in erythrocyte deformability.

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} nitric oxide metabolites (nitrite and nitrate), expressed as NOx, and erythrocyte deformability, expressed as <b>elongation</b> <b>index,</b> {{in a group of}} subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We enrolled 48 subjects (36 men and 12 women; mean age 50. 3 ± 14. 68 yrs) with OSAS diagnosed after a 1 -night cardiorespiratory sleep study. OSAS severity was assessed evaluating the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) and subjects were subdivided in two subgroups: Low (L = AHI 30). NOx was examined converting nitrate into nitrite with a nitrate reductase and then assessing nitrite with spectrophotometry after the addition of Griess reagent. The <b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> was obtained using the diffractometer Rheodyn SSD of Myrenne at shear stresses of 30 and 60 Pa and it was expressed as <b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> (EI). We found no difference in NOx among the entire group of OSAS subjects and normal controls, while we observed a NOx decrease in the H subgroup in comparison with L subgroup, but not in comparison with normal controls. We noted a significant decrease in EI at each shear stress in the entire group and also in the two subgroups in comparison with controls. The decrease in NO bioavailability and in erythrocyte deformability might contribute to explain the increased cardiovascular risk in OSAS subjects...|$|E
40|$|The {{life span}} of donor red blood cells (RBCs) is reduced in the fetus with Rh {{hemolytic}} disease. This may have resulted from donor or recipient factors. Studied in vitro was the effect of gamma irradiation on hemolysis, methemo-globin (metHb), and lipid peroxidation of donor RBCs {{and the ability of}} fetal and adult plasma to protect irradiated RBCs from induced lipid peroxidation. Also studied in vivo were the effects after the time that donor RBCs reside in the fetus by measuring its lipid peroxidation, cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios, and deformability of RBCs. Irradiation barely increased hemolysis and metHb formation and did not increase lipid peroxidation. Plasma samples of D+ fetuses inhibited induced oxidative stress less than plasma samples of adults. Nevertheless, in vivo lipid peroxidation of the donor RBC membrane had not increased, whereas the molar cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio increased from 1. 08 +/- 0. 11 to 1. 38 +/- 0. 12. It became identical to that of the fetal RBCs (1. 44 +/- 0. 12). Before transfusion, the deformability of the adult RBCs (<b>elongation</b> <b>index,</b> 0. 578 +/- 0. 013) was better than that of the fetal cells (<b>elongation</b> <b>index,</b> 0. 494 +/- 0. 027), but decreased to fetal levels after transfusion (<b>elongation</b> <b>index,</b> 0. 518 +/- 0. 039). Irradiation of the RBCs and a reduced fetal antioxidant capacity do not lead to in vivo lipid peroxidation.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} the physiologic status of human tumor cells {{in relation to}} the tumor vasculature. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen tumors of 11 first-generation xenograft lines of human head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma were injected with the hypoxic cell marker pimonidazole, the proliferation marker BrdUrd, and the perfusion marker Hoechst 33342. Consecutive tissue sections were processed with immunohistochemical methods and analyzed with image-analysis techniques. RESULTS: Three different hypoxic patterns were found: patchy, ribbon-like, and mixed. An image-analysis method was developed to {{quantify the}}se, and an <b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> (length/width) was calculated for hypoxia. The mean elongation indices ranged from 2. 0 to 28. 3 and showed a good correlation with the visual scoring of hypoxic patterns. Comparative analysis of hypoxic and proliferating cells in zones around the tumor vasculature showed the presence of both hypoxic and proliferating cells in all zones up to 250 microm from the vessels. The largest coexistence of hypoxic and proliferating cells seemed to occur at 50 - 100 microm from the vessels. CONCLUSIONS: The three hypoxic patterns could be quantified by an <b>elongation</b> <b>index,</b> which is an additional parameter that allows distinction of tumors with similar fractions of hypoxic cells. The analysis of hypoxic and proliferating cells as a function of distance from the tumor vasculature indicates that proliferation does occur also at low oxygen tensions...|$|E

B. microphylla cloned plants have been introduced from Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego to Buenos Aires province in order to evaluate its phenotypic plasticity and the possibility of fruit production. At the same time, a comparative study on the morphology and anatomy of the mature leaves of B. microphylla grown in two different environmental conditions was carried out. Moreno leaves were significantly larger than Ushuaia leaves in all the morphological parameters registered, while Ushuaia leaves were more circular than Moreno leaves with the highest roundness and <b>elongation</b> <b>indexes.</b> Nevertheless, histological sections showed that Ushuaia leaves have one more layer of palisade cells respect to Moreno leaves. Ushuaia leaves showed higher palisade cells, larger abaxial epidermal cells and thicker cuticles than Moreno leaves. The stomatal density was superior on Moreno leaves. SEM of abaxial epidermis showed a surface with numerous ridges of different forms that prevent the layout of epidermal cells on Moreno leaves. Appearance of this surface is glossy and oily. On the contrary, epidermal cells are well recognized on Ushuaia leaves. Stomata of anomocytic type were observed and surface looks waxy. Auto-fluorescence on leaf cross sections were observed on the vascular bundles and partially on the epidermis cells. B. microphylla leaves showed a high phenotypic plasticity between the two sites of cultivation. The changes in the leaf morphology and structure observed in Moreno leaves could indicate that the plants are trying to adjust its morphology to the new culture conditions i. e. higher temperatures and lower irradiance.

40|$|The use of {{recycled}} concrete aggregates in Portland cement concrete and granular road base or sub-base works has increased steadily {{all over the}} world in order to conserve the limited natural aggregate deposits. The recycling of the demolished concrete aggregate for the use in concrete or granular pavement works will not only help to protect the environment but also an economical benefit to the user. The main drawback for the bulk utilization of demolished or recycled aggregate is its characterization and proper quality control during its production. The overall objective of this research was to characterize recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) obtained from a demolished foundation structure and to determine its suitability for Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) works and use as a granular road base or sub-base material. Tests were carried out on RCA samples to determine whether it meets the specification for concrete aggregate material or a granular road base and sub-base materials. Several concrete mixes consisting of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 % replacement of natural coarse aggregates (NCA) with RCA were prepared and tested for compressive strength after curing periods of 7, 14, and 28 days. The compressive strength of concrete made with various percentages of RCA decreased with increasing RCA content but it increased with curing period for all concrete mixes. The durability parameters of the natural aggregates and RCA samples were investigated by using sulfate soundness, rapid freeze-thaw and micro-deval tests to ascertain their chemical and abrasive resistance. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of RCA base was also compared with that of a natural road base material to determine its suitability for road base or sub-base works. In this study, the flakiness and <b>elongation</b> <b>indices</b> of the RCA were found to be better than that of conventional natural aggregates.

The study examined 56 patients. The mean follow-up time was 5 years and 6 months. The mean age {{at the start of}} treatment was 19 years and 10 months. Patients underwent derotational corticotomies of distal metaphysis of the femur or proximal metaphysis of the tibia using the Ilizarov method. In these patients, following derotational corticotomies with the Ilizarov method, numerous variables were defined and their effect evaluated: the selected treatment strategy, the rate, size, type, and level of derotation on complications, the alignment index, the correction coefficient, the <b>elongation</b> <b>index,</b> and deformation correction factor. ResultsThe differences in the values of alignment index and deformation correction factor in this study subgroups were not statistically significant. We found differences in the <b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> and correction coefficient in a number of subgroups.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the role of some erythrocyte patterns (Red Blood Cell deformability, aggregability, cytosolic calcium concentration) in normal tension glaucoma (NTG), compared with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety patients entered the study, divided in three groups: age and sex-matched, otherwise normal subjects (30 patients), POAG (30 patients) and NTG patients (30 patients). Hemorheological parameters (<b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> [EI] and aggregability half time [At 1 / 2] were detected using a laser diffractometer system (Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer [LORCA]). Cytosolic calcium levels were measured using spectrofluorimetry. RESULTS: No significant difference in systemic variables and refractive error was found. Mean hematocrit level, cell volume, plasma protein level and coagulation factors did not show any statistical difference among groups and resulted to be in the range of normality. A significant decrease in EI measurements was demonstrated in the NTG group (p< 0. 001) only. Similarly, A-t 1 / 2 measurements were significantly smaller in the NTG group than in the other groups (p< 0. 001). Cytosolic calcium levels were significantly higher in the NTG group than in the other groups (p< 0. 001) and they were correlated to the <b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> for each group and overall (r=- 0. 756, p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease of erythrocyte deformability and increase in aggregability was found in NTG patients. These alterations seem to be inversely related to the intracytosolic calcium levels and they were not found in POAG patients and controls. Those results may contribute to understand the pathogenesis of normal tension glaucoma, suggesting a possible role played by red blood cells...|$|E

Although it has been reported that striae-shaped or slit-shaped lamina pores are more frequent in eyes with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), this observation is based only on fundus photography. The primary object of this study is to perform layer-by-layer comparisons of the shape of lamina pores within the LC in vivo. Cross-sectional study. Optic nerve head B-scans were obtained using custom-made broad-wavelength optical coherence tomography with a mode-locked laser. A total of 300 single B-scans per eye were obtained and three-dimensional images were rendered from these image sequences to obtain 2 -μm thin-slice en face images of the LC. <b>Elongation</b> <b>indices</b> (EIs) of the lamina pores were measured from the anterior surface (AS) of the LC to the deeper layers in 40 -μm increments. Thirteen eyes from 10 primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients of mean deviation - 15. 2 (- 16. 5, - 12. 9) (median [25, 75 percentile]) dB and 10 eyes from 7 normal controls were studied. Although the EI value was not significantly different between the superior, temporal and inferior regions of the LC at any depth level in either group, it was greater at the AS than at the 40 μm and 80 μm depth levels (P <. 001) in both groups, and was greater in the POAG group only at the AS and 40 μm depth level (P ≤. 05). After adjustment for age and refraction, the effects of depth and presence of POAG on the EI value remained significant. Also, the severity of glaucoma and depth were significant factors associated with EI in multivariate analysis. Elongation of lamina pores was significantly more evident at the anterior surface and the 40 -μm depth level of the LC in POAG eyes than in normal eyes, suggesting that nerve fiber bundles passing through the LC were under greater stress in the anterior layers of the LC...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring gonad {{maturation}} for protandrous {{and functional}} hermaphrodite {{species such as}} the giant clam Tridacna maxima is difficult due to the juxtaposition and relative proportion {{of male and female}} tissues in the gonad [gonadal sex ratio (GSR) ]. Here, the relevance of the widely used gonadosomatic index (GSI) as proxy of giant clam gonad maturation is tested with a large dataset (n = 265). Gonadosomatic index is compared with other indices, namely the proportion of the male part harboring spermatozoids, the proportion of empty oocyte follicles, the mean oocyte diameter, and the oocyte elongation. At gonad scale, high index variability highlighted partial spawning. At individual scale, male and female maturation proxies were contrasted, showing either asynchronous emissions of male and female gametes or contrasted spermatogenesis and oogenesis duration. The GSI was mostly driven by the number and diameter of oocytes and therefore it is recommended here as primary proxy for female maturity. Except for the oocyte <b>elongation,</b> all <b>indices</b> were affected by the GSR, which ruled out drawing conclusions at population scale.

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{changes in}} {{red blood cell}} (RBC) rheology over time in critically ill patients with sepsis and their relationship with outcome. Methods: In this prospective, non-interventional study, RBC rheology was assessed using the Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer in {{a convenience sample of}} intensive care unit (ICU) patients with (n = 64) and without (n = 160) sepsis. Results were compared to measures in healthy volunteers (n = 20). RBC rheology was also assessed on days 1 and 3 of the ICU stay in 32 of the non-septic and 19 of the septic patients. RBC deformability was determined by the <b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> (El) in relation to the shear stress (0. 3 to 50 Pa) applied to the RBC membrane. An aggregation index (AI) was assessed simultaneously with the same device. Results: The ICU mortality rate of the septic patients was 31...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study general {{morphological}} characteristics of pollen grains of Corylus avellana L. Seven samples of pollen were investigated. Samples were collected from different habitats in Ukraine – from botanical gardens (Kyiv, Kamianets-Podilskyi) and natural habitats (Kyiv region, Kamianets-Podilskyi, and Sumy region). We studied such morphological traits of pollen grains as length of polar and equatorial axes, diameter of pores, {{and shape of the}} pollen grain (<b>elongation</b> <b>index).</b> Analysis of morphological characters of pollen was carried out using electron microscope. Comparison of data was performed with the data of the base polleninfo. org. During research the differences in these parameters were marked. Pollen grains of C. avellana are generally isopolar, from suboblate to oblate or oblate-spheroidal, and contain 3 pores. The article contains an attempt to explain the size variations noted for the pollen collected from different habitats...|$|E
40|$|Is there isomorphy in eggs {{belonging}} to {{species of the}} family Ardeidae? Egg shapes in birds reflect many anatomical, biophysical and ecological aspects. In previous literature it has been assumed that a similarity in volumetric indexes from external dimensions is an indicator of constancy in shape of egret eggs (Birds, Ardeidae), but results are not consistent. Previous researchers have used lineal dimension rates to estimate shape, but these can distort the results because both aspects are orthogonal by definition. In the current research we analyze differences in egg shape between eight species of egrets and herons using elliptic Fourier descriptors and landmarks over 203 digital pictures of eggs kept in oological collections. Comparison between species and a discriminate function analysis show that shape is insufficient to distinguish species. The <b>elongation</b> <b>index</b> and breadth of eggs were significantly correlated. Our results suggest that egg shape can discriminate ecological groups but not species, indicating there is no general isomorphy in Ardeidae...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of translation, ribosomes first {{assemble}} on mRNAs (translation initiation) and then translate along the mRNA (elongation) to synthesize proteins. Elongation pausing is deemed highly relevant to co-translational folding of nascent peptides and the functionality of protein products, which positioned the evaluation of elongation speed {{as one of the}} central questions in the field of translational control. By integrating three types of RNA-seq methods, we experimentally and computationally resolved elongation speed, with our proposed <b>elongation</b> velocity <b>index</b> (EVI), a relative measure at individual gene level and under physiological condition in human cells. We successfully distinguished slow-translating genes from the background translatome. We demonstrated that low-EVI genes encoded more stable proteins. We further identified cell-specific slow-translating codons, which might serve as a causal factor of elongation deceleration. As an example for the biological relevance, we showed that the relatively slow-translating genes tended {{to be associated with the}} maintenance of malignant phenotypes per pathway analyses. In conclusion, EVI opens a new view to understand why human cells tend to avoid simultaneously speeding up translation initiation and decelerating elongation, and the possible cancer relevance of translating low-EVI genes to gain better protein quality...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the sexual maturity of fourteen male wild-caught hawksbill turtles [straight carapace length (SCL) range 63 - 79 cm] held in captivity, we investigated their hormone levels {{in blood and}} morphological characteristics. Male turtles {{were divided into two}} groups: five individuals showing mating behavior (group A) and nine individuals not showing mating behavior (group B). Then, seasonal changes of plasma testosterone of both groups were studied. We also tried to determine male maturity based on tail <b>elongation</b> (TE) <b>index,</b> i. e., the ratio of tail length (TL) to SCL. Plasma testosterone level of group A gradually increased during premating and then sharply declined to low levels between mating and postmating seasons. In contrast, that of group B remained low during the experimental periods. The distinct seasonal changes of plasma testosterone levels of groups A and B correlated with their maturity. Furthermore, males were clearly divided into mature and immature based on TE values > 0. 35 and < 0. 33, respectively, corresponding to results based on plasma testosterone levels. Our results indicate that TE can be used more conveniently and accurately to determine maturity of male hawksbill turtles in captivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hydrothermal {{humification}} (HTH) {{is a novel}} way {{to treat}} biomass {{in order to produce}} soil conditioner or organic fertilizer. A plant seed germination technique was used to assess the effect of HTH material derived from garden waste on seed germination, root <b>elongation</b> and germination <b>index</b> (GI) of cucumber at different stages of incubation. The incubation experiment was carried out with the mixture of HTH material and soil at a ratio of 1 : 3, 1 : 5 and 1 : 10 (HTH material:soil, wet weight) in soil. The results showed there are direct positive effects of the HTH material on seed germination and root growth. GI all were over 80 %. High addition rates had non significantly negative effects on plant growth...|$|R
