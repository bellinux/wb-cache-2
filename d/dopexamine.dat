40|$|Dobutamine and <b>dopexamine</b> are {{synthetic}} adrenergic {{agents that}} can efficiently increase cardiac out-put and oxygen supply with {{little effect on}} arterial pressure.

Dobutamine and <b>dopexamine</b> administration resulted in a significant and similar increase in cardiac output due to increases in stroke volume and heart rate.

40|$|<b>Dopexamine</b> is an agonist at {{peripheral}} dopamine receptors and at beta 2 -adrenoceptors. <b>Dopexamine</b> has approximately {{one-third the}} potency of dopamine in stimulating the vascular DA 1 -receptor in the dog, resulting in a fall in renal vascular resistance of 20 % at 2. 3 X 10 (- 8) mol kg- 1 (i. a.). Prejunctional DA 2 -receptors are also stimulated by <b>dopexamine,</b> resulting in a reduction of neurogenic vasoconstriction in the rabbit isolated ear artery (IC 50 of 1. 15 X 10 (- 6) M) and of neurogenic tachycardia in the cat (ID 50 of 5. 4 X 10 (- 8) mol kg- 1, i. v.), with a potency six and four times less respectively than that of dopamine. By contrast, <b>dopexamine</b> is approximately 60 times more potent than dopamine as an agonist at the beta 2 -adrenoceptor of the guinea-pig isolated tracheal chain, with an EC 50 of 1. 5 X 10 (- 6) M. Both <b>dopexamine</b> and dopamine are weak agonists at the guinea-pig atrial beta 1 -adrenoceptor over the concentration range 10 (- 7) to 10 (- 4) M, but <b>dopexamine</b> has an intrinsic activity of only 0. 16 relative to dopamine. <b>Dopexamine</b> does not stimulate postjunctional alpha 1 - or alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the canine isolated saphenous vein, whereas dopamine is an agonist, approximately 120 times less potent than noradrenaline. Unlike dopamine and salbutamol, <b>dopexamine</b> does not cause arrhythmias in the guinea-pig isolated perfused heart at doses of up to 10 (- 5) mol, which is a thousand times the minimum cardiostimulant dose. The combination of agonist properties at peripheral dopamine receptors and at beta 2 -adrenoceptors, {{with little or no}} activity at alpha- and beta 1 -adrenoceptors gives <b>dopexamine</b> a novel pharmacological profile.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Vasoactive {{agents and}} inotropes {{influence}} conduit-coronary blood flow following {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG). It was hypothesized that <b>dopexamine</b> hydrochloride, a dopamine A- 1 (DA- 1) and beta(2) agonist would increase conduit-coronary blood flow. A prospective randomized double blind clinical trial was carried out to test this hypothesis. DA- 1 receptors have previously been localized to human left ventricle. METHODS: Twenty-six American Society of Anaesthesiology class 2 - 3 elective {{coronary artery bypass graft}} patients who did not require inotropic support on separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied. According to a randomized allocation patients received either <b>dopexamine</b> (1 microg/kg per min) or placebo (saline) by intravenous infusion for 15 min. Immediately prior to and at 5, 10 and 15 min of infusion, blood flow through the internal mammary and vein grafts (Transit time flow probes, Transonic Ltd.), heart rate, cardiac index, mean arterial pressure and pulmonary haemodynamics were noted. The data were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: Low-dose <b>dopexamine</b> (1 microg/kg per min) caused a significant increase in mammary graft blood flow compared to placebo at 15 min of infusion (P= 0. 028, <b>dopexamine</b> group left internal mammary artery (LIMA) flow of 43. 3 +/- 14. 2 ml/min, placebo group LIMA flow at 26. 1 +/- 16. 3 ml/min). <b>Dopexamine</b> recipients demonstrated a non-significant trend to increased saphenous vein graft flow (P= 0. 059). Increased heart rate was the only haemodynamic change induced by <b>dopexamine</b> (P= 0. 004, <b>dopexamine</b> group at 85. 2 +/- 9. 6 beats/min and placebo group at 71. 1 +/- 7. 6 beats/min after 15 min of infusion). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that administration of <b>dopexamine</b> (1 microg/kg per min) was associated with a significant increase in internal mammary artery graft blood flow with mild increase in heart rate being the only haemodynamic change. Low-dose <b>dopexamine</b> may improve graft flow in the early post CABG period with minimal haemodynamic changes...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{concentrations}} of <b>dopexamine</b> were measured in five female patients {{during and after}} orthotopic liver transplantation. Each patient received a continuous infusion of the drug (2 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1), starting at induction of anaesthesia and finishing 48 h afterwards. Blood {{concentrations of}} <b>dopexamine</b> increased rapidly {{at the start of}} the infusion, to a mean (range) value of 64 (40 - 150) ng ml- 1 after 20 min.

40|$|Dopamine receptors of the DA 1 subtype {{have been}} {{identified}} in mesenteric blood vessels, stimulation of which leads to vasodilation. In this study, we have determined the anatomical localization of dopexamine-hydrochloride-binding sites and carried out functional characterization of responses to this DA 1 -receptor and beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist in rat mesenteric vasculature. Autoradiographic studies showed the presence of [3 H]-dopexamine-binding sites in all the different layers of the mesenteric artery. The DA 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 (IC 50 = 4. 9 mumol/l), and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (IC 50 = 6. 0 mumol/l), inhibited the binding of <b>dopexamine.</b> The inhibitory effect of these compounds on <b>dopexamine</b> binding was selective for different regions of the mesenteric artery. Also, <b>dopexamine</b> produced concentration-related increases in cAMP formation in membrane particles from superior mesenteric artery and its main branches. The presence of both SCH 23390 and propranolol was required to completely abolish dopexamine-induced increases in cAMP formation. In functional studies, <b>dopexamine</b> (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min) produced dose-related increases in mesenteric blood flow (23 and 38 %, respectively) which were accompanied by concomitant decreases in the calculated mesenteric vascular resistance. As seen with increases in cAMP, the vascular responses to <b>dopexamine</b> could be completely abolished only by prior treatment with both SCH 23390 and propranolol. These results suggest that in mesenteric vasculature of rat <b>dopexamine</b> binds primarily to DA 1 receptors and beta 2 -adrenoceptors.

40|$|AbstractDopexamine {{hydrochloride}} {{is a new}} synthetic catechol {{that offers}} a unique profile of adrenergic and dopaminergic activity. In this multicenter, parallel design, placebo-controlled study, 45 patients with functional class III or IV chronic congestive heart failure were randomized to receive a placebo infusion or one of three different doses of <b>dopexamine.</b> After a 2 -h dose titration sequence, patients received a 6 -h constant dose infusion. During this 6 -h period, <b>dopexamine</b> was infused at rates of 1, 2 and 4 μg/kg body weight per min in the low, intermediate and high dose groups, respectively. In patients receiving high dose infusion, <b>dopexamine</b> produced a 78 % increase in cardiac index associated with a 43 % decrease in systemic vascular resistance and 24 % increase in heart rate (p < 0. 05 vs. placebo for all three variables). There was a trend (p = NS) toward a moderate increase in cardiac index at low and intermediate doses. In patients randomized to receive <b>dopexamine,</b> right atrial, systemic arterial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures showed minimal change from baseline and did not differ statistically from the placebo response. Very few patients developed adverse reactions related to doptxamine, although five patients randomized to receive high dose and three patients randomized to receive intermediate dose <b>dopexamine</b> required dose reduction because hemodynamic variables exceeded arbitrary safety limits or the patients developed symptoms related to the study medication. <b>Dopexamine</b> in higher doses effectively increases cardiac index in association with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Additional clinical studies are indicated to evaluate the merits of <b>dopexamine</b> in comparison with other inotropic and vasodilator medications...|$|E
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} <b>dopexamine</b> and dopamine were compared in the anaesthetized and conscious dog {{by the use}} of intravenous infusions over the dose range 3 X 10 (- 9) - 10 (- 7) mol kg- 1 min- 1. In the anaesthetized dog, <b>dopexamine</b> produced a dose-related fall in blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilatation and a small rise in heart rate and contractility. By contrast, dopamine did not significantly reduce blood pressure but produced a larger dose-related increase in contractility. At the highest infusion rate (10 (- 7) mol kg- 1 min- 1) blood pressure and heart rate were increased by dopamine. <b>Dopexamine</b> dilated the renal and mesenteric vascular beds with a potency similar to that of dopamine. Femoral vascular responses produced by both agents were inconsistent but the highest infusion rate of dopamine did produce vasoconstriction. With the aid of selective receptor antagonists (haloperidol, propranolol and bulbocapnine) the vasodepressor activity of <b>dopexamine</b> was shown to be mediated by stimulation of DA 2 -, beta- and DA 1 -receptors. The cardiac stimulation and renal vasodilatation produced by both compounds were due to stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors and DA 1 -receptors respectively. In the conscious dog, intravenous infusion of <b>dopexamine</b> caused a dose-related fall in blood pressure, renal vasodilatation and an increase in cardiac contractility and heart rate. Dopamine also increased cardiac contractility, and renal blood flow due to renal vasodilatation but without affecting heart rate. At the highest infusion rate, blood pressure was increased. <b>Dopexamine</b> and dopamine produced a similar incidence of panting and repetitive licking at 3 X 10 (- 8) mol kg- 1 min- 1 and emesis at 10 (- 7) mol kg- 1 min- 1, due to stimulation of dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. <b>Dopexamine</b> produces a different cardiovascular profile from dopamine in the anaesthetized and conscious dog. Both compounds reduce renal vascular resistance, but in contrast to dopamine, <b>dopexamine</b> reduces afterload and produces only mild inotropic stimulation. These differences reflect contrasting activity at adrenoceptors...|$|E

INTRODUCTION: The effects of <b>dopexamine,</b> a Î² 2 -agonist, on perioperative and sepsis-related hemodynamic, microvascular, immune, and organ dysfunction are controversial and poorly understood. We investigated these effects in a rodent model of laparotomy and endotoxemia. METHODS: In two experiments, 80 male Wistar rats underwent laparotomy. In 64 rats, this was followed by administration of endotoxin; the remainder (16) underwent sham endotoxemia. Endotoxemic animals received either <b>dopexamine</b> at 0. 5, 1, or 2 Î¼g/kg/min or 0. 9 % saline vehicle (controls) as resuscitation fluid. The effects of <b>dopexamine</b> on global hemodynamics, mesenteric regional microvascular flow, renal and hepatic function and immune activation were evaluated. RESULTS: Endotoxin administration was associated with a systemic inflammatory response (increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -Î±, interleukin (IL) - 1 Î², IL- 6, and IL- 10, as well as cell-adhesion molecules CD 11 a and CD 11 b), and increased pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (indicating pulmonary leukocyte infiltration), whereas biochemical changes demonstrated lactic acidosis with significant renal and hepatic injury. <b>Dopexamine</b> administration was associated with less-severe lactic acidosis (pooled <b>dopexamine</b> versus controls, (lactate, 2. 2 mMÂ± 0. 2 mM versus 4. 0 mMÂ± 0. 5 mM; P< 0. 001) and reductions in the systemic inflammatory response (pooled <b>dopexamine</b> versus control, 4 hour (TNF-Î±) : 324 pg/mlÂ± 93 pg/ml versus 97 pg/mlÂ± 14 pg/ml, p< 0. 01), pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and hepatic and renal injury (pooled <b>dopexamine</b> versus control (ALT) : 81 IU/LÂ± 4 IU/L versus 138 IU/LÂ± 25 IU/L; P< 0. 05; (creatinine) : 49. 4 Î¼MÂ± 3. 9 Î¼M versus 76. 2 Î¼MÂ± 9. 8 Î¼M; P< 0. 005). However, in this study, clinically relevant doses of <b>dopexamine</b> were not associated with clinically significant changes in MAP, CI, or gut regional microvascular flow. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, <b>dopexamine</b> can attenuate the systemic inflammatory response, reduce tissue leukocyte infiltration, and protect against organ injury at doses that do not alter global hemodynamics or regional microvascular flow. These findings suggest that immunomodulatory effects of catecholamines may be clinically significant when used in critically ill surgical patients and are independent of their hemodynamic actions...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the early effects of therapy of endotoxin (ET) shock with epinephrine, norepinephrine, or <b>dopexamine</b> on splanchnic circulation, oxygen metabolism, sigmoid mucosal pHi, bacterial translocation, and morphologic {{integrity of the}} ileal, colonic, and sigmoid mucosa. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Conflicting concepts exist concerning the catecholamine therapy of septic shock, but {{little is known about}} the effects of catecholamine treatment on splanchnic circulation and mucosal integrity. METHODS: ET shock was induced in pigs by ET infusion over 30 minutes, and animals were studied for 4 hours. All animals were resuscitated with fluid. To mimic the treatment of septic shock in humans, mean arterial pressure was maintained in two groups at > 70 mm Hg with the administration of epinephrine or norepinephrine. A third group of animals received <b>dopexamine</b> at 7 microg/kg per minute. Systemic and splanchnic blood flow and oxygen metabolism were studied, sigmoid colon mucosal pHi was obtained tonometrically, and bacterial translocation was determined by culture of portal venous blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and lung specimens. Histologic sections of ileal, colonic, and sigmoid mucosa were morphometrically examined for therapy effects. RESULTS: All investigated catecholamines increased cardiac output and systemic oxygen delivery, whereas intestinal blood flow and oxygen delivery remained unchanged. Sigmoid mucosal pHi decreased in all study animals, but the decrease was most pronounced in the epinephrine group. Pigs receiving epinephrine also showed > 40 % damage of the mucosa of the ileum and colon, whereas animals receiving ET alone, norepinephrine, or <b>dopexamine</b> showed only moderate lesions with signs of restitution. No animal showed bacterial translocation. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism data do not reflect intestinal perfusion. Norepinephrine or <b>dopexamine</b> administration in ET shock causes no additional impairment of intestinal integrity. Epinephrine therapy, in contrast, is associated with a significant reduction of mucosal pHi and considerable early mucosal damage. Its application in septic shock is hazardous...|$|E

This study was conducted as a single-center side arm to a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of <b>dopexamine</b> hydrochloride on its incidence. Methods: Thirty patients, mean age 65. 1 years (range, 46 - 84), undergoing elective infrarenal aortic surgery were entered. Preoperative hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were optimized. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive a perioperative infusion of <b>dopexamine</b> at 2 μg/kg per minute (n = 12) or 0. 9 % saline placebo (n = 18). All patients underwent colonoscopy and biopsy preoperatively and 1 week postoperatively. Specimens were assessed for evidence of mucosal ischemia, presence of mast cell tryptase, myeloperoxidase activity, and both the inducible and endothelial isoforms of nitric oxide synthase. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in perioperative fluid and blood requirements or hemodynamic and respiratory parameters between the two groups. However, there was significantly less evidence of mucosal ischemic changes in dopexamine-treated patients (n = 1) compared with placebo (n = 8) (P =. 049). Furthermore, when preoperative biopsies were compared with those performed 1 week postoperatively, nine (50 %) patients in the placebo group and two (16. 7 %) in the <b>dopexamine</b> group scored worse. Although there {{was no significant difference in}} inflammatory markers between the two groups, both mast cell tryptase and myeloperoxidase expression were increased in patients with histologic evidence of ischemia (P <. 05). Furthermore, inducible nitric oxide synthase staining within the vascular (P =. 001) and lamina propria (P <. 05) components of the mucosa was also significantly greater. Conclusion: A perioperative <b>dopexamine</b> infusion affords significant histologic protection to colonic mucosa after aortic surgery. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 758 - 63. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dopexamine</b> {{is a new}} {{vasodilator}} with {{a combination}} of dopamine receptor and beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonist properties. Its haemodynamic effects were assessed after dose titration and during infusion for up to 24 hours in 15 patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. At the initial titration a dose of 1 micrograms/kg/min produced a 25 % decrease in the systemic vascular resistance index and a 32 % increase in cardiac index. Stroke volume index and heart rate increased by 23 % and 9 % respectively. Left ventricular filling pressures and mean blood pressures were not affected. The short term effects were well sustained during the long term infusion and tolerance did not develop.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study in rats {{was designed to}} demonstrate effects of <b>dopexamine</b> (3 microg kg(- 1) min(- 1), n = 6) or physiologic saline solution (n = 6) on systemic as well as regional perfusion during 30 min of supracoeliac aortic cross-clamping and during 180 min of reperfusion following declamping. Rats were surgically instrumented with arterial, right atrial and portal venous catheters, ultrasonic flow probes around the abdominal aorta, superior mesenteric and carotid artery, and a paediatric tonometer for intestinal mucosal PCO(2) measurement. During 120 min of reperfusion, fluid resuscitation was titrated to keep abdominal aortic blood flow above 80 % of baseline values. We found that during cross-clamping, values of arterial lactate (p = 0. 002) and intestinal tonometric PCO(2) (p = 0. 018) {{were higher in the}} <b>dopexamine</b> group than in the control group...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: Unrecognized {{intestinal}} mucosal ischemia in severely {{ill patients}} may trigger development of multiple organ failure. Such ischemia can be evaluated by intraluminal tonometry reflecting mucosal PCO 2 and intramucosal pH (pHi). The aims were {{to develop an}} apparatus for continuous saline tonometry (CST), to analyse circulatory control mechanisms during intestinal hypoperfusion and to evaluate the effect of <b>dopexamine</b> on intestinal circulation. Methods: A modified standard tonometry catheter was integrated in a closed system with circulating saline. By measuring saline PCO 2 in a measurement unit pHi could be calculated. This novel system was tested in vitro and in vivo. In a porcine study, CST was evaluated against standard saline tonometry, tissue oxygenation (PO 2 TISSUE), jejunal mucosal perfusion (laser doppler flowmetry; LDF) and mesenteric net lactate flux during graded reductions of superior mesenteric arterial pressure (PSMA). Local control mechanisms for maintenance of intestinal oxygenation were analysed. Effects of <b>dopexamine</b> on the intestinal vascular bed were explored. Mucosal lactate production was assessed by microdialysis. Results: CST measured accurate PCO 2 values and changes in pHi during restricted intestinal circulation and at reperfusion. Local control mechanisms were insufficient at a PSMA of 30 mmHg, pHi was reduced to 7. 10 and intestinal net lactate production was demonstrated. Absence of anaerobic intestinal metabolism was verified at PSMA ≥ 50 mmHg, pHi ≥ 7. 22 and a PCO 2 gap ≤ 15. 8 mmHg. <b>Dopexamine</b> induced negative regional metabolic effects at the lowest PSMA, as expressed by decreased PO 2 TISSUE and pHi, increased PCO 2 gap and intestinal net lactate production. Conclusions: CST reflected changes in pHi, induced by intestinal hypoperfusion and at reperfusion. Levels of PSMA, pHi and PCO 2 gap as indicators of aerobic conditions were defined. <b>Dopexamine</b> induced a decrease of PO 2 TISSUE and pHi {{as well as an}} increase in lactate flux at the lowest PSMA level...|$|E
