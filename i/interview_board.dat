25|$|War Office Selection Boards, or WOSBs, were {{a scheme}} devised by British Army psychiatrists during World War II to select {{potential}} officers for the British Army. They replaced an earlier method, the Command <b>Interview</b> <b>Board,</b> {{and were the}} precursors to today's Army Officer Selection Boards. The WOSBs were also later adapted to civilian purposes such as selecting civil servants and firemen.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Household {{announced}} in November 1978 that Prince Andrew {{would join the}} Royal Navy the following year. In December he underwent various sporting tests and examinations at the Aircrew Selection Centre, at RAF Biggin Hill, along with further tests and interviews at HMS Daedalus, and interviews at the Admiralty <b>Interview</b> <b>Board,</b> HMS Sultan. During March and April 1979, the prince was enrolled at the Royal Naval College Flight, undergoing pilot training, until he was accepted as a trainee helicopter pilot and signed on for 12 years from 11 May 1979. On 1 September of the same year, Prince Andrew was appointed as a midshipman, and entered Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. During 1980 he also took the Royal Marines All Arms Commando Course.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{promotion}} to commander, he served mainly in appointments in the Ministry of Defence between 1963 and 1969, attending the Imperial Defence College from 1965 to 1967. In 1969 to 1971, he served at HMS Dryad. In 1972, {{he was appointed}} Defence Fellow of King's College London, where he wrote a thesis on 'The Rule of Law at Sea.' On {{promotion to}} captain, {{he returned to the}} Ministry of Defence from 1973 to 1975, then he was posted abroad to The Netherlands, where he served as Defence and Naval Attaché at The Hague from 1975 to 1977. Promoted to commodore in 1977, he returned to the Ministry of Defence until promoted to rear-admiral in 1981; he served as Flag Officer, Admiralty <b>Interview</b> <b>Board</b> from 1981 to 1983. He retired from the Royal Navy as a rear-admiral in 1983.|$|E
5000|$|Oral <b>Interview</b> <b>Boards</b> This {{technique}} {{entails the}} job candidate giving oral responses tojob-related questions {{asked by a}} panel of interviewers. Each member of the panel then rates each interviewee on such dimensions as work history, motivation, creative thinking, and presentation. The scoring procedure for oral <b>interview</b> <b>boards</b> has typically been subjective; thus, it would be subject to personal biases of those individuals sitting on the board. This technique may not be feasible for jobs in which there are a large number of applicants that must be interviewed.|$|R

40|$|Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> can {{be applied}} as an {{effective}} method to get insight in the opinions of participants. Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> form the interviewing part of Q methodology. Q methodology {{can be used to}} identify typical sets of opinions. However, in many studies, the research goal is to order opinions and see which ones play the most important roles, instead of identifying groups of people with similar opinions. In such cases, full Q methodology is not required. Yet, the Q <b>board</b> <b>interviewing</b> method has a number of characteristics that are also advantageous in such situations. Therefore, we decided to apply Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews,</b> although our goal was not to do factor analysis. With Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews,</b> participants order pre-formulated statements. Besides, participants are encouraged to provide background information. This enables them to bring in issues that go beyond the fixed set of statements. Because of this combination, Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> stimulate engagement of the participants, without making the interview time consuming. The paper describes how Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> were used by students of the course Social Cohesion Design and how the application of Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> functioned as a preparation for applying Q methodology in the second stage of the course.

2500|$|On a {{more local}} level, Assistant Adjutant-General Colonel Frederick Hubert Vinden {{observed}} {{that there was}} a very high failure rate at Officer Cadet Training Units (OCTUs): he visited each board in 1941, and pinpointed failings in the Command <b>Interview</b> <b>Board</b> as making poor selections of officer candidates and thus causing the failures. Psychiatrist Eric Wittkower of the RAMC had been conducting research on [...] "problem" [...] officers who had broken down or caused disruption, and concluded that these men lacked [...] 'ability or qualities of personality adequate to withstand the stresses of their job.' When Wittkower and Vinden met in a pub after Vinden's visit to the final OCTU on his tour, the result was a discussion about how to improve officer selection by utilising psychological methods. Wittkower had been passed a copy of the selection methods used by the Wehrmacht, and so Vinden and Wittkower met with psychiatrists Thomas Ferguson Rodger, A. T. M. Wilson and Ronald Hargreaves, and the head of Scottish Command, Sir Andrew Thorne, who had been military attaché in Berlin in the 1930s and seen the German methods being used. The group made plans to experiment with and adapt these methods for use by the British Army. Army psychiatry was dominated by psychiatrists from the Tavistock Clinic, and so many figures from that organisation were involved in officer selection from the earliest experiments.|$|E
