Gordon, who {{was known as a}} fiery and tempestuous genius, would repeat his Talmudic thoughts to Simcha Zissel and seek his opinion on them, for he valued Simcha Zissel’s scholarship highly. <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> that his friend had been fluent in three orders of the Talmud, to such a level where he knew every comment of Rashi and Tosafot word for word. He was also fluent in all four divisions of the Shulchan Aruch and could locate any given Halacha within it with pinpoint precision.|$|E

The Craithie was also badly damaged in the collision {{and returned to}} Rotterdam flying signals of distress. When later asked why they had not stayed on to help the Elbe and her passengers, the captain, Alexander <b>Gordon,</b> <b>said</b> that he feared that his ship would sink, {{and in any case}} he did not hear any cries for help coming from the liner.

500|$|The role of Martha was {{originally}} played by Burcin Kapkin upon her introduction in 1988. In 2005 the character {{returned to the}} show, played by the model Jodi Gordon. Gordon took acting lessons before successfully auditioning for the role. Gordon later revealed that she was initially nervous about auditioning due to her lack of acting experience. However, producers gave her two months prior to filming so she could learn her scripts and gain more acting skills. <b>Gordon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'd never done any acting. So I did a few little acting course things and then I kind of fluked the part".|$|E
500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race. <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> his crash on lap 264 was [...] "probably the hardest hit I've ever taken" [...] and admitted fault for causing the crash. According to Kenseth, [...] "I {{knew he was going to}} get a run on me, so I laid back a little bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across. Whether it was on purpose or not, it just kind of wiped us out." [...] <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> he hoped Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track. Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed. After consultation with NASCAR officials, construction crews installed a [...] long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008.|$|E
500|$|Curteis {{ran into}} several {{problems}} while directing the film.

Executive producers Tony Tenser and Michael Klinger threatened {{to take over}} production as {{they did not want}} to increase the budget. Since Croydon had hired Curteis, it became his responsibility to fire him and finish directing the film. Richard Gordon suggested that [...] "I think Curteis was relieved to step out because he simply didn't know any longer what to do."

500|$|In January 2010, it was {{announced}} that Gordon had decided to leave the show. She asked Channel Seven to release her two years early from her contract. Producers and network executives had urged her to stay with the show because her character was popular with viewers. <b>Gordon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I've had a wonderful five years with Channel Seven and Home and Away—it's been an amazing experience {{to be a part of}} this incredible show. I've learnt so much." [...] Gordon filmed her final scenes at the end of February. Fellow Actor Ray Meagher who plays Martha's grandfather Alf Stewart backed her decision to leave the show, but said he was sad that his character would be left on-screen without any blood relatives.|$|E
500|$|During office hours, Leslie catches Mark, April and Andy playing Rock Band, {{a popular}} music video {{game in which}} the players perform rock music using guitar, drum and {{microphone}} controllers; during the game, Andy sings the song [...] "My Own Worst Enemy" [...] by Lit. Seth <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> the Parks and Recreation producers almost opted not to include a singing part due to concerns about the legalities of using the song, but they ultimately decided to use it. During Leslie's filibuster at the town hall meeting, she begins reading The Phantom Tollbooth, a children's adventure novel written by Norton Juster. The final scene of the episode, with Tom discussing how much he enjoyed The Phantom Tollbooth, was a last minute addition when the Parks and Recreation producers realized they had six possible seconds left {{to add to the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> {{that love}} is the central conceit of the episode. Although, in {{the myth of the}} Golem, the {{creature}} is soulless, Gordon took [...] "some liberties" [...] with the legend. He wanted [...] "Kaddish" [...] to [...] "literally be about resurrection". Ariel creates an imperfect reflection of her husband by crafting the Golem from mud. In essence, she is trying to play God, a role that Gordon later likened to Victor Frankenstein, the scientist from Mary Shelley's famous novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1823). However, Ariel and Frankenstein differ in the fact that Ariel's flaw was related to her [...] "loving [...] too much, not being able to let go, because of the cruelty and injustice of what she suffered." [...] In this manner, Ariel's motivation for creating the Golem are [...] "slightly more romantically skewed".|$|E

500|$|Co-writer Howard <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> of the episode, [...] "Alex [...] and I made {{an effort}} to play to our own strength, which is character. We thought this was an {{interesting}} place to reiterate Mulder's quest for his sister. We set out to tell a simple abduction story, which was played out behind the shadows. We wanted to create an air of tension. With everything that happened, we wanted to explain what it could be. At every point, everything can be explained. Was she taken or killed by her boyfriend, who she was seeing against her mother's wishes? Is it Twin Peaks or an alien abduction? That was the theme of the show." [...] Gordon and Gansa were afraid that series creator Chris Carter would not like the script, but Carter liked the script and approved the episode they wrote.|$|E
500|$|During the {{pregnancy}} storyline, Martha was also {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E

Biffle qualified eighth, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. ninth and Clint Bowyer tenth. The four drivers that failed to qualify were Tony Raines, Dave Blaney, Papis and Mike Bliss. Derrike Cope withdrew from the race prior to qualifying. After the qualifier <b>Gordon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Our efforts here have improved because we've really focused on it, They started with qualifying, and luckily last time they showed up in the race. ...

500|$|Lennon Parham, {{an actress}} and comedian {{who worked with}} Amy Poehler on the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe, made a guest {{appearance}} in [...] "Canvassing" [...] as Kate Speevak. Michael Schur said {{early on in the}} brainstorming process, the Parks and Recreation producers decided to establish an antagonist for Leslie named Kate Speevak, simply because they thought the name was funny. Seth <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> Poehler and Parham worked especially well together during their largely improvised scenes, which he attributed to their past work together on the Upright Citizens Brigade. [...] The resident who appeared to be a sex offender during the canvassing was played by Brian Huskey, who Schur called a [...] "fantastic improviser". Eric Edelstein portrayed Lawrence, a resident who antagonizes Leslie and Andy during the public meeting. Edelstein was not originally the actor assigned the [...] "Hey parks lady, you suck" [...] line, but the Parks and Recreation producers like Edelstein so much they gave it to him. Leslie's response line, [...] "Hear that? He called me park lady", was improvised by Poehler.|$|E

[...] New Line Cinema and Sega of America established a financial relationship in which a Sega Game Gear video game would be developed for the film. [...] Game designers began developing the video game Surf Ninjas when the film was only in its scripting phase, receiving creative input from director Neal Israel. [...] In turn, Sega partially financed the film. [...] Screenwriter Dan <b>Gordon</b> <b>said</b> that he wrote action sequences that would both suit the film and serve as a springboard for the video game. [...] In the film, one of the lead characters is shown playing the Surf Ninjas video game on a Sega Game Gear.
