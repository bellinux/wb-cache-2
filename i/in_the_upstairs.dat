Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took a seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> gallery, there being none left in the main seating area.

The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E

A second phase was added to <b>the</b> complex <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, while the mid-1990s saw a decline in business, mitigated by the opening of nearby MacArthur Center. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early-2000s, <b>the</b> <b>upstairs</b> stores were replaced by nightclubs, such as Jillian's.|$|R

500|$|Reagan's father nicknamed his son [...] "Dutch", {{due to his}} [...] "fat little Dutchman"-like {{appearance}} and [...] "Dutchboy" [...] haircut; the nickname stuck with him throughout his youth.

During this time, there were men working on building the Rectory, but since there was much snow, they could not return to their work on the Rectory until spring. Nicholas Givens had donated a large quantity of marble for the basement, so they began work on the basement. The workers covered the ground with black asphalt tile and the walls and pillars with white Carrara marble. Two marble altars were constructed along with a large kitchen built to feed up to 400people. They also built a furnace room and a large workshop {{to the side of}} the kitchen.|$|E
