They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 65 m puck (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), or a goal (wave green flag).|$|E
500|$|Outside of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{appears in}} the {{fighting}} game Ehrgeiz, as an unlockable character and an optional boss. She later {{appears in the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>board</b> games Itadaki Street Special and Itadaki Street Portable. In Kingdom Hearts II, she appears in her Advent Children attire, searching for Cloud and later fighting various Heartless, the series' monsters. She was originally planned {{to appear in the}} Final Mix version of the original Kingdom Hearts, [...] but due to time constraints the staff members chose to incorporate Sephiroth instead. Tifa is one of player characters in the fighting game Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, which features characters from various Final Fantasy games. She is featured in her Final Fantasy VII outfit, but the player has also access to her Advent Children form and a third form that is shown during Tifa's appearances in Nibelheim. The first print run of the game also features another form based on artwork by Yoshitaka Amano. In LittleBigPlanet 2, Tifa is featured as a downloadable character model.|$|E
2500|$|Speedball {{is played}} {{in an open}} field that could be {{compared}} to a soccer field, it is flat {{with a minimum of}} natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some [...] "give" [...] to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric [...] "bunkers" [...] were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as [...] "snake" [...] and [...] "can" [...] bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more [...] "High Tech" [...] in a sense that they are controlled by an <b>electronic</b> <b>board</b> and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).|$|E

40|$|Production of <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> {{containing}} brominated {{flame retardants}} is constantly increasing, posing important problems with disposal of products containing these materials. The present {{study investigated the}} thermal degradation behavior of <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> manufactured using tetrabromobisphenol A and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy resins. Qualitative and quantitative information was obtained on the products formed in the thermal degradation process, and the bromine distribution in the different product fractions was determined. The more important decomposition products included hydrogen bromide, phenol, polybrominated phenols, and polybrominated bisphenol A species. The formation of considerable amounts of hydrogen bromide and high-molecular-weight organobrominated compounds, {{as well as the}} potential formation of limited quantities of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, is an important element of concern in the safety and environmental assessment of the thermal degradation processes of <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> containing brominated flame retardants...|$|R
50|$|Like other methods, Scrumban can be {{implemented}} with a help of various tools. The most basic Scrumban implementation is a physical whiteboard with sticky notes.

40|$|On-board {{electronics}} {{in advanced}} military apparatus are often subjected to severe ballistic shocks and vibrations. Safeguarding on-board electronic sensors from such transient shocks due to ballistic impact is of concern.
