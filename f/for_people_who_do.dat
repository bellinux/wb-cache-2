5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E

500|$|The {{administration}} of fluid therapy in individuals with pulmonary contusion is controversial. Excessive fluid in the circulatory system (hypervolemia) can worsen hypoxia {{because it can}} cause fluid leakage from injured capillaries (pulmonary edema), which are more permeable than normal. However, low blood volume (hypovolemia) resulting from insufficient fluid has an even worse impact, potentially causing hypovolemic shock; {{for people who have}} lost large amounts of blood, fluid resuscitation is necessary. [...] A lot of the evidence supporting the idea that fluids should be withheld from people with pulmonary contusion came from animal studies, not clinical trials with humans; human studies have had conflicting findings on whether fluid resuscitation worsens the condition. [...] Current recommendations suggest giving enough fluid to ensure sufficient blood flow but not giving any more fluid than necessary. [...] <b>For</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> require large amounts of intravenous fluid, a catheter may be placed in the pulmonary artery to measure the pressure within it. [...] Measuring pulmonary artery pressure allows the clinician to give enough fluids to prevent shock without exacerbating edema. [...] Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, can be used when fluid overload does occur, {{as long as there is}} not a significant risk of shock. [...] Furosemide, a diuretic used in the treatment of pulmonary contusion, also relaxes the smooth muscle in the veins of the lungs, thereby decreasing pulmonary venous resistance and reducing the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries.|$|E

The Hanseroth brothers' cover of Paul Simon's [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] was deemed [...] "spot-on" [...] by Allmusic's Andrew Leahey and [...] "breathtaking" [...] by Gene Stout of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The Source Weekly contributor Mike Bookey complimented the album for capturing Carlile's live act and recommended this album for first-time listeners of her music.

Stephen Carradini of the Oklahoma Gazette also noted the errors, but summarized his review by saying, [...] "Things aren't perfect; they're still beautiful." [...] Carradini also complimented the successful transition of Carlile's acoustic-based songs to orchestral arrangements. The Salt Lake Tribunes David Burger gave the album an A– rating, asserting that Live at Benaroya Hall captures the [...] "unbridled spirit" [...] of Carlile's live act {{more than any of}} her studio albums. Burger also wrote that Carlile's [...] "well-crafted" [...] songs were [...] "gloriously illustrated" [...] by Buckmaster's and O'Loughlin's arrangements.

500|$|Quantum Break was {{described}} as a [...] "transmedia action-shooter video game and television hybrid". At its core the game is an action-adventure game with a live action TV show bundled with it. According to Lake, the product was designed to be a complete package, players are encouraged to both play the game and watch the show. While the game allows players to skip the TV show completely, Remedy advise against such behaviors, as players may miss crucial details if they do not watch the show. The game features many collectibles, which serve a narrative purpose. Lake explained that once players find a collectible, they will trigger a butterfly effect, whose consequences will be shown during the show. The show also shows some objects, which {{can be found in the}} core game. Through this approach, the team hoped that they could offer an experience that is unique and personalized for all players, and increase the depth of the story. Initially, the game and the TV show were to tell drastically different stories featuring a completely different set of characters. However, Lake eventually scrapped the idea, and the game and the show echo each other more closely. Lake described the TV show as a [...] "natural progression" [...] for the studio, having experimented with the format with the two Max Payne games, which feature televisions, and Alan Wake, which has the Bright Falls live action show, and , which features live-action cutscenes. Producer Thomas Puha added that the game is [...] "the culmination of 21 years of work". Lake added that the TV part can serve as an entry point <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not play video games frequently, and draw them into video gaming. To keep both parts consistent, the team also consulted a filmmaker who gave them advice regarding the game's camera styles and depth of field to allow smooth transitions between the two mediums.|$|E
