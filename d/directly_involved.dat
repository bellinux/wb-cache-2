Jade Ewen commented that the group was <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in the creation of the perfumes, such the choices for their scents and ingredients and the packaging, over a six-month period. The group members expressed interest in creating further products following their perfumes, such as make-up and clothing lines.|$|E
5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in catalysis; instead, the enzyme {{contains}} sites to bind and orient catalytic cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where the binding {{of a small}} molecule causes a conformational change that increases or decreases activity.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{carried a}} {{defensive}} armament of anti-aircraft guns and an air group comprising both attack and anti-submarine aircraft. As {{the ship was}} never <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in a conflict, her weapons and embarked aircraft did not fire a shot in anger.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Habsburgs had been {{involved}} in a major power struggle with the French kings of the House of Valois over the control of the remains of the realm of Charles the Bold, whose daughter and heiress Mary Maximilian had married. Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings over the control of the Duchy of Milan.|$|E

5|$|Australia became <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> {{when the}} Confederate navy visited {{in order to}} repair one of their warships. This led to protests from the Union {{representative}} at Melbourne, while the citizenry of nearby Williamstown entertained the Confederates and some Australians joined the crew. Accounts disagree as to whether Australians generally favored the Union or the Confederacy, as sorrowful demonstrations were held in Sydney when news arrived of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.|$|E
5|$|Duško Knežević {{was found}} guilty of crimes against {{humanity}} (murder, torture, sexual violence, persecution, and other inhumane acts). He was found to have been <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in the crimes carried out in the Omarska and Keraterm camps. He was also found guilty under the theory of joint criminal enterprise for furthering the Omarska and Keraterm camps’ systems of mistreatment and persecution of detainees. He was sentenced to 31 years imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E

5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had given}} {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death {{at the battle of}} Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E

5|$|Although not <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> with Sheffield football, Charles Alcock had a {{major role}} in {{relations}} between the local and London associations. He acted as a go between encouraging the FA to accept rules from the Sheffield Rules. When the FA declined an inter-association match in Sheffield {{on the grounds that they}} could not play under Sheffield Rules it fell to Alcock to organise a team of London players to fulfil the fixture. The success of the match led to it becoming a regular event in the following years.|$|E

Each year since 1968, the United States Air Force Academy alumni association bestows the Jabara Award upon the Academy graduate whose accomplishments demonstrate superior performance in fields <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> with aerospace vehicles. The James Jabara Memorial Foundation was founded by a friend of Jabara, and the foundation constructed a statue of him at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conflict}} {{that is part}} of the party's background was the Algerian War (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> in the war), and the right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to French Algeria. In the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around the right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON).|$|E

5|$|During {{the advance}} on Gettysburg, Maj. Gen. Reynolds was in {{operational}} {{command of the}} left, or advanced, wing of the Army, consisting of the I, III, and XI Corps.

These included portions of the Union IV Corps, the militia and state troops of the Department of the Susquehanna, and various garrisons, including that at Harpers Ferry.|$|E
5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
