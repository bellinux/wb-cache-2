40|$|AbstractApplication of {{multiple}} sensors <b>in</b> Reverse Engineering (<b>RE)</b> {{has been effective}} approach to meet increasing demands of both complexity and accuracy. However, methodology to plan <b>RE</b> <b>steps</b> using systems combining different sensors has been a serious challenge. This paper presents hybrid system that integrates laser line scanning probe and touch trigger probe of coordinate measuring machine for RE of complex part. As a result of integration, this system utilizes strength of one system to overcome limitation of other. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>RE</b> methodology using hybrid system has been described through a part case study. The primary objective {{of this paper is}} to retrieve lost 2 D drawings as well as damaged portion of mechanical part efficiently and accurately using hybrid system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{success of}} several constraint-based {{modeling}} languages such as OPL, ZINC, or COMET, appeals for better software engineer- ing practices, {{particularly in the}} testing phase. This paper introduces a testing framework enabling automated test case generation for constraint programming. We propose a general framework of constraint program de- velopment which supposes that a rst declarative and simple constraint model {{is available from the}} problem speci cations analysis. Then, this model is re ned using classical techniques such as constraint reformu- lation, surrogate and global constraint addition, or symmetry-breaking to form an improved constraint model that must be thoroughly tested before being used to address real-sized problems. We think that most of the faults are introduced <b>in</b> this <b>re</b> nement <b>step</b> and propose a pro- cess which takes the rst declarative model as an oracle for detecting non-conformities. We derive practical test purposes from this process to generate automatically test data that exhibit non-conformities. We im- plemented this approach in a new tool called CPTEST that was used to automatically detect non-conformities on two classical benchmark pro- grams, namely the Golomb rulers and the car-sequencing problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of desynchronising modular syn-chronous specications for their realisation into GALS architectures and obtaining simple wrappers that are eciently synthesisable using exist-ing synthesis tools. The systems are modeled using Petri nets (PN) and the desynchronisation technique {{is based on the}} theory of PN Localities. The ring semantics of a globally synchronous system is characterised by maximal ring of input and output transitions. The partitioning of a synchronous system is achieved by unbundling the input transitions and allowing the output transitions to <b>re</b> <b>in</b> maximal <b>steps,</b> in order to enable asynchronous communication in a distributed environment. Our model satises the two essential correctness properties, namely, seman-tics preservation and deadlock prevention, during the shift from maximal ring semantics, followed by synchronous systems, to standard interleav-ing semantics for input transitions and maximal step ring semantics for output transitions, followed by GALS architectures. The formation of localities is supported by adding internal signals which are necessary for building wrappers in the localities that will generate local clock enables. These wrappers can be subsequently synthesised using PN based synthesis tools. ...|$|R

40|$|Guinea pigs {{were divided}} into the next four groups {{for the purpose of}} {{examining}} the effects of exhaustive physical exercise and fatigue after exposing to X-ray. (1) Non treated group (C) (2) Exercised control group (EC) (3) Radiated control group (RC) (4) Radiated exercised group (RE) The X-ray apparatus was operated at. 200 KV, 15 mA, 0. 5 mm Copper and 0. 5 mm Alminium filtration, 50 cm focus target distance. The dose was 200 r of. X-ray whole body irradiation in dose rate of 80. 6 r/min (in the air). Subjects of this experiment were given 30 successive days of swimming at the rate of 30 minutes per day and 5 days per week. The results are as follows: (1) The 30 days survival rate of RE was lower than that of RC. (2) The decreasing rate of the body weight <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was a little higher than that in RC. (3) The prolongation of the blood clotting time <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was greater than that in RC. (4) The decreasing rate of red cell count <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was a little higher than that in RC. In both groups the decreasing rate was the highest on the 14 th day after the treatment. (5) The decreasing rate of hemoglobin content <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was a little higher than that in RC. In both groups the decreasing rate was the highest on the 14 th day after the treatment. (6) Reticulocyte count <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> and RC decreased in the beginning, but increased extremely on the 21 st day after treatment. Its increasing and decrasing rate <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was little different from that in RC. (7) The increasing rate of Heinz body <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was higher than that in RC. (8) The decresing rate of white cell count <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> was not significantly different from that in RC. In both groups the white cell count was at minimum on the 14 th day after treatment. (9) Concerning the classification of white cell, i. e. basophile., eosinophile-, neutrophile leucocyte, lymphocyte and monocyte, RE was not significantly different from RC. (10) About the changes of plasma proteins, a) The total protein in RC decreased a little in the beginning, but slightly increased in the latter period. That <b>in</b> <b>RE</b> showed little change in the beginning, and slightly increased in the latter period. Difference between RE and RC was not significant, b) A/G ratio did not change much in the beginning in RC as well as <b>RE,</b> but <b>in</b> the latter period it decreased in RC while increased <b>in</b> <b>RE.</b> c) Albumin didn't show much change in the beginning both <b>in</b> RC and <b>RE,</b> but it decreased a little in the latter period where as in RC it increased <b>in</b> <b>RE.</b> d) α-globulin <b>in</b> RC and <b>RE</b> increased a little after the treatment. Difference between RC and RE was not significant. e) β-globulin in RC decreased a little in the beginning, but increased in the latter period. On the contrary <b>in</b> <b>RE,</b> it decreased extremely in the latter period. f) Fibrinogen <b>in</b> RC and <b>RE</b> increased. Difference between RC and RE was not significant. g) γ-globulin n RC and <b>RE</b> decreased <b>in</b> the beginning.
