50|$|Cabinentaxi was {{in serious}} {{consideration}} for two deployments {{in the late}} 1970s; BMFT {{was in the process}} of funding a deployment in Hamburg while their U.S. counterpart, the Urban Mass Transit Authority (UMTA), selected it as a front-runner for a deployment in Detroit. Cabinentaxi's corporate partners decided to pull out of the Detroit competition to focus on the Hamburg development. When unrelated budget cuts drained the BMFT's coffers, the Hamburg project was also canceled, and the Cabintaxi Joint Venture gave up on the public transit field and withdrew the Cabintaxi technology from the market. The rights were purchased in 1985 by a small U.S. consortium, Cabintaxi Corporation, but no developments have followed. The only commercial use was a modified system, the Cabinlift, which operated as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>elevator</b> between buildings at the Schwalmstadt-Ziegenhain hospital in Germany until 2002.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{the design}} of their kite and {{full-size}} gliders on work done in the 1890s by other aviation pioneers. They adopted the basic design of the Chanute-Herring biplane hang glider ("double-decker" [...] as the Wrights called it), which flew well in the 1896 experiments near Chicago, and used aeronautical data on lift that Lilienthal had published. The Wrights designed the wings with camber, a curvature of the top surface. The brothers did not discover this principle, but took advantage of it. The better lift of a cambered surface compared to a flat one was first discussed scientifically by Sir George Cayley. Lilienthal, whose work the Wrights carefully studied, used cambered wings in his gliders, proving in flight the advantage over flat surfaces.The wooden uprights between {{the wings of the}} Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified Pratt truss, a bridge-building design he used for his biplane glider (initially built as a triplane).

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{variable}} wing dihedral and variable wing twist (in conjunction with a conventional <b>horizontal</b> <b>elevator)</b> to control an aircraft performing a perching maneuver. A choice of controller architecture wherein the dihedral is employed in the forward path and the elevator and twist are employed in the feedback path, is considered. The aircraft is modeled as a multivariable linear time-varying system. A specific perching trajectory is considered; and the open-loop aircraft is longitudinally unstable for a segment of this perching trajectory and lateral-directionally unstable for the entire perching trajectory. A multivariable time-varying controller is designed to efficiently stabilize the aircraft as well as reject longitudinal-lateral-directional wind disturbances, while closely tracking the reference perching trajectory...|$|E

25|$|PRT {{vehicles}} are sized for individual or small group travel, typically carrying {{no more than}} three to six passengers per vehicle. Guideways are arranged in a network topology, with all stations located on sidings, and with frequent merge/diverge points. This allows for nonstop, point-to-point travel, bypassing all intermediate stations. The point-to-point service has been compared to a taxi or a <b>horizontal</b> lift (<b>elevator).</b>|$|R
25|$|Built {{mostly from}} aluminum, the XV-1 {{fuselage}} {{consisted of a}} streamlined tube mounted on skid landing gear, with a rear-mounted engine and a pusher propeller. It also had tapered stub wings mounted high on the fuselage. In turn, twin tailbooms and twin vertical surfaces, interconnected by a <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer <b>elevator,</b> were mounted to the wings. A three-bladed main rotor powered by blade tip pressure jets was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, above the wing roots.|$|R
40|$|Robust {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} (SHM) benefits from a repeatable excitation source, but in buildings and other civil engineering structures this is problematic for many technical and practical reasons. Ambient vibrations are therefore often {{used instead of}} artificial vibration excitation for repeated system identification of such civil structures. In tall buildings, the movement of elevators contributes to the mix of ambient vibrations. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using elevator motion as a statistically repeatable excitation for use in SHM of tall buildings. The 17 -story Factor Building on the UCLA campus is heavily instrumented for earthquakes, and has high-resolution real-time continuous recording of vibration data. There are 72 accelerometers distributed throughout the building in addition to nearby ground motion and borehole reference accelerometers. Using Factor as a test bed, we have conducted the following studies of elevator-induced building vibrations: A) Excitation with a small (100 -lb) shaker placed adjacent to an elevator shaft to estimate frequency response/acceleration; B) Direct measurement of elevator counterweight vibrations to estimate the <b>horizontal</b> <b>elevator</b> forcing function; C) Correlation of elevator motion with measured structural vibrations; and D) Correlation of measured elevator forces with measured building vibrations. Initial results indicate that elevator-induced vibrations are statistically separable from other ambient vibration components in both the time and frequency domains. However, {{it may be necessary}} to add additional data channels measuring elevator position and/or elevator counterweight vibrations. Work continues on the development of a methodology to use the elevators as a repeatable source for SHM of the Factor Building...|$|E
50|$|Wingtips, wing-to-nacelle joints, {{tips and}} edge of {{stabilizers}} and control surfaces (excluding the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer and <b>elevator)</b> were all smoothly rounded, blended or filleted. The overall design was exceptionally clean and fluid as the aircraft possessed very few sharp corners or edges.|$|R
50|$|The depth meter {{is placed}} at the inner bottom of the section to detect the water depth level.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} from Kevlar-reinforced fibreglass with steel tube reinforcement {{in the cockpit}} area. The seating is for pilot and passenger in side-by-side configuration, sharing a centre-mounted control stick. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration, with curved main gear legs made from fibreglass and a nosewheel mounted on steel tubes with rubber puck shock absorbing. There is also a shock-absorbing tail skid mounted under the fin. While the fin is fibreglass the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer, <b>elevator</b> and adjustable trim tab mounted as a T-tail are all aluminum.|$|R

50|$|The Cagnet was a two-seat pusher {{propeller}} aircraft. The side-by-side seating {{was in an}} open cockpit {{just ahead of the}} strut-mounted inline engine. The low cantilever wings featured a gull shape, with twin booms mounted, one at each wing's bend point. A <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer and <b>elevator</b> ran between twin fins with rudders, one {{at the end of each}} boom.|$|R
5000|$|GB-4's {{development}} {{began in}} 1944 as a clear-weather, good-visibility weapon to attack heavily defended targets; {{it was only}} useful against objectives readily identifiable on the crude CRT screens of the period. It featured a plywood airframe with twin booms and vertical stabilizers, with a <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer and <b>elevator</b> between them. The warhead was a 2000 lb general-purpose (GP) bomb.|$|R
50|$|Assembly of the 1-36 is {{accomplished}} by inserting the wings and installing the main spar pins and fore and aft drag pins. The T-tail has a fixed section and the two <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer and <b>elevator</b> sections are inserted in that and retained with one pin. The elevators and divebrakes hook up automatically on assembly, but the ailerons require the manual insertion of pins.|$|R
50|$|On December 4, 2002, at 17:32 local, a Cessna 210M, N7660E, {{operated}} by Flight Express as flight 905, was substantially damaged during an gear-up landing at Cincinnati Lunken Field (LUK). The pilot was not injured. The airplane sustained substantial {{damage to the}} <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer, right <b>elevator,</b> and empennage. The cause of the landing gear failure was the rupture of a hydraulic line due to repeated contact with the aileron cable.|$|R
5000|$|A stabilator, more {{frequently}} all-moving tail or all-flying tail, is a fully movable aircraft stabilizer. It serves the usual functions of longitudinal stability, control and stick force requirements [...] otherwise {{performed by the}} separate parts of a conventional <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer and <b>elevator.</b> Apart from a higher efficiency at high Mach number, it is a useful device for changing the aircraft balance within wide limits, and for mastering the stick forces.|$|R
25|$|The Renegade {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} of aluminium square tubing extrusions and fittings, fastened with Avex rivets. The turtle deck and engine cowling {{are made from}} fibreglass. The fin, rudder, <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer and <b>elevators</b> are built from aluminum tubing and channel sections. The tail is wire-braced. A manual trim tab mounted on the elevator is an option. The landing gear is of conventional configuration and incorporates bungee suspension. The welded engine mount is 4130 steel.|$|R
5000|$|The front (usually fixed) {{section of}} the {{tailplane}} is called the tailplane or horizontal stabiliser and is used to provide pitch stability. The rear section is called the elevator, and is usually hinged to the <b>horizontal</b> stabiliser. The <b>elevator</b> is a movable aerofoil that controls changes in pitch, the up-and-down motion of the aircraft's nose. Some aircraft employ an all-moving stabiliser and elevators in one unit, known as a stabilator or [...] "full-flying stabiliser".|$|R
50|$|Early powered {{versions}} consisted simply of a motor {{added to}} the foot-launched hang glider version with control {{by a combination of}} weight shift for pitch and tip rudders for roll and yaw, with the tip rudders used together as air brakes. Because many pilots could not run fast enough to achieve take-off wheeled tricycle gear was added. The aircraft exhibited poor pitch stability so a <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer and <b>elevator</b> was added. Finally on later versions the tip rudders were replaced with a tail-mounted rudder.|$|R
5000|$|The Q2 is a tandem wing design, {{having one}} forward wing and one rear wing (instead {{of the more}} usual main wing and <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer). The <b>elevators</b> are fitted to the forward wing so that all pitch control comes from the forward wing, similar to the canard configuration. The Q2 is a [...] "taildragger" [...] with fixed (non-retractable) main wheels faired into spats located at {{the tips of the}} forward wing.
