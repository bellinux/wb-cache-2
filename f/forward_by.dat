5|$|The seven {{candidates}} were Mary Davis, Seán Gallagher, Michael D. Higgins, Martin McGuinness, Gay Mitchell, David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon.

He withdrew in August 2011 but returned to the race the following month due to his continuing widespread popular appeal.|$|E
3000|$|The {{number of}} data {{forwarded}} in a node affects its energy consumption. The more data <b>forwarded</b> <b>by</b> a given node, the greater its energy consumption. Therefore, {{in order to}} increase the network lifetime, it is necessary to reduce the maximum amount of data <b>forwarded</b> <b>by</b> the nodes in the network. The amount of data <b>forwarded</b> <b>by</b> the node is usually composed of two parts: the amount of data generated by itself and the amount of data generated by other nodes. Therefore, reducing the amount of data generated by itself and the amount of data sent by other nodes can reduce the maximum energy consumption. The set of all nodes in the network is defined as S[*]=[*]{ 1,[*] 2,[*]⋯,[*]N}, the network lifetime is denoted by l, and the amount of data <b>forwarded</b> <b>by</b> each node is Di.
