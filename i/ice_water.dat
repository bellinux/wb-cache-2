A fan of the X-Men movies, Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon as news of a new film came out. The suit went through six months of modifications, and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with <b>ice</b> <b>water.</b> David Harbour auditioned for the role, but was turned down for being too fat at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with {{the temperature in the}} range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia <b>ice.</b> <b>Water</b> ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E

25|$|During deglaciation, {{the melted}} <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> {{returns to the}} oceans, thus sea level in the ocean {{increases}} again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of the melted <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> {{is not the same}} everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of the melted water and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth's variable rotation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ice,</b> <b>water</b> and mantle rocks have mass, and as {{they move}} around, they exert a {{gravitational}} pull on other masses towards them. Thus, the gravity field, which is sensitive to all mass {{on the surface and}} within the Earth, is affected by the redistribution of ice/melted water {{on the surface of the}} Earth and the flow of mantle rocks within.|$|E

40|$|The ESLAB 50 Symposium - {{spacecraft}} at comets from 1 P/Halley to 67 P/Churyumov-GerasimenkoInternational audienceDeep Impact, EPOXI and Rosetta missions visited comets 9 P/Tempel 1, 103 P/Hartley 2 and 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko respectively. Each {{of these}} three missions was equipped with both multispectral imagers and infrared spectrometers. Bright blue features containing <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> were detected {{in each of these}} comet nuclei. We analysed multispectral properties of enriched <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> features observed via OSIRIS NAC on comet 67 P in the wavelength range of 260 nm to 1000 nm and then compared with multispectral data of <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposits observed on comets 9 P and 103 P. We characterize the UV/VIS properties of <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> rich features observed on the nuclei {{of these three}} comets. When compared to the average surface of each comet, our analysis shows that the <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposits seen on comet 9 P are similar to the clustered <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> rich features seen on comet 67 P, while the <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposit seen on comet 103 P is more akin to two large isolated <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> rich features seen on comet 67 P. Our results indicate that the <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> deposit observed on comet 103 P contains more <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> than the <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> rich features observed on comets 9 P and 67 P, proportionally to the average surface of each nucleus...|$|R

25|$|Some limited {{evidence}} supports sponging or bathing feverish children with tepid water. The {{use of a}} fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia, aggressive cooling is required (generally produced mechanically via conduction by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in <b>ice</b> <b>water).</b> In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated. Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known.|$|E
25|$|As an example, for a {{glass of}} <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> in air at room temperature, the {{difference}} in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.|$|E
25|$|One {{obstacle}} that {{conventional and}} hybrid airships face is {{their inability to}} control buoyancy without venting helium. Another operational challenge faced by airships and hybrid airships is the inability to control or adjust static lift during operations. Traditional airships' requirement for external ballast exchange and existing ground infrastructure has significantly limited their cargo utility. Once the cargo is off-loaded, traditional helium-dependent airships become extremely light, and this static lift causes them to float away. To combat these forces, they require external ballast exchange, using rocks, <b>ice,</b> <b>water,</b> or lead bags, to keep the airship anchored to the ground.|$|E

We compare the reflectance spectra of Iapetus's dark terrain, Hyperion and Phoebe and find that both Phoebe and Hyperion are richer in <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> than Iapetus' dark terrain. Spectra of the lowest latitudes of the dark terrain display the diagnostic <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> absorption feature; <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> amounts increase within the dark material away from the apex (at 90 deg W longitude, {{the center of the}} dark leading hemisphere), consistent with thermal segregation of <b>water</b> <b>ice.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>ice</b> in the darkest, warmest low latitude regions is not expected to be stable and may be a sign of ongoing or recent emplacement of the dark material from an exogenic source...|$|R

25|$|Soil {{deposits}} {{are affected}} by the mechanism of transport and deposition to their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual soils—they exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated. Decomposed granite is a common example of a residual soil. The common mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, <b>ice,</b> <b>water,</b> and wind. Wind blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and gravel and sand collect {{at the bottom of a}} river bed. Wind blown soil deposits (aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles down from the top of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base; soil deposits transported by gravity are called colluvium.|$|E
500|$|Early in the contest, congressional {{business}} restricted Barkley's {{campaign to}} weekends, so he enlisted allies like Fred Vinson {{to speak on}} his behalf. Chandler's political enemies such as former governor Ruby Laffoon, whom Chandler had crossed as lieutenant governor, and John Y. Brown, Sr., who felt that Chandler had broken a promise to support him for {{a seat in the}} Senate, also supported Barkley. Although labor leaders had backed Chandler's gubernatorial bid, they endorsed Barkley because of Roosevelt's support for labor unions. After the congressional session, Barkley resumed his [...] "Iron Man" [...] campaign style, making between 8 and 15 speeches each day and traveling, on average, [...] per week. This countered Chandler's implication that Barkley's age was a disadvantage, a charge that was further blunted when the younger Chandler fell ill in July, temporarily halting his campaigning. Chandler indirectly charged that a Barkley supporter had poisoned his <b>ice</b> <b>water,</b> causing the illness. Barkley ridiculed the suggestion, promising to appoint [...] "an <b>ice</b> <b>water</b> guard" [...] for his campaign. During speeches, he would lift a glass of water to his lips, then mockingly inspect it and refuse to drink it. Louisville police dismissed Chandler's claim as [...] "a political bedtime story".|$|E
