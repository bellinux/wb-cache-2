25|$|Pomerol lies {{immediately}} {{to the east and}} north-east of Libourne. Unlike most of the most prestigious communes of Bordeaux, it has no direct river access, being separated from the Dordogne to the south by the town and by Saint-Émilion, which lies to the south-east. To the north-east, across a stream called la Barbanne Rau lies Lalande-de-Pomerol. It stands on a <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> (a feature it shares with the prestigious appellations of the Médoc); towards the south and west, the soil is more sandy, while towards the north and east, it tends to clay. The sub-soil is dark packed clay, with a high iron content. The terrain is relatively flat with slight undulating slopes that fall from a height of 35-40 meters (115–130 feet) above sea level over a course of 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to around 10 meters (33 feet).|$|E
500|$|Caerphilly Castle {{comprises}} a set {{of eastern}} defences, protected by the Outer East Moat and the North Lake, and fortifications on the Central Island and the Western Island, both protected by the South Lake. The site is around [...] in size, making it the second largest in Britain. [...] It is constructed on a natural <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> in the local river basin, and the castle walls are built from Pennant sandstone. The castle's architecture is famous and historically significant. The castle introduced concentric castle defences to Britain, changing the future course of the country's military architecture, and also incorporated a huge gatehouse. The castle also featured a sophisticated network of moats and dams, considered by historian Allen Brown to be [...] "the most elaborate water defences in all Britain".|$|E

6000|$|While {{the light}} turned the moors to a wistful lavender, the little old couple {{stood in a}} hollow of the road, looking mutely up at the sign that mocked them from its {{elevation}} on a bare <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> beside the way. Father's shoulders braced; he bit his lips; he reached out for Mother's hand and patted it. He led her on, and {{it was he who}} spoke first: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{threw an}} oar into the {{sculling}} notch and they drifted away, slipping between the trawl-boats that {{rose out of}} the gloom and vanished astern. A minute later, the stream boiled noisily along the <b>gravel</b> <b>bank,</b> the white buildings faded, and they were swept into the darkness that brooded over the Firth. The fisherman hoisted a small, black lugsail and jib, and took the tiller as the boat listed gently down to a biting wind.|$|E
60|$|They {{left the}} house, {{and a few}} minutes later crept along a {{slippery}} plank to a boat lying against a timber framework on which nets were dried. She was sharp at both ends, half-decked, and about twenty feet long; with a short, thick mast. Now that the tide had ebbed, the river mouth was about a dozen yards across, and a row of larger craft, sheering to and fro in the eddies, nearly filled the channel. Behind these, a cluster of white buildings and a low promontory loomed out of the dark. On the opposite side, a high <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> seemed to close the narrow entrance.|$|E

60|$|Grace's tweed {{dress was}} wet and rather muddy {{when she stood}} with Gerald on a <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> {{at the head of}} a pool, where the beck from the tarn joined a larger stream that flowed through a {{neighboring}} dale. There had been some rain and the water was stained a warm claret-color by the peat. Bright sunshine pierced the tossing alder branches, and the rapid close by sparkled between belts of moving shade. Large white dogs with black and yellow spots swam uncertainly about the pool and searched the bank; a group of men stood in the rapid, while another group watched the tail of the pool. Somewhere between them a hard-pressed otter hid.|$|E
60|$|The log came on; its butt under water, its ragged top {{riding high}} and {{swinging}} round. There {{was a heavy}} shock, the canoe lurched, and a broken branch began to drag her down. Jim could not push off the grinding mass and, letting go the pole, seized an ax. He cut the mooring line to ease the strain, but when the rope parted and the log swung clear he was faced by another risk; unless they could reach the <b>gravel</b> <b>bank,</b> they would go down the rapid. He could not find bottom now, and while he tried the log struck the next canoe. His canoe swerved outshore, the row was drifting fast, and he shouted as he felt for the ax.|$|E
60|$|It was, however, {{obvious that}} the men in camp could not help much and he nerved himself to make a hard choice. If he held on, all the canoes would go down the rapid; if he let two go, one might be saved. He cut the line made fast astern, the log and canoes vanished, and he and the Indian {{strained}} their muscles. They had lost ground they could not recover; the <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> was sliding past, and angry waves leaped about the rocks below. Somehow they must make the bank before they were carried down. There was some water in the canoe; Jim heard it splash about. She was horribly heavy and his pole would not grip the bottom. When it slipped the current washed its end under the craft.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gravel</b> <b>banks</b> such as {{this are}} {{generally}} considered not {{to qualify for the}} title of world's most northerly point of land as they are rarely permanent. In fact several subsequent expeditions have claimed that Oodaaq has now disappeared beneath the ocean.|$|R
60|$|This was {{sufficient}} to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey. Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead. Pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere at once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side. But {{to prevent them from}} getting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the creek bed, till he brought up against a high <b>gravel</b> <b>bank.</b> He worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front.|$|E
60|$|When they nooned upon a <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> {{near the}} end of a wide lake it was {{fiercely}} hot. The calm water, flashed like polished steel, and Agatha could hardly see the flames of the snapping fire; the smoke went up in thin gray wreaths that were almost invisible. A clump of juniper grew among the stones and she sat down in the shade and looked about with dazzled eyes. A line of driftwood, hammered by the ice and bleached white by the sun, marked the subsidence of the water from its high, spring level. Small islands broke the shining surface, some covered with stunted trees and some quite bare. The rocks about the beach were curiously worn, but Agatha knew they had been ground smooth by drifting floes. Behind the beach, the forest rolled back in waves of somber green to a bold ridge that faded into leaden thunder-clouds.|$|E
60|$|One afternoon, {{with the}} sky full {{of white and}} black rolling clouds and a cold wind {{sweeping}} through the cedars, she halted to rest and escape the chilling gale for a while. In a sunny place, under the lee of a <b>gravel</b> <b>bank,</b> she sought refuge. It was warm here because of the reflected sunlight {{and the absence of}} wind. The sand {{at the bottom of the}} bank held a heat that felt good to her cold hands. All about her and over her swept the keen wind, rustling the sage, seeping the sand, swishing the cedars, but she was out of it, protected and insulated. The sky above showed blue between the threatening clouds. There were no birds or living creatures in sight. Certainly the place had little of color or beauty or grace, nor could she see beyond a few rods. Lying there, without any particular reason that she was conscious of, she suddenly felt shot through and through with exhilaration.|$|E
50|$|McHenry is {{surrounded}} by natural lakes and streams, grassy moraine hills, <b>gravel</b> <b>banks</b> and shallow nutrient-rich peat bogs, remnants of receding glaciers from the last ice age.

I'd ha' been glad to behave to you like a mother's sister, if you'd come and live i' this country where there's some shelter and victual for man and beast, and folks don't live on the naked hills, like poultry a-scratching on a <b>gravel</b> <b>bank.</b> And then you might get married to some decent man, and there'd be plenty ready to have you, if you'd only leave off that preaching, as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judith ever did. And even if you'd marry Seth Bede, as is a poor wool-gathering Methodist and's never like to have a penny beforehand, I know your uncle 'ud help you with a pig, and very like a cow, for he's allays been good-natur'd to my kin, for all they're poor, and made 'em welcome to the house; and 'ud do for you, I'll be bound, as much as ever he'd do for Hetty, though she's his own niece.

But where's the use o' talking, if ye wonna be persuaded, and settle down like any other woman in her senses, i'stead o' wearing yourself out with walking and preaching, and giving away every penny you get, so as you've nothing saved against sickness; and all the things you've got i' the world, I verily believe, 'ud go into a bundle no bigger nor a double cheese.

6000|$|So it is, {{you would}} find, with every weed {{in the little}} cleared dell, some fifteen feet deep, beyond the gravel. You could not--I {{certainly}} cannot--guess at the name, seldom at the family, of a single plant. But I am going on too fast. What are those sticks of wood which keep the <b>gravel</b> <b>bank</b> up? Veritable bamboos; and a bamboo-pipe, too, is carrying the trickling cool water into the bath close by. Surely {{we are in the}} Tropics. You hear a sudden rattle, as of boards and brown paper, overhead, and find that it is the clashing of the huge leaves of a young fan palm, {78a} growing not ten feet from the window. It has no stem as yet; and the lower leaves have to be trimmed off or they would close up the path, so that only the great forked green butts of them are left, bound to each other by natural matting: but overhead they range out nobly in leafstalks ten feet long, and fans full twelve feet broad; and this is but a baby, a three years' old thing. Surely, again, we are in the Tropics. Ten feet farther, thrust all awry by the huge palm leaves, grows a young tree, unknown to me, looking like a walnut. [...] Next to it an orange, covered with long prickles and small green fruit, its roots propped up by a semi-cylindrical balk of timber, furry inside, which would puzzle a Hampshire woodsman; for it is, plainly, a groo-groo or a coco-palm, split down the middle. Surely, again, we are in the Tropics. Beyond it, again, blaze great orange and yellow flowers, with long stamens, and pistil curving upwards out of them. They belong to a twining, scrambling bush, with finely-pinnated mimosa leaves. That is the 'Flower-fence,' {78b} so often heard of in past years; and round it hurries to and fro a great orange butterfly, larger seemingly than any English kind. [...] Next to it is a row of Hibiscus shrubs, with broad crimson flowers; then a row of young Screw-pines, {78c} from the East Indian Islands, like spiral pine-apple plants twenty feet high standing on stilts. [...] Yes: surely we are in the Tropics. Over the low roof (for the cottage is all of one storey) of purple and brown and white shingles, baking in the sun, rises a tall tree, which looks (as so many do here) like a walnut, but is not one. It is the 'Poui' of the Indians, {78d} and will be covered shortly with brilliant saffron flowers.|$|E
