40|$|The recent {{publication}} of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) has allowed some tentative statistical correlations to be undertaken {{to assess the impact}} poverty may have on mortality and morbidity. During the period 1989 to 2001, Scotland registered around 51, 600 excess winter deaths (EWDs). An EWD is taken as the additional deaths during December to March than occurred in the preceding and subsequent four-month periods. Almost all of these EWDs were in the population aged over 65. This represents 50 more deaths per day in January than in July. The SIMD measured five criteria by region: income; employment; health and disability; education, skills and training; and geographical access to services. Glasgow was the most <b>deprived</b> <b>region</b> with an SIMD score of 46. 88 and East Dunbartonshire, the least <b>deprived</b> <b>region,</b> with a score of 9. 07. For the over 65 s, the chance of becoming an EWD in Glasgow is one in 36, rising to one in 68 for North Ayrshire. The SIMD is positively correlated with EWD by region (0. 35 at the 5 % confidence level). This correlation appears to go against the influence of climatic variations, house type, energy efficiency and access to the gas network which favours urban areas. Although some of the additional winter deaths have been ascribed to outdoor cold exposure - exacerbated by inappropriate clothing or culturally determined behaviour - the majority of EWDs are premature and essentially preventable if the elderly can be kept warm in their homes during the winter months...|$|E

40|$|Until the 1990 s, {{studying}} {{the impacts of}} Higher Education Institutions (HEI) mostly focused on short-term impacts, i. e. the economic approach.

The human capital analysis (Schultz, 1961; Becker, 1993) estimates the increase in productivity and incomes for individuals due to the knowledge and skills they acquired from attending a HEI. Following these authors, Bluestone (1993) suggested that the creation of human capital for higher education graduates can be estimated by assuming that wages are correlated only with the number of official school years. In this paper, the human capital of a higher education graduate, in a <b>deprived</b> <b>region</b> of Northeast Portugal has been determined considering that the education premium is due solely to the number of years in higher education. It was also possible to determine that the direct stakeholders, namely the government and the students, have different values and attitudes towards the higher education premium...|$|E

To achieve these purposes it was necessary to conduct surveys among the faculty, staff, students and graduates of the IPB, as well as to collect data from IPB’s records and official sources.

40|$|DNA {{cytosine}} methylation is {{an important}} epigenetic mechanism that is involved in transcriptional silencing of developmental genes. Several molecular pathways have been described that interfere with Pol II initiation, but at individual genes the molecular mechanism of repression remains uncertain. Here, we study the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation at Hox genes in dependence of the epigenetic regulator Lsh that controls CpG methylation at selected Hox genes. Wild type cells show a nucleosomal <b>deprived</b> <b>region</b> around the transcriptional start site at methylated Hox genes and mediate gene silencing via Pol II stalling. Hypomethylation in Lsh 2 / 2 cells is associated with efficient transcriptional elongation and splicing, in part mediated by the chromodomain protein Chd 1. Dynamic modulation of DNA methylation in Lsh 2 / 2 and wild type cells demonstrates that catalytically active DNA methyltransferase activity is required for Pol II stalling. Taken together, the data suggests that DNA methylation can be compatible with Pol II binding at selected genes and Pol II stalling can act as alternate mechanism to explain transcriptional silencing associated with DNA methylation...|$|E

The reuse of domestic wastewater for non-potable water application is a potential solution for water <b>deprived</b> <b>region</b> world-wide. In recent days many developing nations cannot afford to construct and maintain costly wastewater treatment plants. They need more options for wastewater treatment at low cost.

Therefore {{in the present study}} an attempt is made to know the efficiency of vermifilter as decentralized treatment for parameters pH, total dissolved solids, removal of biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. In this study sewage water is treated using vermifilter containing earthworms and the results are compared with permissible standards of treated water. The average removal efficiencies of the vermifilter were as follows: chemical oxygen demand (COD) 68. 52 %; biological oxygen demand (BOD) 72. 05 %; total dissolved solids 15. 42 %.

Nine in-depth qualitative interviews with temporarily housed adults (> 25 years) in a socio-economically <b>deprived</b> <b>region</b> of North-west England were held. Accounts of renewed self-confidence, perceived resourcefulness and continual personal participation are said to be supporting wellbeing. A strong belief, or sense of coherence, in internal and external general resistance resources was a critical enabling factor for those living in temporary accommodation. Wellbeing was consistently linked with both social and formal activities; keeping occupied and having a strong sense of purpose were essential to wellbeing.
