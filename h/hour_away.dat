5|$|The Georgia Emergency Management Agency alerted local {{hospitals}} {{to prepare for}} up to 100 casualties. A doctor at nearby Memorial Health hospital described patients arriving at an emergency triage as varying in condition from suffering minor burns to their hands to having received 80-90% burns, with many in critical condition, and one with 95% burns. The victims' ages ranged from 18 to 50. Many victims were placed in artificial comas because they were on life support systems. Eight were transported by helicopter to the specialized Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia, about an <b>hour</b> <b>away.</b> Five of those injured later died there while receiving treatment.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an <b>hour</b> <b>away</b> from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an <b>hour</b> <b>away</b> from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
5|$|With city jobs {{moved to}} the towns and villages around Utica during the {{suburbanization}} of the postwar period. This led {{to the expansion of}} the nearby Town of New Hartford and the village of Whitesboro. Utica's lack of quality academic and educational choices, when compared to Syracuse under an <b>hour</b> <b>away,</b> contributed to its decline in local businesses and jobs as some economic activity moved to Syracuse during the 1990s. Utica's population fell while population in the county increased, reflecting a statewide trend of decreasing urban populations outside New York City. Residents who remain in the city struggle to handle poverty issues stemming from social and economic conditions caused partially by a smaller tax base; this adversely affects schools and public services.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} 15 defunct NBA franchises. The Anderson Packers, the {{original}} Denver Nuggets, the Indianapolis Jets, the Sheboygan Red Skins, and the Waterloo Hawks {{had played in}} the NBL before joining the NBA, while the original Baltimore Bullets had played in the American Basketball League before joining the NBA. Nine of the fifteen defunct teams have played in only one NBA season. The Packers, Red Skins, and Hawks left the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League, and are the only defunct teams to have ceased to exist in a league other than the NBA. The original Bullets were the last defunct team to leave the NBA, having left during the 1954–55 season, and are the only defunct team to have won an NBA championship. The Chicago Stags, the Indianapolis Olympians, the Cleveland Rebels, the Packers, and the Red Skins qualified for the playoffs in every year they were active in the league. Among cities that have hosted defunct NBA franchises, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. {{are the only ones}} to currently have an NBA team, although Providence, Rhode Island, Anderson, Indiana and Sheboygan, Wisconsin are all close to an <b>hour</b> <b>away</b> from a market with an NBA franchise.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, Dornier Seaplane {{announced}} that it would build the Seastar in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, about half an <b>hour</b> <b>away</b> from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The site was picked due to the strength of the local supply chain and presence of skilled aerospace workers, as well as its proximity to Lake Champlain for flight operations. At this point, the company aimed to deliver their first production aircraft in 2012; production was projected to rise from a single aircraft in 2012, to six in 2013 and to 12 in 2014; dependent on demand, as many as 50 Seastars per year could eventually be built.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of access}} to water supply and {{sanitation}} has significant health impacts. In addition, it imposes a significant burden on women and girls who have to carry water. For instance, more than one in five households in Umutara is more than an <b>hour</b> <b>away</b> from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education. Even where people statistically do have access to an improved water source such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they sometimes have to wait for more than four hours before they can get water.|$|E
