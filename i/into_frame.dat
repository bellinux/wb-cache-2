In the {{sideline}} views of both film and video, Harris had caught the ball out of frame, and came running <b>into</b> <b>frame</b> from the right side on his path to the end zone. The only other known NBC video was an end zone shot from above and behind the goalposts depicting Harris scooping the ball before it touched the ground. The best NFL Films shot of the play, from ground level, is a tight shot from the end zone of Harris snaring the ball, with his feet and the ground just out of frame below.|$|E
25|$|In the two {{monochrome}} seasons, Reeves was occasionally {{filmed in}} front of aerial footage on back-projection screen, or against a neutral background which would provide a matte which would be optically combined with a swish-pan or aerial shot. That footage was matted onto various backgrounds depending {{on the needs of}} the episode: clouds, buildings, the ocean, mountain forests, etc., which he would appear to fly by. For the color episodes, the simpler and cheaper technique of a neutral cyclorama backing was used, usually sky-blue, or black for night shots. Techniques for landings involved Reeves jumping off a ladder or holding an off-camera horizontal bar and swinging down <b>into</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
500|$|There was initial {{concern over}} Reeve's stamina for {{shooting}} the scenes, as his particular scene with Welling was six pages long, which translated to approximately twelve {{hours of work}} day. Beeman tried to design everything so it was as simple as possible, but Reeve quickly readjusted the scene. Beeman originally had Welling walk <b>into</b> <b>frame</b> and {{stand in front of}} Reeve, and then make a single move behind Reeve. Beeman was told, by Reeve, the scene needed more dynamic between the characters, and if Welling only made a single move, the dynamic would be lost. According to Reeve, [...] "Tom moving around me will hide the fact that I'm unable to move." [...] Beeman's fear of overstretching Reeve's stamina, because of the added shots to the scene, were put to rest when Reeve himself stated it did not matter how long it took to finish the scene, as long as it turned out great. Reeve was directing Yankee Irving when Smallville was gearing up to film the fourth season opener. As a result, Reeve could not reprise his role as Dr. Swann, which was the intention.|$|E

500|$|Shooting at sea led to many delays: {{unwanted}} sailboats drifted <b>into</b> <b>frame,</b> cameras got soaked, and the Orca once {{began to}} sink with the actors on board. The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing {{to a series}} of problems including bad weather, pneumatic hoses taking on salt water, frames fracturing due to water resistance, corroding skin, and electrolysis. From the first water test onward, the [...] "non-absorbent" [...] neoprene foam that made up the sharks' skin soaked up liquid, causing the sharks to balloon, and the sea-sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed. Spielberg later calculated that during the 12-hour daily work schedule, on average only four hours were actually spent filming. Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boat's propellers, and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage. The actors were frequently seasick. Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems, engaged in binge drinking, and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss, who was getting rave reviews for his performance in Duddy Kravitz. Editor Verna Fields rarely had material to work with during principal photography, as according to Spielberg [...] "we would shoot five scenes in a good day, three in an average day, and none in a bad day." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... {{is one of}} the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come <b>into</b> <b>frame</b> and go back out of frame and someone’s in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they’re having a conversation, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting." [...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E

According to Lucas, it turned out Hambleton was perfectly fine, apart from being angry {{with the people who}} had run into the shot to check on him.

2500|$|While {{considered}} simple by today's standards, the [...] "flying" [...] {{effects on}} Adventures of Superman were advanced for the period, although during season one {{it was apparent}} that, for distance flight shots, Superman was lying on a flat surface, his torso and thighs noticeably flattened between elbows and knees. Beginning with season two, Superman's [...] "flying" [...] involved three phases: take-off, flight, and landing. Cables and wires were used for Superman’s take-offs early in filming. In early episodes, stuntmen sometimes replaced Reeves for Superman’s wire-assisted take-offs. When Reeves came close to suffering a concussion in the episode [...] "Ghost Wolf" [...] (the supporting wires snapped and he fell to the studio floor), cables and wires were discarded and a springboard was brought in, designed by Thol [...] "Si" [...] Simonson, who remained with the series until its end. Reeves would run <b>into</b> <b>frame</b> and hit the out-of-frame springboard, which would boost him out of frame (sometimes over the camera) and onto padding. The springboard had enough force, along with subtle camera manipulation, {{to make it look}} as though he was actually taking off. The flying scenes were accomplished through a relatively few number of repeated shots. The typical technique had footage of Reeves stretched out on a spatula-like device formed to his torso and leg, operated on a counterweight like a boom microphone, allowing him to bank as if in flight. In a couple of later episodes, such as [...] "The Atomic Secret", Reeves simulated flying, opting to lie on the device without the molded form to support his legs, which are seen to hang from the waist in those episodes in marked contrast to the stock footage of Superman in flight.|$|E
