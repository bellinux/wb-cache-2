5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Avonmouth passed to Regional Railways. At this time, all trains ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This changed in 1995 when an <b>hourly</b> timetable was introduced for peak times, but northbound services were terminated at Avonmouth.|$|E
5|$|Freight trains {{started using}} the tunnel on 26 August 2011, and {{passenger}} trains on 28 August. The official opening {{took place on}} 2 September. Along with several other projects west of Oslo, including a new Lysaker Station and Høvik Station, and an upgrade to the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Etterstad, {{the completion of the}} Asker Line will allow higher service frequency, higher regularity and faster trains west of Oslo. A new high-frequency schedule, named Route Plan 2012, was planned for introduction in early 2013 following delivery of new Stadler FLIRT trains. This will also allow for more trains that stop at all stations on the Drammen Line and introduce three <b>hourly</b> trains to Vestfold and six <b>hourly</b> trains stopping at the main stations west of Oslo.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Seattle banned plastic {{shopping}} bags. In June 2014 {{the city}} passed a local ordinance {{to increase the}} minimum wage to $15 an hour on a staged basis from 2015 to 2021. When fully implemented the $15 <b>hourly</b> rate will be the highest minimum wage in the nation.|$|E

5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries.

Freight trains along the Sørland Line operate through the tunnel, although only at night, while freight trains along the Bergen Line do not, instead using the Roa–Hønefoss Line.|$|E
5|$|Both WWV and WWVH {{announce}} the Coordinated Universal Time each minute, and make other recorded announcements {{of general interest}} on an <b>hourly</b> schedule, including the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings.

5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Sea Mills passed to Regional Railways.

5|$|Dæmonen {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the shoulder restraint. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical <b>hourly</b> capacity of 1,200 riders per hour. The structure of the trains are colored orange; the seats and restraints are black. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Dæmonen has no floor on its trains.|$|E
5|$|Each November, the Andromedids {{meteor shower}} appears to radiate from Andromeda. The shower peaks in mid-to-late November every year, {{but has a}} low peak rate of fewer than two meteors per hour. Astronomers have often {{associated}} the Andromedids with Biela's Comet, which was destroyed in the 19th century, but that connection is disputed. Andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself {{is considered to be}} diffuse, as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from Andromeda itself. Andromedid meteors sometimes appear as red fireballs. The Andromedids were associated with the most spectacular meteor showers of the 19th century; the storms of 1872 and 1885 were estimated to have a peak rate of two meteors per second (a zenithal <b>hourly</b> rate of 10,000), prompting one Chinese astronomer to compare the meteors to falling rain. The Andromedids had another outburst on December 3–5, 2011, the most active shower since 1885, with a maximum zenithal <b>hourly</b> rate of 50 meteors per hour. The 2011 outburst was linked to ejecta from Comet Biela, which passed close to the Sun in 1649. None of the meteoroids observed were associated with material from the comet's 1846 disintegration. The observers of the 2011 outburst predicted outbursts in 2018, 2023, and 2036.|$|E
5|$|Each of Kingda Ka's trains has {{an extra}} row of seat mounts. The panels could be removed for the {{installation}} of additional seats in the future. This modification would increase the capacity of each train from 18 to 20, and the <b>hourly</b> capacity of the coaster from 1400 to 1600 riders per hour. Kingda Ka's station is prepared for this modification, with entrance gates for the currently-nonexistent row of seats.|$|E
5|$|Festivities {{formally}} {{begin in}} the early evening with the raising of the ball at around 6:00p.m. ET.

The hours before the drop are preceded by <b>hourly</b> countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians. Some of these performances are organized by, and aired on New Year's Eve television specials which are broadcast from Times Square.|$|E
5|$|Goliath {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has nine cars which can seat four riders {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 36 riders per train; each seat has its own individual lap-bar restraint. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical <b>hourly</b> capacity of 1,220 riders per hour. The structure of the trains are painted orange and teal, with matching colored restraints and seats.|$|E
5|$|Griffon {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains, colored red, yellow, and black. Each train has three rows that seat ten riders across {{for a total}} of 30 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over-the-shoulder restraint with a seatbelt. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical <b>hourly</b> capacity of 1,400 riders per hour. Unlike traditional roller coasters, Griffon's trains are floorless, allowing the riders' legs to dangle throughout the ride. Riders also experience up to 4 times the force of gravity.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the local}} McDonald's was totally rebuilt. The new {{building}} decor features memorabilia of Como {{along with that}} of fellow singer and Canonsburg native, Bobby Vinton. A children's playground in Canonsburg on Giffin Avenue is also named for Como. In downtown Canonsburg, all of the tree grates are marked with information about the records that sold a million copies and the town clock <b>hourly</b> plays one of the hits of Como (141), Vinton (44), or the Four Coins (7), also from Canonsburg.|$|E
5|$|Kraken Unleashed {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless trains. Each train seats 32 riders in eight rows of four. This gives the ride a theoretical <b>hourly</b> capacity of 1500 riders per hour.

As the trains are floorless, the station has a retractable floor for safe boarding.|$|E
5|$|NSB {{operates}} a commuter rail service from Bergen with two <b>hourly</b> departures to Arna, plus fourteen daily departures to Voss, of which {{up to six}} continue to Myrdal. Rolling stock is the Class 69 multiple units. The first part to Arna represents {{an important part of}} the public transport in Bergen, since the rail direct line through the mountain Ulriken is considerably faster than driving around.|$|E
