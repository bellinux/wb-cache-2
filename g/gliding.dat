5|$|A few insects use <b>gliding</b> flight, {{without the}} use of thrust. It is found in some species of {{arboreal}} ants, known as <b>gliding</b> ants.|$|E
5|$|Achievements in <b>gliding</b> {{have been}} marked by the {{awarding}} of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national <b>gliding</b> federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the <b>Gliding</b> Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to national laws controlling aviation, {{the sport in}} many countries is regulated through national <b>gliding</b> associations and then through local <b>gliding</b> clubs. Much of the regulation concerns safety and training.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the spring}} and fall {{approximately}} 22,000 air cadets participate in familiarization <b>gliding</b> at regional <b>gliding</b> centres located across the country.|$|E
5|$|Popping as an {{umbrella}} term also includes <b>gliding.</b> <b>Gliding</b> is a lower body dance performed {{with little to}} no movements in the chest or arms. In <b>gliding</b> a dancer appears {{as if they are}} drifting across the floor on ice. Opposite from <b>gliding</b> is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters on the art of ancient Egypt, hence the name—a reference to King Tut.|$|E
5|$|The Northumbria Hang <b>Gliding</b> and Paragliding Club, {{based in}} Newcastle upon Tyne, organises both hang <b>gliding</b> and {{paragliding}} at Coldsmouth Hill, which works in an easterly or west north westerly wind, and Longknowe, which works {{best in a}} west north westerly wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings are}} {{modified}} when <b>gliding</b> {{so that they}} rise from the body at an angle, but are closer to horizontal further along the wingspan. In silhouette, the comparatively long neck, head and beak stick out from the front almost {{as far as the}} tail does behind. For active flight, the white-bellied sea eagle alternates strong deep wing-beats with short periods of <b>gliding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Competition {{from other}} activities: {{there is now}} a greater variety of similar sports such as hang <b>gliding</b> and {{paragliding}} that may attract potential glider pilots.|$|E
5|$|Different {{species of}} frog use {{a number of}} methods of moving around {{including}} jumping, running, walking, swimming, burrowing, climbing and <b>gliding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each summer, 320 cadets earn a Transport Canada Glider Pilot Licence {{through the}} Air Cadet <b>Gliding</b> Scholarship and 250 more earn a Private Pilot licence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gliding</b> did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as <b>gliding</b> to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gliding</b> motions {{occur between}} flat surfaces, {{such as in}} the {{intervertebral}} discs or between the carpal and metacarpal bones of the hand.|$|E
5|$|In {{bacterial}} <b>gliding</b> and twitching motility, bacteria {{use their}} type IV pili as a grappling hook, repeatedly extending it, anchoring {{it and then}} retracting it with remarkable force (>80 pN).|$|E
5|$|In <b>gliding,</b> wind {{gradients}} {{just above}} the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bacteria}} can move {{using a variety}} of mechanisms: flagella are used for swimming through fluids; bacterial <b>gliding</b> and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion.|$|E
5|$|Skis used in {{cross-country}} are {{lighter and}} narrower than {{those used in}} alpine skiing. Ski bottoms are {{designed to provide a}} <b>gliding</b> surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under foot. The base of the <b>gliding</b> surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes. Glide wax may be used on the tails and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.|$|E
5|$|The Air Cadet <b>Gliding</b> Program conducts {{approximately}} 60,000 glider flights {{annually in}} Schweizer SGS 2-33 gliders.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} fly Batman {{throughout}} the city using his cape, with <b>gliding</b> now allowing for faster, longer sustained flights, steeper dives, and higher climbs. Batman can use some gadgets while <b>gliding,</b> such as batarangs or the line-launcher. The grapnel gun can now be used to instantly switch directions during a glide, {{as well as being}} fired twice while in the air to chain grappling moves together.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that Sinornithosaurus millenii {{was capable of}} <b>gliding</b> or even powered flight has also been brought up several times, though no further studies have occurred.|$|E
5|$|Time {{pressures}} on participants: <b>gliding</b> typically takes whole days {{that many people}} today find harder to devote. As a result, {{the average age of}} glider pilots is increasing.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to their brain size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large <b>gliding</b> birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient <b>gliding</b> to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because <b>gliding</b> birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from <b>gliding</b> birds.|$|E
5|$|Within this {{framework}} certain sectors of GA are governed on a devolved basis. In all cases the CAA/EASA retains responsibility for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors {{that are not}} included in the scope of EASA, are granted greater oversight of their activities. The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA), although a significant number are regulated by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA), formerly known as the Popular Flying Association. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the British Parachute Association, although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club. The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association UK, the British <b>Gliding</b> Association, and the British Microlight Aircraft Association. Separate from these devolved groups, <b>gliding</b> in the UK is self-regulated. The British <b>Gliding</b> Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result of EASA legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. Hang <b>gliding</b> and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British Hang <b>Gliding</b> and Paragliding Association.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of <b>gliding</b> mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the <b>gliding</b> adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Finches are {{seed-eating}} passerine {{birds that}} are small to moderately large {{and have a}} strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and <b>gliding</b> on closed wings, and most sing well.|$|E
5|$|Finches are {{seed-eating}} passerines. They {{are small}} to moderately large and have strong, usually conical and sometimes very large, beaks. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries.

5|$|Finches {{are small}} to {{moderately}} large seed-eating passerine birds {{with a strong}} beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have 12 tail feathers and nine primaries flight feathers. Finches have a bouncing flight, alternating bouts of flapping with <b>gliding</b> on closed wings, and most sing well.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{squirrels}} {{and sugar}} gliders are much alike in their body plans with <b>gliding</b> wings stretched between their limbs, but flying squirrels are placental mammals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas are {{generally}} encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather {{in groups of}} 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern rosellas. They fly in a straight line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and <b>gliding</b> briefly in between.|$|E
5|$|In October 1911, Orville Wright {{returned}} to the Outer Banks again, to conduct safety and stabilization tests with a new glider. On October 24, he soared for nine minutes and 45 seconds, a record that held for almost 10 years, when <b>gliding</b> as a sport began in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields. These airfields may also be used for other general aviation activities, and the addition of <b>gliding</b> may be difficult to accommodate. This can limit the number of available airfields and so it can require longer drives to reach them.|$|E
5|$|Increasing costs: due {{to higher}} costs {{of fuel and}} insurance, and due to greater {{regulation}} requiring equipment such as new radios, {{or in some cases}} transponders, <b>gliding</b> costs have increased, although without the continuous use of engines and fuel, they are still considerably lower than traditional power flying.|$|E
5|$|Lack of publicity: without {{coverage}} by television or popular publications, {{many people are}} unaware that <b>gliding</b> is even a sport. Without this knowledge the public may have a poor understanding of how flying without an engine is possible and safe.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs' hip sockets are {{oriented}} facing slightly upwards, and {{the head}} of the femur (thigh bone) is only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the thigh into a horizontal position during flight, as <b>gliding</b> lizards do.|$|E
5|$|Some of the area's large reservoirs, {{for example}} Carsington Water, have become centres for water sports, {{including}} sailing, fishing and canoeing, {{in this most}} landlocked part of the UK. Other activities include air sports such as hang <b>gliding</b> and paragliding, birdwatching, fell running, off-roading, and orienteering.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, <b>gliding,</b> falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and <b>gliding.</b> Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than a dozen golf clubs in the Riding {{including}} the cliff-top course at Flamborough. The Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club is based at Bridlington, and flying and <b>gliding</b> take place from Pocklington airfield and Eddsfield airfield.|$|E
