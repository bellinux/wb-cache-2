60|$|Once, indeed, a rumor of an {{exciting}} nature {{had reached the}} family. An <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader,</b> bound from the wilds of the interior to a mart on the sea-shore, had entered the valley. He brought with him a report, that a child, answering in some respects to the appearance which might now be supposed to belong to her who was lost, was living among the savages, {{on the banks of}} the smaller lakes of the adjoining colony. The distance to this spot was great; the path led through a thousand dangers, and the result was far from certain. Yet it quickened hopes which had long been dormant. Ruth never urged any request that might involve serious hazard to her husband, and for many months the latter had even ceased to speak on the subject. Still, nature was working powerfully within him. His eyes, at all times reflecting and calm, grew more thoughtful; deeper lines of care gathered about his brow; and at length, melancholy took possession of a countenance which was usually so placid.|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{urbanized}} and congested {{nature of}} the AMA, nine communities with the highest concentration of <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> were purposively sampled for the study. These communities were Abeka, Ablekuma, Abossey Okai, Agbogbloshie, New Fadama, Lartebiokorshie, Sukura, Nima and Mamobi. (Antwi-Bosiakoh, 2009; GSS 2014; Serbeh et al., 2015). The snowballing technique was employed to generate a sample frame of 842 <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> in the nine communities. The sample frame of 842 <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> {{was used as the}} sample size because quantitative approaches demand large sample sizes for rigorous statistical analysis (Fawcett & Arnold, 1987). One major flaw, however, for using the snowball technique was that sampling bias could not be ruled out.|$|R

For this purpose, we performed a descriptive study, using methods such as the literature search and Free Word Association, applied to 90 <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> in Ponta Negra / RN. The central core of the representations presenter the knowledge of <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> collectively shared by tourism. The plan represents the forward thinking and formulating plans to seek improvements.

On entering the room, the peddler relieved himself from his burden, which, as it stood on the floor, reached nearly to his shoulders, and saluted the family with modest civility.

Sarah gave but little time for the usual salutations, before she commenced her survey of the contents of the pack; and, for several minutes, the two were engaged in bringing to light the various articles it contained. The tables, chairs, and floor were soon covered with silks, crapes, gloves, muslins, and all the stock of an <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader.</b> Caesar was employed to hold open the mouth of the pack, as its hoards were discharged, and occasionally he aided his young lady, by directing her admiration to some article of finery, which, from its deeper contrast in colors, he thought more worthy of her notice. At length, Sarah, having selected several articles, and satisfactorily arranged the prices, observed in a cheerful voice,-- ...|$|E

With her earnings she bought a cart and oxen, and had some success as an <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader,</b> which she wrote about in another book, A Lady Trader in the Transvaal (1882).

Moreover, these exposés from both the qualitative and quantitative study where <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> of electronics and accessories attained the highest livelihood status further buttressed the evidence put forward by Rogerson (1999) and Agergaard and Thao Thi (2010) that <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> of durable products like hardware, electronics and accessories generally earn higher and have relatively secured and improved livelihoods standards as compared to vendors of other products such as food-related items.|$|R

5000|$|Because of {{the great}} numbers of people {{attracted}} by fairs they were often the scenes of riots and disturbances, so the privilege of holding a fair was granted by royal charter. At first, they were allowed only in towns and places of strength, or {{where there was a}} bishop, sheriff or governor who could keep order. In time various benefits became attached to certain fairs, such as granting people the protection of a holiday and allowing them freedom from arrest in certain circumstances. The officials were authorized to mete out justice to those who came to their fair; eventually even the smallest fair would have had a court to adjudicate on offences and disputes arising within the fairground, called a pye powder court (from Old French pieds pouldrés, literally [...] "dusty feet", meaning an <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader,</b> from Medieval Latin pedes pulverosi).|$|E

Vasco, enraged over this betrayal, dies when he accidentally buries himself under {{a heap of}} {{construction}} material for the half-finished house. This leaves the two women with no way of returning to the city. Left to their own devices, they venture out to explore the area. They find a fishing hut {{on the shores of}} the ocean and notice that Massu (Seu Jorge), the fisherman, has salt which he regularly obtains from his father on the nearby Island. Massu takes them there, as they seek to follow the salt trail out of the desert. However, Massu's father does not know where the salt comes from since he is the grandson of a runaway slave; he already had been born in the sanctuary; he does not know the world beyond the Island. Yet soon they establish contact with the <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader</b> who brings the salt (fittingly called Chico do Sal), but he too does not offer any viable connection back to the civilization.|$|E

5000|$|Lee wrote {{more than}} 70 pieces of fiction and first {{attracted}} {{attention of the}} literary world in 1928 when his story City and Ghost (Dosi-wa yuryeong) was published in Light of Korea (Joseon jigwang). Lee published many other works including Unanticipated Meeting (Giu), Shattered Red Lantern (Kkaetteuryeojineun hongdeung) and At Sea Near Russia (Noryeong geunhae), all of which reflected his socialist sympathies. Lee's work was self-consciously political and frequently focused {{on the lives of}} unfortunate women forced into prostitution, often combining his political message with explorations of sexuality. [...] In 1933, however, coincident with increased pressure from Japanese occupiers that literature not be political Lee helped found the Group of Nine (Guin hoe), and abandoned political literature in favor of more aesthetic approaches. [...] The Group of Nine included Jung Jiyong, Yi Sang, Kim Girim, Lee Taejun all of whom influenced Lee. Lee continued to be concerned with eroticism, but his focus also turned largely to nature. In his story Pig, Lee writes of a man who raises a sow, with the intent of building a pig farm, but superimposes human sexuality over the rutting of the pigs. In Bunnyeo, Lee explored a sexually wanton character. When Buckwheat Flowers Bloom, Lee's most famous story, follows the story of an <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader</b> and the love he feels for a younger man, his son {{as the result of a}} one-night stand.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the development of}} the retail sector in eighteenth-century provincial England, with particular reference to Hamsphire. The move to fixed place retailing is set against a background of changing wholesale and domestic distribution techniques and the significant demographic shifts experienced at the time. The role of the market, fair, and <b>itinerant</b> <b>trader</b> are considered against the rise of the increasingly specialist resident retailer. Innovations in retail practice (fixed pricing, advertising, loss leaders, the promotion of cash, the tightening of credit and the introduction of branded goods) are examined, collectively indicating that retail distribution underwent a significant transformation in the late eighteenth century. ...|$|E

30|$|With {{regard to}} access to {{healthcare}} services (Table 3), {{it was found}} that <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> of traditional herbal medicines were 1.138 {{times more likely to have}} improved healthcare access as compared to reference category which could be explained by their involvement in the sale of various traditional herbal medicines which perhaps may have made them believe that they have the wherewithal to afford their healthcare needs. As regards the acquisition of household assets, the analysis indicated that <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> of food items (0.337) were less likely to have improved asset-holding status as compared to the reference category (Table 3). An assessment of the overall livelihood status of the immigrant traders revealed that while immigrants who were engaged in the retail of food items were 0.276 times more likely to record a deteriorated livelihood status, those involved in the sale of electronics and accessories were 1.360 times more likely to achieve improved livelihood status (Table 3).|$|R
30|$|According to Skinner (2008) and Peberdy (2016), a {{major factor}} that swells the number of <b>itinerant</b> street <b>traders</b> in sub-Saharan Africa is {{international}} migration. As Landau (2007) points out, international migration is an inexorable response to regional economic inequalities. Itinerant trading is thus what many foreign immigrants opt to do at their destinations. Lonreco-Lindell (2004) for example cites {{the case of the}} Dyulas-itinerant traders who have been active in West Africa for centuries, moving goods across borders. For many villages, <b>itinerant</b> migrant <b>traders</b> are the primary source of supplies (Skinner, 2008). Peberdy’s (2016) study, one of the few surveys on cross border traders in Southern Africa, suggested that <b>itinerant</b> migrant <b>traders</b> either supply domestic street traders or sell their wares directly.|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} {{categories}} of Han merchants: those who sold goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> who traveled between cities and to foreign countries. The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register and had to pay heavy commercial taxes. Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who {{had to resort to}} peddling were to be exempted from taxation.|$|R
30|$|A {{statistically}} significant relationship {{was also found}} between types of wares sold among the immigrants and their livelihood status (Table 3). For instance, while <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> of electronics and accessories were 1.360 {{times more likely to}} have improved job security, those engaged in the sale of food-related items were 0.276 times less likely to attain improved job security (Table 3). Equally, immigrants who were involved in the retail of foot wears/leather belts/bags (0.564) and clothing (0.455) were less likely to better their lots in the area of food security as compared to the reference category (Table 3). With respect to vulnerabilities to occasional price shocks (Table 3), it was again found that itinerant retailers of electronics and accessories were about two times more likely to reduce vulnerabilities to occasional price shocks on basic necessities which confirms the claim by Roever and Linares (2008) that sellers of durable products like electronics and accessories are less exposed to asset loss and price fluctuations compared to other types of goods traded. In general, <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> of garments/fabrics (0.279) had the least likelihood of reducing vulnerabilities to occasional price shocks as compared to the reference category.|$|R

This study analyzed the livelihood activities of itinerant West African migrant traders in the Accra Metropolitan Area, using mixed methods approach. The study which {{was guided by}} the framework for migration and itinerant migrant trade surveyed 779 <b>itinerant</b> immigrant <b>traders</b> and interviewed 12 key informants. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were the main analytical techniques used. The results showed {{that most of the}} immigrant traders were young, unmarried males with no formal education and their main trading activity was itinerant retailing of foot wears/leather belts/bags and herbal medicines. As regards their livelihood status, female immigrant traders and those who were younger (<[*] 20 [*]years) were less likely to have improved livelihood status. Moreover, while immigrant traders of food products {{were more likely to have}} a deteriorated livelihood status, those engaged in the sale of durable products (electronics and accessories) were most likely to achieve improved livelihood status. The study recommends that itinerant West African migrant traders should invest more of their resources in the sale of electronics and accessories as it has the highest potential of guaranteeing secured and improved livelihoods. Any form of business support aim at improving the livelihood status of <b>itinerant</b> immigrant <b>traders</b> should be focused on young and female <b>itinerant</b> <b>traders</b> and those engaged in the sale of food-related items because they were less likely to maintain improved livelihood status.|$|R
