5|$|While emphasising {{the ability}} of the human <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> uncover truth through a study of nature, the poem also {{questions}} religious certainty. However, according to the poem only a privileged few are able to see nature as it truly is and reveal its secrets to the world.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with US News, Riordan said that to write the book, he used his experience of having traveled to the Mediterranean with his family {{as part of a}} Disney-Hyperion promotion {{for the end of the}} Percy Jackson & the Olympians. Many of the tourist destinations he visited were included in the series, but because of the conflicting portrayals of Tartarus in literature, the author said that he appealed to his <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> write the scenes of the underworld.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Police, City of London Police, {{and private}} {{organisations such as}} the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee were {{involved}} in the search for the killer or killers. Despite extensive inquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded identification and capture. The murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> the present day.|$|E
5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> the greatest effect.|$|E
5|$|Meher Baba gave {{numerous}} teachings on {{the cause}} and purpose of life, including teaching reincarnation and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is imagination, that God is what really exists, and that each soul is really God passing through <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also taught about the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in his principal books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of the basic game may have one serious flaw: it seems that a good but conservative player can set up his or her marbles in a defensive wedge and ward off all attacks indefinitely. An attacker may try to outflank this wedge or lure it into traps, but such advances are often more dangerous to the attacker than the defender. Thus, from the starting position, it takes little skill and no <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> avoid losing, and nothing in the rules prevents games from being interminable.|$|E
25|$|May 1968 in France {{introduced}} a partial return to {{representation in the}} work of Jean Messagier. His landscapes were reduced to a point where only a trace of gesture remained. This spontaneous passage would replace the depth of field, while the dynamic imprint of the brushstrokes, turbulent and interlacing, move across the canvas in vast convolutions. Titles, often inscribed directly into the painted surface, are a fundamental aspect of Messagier's paintings. The title becomes part of the work, opening the viewers <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> the pleasure the artist wishes to share.|$|E
50|$|Helbig's {{style has}} been {{described}} as teetering between documentary and abstract. Helbig's approach whatever the subject is not to editorialize but to use his imagery to provide viewers the space, in their own <b>imaginations,</b> <b>to</b> reflect, imagine and think for themselves.|$|R

25|$|The late Stephen Jay Gould {{was one of}} Knight’s most {{well-known}} fans, notably refusing to refer to Brontosaurus as “Apatosaurus” because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name. Gould writes in his 1989 book Wonderful Life, “Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> this day”.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the film had included Jules Verne {{and the culture of}} past and present European history and events, and new inventions. Along with the previous elements, the story {{had to do with the}} idea of Time Travel with one concept including a child that explored the story of the great European scientists of the past on an intelligent computer. However, to keep the audience focused and use <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> depict situations and places that do not cater to the average person, the number of visions of the past and extreme situations of the plot kept increasing all the time for the project.|$|E
25|$|In {{his free}} time, Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History, {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} Dr. Jacob Wortman, who asked Knight to paint a restoration of a prehistoric pig, Elotherium, whose fossilized bones were on display. Knight applied his knowledge of modern pig anatomy, and used his <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> fill in any gaps. Wortman was thrilled with the final result, and the museum soon commissioned Knight to produce an entire series of watercolors to grace their fossil halls. His paintings were hugely popular among visitors, and Knight continued {{to work with the}} museum well into the 1930s, painting what would become some of the world’s most celebrated images of dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, and prehistoric humans.|$|E

25|$|Roh {{used this}} term to {{describe}} painting that signaled {{a return to}} realism after expressionism's extravagances, which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects. Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, {{and in doing so}} the spirit, or magic, of the object reveals itself. One could relate this exterior magic {{all the way back to}} the 15th century. Flemish painter Van Eyck (1395–1441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer's <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills. The magic is contained in the viewer's interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image.|$|E
25|$|Having {{previously}} boycotted {{playing at}} Bristol's Colston Hall {{due to its}} connection with the city's historic slave trade, in October 2012, Del Naja heavily criticised Bristol Mayor candidate George Ferguson because of his membership of a local organisation the Society of Merchant Venturers. The organisation {{dates back to the}} 16th century and had many connections with the Bristol slave trade, continuing to this day as an elitist private organisation, open to very few by invitation only. In November 2012 Del Naja then took a surprising stance to reverse his position and endorse the politically independent, wealthy, ex LibDem parliamentary candidate, George Ferguson. Del Naja was cited by local media as saying that the other candidates had only party political agendas at heart and a newly elected mayor needed more <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> help implement creative projects for Bristol.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Brodovitch collaborated in the {{production}} of the revolutionary publication Portfolio. It has been widely acknowledged as perhaps the definitive graphic design magazine of the twentieth century. The idea for the publication came from art director Frank Zachary. He wanted to put out a magazine that focused solely on art and design, but was at the same time an outstanding example of design itself. Brodovitch was intrigued by the concept. Although he enjoyed his work at Harper's Bazaar, the limitations of space and subject matter often cramped his creative style. Portfolio freed him from the practical and aesthetic restraints to which he had grown accustomed. The pages of the publication were space for his graphic <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> run wild. George S. Rosenthal, whose family owned a printing company dedicated to mass-market pictorial paperbacks, signed on too.|$|E

25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E
25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, with all its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} use {{memory and}} <b>imagination</b> <b>to</b> envision others’ experiences in their minds. As they do, possibilities {{come to the}} mind of the therapist that might not present themselves to the client: possibilities for potential re-interpretation, healing, meaning, relating, and discovery (knowledge). It is for these reasons that hermeneuts consider imagination is so vital to not only reflexive development but it is vital to therapists as an intersubjective tool to help promote growth in clients by bringing “to mind what is presently absent", which helps establish some stability to one's knowledge and, in turn, establish personal truth and meaning about a self and his or her experiences. Finally, the knowledge produced from imagination is only constitutive of a person's (client's) identity and experiences when that person marks that knowledge as meaningful to his- or herself, thus reinforcing the impact of co-created meaning in counseling.|$|E
