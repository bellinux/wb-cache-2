5|$|Found {{mainly in}} Central and Southern Europe {{as well as}} North Africa, Boletus aereus is rare in colder climates such as England, and {{classified}} as a vulnerable species in the Czech Republic. Boletus aereus can be locally abundant; {{it is the most}} common bolete in the woodlands of Madonie Regional Natural Park in northern Sicily. In contrast, it has been placed on a provisional Red List of endangered species of Montenegro. Boletus aereus has been reported from several other <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems</b> across the Mediterranean, such as Corsica, Cyprus, Lesvos, and Naxos.|$|E
25|$|Some {{interest}} {{has been taken}} in regard to conservation of these <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> J.W. McManus, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, has explored the possibilities of designating portions of the Spratly Islands as a marine park. One region of the Spratly Archipelago, named Truong Sa, was proposed by Vietnam's Ministry of Science, Technology, and the Environment (MOSTE) as a future protected area. The site, with an area of 160km2 (62sq mi), is currently managed by the Khánh Hòa Provincial People's Committee of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Like many fragile <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> Seychelles saw {{the loss}} of {{biodiversity}} when humans first settled in the area, including the disappearance {{of most of the}} giant tortoises from the granitic islands, the felling of coastal and mid-level forests, and the extinction of species such as the chestnut flanked white eye, the Seychelles parakeet, and the saltwater crocodile. However, extinctions were far fewer than on islands such as Mauritius or Hawaii, partly due to a shorter period of human occupation (since 1770). Seychelles today is known for success stories in protecting its flora and fauna. The rare Seychelles black parrot, the national bird of the country, is now protected.|$|E

25|$|All rock iguanas are herbivorous, {{consuming}} leaves, flowers, berries, {{and fruits}} from different plant species. A study in 2000 by Allison Alberts of the San Diego Zoo revealed that seeds {{passing through the}} digestive tracts of rock iguanas germinate more rapidly than those that do not. These seeds in the fruits consumed by cycluras have an adaptive advantage by sprouting {{before the end of}} very short rainy seasons. The iguanas are an important means of distributing these seeds to new areas (particularly if females migrate to nesting sites) and, as the largest native herbivores of many <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> they are essential for maintaining the balance between climate and vegetation. Their diet is very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, and fungi; individual animals do appear to be opportunistic carnivores.|$|E

500|$|Seacology is {{a nonprofit}} 501(c)(3) {{charitable}} organization headquartered in Berkeley, California, that works to preserve <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and cultures around the world. [...] Founded in 1991, it began {{with the work of}} ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox, who researched tropical plants and their medicinal value in the village of Falealupo in Samoa during the mid-1980s. [...] When the villagers were pressured into selling logging rights to their rainforest in 1988 to build a new school, Cox and his wife offered to help secure funds for the new school in return for an agreement with the villagers to protect their forest. [...] With the help of his friends and family, Cox secured the funds within six months, later earning him and the village chief, Fuiono Senio, the Goldman Environmental Prize for their efforts. [...] Word spread throughout the islands, and with increasing demand for similar projects, Cox, along with Bill Marré and Ken Murdock, decided to form Seacology and expand their work internationally. [...] For the first few years, the organization operated on a volunteer basis. [...] Duane Silverstein became the first employee in 1999, and headquarters were relocated to Berkeley, not far from his residence.|$|E
2500|$|Island ecology is {{the study}} of island organisms and their {{interactions}} with each other and the environment. [...] Islands account for nearly 1/6 of earth’s total land area, yet the ecology of <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems</b> is vastly different from that of mainland communities. [...] Their isolation and high availability of empty niches leads to increased speciation. [...] As a result, <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems</b> comprise 30% of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, 50% of marine tropical diversity, and some of the most unusual and rare species.

2500|$|In marine ecosystems, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} establishment of “no-take” reserves. [...] This allows for reestablishment of native species, and also augmentation of commercially harvested species. [...] However, in both terrestrial and marine systems, these actions are expensive and do not always result in the desired outcomes. [...] For example, some non-natives become keystone species and their removal can cause {{more harm than good}} to the ecosystem.

2500|$|Since <b>island</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are self-contained, {{it should}} be {{possible}} to mitigate many of the threats to species. [...] Ecologists and managers are working together to prioritize areas for conservation and to quickly design and implement action plans. [...] Not everything can be put into a reserve, so it is important to first compile pertinent information and prioritize areas of concern. [...] Once an area has been chosen, managers must then acquire ownership and gain support. [...] Local experts and indigenous populations should also be involved in this process. [...] Having clearly defined goals will facilitate the many necessary interactions between people and agencies. [...] Once a reserve is in place, managers can then practice adaptive management and do continued community education.|$|E
