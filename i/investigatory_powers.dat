40|$|In May 2009, Congress {{passed the}} Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act which created the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, an independent, {{bipartisan}} panel tasked {{to examine the}} causes of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States. Franklin Roosevelt never created an independent commission to investigate Wall Street, but the Pecora hearings, the eponymous investigation of Wall Street wrongdoing run by a former New York prosecutor, captivated the country. For sixteen months in the worst depths of the Great Depression, Ferdinand Pecora paraded a series of elite financiers before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee. In one hearing after another, he chronicled how the leaders of Wall Street had manipulated stocks, dodged taxes, fleeced their shareholders, and collected enormous bonuses for peddling shoddy securities to unsuspecting American investors. Sensational headlines galvanized public opinion for reform and created the climate in which Congress was able to re-shape much of the modem structure of federal financial regulation. In the first hundred days of Roosevelt 2 ̆ 7 s administration, Congress passed the Banking Act of 1933. Earlier, Congress had passed the Securities Act of 1933. A year later came the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Now, {{more than a year after}} the FCIC released its final report, it is clear that the Commission did not live up to the legacy of its Depression-era predecessor. It was not until six months after the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted that the FCIC released its report on {{the causes of the}} financial crisis. This article compares the politics that underlay the FCIC investigation with those not only of the Pecora investigation but with those of what is generally perceived as a more successful independent commission—the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (the 9 / 11 Commission). When Congress created the FCIC it rejected proposals to conduct a congressional investigation more in line with the Pecora investigation and instead chose to model the FCIC explicitly on the 9 / 11 Commission. This paper highlights two reasons why the FCIC was not the Pecora investigation redux and why it failed to achieve the same consensus as the 9 / 11 Commission. The first explanation involves how the goals for these different investigations were defined. As explained in more detail in Section II, the Pecora investigation appears to have represented an innovative and novel application of congressional <b>investigatory</b> <b>power.</b> While the Pecora probe was ostensibly designed to investigate conditions in the securities markets in preparation for potential legislation, it differed from prior congressional efforts because its motivation was external to the legislature. The second reason why the FCIC hearings never looked like the Pecora hearings was because the former 2 ̆ 7 s design and structure bore absolutely no resemblance to the latter. Rather than being an investigation by a standing congressional committee subject to the near dictatorial control of the committee 2 ̆ 7 s chair, the FCIC was an independent, bipartisan commission that needed consensus to operate effectively. As explained in Section III, the FCIC was subject to the same limitations and political pressures that beset the 9 / 11 Commission 2 ̆ 7 s investigation. Both commissions faced numerous obstacles to conducting vigorous investigations: the partisan selection of commissioners combined with broad commission mandates, woefully small budgets, short time frames for conducting their investigations, and weak subpoena powers. The 9 / 11 Commission 2 ̆ 7 s chairman, former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, went so far as to argue that his commission was designed to fail...|$|R
40|$|From the introduction] Agreement {{was reached}} by the EU member states in June 2007 to remove the {{competition}} phrase contained in Article 3 (1) (g) of the EC Treaty 1 from the new Reform Treaty (hereafter {{referred to as the}} competition principle) and create a 'competition protocol' 2 that includes the words from Article 3 (1) (g). This paper argues such treatment of the matter is inadequate to protect the current competition acquis and ensure the healthy future development of Community competition law. Far from being a minor technical adjustment, this paper argues that the excision of the competition principle {{from the front of the}} Treaty is likely to have a number of damaging consequences for EC competition law. There is a real danger that in future EC competition law will be cribbed, crabbed and confined. While price-fixers may still be fined and dominant firms such as Microsoft put under the <b>investigatory</b> microscope, the <b>power</b> of the State to distort competition through subsidy and regulation will increase. There are also serious concerns as to the extent to which the excision of the competition principle will be deployed to assist industrial policy arguments in merger control cases and frustrate the liberalisation of hitherto protected industrial sectors. The paper is divided into four parts. Section 2 considers whether a protocol is sufficient to protect the current competition acquis; section 3 considers the likely consequences if Article 3 (1) (g) is not restored and the final section offers a conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Full text of {{this item}} is not {{currently}} {{available on the}} LRA. The final published version may be available through the links above. A domestic securities regulator, which is equipped with <b>investigatory</b> and enforcement <b>powers</b> conferred by statutes, should, in theory, be capable of regulating most securities-related activities. However, following from the liberalization of cross-border movements of capital, {{there has been a}} growth in the cross-listing of foreign companies on domestic exchanges. In the event of any disputes and/or frauds, the long arm of the law may not be capable of reaching other jurisdictions. This possibility is imminent in the context of Hong Kong, given that there is a high concentration of listed companies domiciled in China. This article seeks to explore how the regulatory cooperation of securities commissions through bilateral and multilateral agreements can be a solution to the cross-border enforcement problem. The regulators in Hong Kong and China have indeed worked very closely together. A notable product of this joint effort is a comprehensive regulatory framework for the Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In Hong Kong, Chapter 19 A of the Rules and Guidance on Listing Matters is used exclusively for Chinese issuers. It reiterates the applicability of general rules to Chinese issuers or provides modifications for them if applicable. In China, the special regulations and the mandatory provisions outline the general principles and specific requirements in relation to overseas listings. Although this comprehensive framework of regulation is arguably a successful one, making Hong Kong a leading fund-raising centre, the concession provided in Chapter 19 A can be a concern from an investor-protection perspective. There is a question of whether the Chinese issuers are genuinely committed to high standards. This article aims to examine the cooperation between Hong Kong and China in practice, discuss the problems, and reflect on how the Hong Kong case can be a lesson to other financial centres...|$|R

40|$|This study fills a hole left in {{research}} about the Federal Bureau of Investigation. While previous authors {{have examined the}} Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to the executive branch, especially under its long-time Director, J. Edgar Hoover, comparatively little {{has been written about}} the Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with the United States Congress. Using their <b>investigatory</b> and appropriations <b>powers,</b> members of Congress could have maintained stringent oversight of Bureau officials 2 ̆ 7 activities. Instead, members of Congress either deferred to the executive branch, especially presidents and attorneys general, or developed close relationships with Bureau officials based on a shared politics, mainly anti-communism during the Cold War. Examining the relationship from 1907 through 1975 offers numerous examples of members of Congress looking beyond their oversight responsibilities. Even as Congress investigated Bureau actions, no meaningful legislation was passed limiting Bureau activities. Instead, members of Congress left it to the executive branch to correct problems. On issues like wiretapping, Bureau officials either misled Congress about the extent of their activities or ignored Congressional mandates in order to continue their anti- communist agenda. As the Cold War developed, certain Congressional committees began to use Bureau files confidentially in order to educate the public on the dangers of communism. While Bureau officials initially supported such liaison relationships, they were based on the source of the committees 2 ̆ 7 information never coming to light. Once that condition was violated, Bureau officials terminated the relationship, hampering the committees 2 ̆ 7 ability to use the communist issue to further political careers. To fully understand the FBI 2 ̆ 7 s role in 20 th-century America, the relationship with Congress must be further explored. Focusing solely on Director Hoover or the executive branch is too narrow. Members of Congress had equal opportunity to oversee Bureau activities. That they did not fulfill this responsibility portrays the difficulty Americans have in containing the actions of investigatory agencies...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to compare the protections offered to {{minority}} shareholders by the Italian system of corporate law with those offered by the U. S. legal system of corporate and securities law in order to determine if Parmalat 2 ̆ 7 s minority shareholders would have been better off had Parmalat been an American company listed in the U. S. financial market. This analysis will reveal several weaknesses in Italian corporate and securities laws, thereby providing a basis for suggestions on how to improve minority shareholders 2 ̆ 7 rights in Italy based on the U. S. experience. Section II of this paper provides an overview of the structure of the Parmalat group, which was dominated by a strong, active majority shareholder and then discusses why Parmalat collapsed. It also describes the financial frauds that dragged the company into bankruptcy, again underlining the determinant role of the controlling shareholder and management. It further delineates the corporate monitoring structure and analyzes whether Parmalat complied, at least formally, with the recommended standards of corporate governance in Italy. Finally, this section outlines the legal remedies used by the Italian minority shareholders to attempt to obtain compensation for the harms they suffered because of this collapse. After a quick review of the legal sources of Italian corporate law, section III of the paper offers an overview of the main innovations introduced into Italian corporate law by the 2003 Reform movement. The innovations changed the structure of corporate governance of Italian stock companies and gave shareholders the opportunity to choose among three different systems of corporate governance. The innovations also created the mandatory requirement of an external auditor or auditing firm for each affected company. Section III next discusses the methods offered by Italian corporate law to protect listed companies 2 ̆ 7 minority shareholders. It concludes by discussing the role of the Commissione Nazionale per le Societa e la Borsa (2 ̆ 2 CONSOB 2 ̆ 2 or the Italian SEC) in protecting investors and monitoring the transparency and efficiency of the financial markets. Section IV gives a similar overview of the protection of listed companies 2 ̆ 7 minority shareholders in U. S. corporate law. It further explains the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (2 ̆ 2 SEC 2 ̆ 2) in financial markets, focusing on the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s <b>investigatory</b> and enforcement <b>powers.</b> Section V addresses the question of how the U. S. system would have protected the Parmalat minority shareholders had Parmalat been a U. S. listed company. It finds that a Rule 1 Ob- 5 action would be an available remedy for U. S. minority shareholders against perpetrators of fraud, including the company. It analyzes the effectiveness of a private securities fraud class action and its relation to SEC enforcement actions. It concludes by suggesting that the Italian legal system, in light of what happened in the Parmalat case, should introduce a private securities fraud class action similar to the U. S. Rule lOb- 5 action. It also suggests that the creation of such a class action should be accompanied by a significant increase in the powers of the CONSOB, specifically the power to enforce Italian securities law, in order to guarantee an adequate recovery of damages for injured shareholders and investors...|$|R
