5|$|A {{graduate}} of Ringgold High School and the University of Maryland, Zolak was selected 84th in the 1991 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. He {{did not play}} in 1991, but started four games in 1992 and had his most productive season statistically. When <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup {{for the next six}} seasons. He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when he was hurt, but only started three games during this time. He was released {{at the end of the}} 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring. After his retirement, he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} two clubs were placed in {{separate}} divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were {{among the best in}} the AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning (for the Colts) and Tom Brady (for the Patriots) The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31–28 loss in September as the Patriots behind <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> erased a 28–7 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20–15 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady–Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44–13 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38–17.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died at the}} age of 89. Mara {{had been}} {{involved}} with the Giants since he was 9 years old, when he was a ball boy for the Giants. The Giants dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Washington Redskins 36–0. Just twenty days after Mara's death, on November 15, 2005, the other Giants Executive Officer and well-known businessman Preston Robert Tisch {{died at the age}} of 79. The Giants then lost 24–21 to the Seahawks when kicker Josh Brown kicked a 36-yard game-winning field goal. They then defeated the Cowboys 17–10. The Giants defense made opposing QB <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> go 15 of 39 for 146yards with only one touchdown pass and two interceptions. On December 17, 2005, in their 27–17 home victory against the Kansas City Chiefs, Tiki Barber set the team's single game rushing yard record with 220yards, breaking the previous record of 218yards, which had been set by Gene Roberts on November 12, 1950.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots and the Bills {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. They have {{remained}} divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe.</b> However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both the Bills and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Patriots and {{new head}} coach Bill Parcells {{were looking to}} improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed Scott Secules, and {{attempted}} to sign Steve Beuerlein, but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade. In April, Millen {{was traded to the}} Dallas Cowboys, and the Patriots chose <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> with the first pick in the 1993 NFL Draft. During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback. Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes. He became a restricted free agent in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years. As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As {{was the case in the}} 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the holder for extra point and field goal attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback. The 1995 season was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992. On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 3017. Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the Denver Broncos. This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.|$|E
25|$|The Browns intercepted three {{passes from}} New England quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> and halted an {{attempted}} comeback {{in the final}} minutes of the game to clinch the victory.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry is also notable as {{numerous}} players, including <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe,</b> Doug Flutie, Lawyer Milloy, Brandon Spikes, Scott Chandler and Stephon Gilmore have played for both teams {{at some point}} in their careers.|$|E
25|$|The Packers outgained the Patriots 323 {{yards to}} 257 and intercepted quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> four times. Packers {{defensive}} lineman Reggie White set a Super Bowl record with three sacks, including back-to-back takedowns in the 3rd quarter.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} {{speculation}} on whether longtime starter <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> might start the game. As stated above, Bledsoe replaced an injured Brady against the Steelers in the AFC Championship game. Eventually, though, Brady was named starter.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{got off to}} a hot 7–3 {{start for}} the 2005 season but ended the season in 3rd place with a 9–7 record. Prior to the season {{starting}} the Cowboys signed veteran <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> as a quarterback.|$|E
25|$|When Romo {{started the}} Thanksgiving Day game against Tampa Bay, {{it marked the}} 7th {{different}} starting Cowboys quarterback in the last 7 Thanksgiving Day games (Troy Aikman, Ryan Leaf, Chad Hutchison, Quincy Carter, Drew Henson, <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> and Romo).|$|E
25|$|The Patriots' storybook season {{continued}} as <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> {{came into the}} game in the second quarter in place of an injured Tom Brady – who replaced Bledsoe himself early in the season when he suffered a sheared blood vessel.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys {{have had}} nine {{starting}} quarterbacks since Troy Aikman retired in 2000. They are Quincy Carter(started 32 games), Vinny Testaverde(started 15), the other games have been started by Ryan Leaf(3), Anthony Wright(3), Clint Stoerner(2 games), Chad Hutchinson(9), Drew Henson(1 game), <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> (22), and now Tony Romo is starting.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots' 530 net {{yards of}} offense were {{the second highest}} output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots career.|$|E
25|$|Brady {{started the}} season as the fourth string quarterback, behind starter <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop; by season's end, he was number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe. During his rookie season, he was 1-of-3 passing, for six yards. Tight end Rod Rutledge caught Brady's first and only {{completed}} pass {{of the season in}} a 34–9 loss to the Detroit Lions on November 23.|$|E
25|$|With {{the first}} pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, the Patriots {{selected}} quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> from Washington State. This {{was only part of}} a major season of change in New England. Other draft picks such as linebacker Chris Slade helped the team immediately. Bledsoe started the season as the starting quarterback, but after losing the first four games, he was injured and replaced with former Dolphins backup Scott Secules, who won one of his two games.|$|E
25|$|This Super Bowl {{featured}} two {{clubs that}} were considered losing teams {{for much of}} the late 1980s. The Packers' fortunes turned after head coach Mike Holmgren and quarterback Brett Favre joined the team in 1992. The Patriots' rise began in 1993 when Bill Parcells was hired as head coach, and the team drafted quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe.</b> Under their respective head coaches and quarterbacks, Green Bay posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record in 1996, while New England advanced to their second Super Bowl after recording an 11–5 record.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{managed to}} right {{the ship in}} , {{although}} the quarterback situation had not quite improved. A solid defense led the league for fewest yards allowed per attempt, sending four players (Rob Burnett, Pepper Johnson, Michael Dean Perry, and Eric Turner) to the Pro Bowl. The Browns finished 11–5, making {{the playoffs for the}} first time in five seasons. In the AFC wild card game against the New England Patriots, the Browns' defense picked off <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> three times, with Testaverde completing two-thirds of his passes, to win 20–13. Arch-rival Pittsburgh ended the Browns' season the following week, however, with a 29–9 blowout in the AFC divisional game.|$|E
25|$|Coming off a fifth-place {{finish in}} head coach Bill Belichick's first season in 2000, the Patriots were not {{expected}} to fare much better in 2001. While <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> was signed to a 10-year contract extension in March, offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong retired, and wide receiver Terry Glenn had a preseason contract holdout and was also hit with a drug suspension by the NFL {{for the first four}} games of the season. Despite these high-profile losses, the Patriots were able to find adequate replacements at very low cost. Receivers Troy Brown and David Patten had career seasons, 1st-round draft pick Richard Seymour anchored the defensive line, and Antowain Smith (a free agent signed from Buffalo) ran for over 1,000 yards.|$|E
25|$|Testaverde's one-year {{contract}} with the Cowboys expired early in 2005. The Cowboys chose to instead sign Parcells's 1993 number one draft pick, <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe,</b> as their top quarterback, leaving Testaverde without a contract. Parcells cites Testaverde's presence in Dallas as having been important {{to the development of}} their former starter Tony Romo. At the time, his 3,532 passing yards and 297 completions were the third best total of his career and the third most passing yards in Dallas Cowboys franchise history. He also tied the franchise record for 300-yard passing games in a season with three and became the fifth quarterback in league history to pass for over 300 yards at forty years of age.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots were {{severely}} depleted by injuries, playing without star {{running back}} Curtis Martin. Pro Bowl tight end Ben Coates {{was limited to}} just a few plays, while receiver Terry Glenn was out of the game a few minutes into the fourth quarter. On the third play of the game, rookie defensive back Chad Scott intercepted a pass from New England quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> and returned it 27 yards to the Steelers 38. Stewart then got the team to the Patriots 40-yard line, converting two third downs with 10-yard completions to Charles Johnson before taking the ball {{the rest of the way}} to the end zone on a 40-yard score, the longest touchdown run in Steelers playoff history at the time.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys {{improved}} their defense before the 2005 {{season with the}} additions of first round draft picks DeMarcus Ware and Marcus Spears. Parcells drafted these players in hopes of jumpstarting the team's transition from the traditional 4–3 defense to a 3–4 defense, which Parcells had run {{in all of his}} previous stops. Jerry Jones also added a number of high-priced older veteran players, acquiring nose tackle Jason Ferguson and cornerback Anthony Henry via free agency, and linebacker Scott Fujita via the Kansas City Chiefs. On offense, the Cowboys felt the need to upgrade their passing game to complement their top 2004 draft pick, running back Julius Jones, and acquired quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> via free agency. During his tenure, Parcells made a point of signing players who had played for him in the past, including Bledsoe, Terry Glenn (with the Patriots), Testaverde, cornerback Aaron Glenn, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, and fullback Richie Anderson with the Jets. In 2005, the Cowboys went 9–7, missing the playoffs by one game.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} play from scrimmage, the Steelers {{got a taste of}} what lay in store as Pats quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> {{completed}} a 53-yard pass to Terry Glenn that set up Curtis Martin's 2-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh was quickly forced to punt, and New England took just four plays to score again, the last a 34-yard touchdown on a screen pass from Bledsoe to fullback Keith Byars, giving the team a 14-0 lead just over seven minutes into the first quarter. Then on {{the first play}} of the second quarter, Martin burst {{through a hole in the}} right line, dodged a tackle attempt by Carnell Lake, and raced 78 yards for a touchdown, the second longest scoring run in NFL postseason history. Near the end of the half, Steelers defensive back Willie Williams intercepted a pass from Bledsoe to give his team a chance to get back in the game. But Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs on the Pats 24-yard line and the score remained 21-0 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} season, Brady {{took over as}} the {{starting}} quarterback after <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> was injured; he eventually led the Patriots to victory in Super Bowl XXXVI. The Patriots would miss the playoffs the following season, but would then win back-to-back titles in 2003 and 2004. Although Brady and the Patriots continued to be highly successful, he {{did not return to}} the Super Bowl until the 2007 season. In that season, Brady set an NFL record for touchdown passes, won his first League MVP, and led the Patriots to a 16–0 regular season record. However, the Patriots were upset by the New York Giants in spectacular fashion in Super Bowl XLII. Brady missed virtually the entire following season due to a catastrophic knee injury in his first game. Brady won the National Football League Comeback Player of the Year Award in the 2009 season, and he and the Patriots continued in that and subsequent seasons to turn in strong performances, winning his second League MVP in 2010. Brady returned to the Super Bowl in the 2011 season where once again Brady and the Patriots were upset by the New York Giants. Brady then made his sixth trip to the Super Bowl after the 2014 season (his 15th as a professional) where he led a memorable fourth quarter comeback over the defending champion Seattle Seahawks for his fourth Super Bowl win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time. Brady missed the first four games of the 2016 season due to a suspension resulting from the Deflategate controversy, but then won 11 out of the 12 remaining regular season games and two postseason games to make his seventh and most recent Super Bowl appearance, earning his fifth Super Bowl win and fourth Super Bowl MVP title in epic fashion, coming back from a 25-point deficit against the Atlanta Falcons midway through the third quarter to win in overtime, by far the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history.|$|E
500|$|After leading Charles M. Russell High School in Great Falls, Montana to the 1992 Montana state title, he {{considered}} playing college football as a linebacker at the University of Miami. He {{chose to be}} a quarterback for the Washington State Cougars instead after head coach Mike Price, who had coached longtime New England Patriots starting quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe,</b> called {{him on the phone}} while Leaf was watching the Rose Bowl, and told him [...] "If you come here, we're going there" [...] even though Washington State had not reached the Rose Bowl since 1931. Leaf told Sports Illustrated that he immediately knew he wanted to accept a scholarship and play for Price.|$|E

[...] His first NFL pass was a 33-yard {{completion}} to wide receiver Sam Hurd. [...] His only other pass of the game was a two-yard touchdown pass, his first in the NFL, to wide receiver Terrell Owens.|$|E
2500|$|Mike Vanderjagt kicked two field goals, one {{of which}} was 50 yards long. <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> threw for a {{touchdown}} in the first and the fourth quarters {{for the first time since}} 2005. The Cowboys defense allowed no touchdowns, with the only touchdown for the Redskins coming from a kickoff return by Rock Cartwright). It was also the first time that the Cowboys had allowed zero second-half points since November 20, 2005 against the Detroit Lions.|$|E
2500|$|The Cowboys {{opened the}} regular season on the road against the Jacksonville Jaguars on September 10. The Cowboys built a lead of 10–0 just 10 minutes into the game, but allowed 24 {{consecutive}} points in later quarters. Quarterback <b>Drew</b> <b>Bledsoe</b> threw two interceptions, and placekicker Shaun Suisham missed a field goal off the right upright. The Cowboys scored again during the final minutes of the fourth quarter, when newly signed wide receiver Terrell Owens caught his first touchdown in a Dallas uniform, which was also his first regular-season game since October 2005. Dallas attempted and failed an onside kick, but received the ball again when their defense prevented the Jaguars from getting a first down. The Cowboys drive {{to tie the game}} ended with a Bledsoe interception. [...] With the loss, the Cowboys started out their season at 0–1.|$|E
