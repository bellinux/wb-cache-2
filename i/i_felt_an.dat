25|$|Early on, Casanova {{demonstrated}} a quick wit, an intense appetite for knowledge, and a perpetually inquisitive mind. He entered the University of Padua at twelve and graduated at seventeen, in 1742, {{with a degree}} in law ("for which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> unconquerable aversion"). It was his guardian's hope that he would become an ecclesiastical lawyer. Casanova had also studied moral philosophy, chemistry, and mathematics, and was keenly interested in medicine. ("I should have been allowed to do as I wished and become a physician, in which profession quackery is even more effective than it is in legal practice.") He frequently prescribed his own treatments for himself and friends. While attending the university, Casanova began to gamble and quickly got into debt, causing his recall to Venice by his grandmother, but the gambling habit became firmly established.|$|E
2500|$|After his death, Kharlamov's {{teammates}} with CSKA {{decided that}} no one at any level of the organization would wear Kharlamov's #17 sweater, until his son Alexander {{was old enough to}} wear it. Alexander wore #17 until he was a teenager, but later switched to #22, feeling that the expectations that went along with his father's sweater number were too great. When he found himself playing for Tikhonov with the Central Red Army club in 1992, the decision was taken away from him, and he was issued the #17 sweater. After initially being reluctant, Alexander said [...] "Now I am used to it. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> additional burden on my shoulders. But now I don't feel anything like that." [...] The #17 is not worn by any member of the Russian national team at senior international competitions. Ilya Kovalchuk who usually wears #17 in honour of Kharlamov, his father's favorite player, dons the reverse #71 for international play.|$|E

30|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{little sense}} of loss, at the beginning. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> relaxed because you needn’t go to work everyday, then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> bit of loss. I managed to lessen the feeling of loss through my child. My job was easy and I had a good salary.|$|R
6000|$|We had not {{proceeded}} {{more than}} a mile when suddenly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> very gentle tap on the end of my nose, and at the same moment the young lady turned her head towards me and exclaimed: [...] "It's going to rain! <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> drop!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{spasm of}} petulant {{annoyance}} at this unexpected catastrophe.|$|R
60|$|In that {{dazzling}} light, in that fearful silence, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> Invisible Presence near me. It {{touched me}} gently.|$|E
60|$|It weaned me of all further {{desire to}} rail at Mary, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{uncommon}} drawing to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that is so." [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> inexpressible {{lightening}} of the heart. Mary Cavendish {{could certainly}} not rest under suspicion.|$|E

60|$|At last <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{touch on}} my shoulder, and heard Fabio's voice.|$|R
60|$|As I {{opened the}} gate <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> odd chill of {{positive}} fear. Then she smiled as if I had spoken my thought.|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} at the thought, and with those {{pictures}} of grim nature before me, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> unpleasant shiver coursing down my spine.|$|E
60|$|My spirit quailed {{under those}} last words; and yet <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> immense relief {{at the same}} time, as if some {{overwhelming}} burden had been lifted from me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> ferocious {{pleasure}} in throwing {{the words of}} contempt in his face.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little obstinate {{and did not}} at once {{get into}} the carriage.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> thrill while <b>I</b> {{answered}} him; but no coldness, and no faintness.|$|R
60|$|Saying {{these last}} words, the lawyer {{approached}} {{me on his}} way out of the house. I stopped him without ceremony; <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> ungovernable curiosity to know more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Jeanne answered, [...] "only {{you asked}} me a question, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> irresistible desire to answer you truthfully. It would have come sooner or later." ...|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} strangely jumbled anticipations that haunted me during our {{passage from the}} {{cruising}} ground. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> irresistible curiosity to see those islands which the olden voyagers had so glowingly described.|$|E
60|$|Ham {{glanced at}} me, and {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> shock {{that struck me}} back.|$|R

60|$|Well, I {{had hardly}} taken it when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> odd sort of psychic feeling--a sort of drowsiness. I {{remember}}, in a dim way, going to bed, and then I remember nothing till I woke up next morning.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{unreasonable}} amazement. I {{knew that}} something strange had happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. As I stood staring, {{the door into the}} garden opened, and the man-servant appeared.|$|E
60|$|The {{bombardment}} became furious, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> uncomfortable {{disposition to}} shrink as I heard and saw shot and shell falling {{everywhere in the}} streets, piercing the houses, and bursting in them. Many of these were speedily reduced to ruins.|$|E
60|$|The next instant <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{hand on my}} collar, and I {{was drawn}} {{forcibly}} back.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{respect for}} Miss Jhansi McKenna; and I {{went to her}} wedding later on.|$|R

60|$|I {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary persuasion that I {{was being}} played with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this mysterious death--as swift as {{the passage of}} light--would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down.|$|E
60|$|But {{the clouds}} in the {{direction}} of Seville were very black, and coming nearer I saw that it rained upon the hills. The water fell on the earth like a transparent sheet of grey. Soon <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> occasional drop, and I put on my poncho.|$|E
