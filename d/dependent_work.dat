The GMU can pause the dispatch of new grids and queue pending and suspended grids {{until they are}} ready to execute, providing the flexibility to enable powerful runtimes, such as Dynamic Parallelism.The CUDA Work Distributor in Kepler holds grids that are ready to dispatch, and is able to dispatch 32 active grids, which is double the capacity of the Fermi CWD. The Kepler CWD communicates with the GMU via a bidirectional link that allows the GMU to pause the dispatch of new grids and to hold pending and suspended grids until needed. The GMU also has a direct connection to the Kepler SMX units to permit grids that launch additional work on the GPU via Dynamic Parallelism to send the new work back to GMU to be prioritized and dispatched. If the kernel that dispatched the additional workload pauses, the GMU will hold it inactive until the <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> has completed.|$|E
50|$|The main {{taxes in}} Chile {{in terms of}} revenue {{collection}} are the value added tax (45.8% of total revenues in 2012) and the income tax (41.8% of total revenues in 2012). The value added tax is levied on sales {{of goods and services}} (including imports) at a rate of 19%, with a few exemptions. The income tax revenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of 20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is ultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid constitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global Complementary Tax (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the case of non-residents). The Global Complementary Tax is payable by those that have different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally progressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income arising from corporate activity under the Global Complementary Tax only becomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual. There are also special sales taxes on alcohol and luxury goods, as well as specific taxes on tobacco and fuel. Other taxes include the inheritance tax and custom duties.|$|E

This practice that {{is also known as}} a so-called švarcsystém, i. e. the mutual relationship between two parties in which a natural person performs the <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> for another natural person or legal entity on grounds of a commercial- law or civil law agreement and therefore outside a labour-law relationship, has been as of 1 January 2012 regarded as illegal work. The regulation of labour law in the Czech Republic has been significantly changed as of 1 January 2012, including amendments to Labour Code and Act on Employment. The amendment to the Labour Code changed a legal definition of the <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> {{that is one of the}} main terms of the Czech labour law. The performance of the <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> outside the labour law relationship has been regarded as the illegal work due to the amendment of the Act on Employment.

40|$|Since 2007 Labour Code {{contains}} {{the definition of}} <b>dependent</b> <b>work,</b> which {{can be carried out}} only in labour-law relations. The Amendment to Labour Code from 2012 makes the definition more precise, when it stipulates essential elements of <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> and designates the others as conditions, under which <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> should be carried out. The Amendment to Employment Act changes the definition of illegal work. Illegal work is a performance of <b>dependent</b> <b>work</b> by natural person except for labour-law relation, or if natural person – foreigner carries out work in conflict with issued permission to employment or without this permission. Since 2012 sanctions for illegal work were increased. Labour inspection is entitled to impose sanctions, in case of foreigners it is Customs Office. For control purposes employer is obliged to have copies of documents at the workplace proving the existence of labour-law relation. Goal of controls and high fines is to limit illegal employment of citizens of Czech Republic and foreigners as well. Illegal work has unfavourable economic impact on state budget. It comes to extensive tax evasions and also to evasions within health insurance and social security. If a concluded commercial-law relation meets the attributes of <b>dependent</b> <b>work,</b> then it stands for a concealed legal relationship. Tax Office can subsequently assess an income tax to businessman. Labour-law relationship enjoys a higher legal protection than commercial-law relationship; nonetheless it is not suitable to limit liberty of contract in cases when it is not unambiguously a dependent activity...|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{financial}} supports {{from foreign}} brides to their natal families {{have also been}} under-acknowledged {{due to the traditional}} gender norm of seeing married-out daughters as “spilt water” (Zhang 2009). However, as noted by many scholars (Suzuki 2005; Angeles and Sunanta 2009; Cheng 2010), with the improvement of migrant women’s economic capabilities, {{they are more likely to}} help their parents with concrete supports. Migrant daughters are more reliable than sons in remitting income to their birth families (Angeles and Sunanta 2009; Faier 2007; Mills 1999; Lapanun 2010). Interestingly, some studies (Bélanger and Linh 2011; Suzuki 2005) discover that even when a foreign bride earns money by herself and sends remittance home, their parents and relatives still believe that the financial support is from the son-in-law. Here, we can easily discern how the stereotypical gendered bias to see foreign brides only as <b>dependents</b> <b>works</b> again to deny their economic contributions.|$|R

Using a survey of public sector employees in Queensland, Australia and structural equation modelling, {{the results show that}} participatory management consistently reduces work-to-life interference via a number of pathways: by increasing flexibility of work hours, increasing meaningful work, reducing workload, and reducing work uncertainty. Although females with <b>dependents</b> <b>work</b> fewer hours on average, they are still more likely to have higher work-to-life interference. Overall, however, the main way participative management can reduce work-to-life interference is by reducing workloads. Participative management is normally employed to increase organizational efficiency and effectiveness; however, it can also reduce work-to-life interferences for its employees and thus assist an organization in meeting its social responsibility obligations...|$|R

A hypothesis is presented which assumes that those relations are de facto relations between workers and their employers despite the form and name of the agreement between contract parties, which refers to it as a business deal. The thesis consists of two main chapters. The first of them introduces the concept of "dependent work," which is used by the Czech legislation to determine which relations should be regulated by the labor law.

Stones {{are major}} {{materials}} for various {{civil engineering works}} and architectural construction areas and various kinds of stones are being used in construction sites and those areas are also very diverse. Even though the size of domestic stone market size is currently increasing, production volume cannot meet the demand because the production method is still highly <b>dependent</b> on manual <b>work.</b> In addition, as China is rising {{as the center of}} world stone market which emphasized the strong price competitiveness, imports from China are currently increasing because China is gradually securing the quality competitiveness as well. This seems because the quality of Chinese stones does not fall behind than the quality of domestic stones and in order to recover this situation, it is considered important to maximize the productivity of domestic stone working companies through the automation of production environment and to secure the price competitiveness through quality equalization to deal with low labor costs which China is emphasizing as their strength. Based on these reasons, this development was conducted and tried to secure the competitiveness of stone working by developing automatic control technology and stone working technology using air pressure and PLC, preventing risk factors and environmental problems caused by manual work in stone working site, removing working risk factors through automation and reducing dust and noise.
