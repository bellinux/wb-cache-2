They are commonly thought to be local phenomena that collect the random thermal electron current, but do not otherwise perturb a plasma. Here, using experiments on an electrode embedded in a wall, particle-in-cell simulations and theory, it is shown that under low temperature plasma conditions (T_e ≫ T_i) <b>electron</b> <b>sheaths</b> are far from local. Instead, a long presheath region (in excess of 70 λ_D) extends into the plasma where electrons are accelerated via a pressure gradient to a flow speed exceeding the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge.

For the optimal target thickness D = Δ > c/ωp, the <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> is piled up at the rear surface and the sheath electric field accelerates the protons until they are reflected by the inertial force in the accelerated frame. These protons are therefore trapped by the combined forces of the electrostatic field of the <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> and the inertial force of the accelerating target.

40|$|The plasma {{dynamics}} {{resulting from}} the simultaneous impact, of two equal, ultra-intense laser pulses, in two spatially separated spots, onto a dense target is studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The simulations show that electrons accelerated to relativistic speeds, cross the target and exit at its rear surface. Most energetic electrons are bound to the rear surface by the ambipolar electric field and expand along it. Their current is closed by a return current in the target, and this current configuration generates strong surface magnetic fields. The two <b>electron</b> <b>sheaths</b> collide at the midplane between the laser impact points. The magnetic repulsion between the counter-streaming electron beams separates them along the surface normal direction, before they can thermalize through other beam instabilities. This magnetic repulsion is also the driving mechanism for the beam-Weibel (filamentation) instability, which {{is thought to be}} responsible for magnetic field growth close to the internal shocks of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. The relative strength of this repulsion compared to the competing electrostatic interactions, which is evidenced by the simulations, suggests that the filamentation instability can be examined in an experimental setting.

New exact {{results are}} {{obtained}} for relativistic acceleration of test positive ions in the laminar zone of a planar <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> evolving from an initially mono-energetic electron distribution. The electron dynamics is calculated {{against the background}} of motionless foil ions. The limiting gamma-factor γp ∞ of accelerated ions is shown to be determined primarily by the values of the ion-electron charge-over-mass ratio µ = meZp/mp and the initial gamma-factor γ 0 of the accelerated electrons.

40|$|Electron sheaths are {{commonly}} found near Langmuir probes collecting the electron saturation current. The common {{assumption is that}} the probe collects the random flux of electrons incident on the sheath, which tacitly implies {{that there is no}} electron presheath and that the flux collected is due to a velocity space truncation of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). This work provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths, which suggests that they are not so simple. Motivated by EVDFs observed in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, a 1 D model for the <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> and presheath is developed. In the model, under low temperature plasma conditions (T_e≫ T_i), an electron pressure gradient accelerates electrons in the presheath to a flow velocity that exceeds the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This pressure gradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by ballistic motion in response to the electric field. It is found that in many situations, under common plasma conditions, the electron presheath extends much further into the plasma than an analogous ion presheath. PIC simulations reveal that the ion density in the electron presheath is determined by a flow around the <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> and that this flow is due to 2 D aspects of the sheath geometry. Simulations also indicate the presence of ion acoustic waves excited by the differential flow between electrons and ions in the presheath which result in sheath edge fluctuations.

40|$|A {{new type}} of laser photodetachment (LPD) {{technique}} has been developed for the measurement of <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> thickness around an electrostatic probe and for the measurement {{of the length of}} collection region of photodetached electrons (PDE). When a thickness of the sheath formed around an electrostatic probe is thicker than about 0. 1 mm, modification of the temporal evolution of the LPD signal is observed. By making use of the modification, we evaluated sheath thickness around a cylindrical probe in the existence of the magnetic field of 15 mT. It was found that the thickness of <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> along the magnetic field was comparable to the calculated plane-parallel Child-Langmuir sheath thickness when the probe-bias voltage was high. Furthermore, by inserting a small screening object in the laser beam channel, we can measure the sheath thickness from the modification of LPD signal. From the variation of the signal intensity as scanning the screening object perpendicular to the laser beam channel, we can observe the collection region of photodetached electrons, because this procedure changes the relative displacement between shadow and the probe electrode.

Because of the low plasma collisionality the two counterstreaming beams of secondary electrons {{are not expected to}} be totally trapped within the bulk of the discharge. In order to analyze the effects of partial trapping of secondary electrons on the presheathsheath radial structure, a macroscopic model is formulated. The plasma response depends on the secondary electron emission yield and the trapped fraction of secondary <b>electrons.</b> The <b>sheath</b> potential and wall energy losses are determined mainly by the net current of secondary <b>electrons</b> in the <b>sheaths.</b> For any practical value of the secondary emission yield, the zero-trapping solution is very similar to the zero secondary emission case.

40|$|Electrodes in low {{pressure}} laboratory plasmas have {{a multitude of}} possible sheath structures when biased at a large positive potential. When {{the size of the}} electrode is small enough the electrode bias can be above the plasma potential. When this occurs an electron-rich sheath called an <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> is present at the electrode. Electron sheaths are most commonly found near Langmuir probes and other electrodes collecting the electron saturation current. Such electrodes have applications in the control of plasma parameters, dust confinement and circulation, control of scrape off layer plasmas, RF plasmas, and in plasma contactors and tethered space probes. The electron sheaths in these various systems most directly influence the plasma by determining how electron current is lost from the system. An understanding of how the <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> interfaces with the bulk plasma is necessary for understanding the behavior induced by positively biased electrodes in these plasmas. This thesis provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths. Motivated by electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) observed in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, a 1 D model for the <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> and presheath is developed. In the presheath model, an electron pressure gradient accelerates electrons to near the electron thermal speed by the sheath edge. This pressure gradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by ballistic motion in response to the electric field. Using PIC simulations, the form of a sheath near a small electrode with bias near the plasma potential is also studied. When the electrode is biased near the plasma potential, the EVDFs exhibit a loss-cone type truncation due to fast electrons overcoming the small potential difference between the electrode and plasma. No sheath is present in this regime, instead the plasma remains quasineutral up to the electrode. Once the bias exceeds the plasma potential an <b>electron</b> <b>sheath</b> is present. In this case, 2 D EVDFs indicate that the flow moment has comparable contributions from the flow shift and loss-cone truncation. The case of an electrode at large positive bias relative to the plasma potential is also studied. Here, the rate of electron impact ionization of neutrals increases near the electrode. If this ionization rate is great enough a double layer forms. This double layer can move outward separating a high potential plasma at the electrode surface from the bulk plasma. This phenomenon is known as an anode spot. Informed by observations from the first PIC simulations of an anode spot, a model has been developed describing the onset in which ionization leads to the buildup of positive space charge and the formation of a potential well that traps electrons near the electrode surface. A model for steady-state properties based on current loss, power, and particle balance of the anode spot plasma is also presented...|$|E

Laser produced plasmas {{have been shown to}} support quasi-static TeV/m acceleration gradients which are more than four orders of magnitude stronger than conventional accelerators. These high gradients have the potential to allow compact particle accelerators for active interrogation of nuclear material. In order to better understand this application, several experiments have been conducted at the HERCULES and lambda^ 3 lasers as the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the University of Michigan. Electron acceleration and bremsstrahlung generation were studied on the lambda^ 3 laser. The scaling of the intensity, angular, and material dependence of bremsstrahlung radiation from an intense (I> 10 ^ 18 W/cm^ 2) laser-solid interaction has been characterized at energies between 100 keV and 1 MeV. These were the first high resolution (lambda/d_lambda> 100) measurements of bremsstrahlung photons from a relativistic laser plasma interaction. The electron populations and bremsstrahlung temperatures were modeled in the particle-in-cell code OSIRIS and the Monte Carlo code MCNPX and were in good agreement with the experimental results.

The effect of three dimensional perturbations of <b>electron</b> <b>sheaths</b> on proton acceleration was investigated through the use of foil, grid, and wire targets. Hot electron density, as measured with an imaging Cu Kalpha crystal, increased as the target surface area was reduced and was correlated to an increase in the temperature of the accelerated proton beam.
