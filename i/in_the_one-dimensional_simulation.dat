The standard method developped by Rice is difficult to apply when we consider second and third order of scattered fields {{as a function of}} the surface height. Calculations can be greatly simplified with the use of reduced Rayleigh equations, because one of the unknown fields can be eliminated. We derive a new set of four reduced equations for the scattering amplitudes, which are applied to the cases of a rough conducting surface, and to a slab where one of the boundary is a rough surface.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{promising}} alternative rocket propulsion concepts {{have been developed}} {{over the past two}} decades that take advantage of unsteady combustion waves in order to produce thrust. These concepts include the Pulse Detonation Rocket Engine (PDRE), in which repetitive ignition, propagation, and reflection of detonations and shocks can create a high pressure chamber from which gases may be exhausted in a controlled manner. The Pulse Detonation Rocket Induced Magnetohydrodynamic Ejector (PDRIME) is a modification of the basic PDRE concept, developed by Cambier (1998), which has the potential for performance improvements based on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) thrust augmentation. The PDRIME has the advantage of both low combustion chamber seeding pressure, per the PDRE concept, and efficient energy distribution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system, per the rocket-induced MHD ejector (RIME) concept of Cole, et al. (1995). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> initial part of this thesis, we explore flow and performance characteristics of different configurations of the PDRIME, assuming quasi-one-dimensional transient flow and global representations of the effects of MHD phenomena on the gas dynamics. By utilizing high-order accurate solvers, we thus are able o investigate the fundamental physical processes associated with the PDRIME and PDRE concepts and identify potentially promising operating regimes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second part of this investigation, the detailed coupling of detonations and electric and magnetic fields are explored. First, a one-dimensional spark-ignited detonation with complex reaction kinetics is fully evaluated and the mechanisms for the different instabilities are analyzed. It is found that complex kinetics in addition to sufficient spatial resolution are required to be able to quantify high frequency as well as low frequency detonation instability modes. Armed with this quantitative understanding, we then examine the interaction of a propagating detonation and the applied MHD, both in one-dimensional and two-dimensional transient simulations. The dynamics of the detonation are found to be affected by the application of magnetic and electric fields. We find that <b>the</b> regularity of <b>one-dimensional</b> cesium-seeded detonations can be ignificantly altered by reasonable applied magnetic fields (Bz &le 8 T), but that it takes a stronger applied field (Bz > 16 T) to significantly alter the cellular structure and detonation velocity of a two-dimensional detonation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time <b>in</b> which these phenomena were observed. This observation is likely attributed to the additional coupling of the two-dimensional detonation with the transverse waves, which are not captured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>simulations.</b> Future studies involving full ionization kinetics including collisional-radiative processes, will be used to examine these processes in further detail...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{acoustic}} source characteristics of internal combustion engines (IC-engines) {{is of great}} importance when designing the exhaust duct system and its components to withstand the resulting dynamic loads and to reduce the exhaust noise emission. Number of studies has been published earlier on the low frequency in-duct exhaust noise of high speed engines. The goal {{of the present study}} is to investigate the medium speed IC-engine acoustic source characteristics numerically and experimentally not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low frequency - plane wave range but also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high frequency range. The low frequency acoustic source characteristics were predicted by simulating {{the acoustic}} multi-load measurements using a <b>one-dimensional</b> process <b>simulation</b> code. <b>The</b> engine model used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> process <b>simulations</b> was validated with measurements. In this study, it is shown that the low frequency in-duct exhaust noise of a medium speed IC-engine can be predicted quite accurately by using a onedimensional process simulation code. The high frequency source data is estimated by averaging the measured acoustic pressures with different methods. According to this study, using the simple cross spectra averaging method instead of two microphone method to estimate the induct downstream acoustic power of medium speed IC-engine exhaust noise seems promising. The simulation of the high frequency exhaust noise is beyond this study. QC 20140826 </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary Leaf {{area and}} its spatial {{distribution}} are key can-opy parameters needed {{to model the}} radiation regime within a forest and to compute the mass and energy exchange between a forest and the atmosphere. A much larger proportion of avail-able net radiation is received at <b>the</b> forest floor <b>in</b> open-canopy forests than <b>in</b> closed-canopy forests. <b>The</b> proportion of eco-system water vapor exchange (λE) and sensible heat exchange from the forest floor is therefore expected to be larger in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests. We used a combination of optical and canopy geometry measurements, and robust one- and three-dimensional models to evaluate the influence of canopy architecture and radiative transfer on estimates of carbon, water and energy exchange of a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forest. Three-dimensional model simulations showed that the aver-age probability of diffuse and direct radiation transmittance to the forest floor was greater than if a random distribution of fo-liage had been assumed. Direct and diffuse radiation transmit-tance to the forest floor was 28 and 39 %, respectively, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional model simulations versus 23 and 31 %, re-spectively, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> model <b>simulations.</b> <b>The</b> as-sumption of randomly distributed foliage versus inclusion of clumping factors in a one-dimensional, multi-layer biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange model (CANVEG) had the greatest effect on simulated annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil evaporation. Assuming random distribution, NEE was 41 % lower, net photosynthesis 3 % lower, total λE 10 % lower, and soil evaporation 40 % lower. The same comparisons at LAI 5 showed a similar effect on annual NEE estimates (37 %) and λE (12 %), but a much larger effect on net photosynthesis (20 %), suggesting that, at low LAI, canopies are mostly sunlit, so that redistribution of light has little effect on net photosyn-thesis, whereas the effect on net photosynthesis is much greater at high LAIs...|$|R
40|$|Laminar methane/air {{premixed}} flames {{at different}} pressures {{in a newly}} developed high-pressure Bunsen flame rig are studied using detailed numerical simulations and laser diagnostics. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> numerical <b>simulations,</b> <b>one-dimensional</b> and two-dimensional axisymmetric configurations were considered employing detailed transport properties and chemical kinetic mechanisms. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> measurements, OH PLIF was employed. The aims are to improved {{the understanding of the}} structures of the flames at varying pressures, to measure the laminar flame speed at different pressures, and to quantify the accuracy of the Bunsen flame method for measurement of laminar flame speed at different pressures. The stoichiometric and fuel-rich flames were found to exhibit a two-reaction-zone structure: an inner premixed flame <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> fuel was converted to CO and H 2, and an outer diffusion flame in which CO and H 2 were oxidized further to form combustion products. With increasing pressure, the inner premixed flame becomes thinner and the flame as a whole has the tendency to become unstable. Using the numerical and the experimental data, the methods of flame-cone-angle and flame-area were used to extract the laminar flame speed for different equivalence ratios and pressures. The flame-cone-angle method showed slightly better accuracy than the flame-area method did. The accuracy of both methods became lower under high pressure conditions. The inlet velocity of the burner was shown to affect the accuracy of the extracted laminar flame speed. For a stoichiometric atmospheric flame {{it was found that the}} most suitable inlet velocity for the fuel/air mixture was about 6 times the laminar flame speed, yielding a flame length about 7 times the radius of the burner. With appropriate flame length, the mid-height of the flame showed a rather low flame stretch rate, the laminar flame speed being in close agreement with the unstretched laminar flame speed, the error being less than 6 % for the flames that were studied...|$|R
