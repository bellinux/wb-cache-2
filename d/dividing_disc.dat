50|$|The {{album is}} {{composed}} by 32 songs, <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs,</b> one for pop {{and the other}} one for rancheras.|$|R
5000|$|The Target {{exclusive}} edition is <b>divided</b> {{into two}} <b>discs,</b> {{with the second}} disc beginning with [...] "Suite V Electric Overture".|$|R
5000|$|The album's two <b>discs</b> are <b>divided</b> thematically: <b>Disc</b> One {{contains}} shorter songs while Disc Two {{was intended}} to showcase the band's longer jamming capabilities. [...] "Little Shimmy in a Conga Line" [...] segues seamlessly into [...] "Pat and Dex," [...] resulting in 25 minutes of uninterrupted music.|$|R
40|$|Conjoined {{twins are}} very rare, unique {{anomalies}} of monozygotic twinning. They develop from an incompletely <b>divided</b> embryonic <b>disc</b> after {{formation of the}} disk and primitive amniotic sac. Ultrasonography has made prenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins possible. A case of conjoined twins of ischiopagus type at 15 weeks of gestation is presented...|$|R
50|$|This album {{brings a}} total of twenty songs <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs.</b> With songs like Crystal Dress, fragile in the wind, every man is a story, and blue.|$|R
50|$|On a <b>disc</b> <b>divided</b> {{vertically}} {{blue and}} scarlet with a 1/8 in yellow border, 3 in in diameter overall, two white eagles’ heads conjoined back to back, beaks yellow, eyes detailed black.|$|R
50|$|Torico {{is set on}} {{two major}} locations: Misty Town and the City of Moons. Correspondingly, the game is <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs.</b> Once the player {{finishes}} disc 1, disc 2 can be accessed and continues from there.|$|R
5000|$|In the iTunes Store version, {{the album}} was <b>divided</b> into 2 <b>discs</b> with 9 tracks each, with the song [...] "Alive" [...] on disc 1 and [...] "Move On" [...] on disc 2 (both songs are listed as track 9).|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Impulse {{released}} a second album culled {{from the same}} sessions, The Africa/Brass Sessions, Volume 2. Two additional outtakes appeared on another posthumous Coltrane compilation, Trane's Modes. On October 10, 1995, Impulse released the complete sessions on a two-disc set entitled The Complete Africa/Brass Sessions. Rather than placing the original album on one disc and the outtakes on the other, it <b>divides</b> the <b>disc</b> content by session, with the May 23 results on the first disc and those from June 7 on the second disc.|$|R
25|$|The {{album was}} the {{intended}} 23 tracks as originally planned, <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs</b> with a 44-page color booklet. Release {{of the album}} in other countries, including Canada, was delayed until November 21, 2006. After SpinART declared bankruptcy in 2007, Pretty Little Head was released by Sony.|$|R
50|$|Black on Blonde (stylized as BLack on BLonde) is {{the fifth}} studio album by Canadian rapper k-os, {{released}} January 23, 2013 on Crown Loyalist and EMI Records. A double album, BLack on BLonde is <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs,</b> one consisting of hip hop songs (BLack) and one consisting of rock songs (BLonde).|$|R
50|$|The barn-owls' main {{characteristic}} is the heart-shaped facial disc, formed by stiff feathers which serve to amplify and locate {{the source of}} sounds when hunting. Further adaptations in the wing feathers eliminate sound caused by flying, aiding both the hearing of the owl listening for hidden prey and keeping the prey unaware of the owl. Barn-owls overall are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although considerable variation is seen even amongst species. The bay-owls closely resemble the Tyto owls, but have a <b>divided</b> facial <b>disc,</b> ear tufts, and tend to be smaller.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} <b>divided</b> into 2 <b>discs.</b> One is the {{electronic}} {{version of the}} album, while the second disc presents eight of the songs as acoustic versions {{with the exception of}} [...] "Iman", which is mostly an electronic/ambient piece and features no acoustic instruments but includes Azam Ali's vocals. Many of the track titles were revealed on site of the band's label.|$|R
5000|$|Drivers {{are usually}} {{recognized}} by their sharp, beveled edge and {{have most of}} their mass concentrated on the outer rim of the disc rather than distributed equally throughout. They are designed to travel farther distances at greater speeds and are mostly used for tee-off and other long distance throws. Drivers are often divided into different categories. For example, Innova <b>Discs</b> <b>divides</b> their <b>discs</b> into Distance Drivers and Fairway Drivers, with a fairway driver being somewhere between a distance driver and a mid-range <b>disc.</b> Discraft <b>divides</b> their drivers into 3 categories: Long Drivers, Extra Long Drivers, and Maximum Distance Drivers. Because the physics of a disc require [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "flick", which means putting spin on the disc, new players generally find that throwing a distance driver accurately can be somewhat difficult and will require experience with golf disc response. This {{is why it is}} better for players to begin with fairway drivers, long drivers, or even mid-ranges, and incorporate maximum distance drivers as their strength and disc control increases. Most players that are starting off will be most likely throwing lighter discs. Another type of driver, used less frequently, is a roller. As the name indicates, it has an edge designed to roll rather than fly.|$|R
50|$|The {{album is}} {{composed}} by 23 {{songs in the}} CD format, <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs,</b> one for pop {{and the other one}} for rancheras. The DVD version contains 24 tracks and is divided also into two discs too, one of pop and the other of rancheras, the difference is a track called Son De La Negra that works as a break {{at the beginning of the}} second DVD.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Chilocoris pallidus n. sp. from Sulawesi and Ch. malickyi n. sp. from Thailand are {{described}} and {{compared with their}} allied species. Both new taxa represent the subgenus Statanus DISTANT characterised by pronotal <b>disc</b> <b>divided</b> into two lobes by distinct uninterrupted transverse impressed line behind calli. Ch. malickyi n. sp. is the fourth species of the genus known from Thailand, while Ch. pallidus n. sp. is the seventh species of the genus recorded from Sulawesi...|$|R
50|$|The OST has two discs, Disc RUE and Disc MINT, {{featuring}} all of {{the tracks}} played throughout the game. The tracks are <b>divided</b> between the <b>discs</b> according to which character they fit best. Much of the mellower music is contained on Rue's disc, with a fairly small selection of 'happy' tracks or battle tracks, while Mint's disc contains almost {{all of the}} more intrusive tracks, the happier tracks, and several battle themes.|$|R
50|$|The game also {{utilizes}} the Disk System's {{feature of}} being able to exchange game discs while the device is powered on. The game is <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs,</b> and the player must exchange disks while the Disk System is still powered on in order to activate the second disc (note: Disc 2 is not playable without the first). This format was also used in the game's sequel Yūyūki and the Famicom Tantei Club series.|$|R
30|$|We also {{investigated}} 3 different {{measures of}} disc signal intensity. These included (1) a raw disc signal intensity measure (2) a ratio adjusted for brightness of CSF (Battié et al. 1995; Videman et al. 1994) {{at the same}} level (ratio 1) and (3) a ratio adjusted for brightest level of CSF at any of the 5 spinal levels (ratio 2). Raw signal intensity was recorded for each disc area as defined above for measurement of disc height. All measurements of signal intensity were made using primary DICOM data, preserving the full dynamic range of the raw data. Ratio 1 was calculated by <b>dividing</b> the raw <b>disc</b> signal intensity for each vertebral level by the signal intensity of the CSF at the adjacent level. Ratio 2 was calculated by <b>dividing</b> the raw <b>disc</b> signal intensity by the signal intensity of the most intense CSF at any of the 5 spinal levels. A clean sample of CSF adjacent to vertebra levels was used as the intra-body reference standard, accept at stenotic levels where it was difficult to obtain a clean sample so the level of the vertebral body above was used.|$|R
50|$|Hollyhocks are annual, biennial, or {{perennial}} plants usually taking an erect, unbranched form. The herbage usually has a coating of star-shaped hairs. The leaf blades are often lobed or toothed, and are borne on long petioles. The flowers may be solitary or arranged in fascicles or racemes. The notched petals are usually over three centimeters wide {{and may be}} pink, white, purple, or yellow. The fruit is a schizocarp, a dry <b>disc</b> <b>divided</b> into over 15 sections that contain seeds.|$|R
50|$|The game's {{music is}} {{composed}} by Motoi Sakuraba of Star Ocean. It has two original soundtracks, Alicia and Silmeria. Each soundtrack is <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs</b> {{with a grand}} total of 70 songs from the game. Prior to the release, a special artifact box was released which included a copy of the game, ten musical tracks, a keychain, and a figurine. In 2012, characters Rufus and Alicia were added to the Square Enix card game Lord of Vermillion Re: 2.|$|R
5000|$|... 1, 2, 3 Soleils (1, 2, 3 Suns) is a live album {{performed}} by Algerian artists Rachid Taha, Khaled and Faudel, widely {{hailed as the}} three masters of raï music. The concert, a unique event, took place in 1998 in Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris, and the songs consisted {{of the most famous}} from all three artists plus a few Algerian classics. All 23 were <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs,</b> produced and arranged by Steve Hillage, released by Barclay in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Cushioning' of {{the joint}} is {{provided}} by two C-shaped pieces of cartilage called menisci which sit between the medial and lateral chondyles of the distal femur and the tibial plateau. The main biomechanical function of the menisci is probably to divide the joint into two functional units—the 'femoromeniscal joint' for flexion/extension movements and the 'meniscotibial joint' for rotation—a function analogous {{to that of the}} <b>disc</b> <b>dividing</b> the temporomandibular (jaw) joint. The menisci also contain nerve endings which are used to assist in proprioreception.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the FUTURA project {{is to improve the}} quality and safety of life of over 55 million EU citizens who live or work near train tracks, and prepare our ambitious, close to market technical solution – Divided, axle mounted Rail Freight Brake Disc (further referred to as DRFB disc) for commercialisation, as this is a world novelty in the field of braking systems in rail freight transport (further referred to as RFT). With its innovative solution, FUTURA project will considerably influence the following 3 key elements: 1) safety and security, 2) health and environment and 3) cost-effectiveness in the RFT.

The crest was a parson-crow, and the motto Non auro sed virtute. Together the crow (kraai) and the fountains (fonteine) were a pun on the name of the town.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} <b>divided</b> into three <b>discs,</b> with three {{different}} styles. Disc One - Morning is her soul, funk and R&B album, produced by Grammy-winning Warren Riker and Popović, and recorded at Esplanade Studios, New Orleans in Louisiana, Royal Studios and Music+Arts Studio, Memphis and The Switchyard, Nashville in Tennessee, and Full Sail Studio, Orlandoin Florida. Besides Popović's strong guitar work, Morning uses plenty of horns and piano, and features Joe Bonamassa as a guest guitarist on [...] "Train", ending the song with a smoking outro.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{chemical}} and dynamical structure in the solar neighbourhood of a model Galaxy that is the endpoint of a simulation of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way {{in the presence of}} radial mixing of stars and gas. Although the simulation's star formation rate declines monotonically from its unique peak and no merger or tidal event ever takes place, the model replicates all known properties of a thick disc, as well as matching special features of the local stellar population such as a metal-poor extension of the thin disc that has high rotational velocity. We <b>divide</b> the <b>disc</b> by chemistry and relate this dissection to observationally more convenient kinematic selection criteria. We conclude that the observed chemistry of the Galactic disc does not provide convincing evidence for a violent origin of the thick disc, as has been widely claimed. © 2009 RAS...|$|R
25|$|The unique {{feature of}} the {{temporomandibular}} joint is the articular disc. The disc is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue that is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The temporomandibular joints {{are one of the}} few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The <b>disc</b> <b>divides</b> each joint into two.These two compartments are synovial cavities, which consists of an upper and a lower synovial cavity. The synovial membrane lining the joint capsule produces the synovial fluid that fills these cavities.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} new flow control method for {{centrifugal}} microfluidic systems; CO 2 is released from on-board stored baking powder upon {{contact with an}} ancillary liquid. The elevated pressure generated drives the sample into a dead-end pneumatic chamber sealed by a dissolvable film (DF). This liquid incursion wets and dissolves the DF, thus opening the valve. The activation pressure of the DF valve can be tuned by the geometry of the channel upstream of the DF membrane. Through pneumatic coupling with properly dimensioned disc architecture, we established serial cascading of valves, even at a constant spin rate. Similarly, we demonstrate sequential actuation of valves by <b>dividing</b> the <b>disc</b> {{into a number of}} distinct pneumatic chambers (separated by DF membranes). Opening these DFs, typically through arrival of a liquid to that location on a disc, permits pressurization of these chambers. This barrier-based scheme provides robust and strictly ordered valve actuation, which is demonstrated by the automation of a multi-step/multi-reagent DNA-based hybridization assay...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{keeping a}} {{constant}} transfer {{rate for the}} whole disc is not so important in most contemporary CD uses, a pure CLV approach had to be abandoned to keep the rotational speed of the disc safely low while maximizing data rate. Some drives work in a partial CLV (PCLV) scheme, by switching from CLV to CAV only when a rotational limit is reached. But switching to CAV requires considerable changes in hardware design, so instead most drives use the zoned constant linear velocity (Z-CLV) scheme. This <b>divides</b> the <b>disc</b> into several zones, each having its own constant linear velocity. A Z-CLV recorder rated at [...] "52×", for example, would write at 20× on the innermost zone and then progressively increase the speed in several discrete steps up to 52× at the outer rim. Without higher rotational speeds, increased read performance may be attainable by simultaneously reading more than one point of a data groove, but drives with such mechanisms are more expensive, less compatible, and very uncommon.|$|R
5000|$|Zoned Constant Linear Velocity (ZCLV) is a {{modification}} of CLV for high speed CD and DVD recorders. Early model recorders were CLV drives. The recording speed on such drives was rated in multiples of 150 KiB/s; a 4X drive, for instance, would write steadily at around 600 KiB/s. The transfer rate was kept constant by having the spindle motor in the drive vary in speed and run about 2.5 times as fast when recording at the inner rim of the disc as on the outer rim. Some high-speed recorders use the zoned CLV method (ZCLV), which <b>divides</b> the <b>disc</b> into stepped zones, {{each of which has}} its own constant linear velocity. At higher speeds, ZCLV offers a compromise between CAV, which enables faster seek times, and CLV, which enables greater storage capacity. A ZCLV recorder rated at [...] "52X", for example, would write at 20X on the innermost zone and then progressively step up to 52X at the outer rim.|$|R
30|$|Brake discs are an {{important}} component found in almost all moving vehicles. Safety and reliability are crucial for braking systems. Several types of brake discs used in rail vehicles are mainly divided into two groups: axle-mounted brake discs and wheel-mounted brake discs. There are also other designs, like separate brake disc axles and end-axle-mounted brake discs. Brake discs are usually made from grey cast iron, nodular cast iron or steel, depending on the loads to which they will be subjected. The use of brake discs prevents {{the surface of the}} rolling wheel itself from braking and thus increases the lifespan of and reduces stress on the wheels. <b>Divided</b> brake <b>discs</b> were developed to facilitate replacement of the brake discs, making the process less time consuming and less expensive, as it eliminates the need to disassemble the entire axle assembly. Disassembly of the axle can cause other problems as well, since all of the parts, like the wheels and bearings, are press fit onto the axle, and disassembly risks damaging them.|$|R

50|$|The genus Tyto {{includes}} all barn owls (family Tytonidae) {{except for the}} bay owls (subfamily Phodilinae, genus Phodilus) - that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. Tyto owls have a <b>divided,</b> heart-shaped facial <b>disc,</b> and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. Tyto owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls.

500|$|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was {{intended}} as a two-record set. The CD and cassette versions of the album are <b>divided</b> into two <b>discs,</b> entitled Dawn to Dusk and Twilight to Starlight. The vinyl version, however, is divided into three records with six sides, entitled Dawn/Tea Time, Dusk/Twilight, and Midnight/Starlight. The vinyl release also features two bonus songs ("Tonite Reprise" [...] and [...] "Infinite Sadness"), and a completely rearranged track order. In 2012 the album was remastered and re-released as a 6 disc edition, with 3 bonus discs of music and a DVD and also on 4 Vinyl LPs which contained the regular CD track order instead of the original LP order.|$|R
