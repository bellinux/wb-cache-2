However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E

2500|$|In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of {{the value}} of Darwin's theory. Only a few years later, Popper wrote, [...] "I have in the past {{described}} the theory as 'almost tautological' ... <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} make a recantation." [...] His conclusion, later in the article is [...] "The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{read the}} letter over several times. Making due {{allowance}} for Mr. Micawber's lofty style of composition, and for the extraordinary relish with which {{he sat down and}} wrote long letters on all possible and impossible occasions, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> something important lay hidden at the bottom of this roundabout communication. I put it down, to think about it; and took it up again, to read it once more; and was still pursuing it, when Traddles found me in the height of my perplexity.|$|R
2500|$|After further {{discussion}} and study, he briefly adopted a new date—April 18, 1844—one {{based on the}} Karaite Jewish calendar (as opposed to the Rabbinic calendar). Like the previous date, April 18 passed without Christ's return. In the Advent Herald of April 24, Joshua Himes wrote that all the [...] "expected and published time" [...] had passed and admitted {{that they had been}} [...] "mistaken in the precise time of the termination of the prophetic period". [...] Josiah Litch surmised that the Adventists were probably [...] "only in error relative to the event which marked its close". Miller published a letter [...] "To Second Advent Believers," [...] writing, [...] "I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the day of the Lord is near, even at the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|While no {{specific}} date {{is given in}} official belief statements, many Adventists hold October 22, 1844 as the starting date for the investigative judgment. Originally Miller set {{the end of the}} 2300 days between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844. In mid-1844, Miller stated [...] "I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment: Yet <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the day of the Lord is near." [...] In February, 1844, Samuel S. Snow began preaching the end of the 2300 days to be in the Fall of 1844. He soon settled on October 22. In an August camp meeting, October 22 took hold of the Adventists in New England. Miller {{was one of the last}} to accept the date. W. W. Prescott suggested that the investigative judgment occurred in the spring, and not autumn, but his view was rejected.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the urging}} of his supporters, Miller never {{personally}} set an exact date for the expected Second Advent. [...] However, in response to their urgings, he did narrow the time-period to sometime in the Jewish year beginning in the Gregorian year 1843, stating: [...] "My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844." [...] March 21, 1844, passed without incident, and further discussion and study resulted in the brief adoption of a new date (April 18, 1844) based on the Karaite Jewish calendar (as opposed to the Rabbinic calendar). Like the previous date, April 18 passed without Christ's return. Miller responded publicly, writing, [...] "I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the day of the}} Lord is near, even at the door." ...|$|E

60|$|On the 23d of October I {{learned of}} Pemberton's being in command at Holly Springs and much {{reinforced}} by conscripts and troops from Alabama and Texas. The same day General Rosecrans was relieved from duty with my command, {{and shortly after}} he succeeded Buell in the command of the army in Middle Tennessee. I was delighted at the promotion of General Rosecrans to a separate command, because <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> when independent of an immediate superior the qualities which I, at that time, credited him with possessing, would show themselves. As a subordinate I found that I could not make him do as I wished, and had determined to relieve him from duty that very day.|$|R
60|$|In {{accordance}} with my plan {{to become a}} teacher, I determined {{to go to the}} bottom of the laws which govern literary development, and so with an unexpurgated volume of Taine, a set of Chambers' Encyclopædia of English Literature, and a volume of Greene's History of the English People, I set to work to base myself profoundly in the principles which govern a nation's self-expression. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> in order to properly teach an appreciation of poetry, a man should have the power of dramatic expression, that he should be able to read so as to make the printed page live in the ears of his pupils. In short I had decided to unite the orator and the critic.|$|R

It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you. And if you were a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that.</b> But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright blip on the radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it. For some years there, it had not been legalized. I look on the national scene and think, 'Wow, of all things to be fighting over and battling over.' Especially when it comes to medical marijuana, I think, 'Hmm. It's just not my baby.'" ...|$|E

60|$|At {{that time}} it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged it {{improbable}} that it contained any living creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite of Ogilvy, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> there were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations.|$|R

60|$|We had a jubilant {{fortnight}} {{in working}} {{the particulars of}} these things out. It was not possible for Clemens to write like anybody else, but I could very easily write like Clemens, and we took the play scene and scene about, quite secure of coming out in temperamental agreement. The characters remained {{for the most part}} his, and I varied them only to make them more like his than, if possible, he could. Several years after, when I looked over a copy of the play, I could not always tell my work from his; I only knew that I had done certain scenes. We would work all day long at our several tasks, and then at night, before dinner, read them over to each other. No dramatists ever got greater joy out of their creations, and when I reflect that the public never had the chance of sharing our joy I pity the public from a full heart. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the play was immensely funny; <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> if it could once have got behind the footlights it would have continued to pack the house before them for an indefinite succession of nights.
