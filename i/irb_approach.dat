Methods: We analyzed the content of IRB policies posted on their websites regarding recruitment payments and role conflicts for 121 U. S. medical schools that receive NIH research funding. Results: The majority of IRB websites discuss conflicts of interest during recruitment, but less than one-half discuss both types of recruitment payments and role conflict. There is considerable variation in <b>IRB</b> <b>approaches</b> to these conflicts. IRBs commonly ban recruitment payments, but few IRBs restrict recruitment when role conflicts exist.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between banks’ approval for the internal ratings-based (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approaches</b> of Basel II and the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets. Analysing a panel of 115 banks from 21 OECD countries that were eventually approved for applying the IRB to their credit portfolio, we find that risk-weight density becomes lower once regulatory approval is granted. The effect persists when we control for asset structure, and we provide evidence showing that this phenomenon cannot be explained by modelling choices, or improved risk-measurement alone. Consistent with theories of risk-weight manipulation, we find the decline in risk-weights to be particularly pronounced among weakly capitalised banks, where the legal framework for supervision is weak, and in countries where supervisors are overseeing many IRB banks. We conclude that part of the decline in reported riskiness under the IRB results from banks’ strategic risk-modelling. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cyclical e¤ects of bank capital requirements {{in a simple}} macro model with credit market frictions. A bank capital channel is introduced through a monitoring incentive effect of bank capital buffers on the repayment probability and hence the loan rate. We also identify a collateral channel, which mitigates moral hazard behaviour by firms, and therefore raises their repayment probability. Basel I and Basel II regulatory regimes are then defined, with a distinction made between the Standardized and Foundation Internal Ratings Based (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approaches</b> of Basel II. We analyze {{the role of the}} bank capital and collateral channels in the transmission of supply shocks, and show that depending on the strength of these channels, the loan rate can either amplify or mitigate the e¤ects of the shock. Finally, the relative impact of the two channels also determines which of the regulatory regimes is most procyclical. ...|$|R

It turned out that portfolio invariance of the ASRF model is a property with strong influence on its application on credit portfolio models. The ASRF models are derived from ordinary credit portfolio models by the law of large numbers and known to be portfolio invariant. When a portfolio consists {{of a large number}} of relatively small exposures, idiosyncratic risks associated with individual exposures tend to cancel out one-another and only systematic risks that affect many exposures have a material effect on portfolio losses. In the ASRF model, all systematic risks, which affect all borrowers to a certain degree, are modeled with only one systematic risk factor. In this paper, we describe the modeling framework of the ASRF model and carry out an implementation of the ASRF model by means of a standard programming tool, namely the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, for measuring the portfolio credit risk of a sample portfolio...|$|R

3000|$|The {{probability}} of default (PD) and the recovery rate [1 − loss given default (LGD)] are the key parameters for risk-adjusted pricing of loans {{in the context of}} Basel II. The recovery rate relates the proceeds and costs from realization to the outstanding amount at the time of default [exposure at default (EAD)]. For internal risk management purposes, the recovery rate, the PD, the EAD, and their correlations are included in the calculation of expected and unexpected losses of the credit portfolio, and thereby influence the calculation of the value at risk (VaR) as well as (future) credit terms. Therefore, a bank’s internal risk management has to develop a model that allows an accurate estimate of the recovery rate. A precise estimate, on one hand, can generate a competitive advantage and, on the other, can reduce problems arising from adverse selection due to small differences in loan spreads (e.g., Gürtler and Hibbeln 2013). Moreover, banks that prove to have appropriate internal models for predicting the recovery rate are allowed to use advanced internal rating based (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approaches.</b> These approaches can result in reduced capital requirements. Hence, a detailed estimate of the recovery rate is beneficial from a regulatory perspective as well. 1 [...]...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of complex}} and {{sophisticated}} financial instruments, such as derivatives, {{in the modern}} financial environment, has triggered {{the emergence of new}} forms of risks. As well as the need to manage such types of risks, this paper investigates developments which have instigated the Basel Committee in developing advanced risk management techniques such as the Internal Ratings Based (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approaches</b> and the Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA). Developments since the inception of the 1988 Basel Capital Accord have not only led to growing realisation that new forms of risks have emerged, but that previously existing and managed forms require further redress. Basel II has evolved to a form of meta regulation – a type of regulation which involves the risk management of internal risk within firms. This paper attempts to illustrate {{the extent to which the}} Basel II Capital Accord has responded to global and financial developments and concludes on the basis of available research evidence, that given the difficulties attributed to the constantly evolving nature of risk and the need for regulators to remain one step ahead, that Basel II, to an extent, has been responsive in meeting with regulatory demands. However, the existence of unregulated instruments such as hedge funds still implies that, despite its advancements and achievements, the Basel Committee still faces uphill challenges in its efforts to address and regulate risks. ...|$|R
