5|$|Fincher's {{first choice}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo, who {{objected to the}} film's sexual content. The filmmakers {{considered}} Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher objected that she was too young <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role.</b> He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, Peirce {{had envisioned}} a young Jodie Foster. The role was also offered to Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Polley.

Sevigny had auditioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of Brandon, but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana because she could not picture Sevigny as a man.|$|E

5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role.</b> However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role.</b> Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
5|$|Marina Sirtis auditioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of Macha Hernandez, while Denise Crosby {{auditioned for}} the part of Deanna Troi.

Macha Hernandez was re-written to become Tasha Yar to better suit Crosby.|$|E

5|$|After Sorkin's {{completion}} of the script in January 2014, development on the project began to heat up when David Fincher entered negotiations to direct the film, with Fincher selecting Christian Bale as his choice for Jobs. However, in April 2014, Fincher exited the project due to contractual disputes. Danny Boyle was then hired to direct, with Leonardo DiCaprio in discussions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role.</b> In October, DiCaprio exited, with Bale, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Bradley Cooper being considered. Sorkin revealed {{in an interview that}} month that Bale was once again cast in the role, with Seth Rogen entering negotiations to play Wozniak, and Jessica Chastain being considered for a part. Ike Barinholtz revealed he had auditioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of Wozniak. In November, Bale again left the project, with Michael Fassbender emerging as a frontrunner to replace him, and Scarlett Johansson reportedly being offered a role before Sony put the project in turnaround and Universal Pictures acquired it.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> of Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought {{that not only was}} she more suitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>role,</b> but that it was best to keep Olivier and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. Olivier followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E
