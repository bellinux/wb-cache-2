25|$|The artwork of {{the stone}} {{is in line with}} many of the other Ingvar runestones, but it is debated whether they were made by the same runemaster or not.

25|$|The runemaster's name is {{partially}} superficially carved {{and the last}} rune has disappeared, but it was probably Alrikr.

25|$|Several {{countries}} have established their national churches, linking the ecclesiastical structure with the state.

25|$|The {{moratorium}} on commercial whaling led Iceland to withdraw in protest from IWC, {{as it had}} threatened to do if the moratorium was extended. Both Japan and Norway also threatened to leave the organisation. In April 1992, the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) was established by the Faroe Islands, Greenland, <b>Iceland,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Norway</b> under the Agreement on Cooperation in Research, Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals in the North Atlantic. The document clearly responded to what the drafters regarded as inappropriate whale protectionist tendencies of the IWC. Guðmundur Eiríksson of Iceland stated at NAMMCO's inaugural meeting that the organisation was established in part out of dissatisfaction with the IWC's zero-catch quota. Although NAMMCO does not conflict directly with the obligations of membership states under the IWC, it nonetheless presented {{a challenge to the}} legitimacy of the IWC.|$|E
25|$|Greenland {{was always}} colder in winter than <b>Iceland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Norway,</b> and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion {{of the soil}} was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland {{settlements}} may not have recognized {{until it was too}} late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation. A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food. But they never learned to use the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.|$|E

Several place names in Iceland, Greenland and Norway may originate from walrus sites: Hvalfjord, Hvallatrar and Hvalsnes to name some, all being typical walrus breeding grounds.|$|E
