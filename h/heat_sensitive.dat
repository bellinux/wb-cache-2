25|$|Thermal nociceptors are {{activated}} by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. There are specific nociceptor transducers {{that are responsible}} for how and if the specific nerve ending responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was TRPV1, and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 42°C. Other temperature in the warm–hot range is mediated by more than one TRP channel. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm–hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the pain threshold are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by TRPM8 channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the <b>heat</b> <b>sensitive</b> TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.|$|E

2500|$|The {{eyelash viper}} is a {{relatively}} small species of pitviper, with adults ranging from [...] long, and females being longer and more variable in size than males, which can grow to [...] long.

Like all pit vipers, it is solenoglyphous, having large, hypodermic needle-like fangs {{in the front of}} the upper jaw that fold back when not in use, and has <b>heat</b> <b>sensitive</b> organs, or pits, located on either side of the head between the eye and nostril.|$|E
2500|$|Eukaryotic {{proteins}} {{that are no}} longer needed or are misfolded or otherwise damaged are usually marked for destruction by the polyubiquitation pathway. [...] These ubiquitinated proteins are recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Hence the 26S proteasome {{is an integral part}} of the cell's mechanism to degrade proteins. [...] Furthermore, a constant supply of functional Hsp90 is needed to maintain the tertiary structure of the proteasome. Finally experiments done with <b>heat</b> <b>sensitive</b> Hsp90 mutants and the 26S proteasome suggest that Hsp90 is responsible for most, if not all, of the ATPase activity of the proteasome.|$|E

40|$|Background: Though the Nuclear factor 1 {{family member}} NFIX has been {{strongly}} implicated in PDGFB-induced glioblastoma, its molecular mechanisms of action remain unknown. HSF 1, a heat shock-related transcription factor {{is also a}} powerful modifier of carcinogenesis by several factors, including PDGFB. How HSF 1 transcription is controlled has remained largely elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings: By combining microarray expression profiling and a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we identified that NFIX and its interactions with CGGBP 1 and HMGN 1 regulate expression of HSF 1. We found that CGGBP 1 organizes a bifunctional transcriptional complex at small CGG repeats in the HSF 1 promoter. Under chronic heat shock, NFIX uses CGGBP 1 and HMGN 1 to get recruited to this promoter and in turn affects their binding to DNA. Results show that the interactions of NFIX with CGGBP 1 and HMGN 1 in the soluble fraction are <b>heat</b> shock <b>sensitive</b> due to preferential localization of CGGBP 1 to heterochromatin after heat shock. HSF 1 in turn was found to bind to the NFIX promoter and repress its expression in a <b>heat</b> shock <b>sensitive</b> manner. Conclusions/Significance: NFIX and HSF 1 exert a mutual transcriptional repressive effect on each other which requires CGG repeat in HSF 1 promoter and HSF 1 binding site in NFIX promoter. We unravel a unique mechanism of <b>heat</b> shock <b>sensitive</b> DNA sequence-directed reciprocal transcriptional regulation between NFIX and HSF 1. Our findings provide new insights into mechanisms of transcription regulation under stress...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this talk}} I {{presented}} and discussed our unexpected de-tection of water vapor in the disk-averaged {{spectrum of the}} K 2 IIIp red giant Arcturus [for details, see Ryde et al. (2002) ]. Arcturus, or Bootes is, with its eective temperature of 4300 K, the hottest star yet to show water vapor features. We argue that the water vapor is photospheric and that its detection provides us with {{new insights into the}} outer parts of the photosphere. We are not able to model the vater vapor with a standard, one-component, 1 D, radiative-equilibrium, LTE model photo-sphere, which probably means we are lacking essential physics in such models. However, we are able to model several OH lines of dierent exci-tation and the water-vapor lines satisfactorily after lowering the tempera-ture structure of the very outer parts of the photosphere at log 500 = 3 : 8 and beyond compared to a ux-constant, hydrostatic, standard marcs model photosphere.
