5|$|Militarily, {{although}} {{the battle was}} actually not decisive {{in the context of}} the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting.

5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used {{as an example of the}} advantages of training, equipment, and <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.|$|E

5|$|Chase was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. He was chosen to lead {{the assault on the}} Admiralty Islands in February 1944. He resisted the temptation to swiftly overrun the island, and thereby overextend his forces, and formed a defensive perimeter that made <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of the terrain. From this position, he was able to defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison.|$|E
5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't make <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, Lyon {{initially}} {{served under}} Horatio Gates in upstate New York and Vermont. In {{a version of}} the event later circulated by his political opponents, he was cashiered for cowardice and ordered to carry a wooden sword to represent his shame. In Lyon's version, he and his men were assigned to guard wheat growing in the fields near Jericho, Vermont; unhappy at not being put to <b>good</b> <b>use,</b> he asked to leave Gates' command and join the regiment commanded by Seth Warner. Lyon's conduct was vindicated by both Arthur St. Clair and James Wilkinson.|$|E

They were immediately put to <b>good</b> <b>use</b> and eased {{the work of the}} already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be especially well suited for such tasks.

5|$|Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was {{developed}} using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 {{and is available}} for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It is the first Mortal Kombat title developed solely for seventh generation video game consoles. Most reviewers agreed that Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was entertaining and made <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of its DC Universe license, but the game's lack of unlockable features as opposed to past installments of Mortal Kombat and toned-down finishing moves garnered some criticism.|$|E
5|$|The Bank of New Zealand Building, 205 Princes St (cnr. Princes and High Sts) (Category I). Designed in Venetian Renaissance styling, the 1882 BNZ {{building}} stands {{just two}} doors along from the National Bank building. The William Armson-designed building is notable for the richly carved exterior work by Louis Godfrey and moulded ceilings in its interior. The façade combines Doric, Ionic and Corinthian styles, and makes <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of Port Chalmers bluestone and Oamaru stone, a compact, cream-coloured limestone.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E

5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to <b>good</b> <b>use.</b> Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E
5|$|As aforesaid, SVT {{wanted to}} make a <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of Malmo Arena's space to {{highlight}} the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd from both sides of it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a movable part beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Katrina {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and was heading towards Louisiana. For precaution, Six Flags closed down the New Orleans theme park during mid-season {{to prepare for}} the storm. Due to {{substantial}} flooding, many of the park's rides were damaged beyond repair causing the park to remain closed until the floods retrieved. Many of the park rides were destroyed as the park's drainage system failed and were submerged in water {{for a long period of}} time, long after the hurricane. Anything found in the park still in <b>good</b> <b>use</b> was removed and moved to other parks in the company as Six Flags had no plans on reopening the theme park. Batman: The Ride survived, mainly because of its elevated station and corrosion-resistant support structure, which caused it to make it through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting <b>good</b> <b>use</b> of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E
5|$|Operation Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project in aerial warfare, initiated in 1966 by the United States Air Force {{to increase the}} ability to accurately strike at night or in adverse weather. During the 1960s the United States military worked hard to interdict the movement of men and materiel along the Ho Chi Minh trail. The North Vietnamese were experts {{in the use of}} weather and darkness to conceal their movement, and understanding the superiority of American air power put their skills immediately to <b>good</b> <b>use.</b> US forces seeking to impede the steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during the day with poor results.|$|E
