40|$|This paper {{examines}} recent {{evidence on}} the role that <b>gasoline</b> margins <b>and</b> volatility play in the asymmetric response of gasoline prices to changes in oil prices {{at different stages of}} distribution process. In a regression model with margins, we find that margins are statistically significant in explaining asymmetry between crude oil <b>and</b> spot <b>gasoline</b> prices, spot <b>gasoline</b> prices <b>and</b> wholesale <b>gasoline</b> prices, <b>and</b> wholesale <b>gasoline</b> prices <b>and</b> retail prices. In a regression model with input volatility, we find evidence that volatility is responsible for asymmetry between wholesale <b>gasoline</b> prices <b>and</b> retail <b>gasoline</b> prices. When both, <b>gasoline</b> margins <b>and</b> <b>gasoline</b> volatility are included in the regression, we find evidence supporting margins, the search theory, volatility, the oligopolistic coordination theory and an explanation of asymmetry.

5|$|After a brief {{slowdown}} of {{the economy}} {{at the end of}} the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region's rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s, when the affordability of automobiles and the subsidized Interstate Highway System drew off passengers from the trains. The decline of the railroad industry, which went through considerable restructuring among freight lines as well, caused significant job losses. The city's population declined as workers left for other areas.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on <b>gasoline,</b> <b>and</b> an increased corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting {{food from the}} state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E

5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
