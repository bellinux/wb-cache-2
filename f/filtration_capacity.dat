40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary results {{of research on}} soil resilience to anthropopressure in Łosie village (Lower Beskids Mts). The considered risks included three features which reflect soil resilience: predicted soil loss caused by water erosion, mechanical and physico-chemical <b>filtration</b> <b>capacities.</b> The average annual rate of soil loss was calculated based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Analyses of mechanical and physico-chemical <b>filtration</b> <b>capacities</b> of soils were conducted {{on the basis of}} algorithms which took into account the soil texture class and groundwater table class. The results confirmed that the highest predicted soil loss takes place within arable lands, particularly those located on slopes - with up and down tillage. During the period from 1997 to 2009, predicted soil loss decreased by 57 % due to the decline in the percentage of arable land in the research area. It was found that the introduction of cross-slope tillage within arable lands could decrease overall predicted soil loss up to 67 %. Areas with the lowest mechanical <b>filtration</b> <b>capacities</b> were located on slopes and related to sandy clay soils whereas the areas with the lowest physico-chemical <b>filtration</b> <b>capacities</b> were situated in valley bottoms and are mainly due to the shallow level of the groundwater table. Finally, it was noted that the different types of analyzed risk do not overlap nor even do they correspond with each other, which is conditioned by different features of the environment that were taken into consideration. The obtained results have shown how important sustainable spatial planning evaluation of various types of environmental resilience is...|$|R

40|$|The process {{streams in}} the wood-based biorefineries contain a propitious source of novel {{renewable}} raw material, such as hemicellulose and lignin. The utilization of UF membranes has been drawn considerable {{interest in the}} isolation of hemicellulose from the other dissolved wood components before any further uses. However, membrane filtration processes have been mostly restricted to limited <b>filtration</b> <b>capacities</b> and severe fouling caused by aromatic compounds, such as lignin and extractives. Hence, from an economic point of view, the preparation of competent membranes which can minimize the fouling and life-time shortening of the membranes during filtration are highly demanded. In this study, vanillin as antifouling agent has been utilized in surface modification of commercial ultrafiltration membrane (UH 004 P) and in preparation of a novel polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane to improve the performance of membrane. The parameters involved in surface modification of UH 004 P membrane (e. g. vanillin concentration) and in preparation of PES membrane (e. g. vanillin and water content, and coagulation bath temperature) were investigated. In general, the PEG solution permeability of modified commercial membranes improved as the degree of vanillin adsorption {{on the surface of}} the membrane increased while PEG rejection remained almost the same. In addition, better antifouling characteristics of modified membrane compared to virgin UH 004 P membrane has been observed; approximately 12 % lower water flux reduction.

50|$|Along with {{obtaining a}} {{complete}} medical history, {{a series of}} biochemical tests are {{required in order to}} arrive at an accurate diagnosis that verifies the presence of the illness. In addition, imaging of the kidneys (for structure and presence of two kidneys) is sometimes carried out, and/or a biopsy of the kidneys. The first test will be a urinalysis to test for high levels of proteins, as a healthy subject excretes an insignificant amount of protein in their urine. The test will involve a 24-hour bedside urinary total protein estimation. The urine sample is tested for proteinuria (>3.5 g per 1.73 m2 per 24 hours). It is also examined for urinary casts, which are more a feature of active nephritis. Next a blood screen, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) will look for hypoalbuminemia: albumin levels of ≤2.5 g/dL (normal=3.5-5 g/dL). Then a Creatinine Clearance CCr test will evaluate renal function particularly the glomerular <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity.</b> Creatinine formation {{is a result of the}} breakdown of muscular tissue, it is transported in the blood and eliminated in urine. Measuring the concentration of organic compounds in both liquids evaluates the capacity of the glomeruli to filter blood. Electrolytes and urea levels may also be analysed at the same time as creatinine (EUC test) in order to evaluate renal function. A lipid profile will also be carried out as high levels of cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), specifically elevated LDL, usually with concomitantly elevated VLDL, is indicative of nephrotic syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Relatively {{few studies}} have {{examined}} recoveries from source waters by using Environmental Protection Agency method 1623 with organism spike doses that are environmentally realistic and at turbidity levels commonly found in surface waters. In this study, we evaluated the <b>filtration</b> <b>capacities</b> and recovery efficiencies of the Gelman Envirochek (standard filter) and the Gelman Envirochek high-volume (HV) sampling capsules under environmental conditions. We also examined the performance of method 1623 under ambient conditions with matrix spike experiments using 10 organisms/liter. Under turbid conditions, the HV capsule filtered approximately twice the volume filtered by the standard filter, but neither could filter 10 liters without clogging. In low-turbidity waters, oocyst, but not cyst, recoveries were significantly higher when the HV capsule was used. In turbid waters, organism recoveries were lower than those in nonturbid waters and were not significantly different for the different filters. When the HV capsule was used, Cryptosporidium recoveries ranged from 36 to 75 %, and Giardia recoveries ranged from 0. 5 to 53 %. For both organisms, recoveries varied significantly by site. Turbidity could explain variation in Giardia recoveries (r 2 = 0. 80) but not variation in Cryptosporidium recoveries (r 2 = 0. 16). The inconsistent recoveries across sites suggested that the background matrix of the ambient water affected recovery by method 1623. A control sample collected {{at the height of the}} winter rainy season detected one organism, highlighting the difficulty of using this method to accurately measure pathogen abundance under natural conditions. Our findings support the use of the HV filter under field conditions but suggest that designing a cost-effective and statistically valid monitoring program to evaluate sources and loads of protozoan pathogens may be difficult...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{assessed}} whether an internal dose of cadmium (Cd), as reflected by a Cd concentration in urine not yet sufficient to induce a significantly increased urinary excretion of various plasma proteins (microproteinuria defined as beta 2 -microglobulin in urine greater than 300 micrograms/g creatinine, or retinol-binding protein in urine greater than 300 micrograms/g creatinine, or albumin in urine greater than 15 mg/g creatinine, {{or a combination}} of these), may affect the <b>filtration</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> of the kidney. The last was determined by measuring the difference between the baseline creatinine clearance and the maximal creatinine clearance after an acute oral load of protein (400 g of cooked red meat). In total 215 men were examined of whom eventually 87 Cd exposed workers (concentration of Cd in urine greater than 2 micrograms/g creatinine) from zinc/cadmium smelters and 92 control workers (concentration of Cd in urine less than 2 micrograms/g creatinine, absence of microproteinuria, normal fasting serum creatinine) were retained for data analysis performed separately for workers aged less or more than 50 years. Microproteinuria was present in 20 Cd workers, all older than 50. This study confirmed the previous observation that the age related decline of the baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is accelerated in male workers with Cd induced microproteinuria; the same observation was made for the maximal GFR. It was found, however, that a renal Cd burden that had not yet caused microproteinuria did not impair the <b>filtration</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> of the kidney. This study therefore validates the previous estimate of the threshold effect concentration of Cd in urine (10 micrograms/g creatinine) that is intended to prevent the occurrence of microproteinuria in male Cd workers. It should be kept in mind, however, that because of the likely interference of the healthy worker effect, this conclusion may not be directly extrapolated to the general population...|$|R

40|$|Hemicelluloses are {{potential}} {{raw material for}} several items produced in future wood-based biorefineries. One possible method for recovering hemicelluloses from wood extracts is ultrafiltration (UF). However, low filtration capacities and severe fouling restrict the use of tight UF membranes {{in the treatment of}} wood extracts. The lack of suitable commercial membranes creates a need for pretreatment which would decrease fouling and increase the <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity.</b> This thesis focuses on the evaluation of the possibility to improve the <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity</b> and decrease fouling with the pretreatment of wood extracts. Methods which remove harmful compounds and methods which degrade them are studied, as well as combinations of the methods. The tested pretreatments have an influence on both the concentration of different compounds and the molecular mass distribution of the compounds in the extract. This study revealed that in addition to which kind of compounds were removed, also the change in molecular size distribution affected the <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity</b> significantly. It was shown that the most harmful compounds for the <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity</b> of the hydrophobic 5 kDa membrane were the ones capable of permeating the membrane and fouling also the inner membrane structure. Naturally, the size of the most harmful compounds depends on the used UF membrane and is thus case-specific. However, in the choice of the pretreatment method, the focus should be on the removal of harmful compound sizes rather than merely on the total amount of removed foulants. The results proved that <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity</b> can be increased with both adsorptive and oxidative pretreatments even by hundreds of per cents. For instance, the use of XAD 7 and XAD 16 adsorbents increased the average flux in the UF of a birch extract from nearly zero to 107 kg/(m 2 h) and 175 kg/(m 2 h), respectively. In the treatment of a spruce extract, oxidation by pulsed corona discharge (PCD) increased the flux in UF from 46 kg/(m 2 h) to 158 kg/(m 2 h). Moreover, when a birch extract batch was treated with laccase enzyme, the flux in UF increased from 15 kg/(m 2 h) to 36 kg/(m 2 h). However, fouling was decreased only by adsorptive pretreatment while oxidative methods had a negligible or even negative impact on it. This demonstrates that <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity</b> and fouling are affected by different compounds and mechanisms. The results of this thesis show that <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity</b> can be improved and fouling decreased through appropriate pretreatment. However, the choice of the best possible pretreatment is case-specific and depends on the wood extract and the membrane used. Finding the best option requires information on the extract content and membrane characteristics {{as well as on the}} filtration performance of the membrane in the prevailing conditions and a multivariate approach. On the basis of this study, it can be roughly concluded that adsorptive pretreatment improves the <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity</b> and decreases fouling rather reliably, but it may lead to significant hemicellulose losses. Oxidation reduces the loss of valuable hemicelluloses and could improve the <b>filtration</b> <b>capacity,</b> but fouling challenges may remain. Combining oxidation with adsorptive pretreatment was not a solution for avoiding hemicellulose losses in the tested cases...|$|E

This project caused hydrodynamic and water-quality changes; hence, phytoplankton-species composition changed and phytoplankton turnover increased, but primary production remained the same.
