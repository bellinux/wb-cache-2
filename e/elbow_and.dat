The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2015, Nathan {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list due to a strained right elbow. During a rehab start with the Toledo Mud Hens on April 22, Nathan re-injured his elbow after throwing only 10 pitches. The same night, Nathan underwent MRIs, which tested positive revealing tears in his ulnar collateral ligament of the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> his pronator teres muscle, and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending Nathan's 2015 season. Sources projected that this surgery could end Nathan's career, but he was not planning to retire yet.|$|E

5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E

5|$|From 2004 to 2009, Nathan was {{considered}} one of the top closers in Major League Baseball (MLB) with four All-Star appearances and a league-leading 246 saves. In 2010, Nathan underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> missed the entire season. On April 3, 2011, Nathan recorded his first save since his injury against the Toronto Blue Jays and later that year in July, Nathan regained the role as closer. On August 10, 2011, he became the Twins all-time leader in saves with his 255th in a game against the Boston Red Sox. After the 2011 season, Nathan left the Twins via free agency to sign with the Texas Rangers, becoming an All-Star again in 2012 and 2013. On April 8, 2013, he earned his 300th save. After the 2013 season, Nathan left the Rangers via free agency to sign with the Detroit Tigers. Nathan is currently eighth on the all-time saves list.|$|E
5|$|Jamal {{was taken}} {{at first to}} the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E
5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} apron, the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth jumped on the ring apron and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take drastic measures to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually tore off her skirt and threw it into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> Hogan's legdrop -- before taking the pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Forty-eight {{young adult}} males were ranked {{on the basis}} of mean {{hand-grip}} strength scores and the middle one-third, the medium strength range, were chosen as subjects. These sixteen subjects were given 30 serial trials in each of four tests; knee flexion, knee extension, <b>elbow</b> flexion, <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> extension. Each trial consisted of a contraction period of three seconds followed by an intertrial rest interval of 10 seconds. Factorial analysis of variance of reciprocal strength decrement index scores suggested that: a) a significant difference existed between responses of 1) knee <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> extensor muscle groups, 2) knee extensors <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors 3) flexors and extensors of the knee and 4) flexors and extensors of the elbow; b) no significant difference existed between responses of 1) knee <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> flexors, <b>and</b> 2) knee flexors <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> extensors, <b>and</b> c) when considered by trial intervals, no significant difference existed between responses of 1) knee flexors and extensors, <b>and</b> 2) <b>elbow</b> flexors <b>and</b> extensors...|$|R

5|$|The oldest known tetrapodomorph is Kenichthys from China, dated {{at around}} 395 million years old. Two of the {{earliest}} tetrapodomorphs, dating from 380 Ma, were Gogonasus and Panderichthys. They had choanae and used their fins to move through tidal channels and shallow waters choked with dead branches and rotting plants. Their fins {{could have been used}} to attach themselves to plants or similar while they were lying in ambush for prey. The universal tetrapod characteristics of front limbs that bend forward from the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> hind limbs that bend backward from the knee can plausibly be traced to early tetrapods living in shallow water. Pelvic bone fossils from Tiktaalik shows, if representative for early tetrapods in general, that hind appendages and pelvic-propelled locomotion originated in water before terrestrial adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} festivities {{were called}} off after {{an assassination attempt}} on the Huguenot leader Admiral Coligny, who was shot from a house by an arquebusier on 22 August and wounded in the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> hand. The day before, the king and his brothers had dressed as Amazons to fight Navarre and his friends, who wore turbans and golden robes {{in the role of}} Turks. Fighting broke out for real between the Catholics and Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, which began on 24 August when Charles IX ordered the slaughter of all the Huguenot leaders in Paris, provoking massacres of Huguenots throughout France. Henry of Navarre was given the choice of death, life imprisonment, or conversion to Catholicism. He chose Catholicism and was spared.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
