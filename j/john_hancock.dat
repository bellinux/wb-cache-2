5|$|Hancock was {{originally}} titled Tonight, He Comes and later changed to <b>John</b> <b>Hancock</b> {{before settling on}} its final title. Prior to the film's release, marketing consultants attempted to persuade Sony Pictures to again change the title Hancock {{because it was too}} vague for audiences, suggesting alternatives like Heroes Never Die, Unlikely Hero, and Less Than Hero. Despite the advice, Sony stayed with Hancock and anticipated marketing on the popularity of the film's star, Will Smith.|$|E

As a result, he is routinely jeered at crime scenes. Hancock also ignores court subpoenas to address the damage he has caused.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock {{enrolled}} in Harvard College and received a bachelor's degree in 1754. Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the French and Indian War (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. <b>John</b> <b>Hancock</b> learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed {{playing the role of}} a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.|$|E
