We examined the effects of soil texture on (i) estimated rates of root and soil respiration and (ii) soil CO 2 concentrations, during cycles of soil wetting and drying in the citrus rootstock, Volkamer lemon (Citrus volkameriana Tan. and Pasq.). Plants were grown in soil columns filled with three different soil mixtures varying in their sand, silt and clay content. Root and soil respiration rates, soil water content, plant water uptake and soil CO 2 concentrations were measured and dynamic relationships among these variables were developed for each soil texture treatment. We found that although the different soil textures differed in their plant-soil water relations characteristics, plant growth was only slightly affected. Root and soil respiration rates were similar under most soil moisture conditions for soils varying widely in percentages of sand, silt and clay. Only following irrigation did CO 2 efflux from the soil surface vary among soils. That is, efflux of CO 2 from the soil surface was much more restricted after watering (therefore rendering any respiration measurements inaccurate) in <b>finer</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils</b> than in sandy soils because of reduced porosity in the <b>finer</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils.</b> Accordingly, CO 2 reached and maintained the highest concentrations in <b>finer</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils</b> (> 40 mmol CO 2 mol(- 1)).

40|$|A {{process has}} been {{developed}} for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated, fine textured; solid wastes so that the treated material will meet EPA's TCLP and Total Extractable Metal Limits. The process involves the formation of strong aggregates using dry agglomeration methods. Remediation is achieved either by incorporating metal fixation agents into the agglomerates, or by leaching of heavy metal and other soluble salts by percolation through a packed bed of agglomerated soil. The handling problems encountered during solid liquid separations in conventional soil washing are overcome by agglomerating the fine textured solids. The newly developed process {{was applied to the}} remediation of a <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil</b> sample from a Dupont site contaminated with lead and a sediment from the Coeur d'Alene river, contaminated with Pb, Cd, and Zn.

This study was conducted in a greenhouse at Vli-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan. Treatments were arranged in a factorial manner as a completely randomized design with three replications. Treatments were three levels of Caco 3 (0, 20 and 40 g/ 100 g soil), gypsum at three levels (0, 15 and 30 g/ 100 g soil) and two soil textures (Sand and Silt clay loam). Results indicate that irrespective of soil texture, Caco 3 application significantly decreased leaf area (by 80 % and 15 % for sand and silty clay loam texture, respectively), dry weight (by 80 % and 15 % respectively), plant height (regressed on Caco 3 percentage by slopes - 0. 7 and - 0. 15 for sand and silty clay loam respectively), and shoot Fe (- 9. 67 and - 11. 3) and Zn (- 0. 24 and - 1) uptake, but had no significant effect on shoot Cu uptake.

The results indicated that after a threshold period which was longer for the lower rate of water application, the cumulative evaporation (E) increased with the decrease in irrigation interval and the type of soil amendments added in the order of control, peatmoss, and the absorbent copolymer.

In accordance with previous findings, E was found to be a linear function of the square root of time (i. e., E = c/t 0. 5), where c under the experimental conditions was largely determined by the amount of water applied per irrigation and the type of soil amendment added. Salt and soil water distributions were governed by the amount of water conserved. Within the profile, peatmoss was significantly effective in leaching salts. The quantity of water applied at a time, rather than the cumulative amount, seemed to affect water conservation; whereas the cumulative amount of water applied during the span of study significantly affected EC and SAR re-distributions.

In south Uruguay, frequent tillage and {{little or no}} inputs of organic matter have resulted in soil degradation that threatens soil productivity and systems sustainability. This study aimed to quantify the impact of tillage, crop residue management, and organic matter incorporation on runoff, soil erosion, water dynamics, and productivity of a raised bed tomato-oat rotation system. A field trial {{was set up in}} 2010 and replicated in 2011 in a temperate climate on a <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil</b> including four soil management practices: reduced tillage with a cover crop left as mulch and chicken manure incorporation (RT), conventional tillage with a cover crop used as green manure and chicken manure incorporation (CGM), conventional tillage with chicken manure incorporation (CChM), and conventional tillage system as control (CT). RT decreased soil erosion and runoff by more than 50 % compared with the three conventional tillage systems. We proposed a non-linear model to estimate the reduction in runoff due to stubble as a function of rainfall, with locally adjusted parameters. Yields under CChM were the largest both years, and more than 50 % greater than under RT. Causes of low yields under RT are most likely poor crop establishment under the organic cover in combination with N immobilization. Compared with CChM water use efficiency under RT was reduced by 43 % during the first season, and by 35 % under both RT and CGM during the second season. In a dry season, RT increased soil water capture by 20 % (45 mm) compared with conventional tillage treatments. This is of special interest in these systems as it may result in a larger cultivated area of irrigation-dependent crops on a farm, thus building resilience to climate change.

40|$|Extensive {{applications}} of persistent organochlorine pesticides like endosulfan on cotton {{have led to}} the contamination of soil and water environments at several sites in Pakistan, Microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove such toxicants from the environment. Several strains of Bacteria and fungi were isolated from endosulfan contaminated soil. A total of 29 bacterial and 16 fungal strains were tested for their endosulfan degradation potential. The strains differed substantially in their potential to degrade endosulfan in vitro which ranged from 40 to 93 % of the spiked amount (100 mg 1 - 1) Biodegradation of endosulfan by these microorganisms also resulted in substantial decrease in pH of the brother from 8. 2 to 3. 2 within 14 days of incubation. High performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that endosulfan diol and endosulfan ether were among the products of endosulfan metabolism by these microbial strains while endosulfan sulfate. A persistent and toxic metabolite of endosulfan was not detected in any case. The three strains of each of bacteria (Chaetosartorya stromaloides, Aspergillus terricola and Aspergillus terreus) were the most efficient degraders of both a-and B-endosulfan as they consumed more than 90 % of the spiked amount (100 mg 1 - 1) in the broth within 14 days of incubation. The results showed that endosulfan degradation by P. aeruginosa was most effectively achieved at an initial inoculum size of 600 (OD= 0. 86). incubation temperature of 30 C in shaken slurries at p 11 8 in loam soil. Biodegradation of endosulfan varied in different textured soils being more rapid in course textured soils than in <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil.</b> Exogenous application of organic acids (citric acid and acetic acid) and amino acids (L-methionine and L-cystein) had stimulatory and inhibitory effects respectively on biodegradation of endosulfan.

It was observed that at initial endosulfan concentrations of 50 to 150 mg 1 - 1 Mond with growth model was well fitted into the data. The results of these studies may imply that these bacterial/fungal strains could be employed for bioremediation of endosulfan polluted soil and water environment...|$|E
40|$|Predicting N {{release in}} {{agricultural}} soils amended with organic residuals {{is essential to}} ensure there are sufficient nutrients for crops, and minimal losses to the environment. Factors such as moisture, temperature, soil type and organic residuals type may affect the amount of mineralised nutrients. Information is required to describe microbial N immobilisation in biosolids-amended soil, which may vary between soil types influencing extent and rate of nutrient release. Industrial biowastes are increasingly being used as soil amendments as a diversion from landfill disposal; these materials result from a diverse range of processes and vary greatly in physical and chemical characteristics. There is little published or advisory information regarding their agronomic benefit, therefore research is required to quantify their fertiliser value. The aims of this research were to quantify mineralisation of N, and investigate other agronomic benefits of biosolids and biowastes, and to investigate microbial biomass N (MBN) dynamics, {{with the aim of}} improving fertiliser guidelines. A field trial was established at the Imperial College field station in Wye, Kent, in spring 2005, to investigate N transformations in contrasting soil types amended with conventional and enhanced treated biosolids. Analysis of MBN in biosolids-amended soil indicated that there were differences in N immobilisation processes in soils of differing fertility status, with greater immobilisation observed in the lower fertility soil in some cases. Despite initial differences in rate of mineralisation and nitrification, overall extent of N release was similar in both soils. A programme of field trials was established at Imperial College Silwood Park campus in 2006 - 2007 to quantify the agronomic value of a range of industrial biowastes. Biowastes from the vegetable, meat and dairy industries and from aerobic and anaerobic digestion plants were investigated. Yield response and N offtake of perennial ryegrass to biowastes, at five rates of application, in comparison to mineral N fertiliser, was used to calculate the replacement N fertiliser value. The results of a laboratory incubation experiment, to investigate MBN and mineral N in biowastes-amended soil, demonstrated lower recoveries of N in <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil</b> with low stability waste. Denitrification was suspected as the potential mechanism for this observation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have tested the {{feasibility}} of the inverse modeling approach to derive root water uptake parameters (RWUP) from soil water content data using numerical experiments for three differently <b>textured</b> <b>soils</b> and for an optimal drying period. The RWUP of interest are the rooting depth and the bottom root length density. In a first step, a thorough sensitivity analysis was performed. This showed that soil water content dynamics is relatively insensitive to RWUP and that the sensitivity depends on {{the texture of the}} considered <b>soil.</b> For medium-fine <b>textured</b> <b>soil,</b> the sensitivity is particularly low due to relatively high unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values. These ones allow a “compensating effect” to occur, i. e., vertical unsaturated water fluxes overshadowing in some way the root water uptake. In a second step, we analyzed the well-posedness of the solution (stability and nonuniqueness) when only RWUP are optimized. For this case, the inverse problem is clearly ill-posed except for the estimation of the rooting depth parameter for coarse and the very <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils.</b> In a third step, we addressed the case where RWUP are estimated simultaneously with additional parameters of the system (i. e., with soil hydraulic parameters). For this case, our study showed that the inverse problem is well-posed for the coarse and very <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils,</b> allowing for the estimation of both RWUP of interest provided that a powerful global optimization algorithm is used. On the contrary, the estimation of RWUP is unfeasible for medium-fine <b>textured</b> <b>soil</b> due to the “compensating effect” of the vertical unsaturated water flows. In conclusion, we can state that the inverse modeling approach can be applied to derive RWUP for some soils (coarse and very <b>fine</b> <b>textured)</b> and that the feasibility is strongly improved if the RWUP are simultaneously optimized with additional parameters. Nevertheless, more detailed research is needed to apply the inverse modeling approach to real cases for which additional issues are likely to be encountered such as soil heterogeneity and root dynamics...|$|R

The following fractions were analyzed in parallel REFERENCE (mostly virgin soils under Propospis caldenia bush) and CULTIVATED soils (since more than 50 years) : total organic matter (TOM), the wet-sieving obtained < 100 m humified organic matter (HOM), and 100 to 2, 000 m young organic matter (YOM), {{as well as the}} floatable organic matter (FOM), and the E 4 /E 6 quotient. The proportion amongst organic matter fractions were similar in REFERENCE and CULTIVATED soils (YOM 56 %, HOM 39 %, and FOM 5 %), though the absolute contents of these fractions were mostly higher in REFERENCE than in CULTIVATED soils in all studied sites. Simple and multiple regression analysis demonstrated that TOM, HOM, and YOM were positively correlated with silt+clay but not with temperature or precipitation in both soil managed types. Slopes and y o values of TOM-clay+silt regressions of REFERENCE soils (y = 0. 02 + 0. 08 x) were higher than of CULTIVATED ones (y = 0. 0037 + 0. 04 x), indicating that absolute potential TOM losses of <b>finer</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils</b> can be higher (equivalent to 35 Mg C ha) than of coarse soils (equivalent to 11 Mg C ha).

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is a {{more common}} problem {{now than it was}} 15 years ago, regardless of the tillage system used. Producers now use heavier tractors, larger implements, bigger combines, earlier spring tillage, reduced tillage, and no-till planting systems. While all of these have a potential to increase compaction, the major cause of the problem is conducting field operations when the soil is too wet. Most think about tilling wet soils in the spring as being the major problem, but harvesting a too-wet field in the fall can cause just as much compaction. Large combines and auger wagons can have loads exceeding 20 tons per axle. Continuous no-till has also created concerns regarding soil compaction and potential yield decreases. A study in Minnesota that compared no-till and other tillage systems used for 10 years on a clay loam soil showed the greatest soil density for the no-tilled soil. A study in Illinois indicated more compaction with no-till and other reduced tillage systems than with moldboard plow or chisel systems. Generally speaking, no-till is undesirable on a <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil</b> which has poor internal drainage or on a soil that has marginal tilth at the outset. On top of the soils themselves, the residue cover with no-till conserves moisture and slows soil drying, which can further complicate the problems of compaction when no-till is used on poorly drained soils. Soils with good structure, high organic matter, and good internal drainage are less likely to have compaction problems. Also, in low-rainfall areas, such as the Great Plains, compaction is less likely to be a problem than it is in areas of more moisture. The biggest single cause of compaction is the degree of wetness in a field when work is performed in or on that field. Defining compaction Compaction can be defined as the moving of soil particles closer together by external forces exerted by humans, animals, equipment, and/or the impact of water droplets. Packing the soil particles together results in the loss of pore space within the soil. This, in turn, leads to poorer internal drainage and aeration. Under many soil conditions compaction leads to slower water infiltration, which results in greater runoff and soil loss from both rainfall and irrigation. Compaction effects on the crop include reduced plant growth, especially root development, decreased crop yield, and delayed maturity...|$|E

In this study the authors investigated the hypothesis that the decline in the amount of C in clay and silt particles from coarse to <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil</b> is due to a reduction of the specific surface area of clay and silt fractions in clay soils. The relation between the mineralization rates of C and N to the degree of C saturation in the clay and silt particles was also investigated.

All soils were ultrasonically treated and gravimetrically separated into fractions > 50 µm (sand) and < 50 µm (clay and silt). All fractions and whole soils were analyzed for organic-C and the specific surface area with ethylene glycol monoethyl (EGME). Moreover, there was a close relation between the degree of C saturation and the mineralization rates. However, there also was a good relation between the total organic C of the soil and the mineralization rates. This coincided with the fact that a good relation between the soil organic carbon and the degree of carbon saturation was found. Our results partially explain the hypothesis that the mineralization rates are more related to the degree of C saturation than to the soil texture (% clay and silt) and soil organic carbon...|$|E
40|$|Engineered {{barriers}} of two designs are being tested at the Engineered Barriers Test Facility (EBTF) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. This report describes the test facility, barrier designs, and instruments {{used to monitor}} the test plots. Wetting tests conducted on the test plots in FY- 97 are described and data collected from monitoring the test plots before, {{during and after the}} wetting tests are used to evaluate the performance of the covers during FY- 97 and FY- 98. Replicates of two engineered barrier designs were constructed in the EBTF cells. The first design comprises a thick, vegetated soil cover. The second design incorporates a capillary/biobarrier within the vegtated soil cover. The capillary barrier uses the textural break between an upper, <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil</b> and a lower, coarser-textured gravel layer to inhibit drainage under unsaturated conditions while increasing soil moisture storage in the root zone. Evaporation and transpiration by plants (although the test plots have not yet been vegetated) are used to recycle water stored in the soil back to the atmosphere. A geotextile fabric is used to maintain separation of the soil and gravel layers. A thick layer of cobbles beneath the gravel layer serves as a biobarrier to prevent intrusion of plant roots and burrowing animals into underlying waste (there is no waste in the test plots). Each test plot was instrumented with time domain reflectometry probes and neutron probe access tubes to measure moisture contents, tensiometers, heat dissipation sensors, and thermocouple psychrometers to measure matric potentials, thermocouples to measure soil temperature, and ion-exchange resin beads to monitor tracer movement. Each drainage sump is equipped with a tipping bucket instrument and pressure transducer to measure drainage. Precipitation is measured using a heated rain gauge located at the EBTF. Instrument calibration equation coefficients are presented, and data reduction techniques are described. The wetting tests were designed to stress the test plots to the maximum by forcing drainage to occur. Drainage generally occurred two to three days following the start of the wetting test. Drainage from the capillary/biobarrier test plots stopped sooner than drainage from the thick soil test plots. Similar results were observed in drainage data collected in FY- 98 following the spring thaw. Drainage from the capillary/biobarrier test plots following the winter of 1998 represents about one-third of the precipitation occurring during that period compared to two-thirds of the precipitation from the thick soil test plots. By limiting drainage, the capillary/biobarriers increased water storage in the upper portions of the test plots compared to the thick soil barriers. The data evaluated in this report come from an ongoing project. The aftereffects of the wetting tests continue to be monitored. Long-term monitoring under ambient conditions, the application of additional treatments to the test plots, and numerical modeling are planned for the future...|$|E
40|$|Continuous use of no-till {{planting}} {{systems may}} result in reduced yields, especially on <b>finer</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils</b> that tend to be poorly drained. Soil compaction and poor soil aeration {{have been identified as}} possible factors contributing to the lower yields. Research conducted to evaluate tillage rotations on these soils shows that periodic use of the moldboard plow can result in statistically higher yields as compared to continuous no till. However, use of chisel plow and disk tillage systems following three years of continuous no-till did not result in yield increases. A relationship between cone penetrometer index and yield indicates a trend toward lower yield with higher index values with continuous no-till having the highest index...|$|R

The topographic form and the soil characteristics of Cholistan is the best catchment area for rainwater harvesting.

40|$|This study {{generated}} {{new insight}} into the effect of bedrock grain sizes on pedogenesis under identical topographic and climatic environment. The physico-chemical and mineralogical properties of two adjacent Typic Dystrochrepts (USDA, 1999) respectively developed from <b>fine</b> and coarse <b>textured</b> granites were compared. This research study was performed in the Morvan Mountains (France). Analysis of the two underlying bedrocks revealed similar chemical and mineralogical properties, with the crystal grain size being the only parameter which differed. In these soils, bedrock played the {{key role in the}} particle size fraction distribution, the main factor controlling water retention in the soils. Weathering reactions of clay minerals were more marked in the <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> granite <b>soil.</b> In this soil, both clay mineral swelling and mica transformation into expansible phyllosilicates were greater compared to the coarse <b>textured</b> granite <b>soil.</b> In the clay fraction of the <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> granite <b>soil,</b> there were smaller amounts of low crystallised Fe and Al minerals, with higher carbon content in the topsoil, as compared to the coarse granite soil. The exchangeable cation analysis of the <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> granite <b>soil</b> revealed a higher proportion of base saturation and a smaller proportion of Altit than in coarse <b>textured</b> granite <b>soil</b> which could be explained by preferential leaching of Al cations. The decrease in exchangeable Al, the higher swelling of the smectitic layer and the smaller proportion of Fe and Al-oxy-hydroxides could be explained by the complexing acid conditions, which increased mineral weathering and Al leaching. The higher water retention increased the time of contact between minerals and the soil solution, and the higher carbon content in the topsoil could have enhanced the complexing acid conditions.

40|$|Chlorpyrifos an insecticide, is {{extensively}} used in Pakistan and contaminating {{the soil}} and water environments at several sites. Exploration of efficient chlorpyrifos-degrading bacteria to clean-up this toxicant is of immense importance. This study reports the isolation, screening and identification of highly efficient chlorpyrifos degrading bacterial strains from different soils and water samples collected from different sites of Pakistan. Out of total 50 isolated bacterial strains, 32 were tested for their biodegradation capability in a culture medium containing chlorpyrifos as carbon and energy source. The bacterial isolates showed a great variation (25 - 92 %) {{in their ability to}} degrade chlorpyrifos in broth condition. Out of these 32 strains, four bacterial strains (SWLC 2, SWLH 2, SGB 2 and SWLC 1) were the most promising in their growth and biodegradation activity and were identified and characterized by biochemical characteristics and 16 S rRNA sequence analyses. Three strains (SGB 2, SWLC 1 and SWLC 2) showed the greatest similarity to the members of Enterobacteriacea and one strain (SWLH 2) to Rhizobiacea families. These selected strains (Enterobacter sp. SWLC 1, Enterobacter sp. SGB 2, Agrobacterium sp. SWLH 2 and Enterobacter sp. SWLC 2) exhibited biodegradation potential between 81 to 92 % of the spiked amount of chlorpyrifos (100 mg l- 1) within 18 days of incubation in broth culture. Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos continued gradually throughout the incubation period (18 days) as examined by the HPLC - UV system. Abiotic degradation contributed only up to 15 % of the spiked amount. Maximum biodegradation by the four efficient bacterial strains was observed at an initial pH of 7 and an incubation temperature of 30 oC, under shaking conditions. Among these four strains, Enterobacter sp. SWLC 2 was found most efficient in biodegradation of chlorpyrifos and was selected for further studies. This strain was then optimized in broth as well as in soil slurry under different conditions. Enterobacter sp. SWLC 2 showed maximum biodegradation of chlorpyrifos at pH 7, 30 oC, under shaking conditions with inoculum size of 800 μl. Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by Enterobacter sp. SWLC 2 varied in different textured soils, being more rapid in course textured soils than in <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil.</b> Among these soils, loamy soil was selected for further studies in soil slurry experiments due to its medium textured nature as soils of Punjab are mostly loamy in texture. An initial inoculum size of 800 μl (OD= 0. 80), incubation temperature of 30 oC, under shaking, initial pH 7 of soil slurry of loam soil were found optimal conditions for maximum biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by Enterobacter sp. SWLC 2. Exogenous application of sugars, yeast extract, manitol, organic acids and amino acids had stimulator or inhibitory effects on biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by Enterobacter sp. SWLC 2. Among these, glucose, yeast extract, succinic acid and citric acid had stimulatory effects on biodegradation of chlorpyrifos. Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by Enterobacter sp. SWLC 2 was also checked at different initial concentrations of chlorpyrifos from 10 - 250 mg l- 1. Rate of biodegradation increased with increase in concentration of chlorpyrifos from 100 - 150 mg l- 1 and suggested first order rate kinetics. In all experiments, utilization of chlorpyrifos by the strains was accompanied by a parallel increase in optical densities of broth implying that removal of this pesticide from the growth medium was a growth linked biodegradation. These results highlighted the potential of this bacterium {{to be used in the}} detoxification strategies of chlorpyrifos contaminated water and soil environments...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture {{is a big}} {{consumer}} of fresh water in competition with other sectors of the society. Within the EU-project SAFIR new water-saving irrigation strategies were developed based on pot, semi-field and field experiments with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and processing tomatoes as model plants. From the pot and semi-field experiments an ABA production model was developed for potatoes to optimize the ABA signalling; this was obtained by modelling the optimal level of soil drying for ABA production before re-irrigation in a crop growth model. The field irrigation guidelines were developed under temperate (Denmark), Mediterranean (Greece, Italy) and continental (Serbia, China) climatic conditions during summer. The field investigations on processing tomatoes were undertaken only in the Po valley (North Italy) on <b>fine,</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soil.</b> The investigations from several studies showed that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation (DI) or partial root zone drying irrigation (PRD) induced hydraulic and chemical signals from the root system resulting in partial stomatal closure, an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency, and a slight reduction in top vegetative growth. Further PRD increased N-mineralization significantly beyond that from DI, causing a stay-green effect late in the growing season. In field potato and tomato experiments the water-saving irrigation strategies DI and PRD were able to save about 20 - 30 % of the water used in fully irrigated plants. PRD increased marketable yield in potatoes significantly by 15 % due to improved tuber size distribution. PRD increased antioxidant content significantly by approximately 10 % in both potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Under a high temperature regime, full irrigation (FI) should be undertaken, as was clear from field observations in tomatoes. For tomatoes full irrigation should be undertaken for cooling effects when the night/day average temperature > 26. 5 Â Â°C or when air temperature > 40 Â Â°C to avoid flower-dropping. The temperature threshold for potatoes is not clear. From three-year field drip irrigation experiments we found that under the establishment phase, both potatoes and tomatoes should be fully irrigated; however, during the later phases deficit irrigation might be applied as outlined below without causing significant yield reduction: - Potatoes o After the end of tuber initiation, DI or PRD is applied at 70 % of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50 % of FI. - Fresh tomatoes o From the moment the 1 st truce is developed, DI is applied at 85 - 80 % of FI for two weeks. In the middle period, DI or PRD is applied at 70 % of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50 % of FI. - Processing tomatoes o From transplanting to fruit setting at 4 th- 5 th cluster, the PRD and DI threshold for re-irrigation is when the plant-available soil water content (ASWC) equals 0. 7 (soil water potential, [Psi]soilÂ =Â - 90 Â kPa). During the late fruit development/ripening stage, 10 % of red fruits, the threshold for re-irrigation for DI is when ASWCÂ =Â  0. 5 ([Psi]soilÂ =Â - 185 Â kPa) and for PRD when ASWC (dry side) Â =Â  0. 4 ([Psi]soil, dry sideÂ =Â - 270 Â kPa). The findings during the SAFIR project might {{be used as a}} framework for implementing water-saving deficit irrigation under different local soil and climatic conditions.

50|$|The Oregon Giant {{earthworm}} is {{endemic to}} Oregon {{and has been}} found at 15 sites in the Willamette Valley and one additional site within the Oregon Coast Range. Like Oregon’s other indigenous worms, this species has a narrow range of tolerance for <b>soil</b> conditions, favoring <b>fine</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils</b> rich in clay. It appears to prefer well drained soils (fine-grained, clay to silt loams) that are near subsurface water, often where the water table is reachable but the soil is not waterlogged. This species is associated with deep, little-disturbed soils in moist mixed forest of Douglas firs, grand firs, and bigleaf maples and is also known from pure Douglas-fir woodlots and occasionally from oak-ash woods. It is apparently tolerant of the acidic soil found under coniferous forests.|$|R
40|$|Sowing of {{chickpea}} in the heavy-textured soils of north-west Bangladesh {{with minimum}} tillage technology aims {{to increase the}} timely planting of large areas during a relatively short sowing window before soil water deficit limits germination and emergence. However, the seedbed conditions into which chickpea is sown need to be better quantified, so that limiting factors which affect germination and emergence can be identified. Two of the soil physical characteristics of importance are soil water and aeration. Growth cabinet studies have identified the fastest germination and emergence of chickpea on representative soils for this area at gravimetric water contents of 17 - 18 %, whilst soil water contents above and below this delayed germination and emergence. Emergence was recorded at soil water potentials between field capacity (- 10 kPa) and wilting point (- 1500 kPa).

40|$|Comparative plant water {{relations}} and {{soil moisture content}} of three geomorphic surfaces were assessed in a northern Mojave Desert mixed shrub community. The adjacent geomorphic surfaces studied were an ephemeral wash (Wash), a dissected alluvial fan remnant (Bench), and a montane slope (Slope). Perennial vegetation transpired for 2 - 6 months during a typical precipitation year. Plant water relations differed between species (on the same geomorphic surface) and between surfaces (for the same species). Plant water stress was greatest on the Bench, which had the <b>finest</b> <b>textured</b> <b>soils</b> and was underlaid by an indurated petrocalcic layer. Plants from the Wash and Slope sites had higher water potentials and stomatal conductances, presumably due to coarser <b>textured,</b> deeper <b>soils</b> in the Wash and water storage in fractured bedrock on the Slope.
