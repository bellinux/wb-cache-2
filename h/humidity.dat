5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative <b>humidity.</b> A high relative <b>humidity</b> indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative <b>humidity</b> is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative <b>humidity.</b> At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific <b>humidity</b> of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high <b>humidity.</b> Active snails were found only when {{relative}} <b>humidity</b> approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum <b>humidity</b> or saturation in the spray zone of the Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and <b>humidity</b> data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the <b>humidity</b> generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E

However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in <b>humidity,</b> especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). <b>Humidity</b> can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic humidifier in conjunction with a humidistat.|$|E

50|$|The term dry rot is {{somewhat}} misleading, as both species of fungi Serpula lacrymans and Meruliporia incrassata require an elevated moisture content to initiate {{an attack on}} timber (28-30%).

At relative <b>humidities</b> below 86 percent, growth of Serpula lacrymans is inhibited, but it can stay dormant at relative <b>humidities</b> down to 76 percent.

5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative <b>humidity</b> under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative <b>humidity</b> (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low <b>humidity</b> can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative <b>humidity</b> maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high <b>humidity</b> which {{prevents}} the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells.

5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as <b>humidity</b> decreases.

5|$|When {{grown in}} {{favorable}} conditions of high water availability and <b>humidity,</b> the fruit body can proliferate by growing additional (secondary) fruit bodies on {{all parts of}} its upper and lower surfaces. These secondary growths typically number between four and seven; some may be aborted as the nutrients from the pine cone substrate are depleted, resulting in stems lacking caps. In one instance, a complete secondary proliferation was noted (i.e., growing from a primary proliferation) that developed completely so as to produce viable spores. <b>Humidity</b> is a limiting factor for optimum fruit body development. Removal of incompletely mature laboratory-grown specimens from a relative <b>humidity</b> (R.H.) of over 98% to one of 65–75% causes the fruit bodies to brown and stop growing. When transferred to an even lower R.H. of about 50%, the stems quickly begin to collapse.

40|$|Advanced {{measurement}} and modelling techniques are employed {{to determine the}} partitioning of atmospheric water between the gas phase and the condensed phase in and around cirrus clouds, and thus to identify in-cloud and out-of-cloud supersaturations with respect to ice. In November 2008 the newly developed balloon-borne backscatter sonde COBALD (Compact Optical Backscatter and AerosoL Detector) was flown 14 times together with a CFH (Cryogenic Frost point Hygrometer) from Lindenberg, Germany (52 &deg; N, 14 &deg; E). The case discussed here in detail shows two cirrus layers with in-cloud relative <b>humidities</b> with respect to ice between 50 % and 130 %. Global operational analysis data of ECMWF (roughly 1 &deg; &times; 1 &deg; horizontal and 1 km vertical resolution, 6 -hourly stored fields) fail to represent ice water contents and relative <b>humidities.</b> Conversely, regional COSMO- 7 forecasts (6. 6 km &times; 6. 6 km, 5 -min stored fields) capture the measured <b>humidities</b> and cloud positions remarkably well. The main difference between ECMWF and COSMO data is the resolution of small-scale vertical features responsible for cirrus formation. Nevertheless, ice water contents in COSMO- 7 are still off by factors 2 – 10, likely reflecting limitations in COSMO's ice phase bulk scheme. Significant improvements {{can be achieved by}} comprehensive size-resolved microphysical and optical modelling along backward trajectories based on COSMO- 7 wind and temperature fields, which allow accurate computation of <b>humidities,</b> ice particle size distributions and backscatter ratios at the COBALD wavelengths.
