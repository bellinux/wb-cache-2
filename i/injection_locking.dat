50|$|<b>Injection</b> <b>locking</b> and {{injection}} pulling are {{the frequency}} effects {{that can occur}} when a harmonic oscillator is disturbed by a second oscillator operating at a nearby frequency. When the coupling is strong enough and the frequencies near enough, the second oscillator can capture the first oscillator, causing it to have essentially identical frequency as the second. This is <b>injection</b> <b>locking.</b> When the second oscillator merely disturbs the first but does not capture it, the effect is called injection pulling. <b>Injection</b> <b>locking</b> and pulling effects are observed in numerous types of physical systems, however the terms are most often associated with electronic oscillators or laser resonators.|$|E

50|$|In {{a modern-day}} voltage-controlled {{oscillator}} an injection-locking signal may override its low-frequency control voltage, resulting in loss of control. When intentionally employed, <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> {{provides a means}} to significantly reduce power consumption and possibly reduce phase noise in comparison to other frequency synthesizer and PLL design techniques. In similar fashion, the frequency output of large lasers can be purified by <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> them with high accuracy reference lasers (see injection seeder).|$|E

5000|$|RLGs, {{while more}} {{accurate}} than mechanical gyroscopes, suffer from an effect known as [...] "lock-in" [...] at very slow rotation rates. When the ring laser is hardly rotating, the frequencies of the counter-propagating laser modes become almost identical.

50|$|It {{operates}} {{similarly to}} an <b>injection</b> <b>locked</b> oscillator. In an <b>injection</b> <b>locked</b> frequency divider, {{the frequency of}} the input signal is a multiple (or fraction) of the free-running frequency of the oscillator. While these frequency dividers tend to be lower power than broadband static (or flip-flop based) frequency dividers, the drawback is their low locking range. The ILFD locking range is inversely proportional to the quality factor (Q) of the oscillator tank. In integrated circuit designs, this makes an ILFD sensitive to process variations. Care must be taken to ensure the tuning range of the driving circuit (for example, a voltage-controlled oscillator) must fall within the input locking range of the ILFD.|$|R

A frequency noise level of approximately 2 × 10 - 5 HzHz - 1 / 2 was measured for the master laser around this frequency using an independent, narrow line width, suspended analyzer cavity.

5000|$|Injection pulling and <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> can be {{observed}} in numerous physical systems where pairs of oscillators are coupled together. Perhaps the first to document these effects was Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock, who was surprised to note that two pendulum clocks which normally would keep slightly different time nonetheless became perfectly synchronized when hung from a common beam. Modern researchers have confirmed his suspicion that the pendulums were coupled by tiny back-and-forth vibrations in the wooden beam. [...] The two clocks became injection locked to a common frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Ring laser {{gyroscopes}} {{suffer from}} an effect known as [...] "lock-in" [...] at low rotation rates (less than 100°/h).

H 577 P EIE 2015 Ganxix, 155 pages :color illustrationsOptical <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> has {{numerous}} applications including {{direct modulation}} bandwidth enhancement, all-optical function device (such as the all-optical wavelength convertor, all-optical memory, time recovery devices, etc), all-optical network, {{wavelength division multiplexing}} passive optical network (WDM-PON) and microwave signal generation. These applications of optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> have attracted experimental and theoretical researches over forty years. These research mainly focused on single beam <b>injection</b> <b>locking.</b> Only few research have considered multi-beam optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking,</b> and these few research are almost all experimental studies. However, most applications of optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> are based on multi-beam optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking,</b> in which two or more light beams are injected into an Fabry-Perot laser diode. In this work, we focus on theoretical study of the multi-beam optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking.</b> Firstly, a self-consistent multimode rate equation model is derived and applied to the simulation of 10 Gb/s all-optical header processing and all-optical packet switching. Besides the simple rate equation model, the transmission line laser model packaged in the commercially available software produced by the VPITM is also used. Because of the short length of the Fabry-Perot cavity, the efficiency of simulation in the transmission line laser model is high. By using this transmission line laser model, we study the multi-beam optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> with bias current modulation of the Fabry-Perot laser diode {{which can be used}} for high frequency microwave signal generation. The main features in this new proposed method are studied in details, including criteria of the sideband <b>injection</b> <b>locking,</b> asymmetric sideband <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> ranges and effect of bias current modulation format on sidebands <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> ranges. With this proposed method, microwave signal with frequency N times the modulation frequency of the bias current of the Fabry-Perot laser diode can be generated, where N is the order of the modulated harmonic sidebands. Sideband <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> range, frequency tunable range of the generated RF signal, as well as maximum RF signal output power are also investigated. Multi-beam optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> from external injections is then studied, where these external injection lights come from different independent lasers. We study two beams optical <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> numerically. It is found that the behavior of the <b>injection</b> <b>locking</b> when two beams are injected into the same cavity mode of the Fabry-Perot laser diode {{is quite different from the}} case when the two external injection beams are injected into different cavity modes.
