They are also used to interrupt negligible currents such as capacitive currents associated with unload transmission lines...|$|R
40|$|Connectors and <b>Disconnectors</b> play a {{major role}} in the {{performance}} of extra high voltage (EHV) system. Failure due to the connectors and <b>disconnectors</b> leads to the shutdown of the whole system. Also this leads to heavy losses and inconvenience to the users. Hence the maintenance of the connectors and <b>disconnectors</b> is an important activity in the EHV system. Among the three types of maintenance such as Preventive maintenance, Predictive maintenance and Shutdown maintenance, Preventive maintenance improves reliability, reduces downtime and improves availability of plant and equipment. If we do not plan and perform the scheduled maintenance, it leads to forced outage due to fault or equipment failure. As far as EHV system is concerned, preventive maintenance plays a vital role, for which a thorough knowledge on the major parts of EHV components is mandatory. This article deals specifically with the EHV Power connectors and <b>disconnectors</b> in Major Power systems, right from design upto maintenance aspects. The modern trends using computers enable us to achieve better maintenance results...|$|R
500|$|Unlike {{most modern}} pump-action shotguns, the Winchester Model 1897 (versions {{of which were}} type {{classified}} as the Model 97 or M97 for short) fired each time the action closed with the trigger depressed (that is, it lacks a trigger <b>disconnector).</b> Coupled with its six-shot capacity, this made it effective for close combat, such that troops {{referred to it as}} a [...] "trench sweeper". This characteristic allowed troops to fire the whole magazine with great speed. The Model 1897 was so effective, and feared, that the German government protested (in vain) to have it outlawed in combat. The Model 1897 was used again in World War II by the United States Army and Marine Corps, where it was used alongside the similarly militarized version of the hammerless Model 1912.|$|E
500|$|The Winchester Model 1897 and the Winchester Model 1893 {{were both}} {{designed}} by John Browning. The Model 1897 is an external hammer shotgun lacking a trigger <b>disconnector.</b> This {{means that the}} user can hold the trigger down while cycling the shotgun and once the action is returned to battery the shotgun fires. The firearm itself is classified as a slide action pump shotgun. It was the first truly successful pump-action shotgun produced. Throughout the time period the Model 1897 was in production, over a million of the type were produced in various grades and barrel lengths. 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20inches, {{and as long as}} 36inches. Along with various grades and barrel lengths, the Model 1897 came in two different chamberings. One was the 12 gauge and the other was the 16 gauge. The shells should be of the [...] inch or [...] inch model. Any shells larger are not recommended. An average Model 1897 can hold 5 shotgun shells in the magazine tube. However, this could vary from grade to grade. When working the action of the Model 1897 the forend (fore grip) is pulled back, forcing the breech bolt to the rear which extracts and then ejects the spent shell while simultaneously cocking the external hammer by pushing it to the rear. When the forend is slid forward again, the breech bolt pushes a fresh shell into the gun's chamber and locks into place.|$|E
2500|$|The Stevens Model 520 was a pump-action shotgun {{developed}} by John Browning and originally manufactured by the J Stevens Arms & Tool Company between 1909 and 1916. [...] Stevens {{was sold to}} New England Westinghouse on 28 May 1915 and production of civilian firearms was greatly reduced. [...] The company was renamed the [...] "J Stevens Arms Company" [...] on 1 July 1916 and New England Westinghouse used their manufacturing facility in Chicopee Falls, MA to produce Mosin-Nagant rifles under contract for the Russian Czar during World War I. [...] After the war, Stevens was sold to Savage Arms on 1 April 1920 and full production of civilian firearms resumed. [...] Under Savage ownership, Model 520 production continued until 1939 when it {{was replaced by the}} Model 520A which ended production in 1948. [...] Stevens also further modified the design when they introduced the streamlined Model 620 in 1927. [...] The Model 620 was internally similar to the Model 520 and was [...] produced until 1939 when it was replaced by the Model 620A which ended production in 1955. [...] This [...] shotgun is a hammerless, pump action, take-down design with a tubular magazine which holds 5 shells. [...] All models can also be slam fired: the shotgun has no trigger <b>disconnector</b> and shells can be fired one after the other simply by working the slide if the trigger is held down.|$|E

5000|$|The sear on many {{firearms}} {{is often}} {{connected to a}} <b>disconnector,</b> which, after a cycle of semi-automatic fire has proceeded, keeps the hammer in place until the trigger is released and the sear takes over. Many firearms, such as the M1911 pistol, use a notch in the slide of the handgun that the top end of the <b>disconnector</b> returns to after the trigger is released. When the trigger is still under pressure by the firearm operator, the <b>disconnector</b> will not retract to its resting position. On other handguns, such as the Series 80 version of the M1911, a firing pin block acts as an internal safety, which is disengaged by the <b>disconnector</b> after the trigger is pulled. However, because of the spring tension placed on the <b>disconnector</b> by the firing pin block, {{the weight of the}} trigger pull is significantly increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{disconnecting}} {{circuit breaker}} (DCB) {{was introduced in}} 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate <b>disconnectors.</b> This increases the availability, since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, {{due to the lack of}} separate <b>disconnectors.</b>|$|R

40|$|High voltage dc {{networks}} are a promising technology to flexibly transmit power over long distances. However, dc grid protection {{is still a}} major challenge. DC fault clearance can be mainly achieved with three devices. These are ac circuit breakers (ACCBs), dc circuit breakers (DCCBs) and converters with fault current blocking (FB) capability. In spite of their great operational advantages, FB converters have attracted less attention than ACCBs or DCCBs in dc protection research. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates a protection strategy for a multi-terminal dc (MTDC) network equipped with FB converters and fast dc <b>disconnectors.</b> A novel minimum opening protection approach fully based on local data is proposed. Digital simulations are carried out using PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that only the two fast dc <b>disconnectors</b> placed in a faulty link operate following a dc fault.

50|$|In 2013, ABB {{launched}} a 420 kV Disconnecting Circuit Breaker (DCB) with integrated FOCS. Since one FOCS replaces many conventional current transformers, engineering {{and design of}} the substation is simplified.

5000|$|A trigger <b>disconnector</b> {{captures the}} hammer in the cocked {{position}} after a shot has been fired, {{even if the}} trigger is held to the rear as the gun cycles. This ensures the gun can only fire in the semi-automatic mode, as the trigger needs to be released to 'reset' and have the <b>disconnector</b> release the hammer back to the trigger sear. It also prevents out-of-battery [...] "slamfire" [...] malfunctions that occur when a hammer follows the bolt carrier group forward as it closes.|$|E
50|$|The vz.58 uses {{a trigger}} {{mechanism}} with a lever-type fire mode selector, {{which is also}} a manual safety against accidental discharge. When the selector lever is placed in its rear position ("1"—single fire) the sear is disabled and the left hammer catch is rotated by the <b>disconnector,</b> which is depressed by the bolt carrier after every shot and is therefore disconnected from the hammer catch. The forward setting of the selector lever ("30"—automatic fire) disables the <b>disconnector,</b> and the left hammer catch meshes with the sear mechanism. The center ("safe") setting with the selector lever pointing vertically downwards, mechanically lowers the trigger bar and the <b>disconnector</b> so there is no connection between the trigger and the semi-automatic sear which holds the hammer. The rifle also has an internal safety, which prevents the weapon from discharging when out of battery. The right linear hammer catch disables it, and it can only be released by pulling the charging handle back and cocking the weapon.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a <b>disconnector,</b> {{disconnect switch}} or isolator switch {{is used to}} ensure that an electrical circuit is completely de-energized for service or maintenance. Such switches are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as circuit breakers, transformers, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The <b>disconnector</b> is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Disconnectors can be operated either manually or automatically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disconnectors</b> have {{provisions}} for a lockout-tagout so that inadvertent operation is not possible. In high-voltage or complex systems, these locks {{may be part}} of a trapped-key interlock system to ensure proper sequence of operation. In some designs, the isolator switch has the additional ability to earth the isolated circuit thereby providing additional safety. Such an arrangement would apply to circuits which inter-connect power distribution systems where both ends of the circuit need to be isolated.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the unavailability for OKG {{will be affected}} by the planned replacement of the 400 kV substation at Simpevarp. The evaluation has been based on calculation of unavailability due to both faults and maintenance, fault and maintenance frequencies and estimated costs for the different substation designs. Four different variations of two-breaker arrangement designs have been simulated and been compared to simulations of the existing substation. To perform the calculations a program has been developed in java that simulates the different substation designs. The fault probabilities used in this study has primarily been taken from fault statistics for the Swedish grid but has also been compared to the assumptions used in other substation reliability studies. The results of this thesis show that the unavailability is likely to be higher for the proposed twobreaker arrangement design without separate <b>disconnectors</b> compared to the existing substation. When the two-breaker arrangement simulation instead included separate <b>disconnectors</b> the unavailability was found to be lower for the two-breaker arrangement design compared to the existing substation. The study also showed that the two-breaker arrangement designs had considerably lower fault frequencies compared to the existing substation. The thesis found that the unavailability that will be caused by maintenance can be significant and are likely to be higher than the unavailability caused by faults. The amount of unavailability caused by maintenance was, however, found to be uncertain because a large part of it can be performed during planned outage. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} two-breaker arrangement design with and without <b>disconnectors</b> had similar expected present value of costs if the maintenance costs were excluded. This indicates that the best substation option from an economic point of view is determined by the maintenance costs...|$|R

40|$|Circuit breakers, <b>disconnectors,</b> fuse <b>disconnectors</b> and fuse holders {{installed}} in LV electric panels sometimes suffer overheating, mainly due to inadequate dissipation {{of the heat}} generated. A theoretical and experimental investigation is attempted of the mechanisms that can affect heat transfer to a component-conductor system, as well the mass and the external surface area of the component. The resulting system of differential equations is solved using the Laplace transform in the s-plane. The time-dependent temperature distribution in the component-conductor system is provided by an analytical expression, and a simple formula is given for the component's stabilised temperature. Results from the models are compared with experimental measurements performed on a fuse holder and are shown to be consistent. The model accuracy is also investigated. It is convincingly shown that excessive (or additional) external surface area of the component's metallic parts reduces the component temperature. Above a certain level, this can make the component act as a cooler of the conductor. In addition, an increase of the component's mass slows temperature stabilisation. The proposed model could effectively support component design as it involves all the technical characteristics of the system, so that the requirements of international standards are fulfilled {{in relation to the}} prevention of overheating. © IEE, 2005...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{elongated}} {{shape of}} the city and the terrain conditions, the trolleybus network was planned along main streets. The network is powered with overhead lines because most of the network is located on wide, bi-directional streets. The overhead lines are supported with lateral suspension lines or extension arms. From 1998, the overhead lines began to be overhauled with modern suspension lines produced by the Czech company Elektroline. Almost 80% of overhead line intersections and junctions were replaced with new parts. These new parts allow trolleybuses to use greater speeds.
