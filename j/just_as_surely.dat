500|$|... "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg," [...] the Ramones 1985 single, pictured Reagan's {{controversial}} {{visit to}} a German military cemetery in Bitburg earlier that year. Critics in the U.S., Europe, and Israel decried the presidential visit because among the 2,000 German soldiers buried there were 49 members of the Waffen-SS who had committed genocidal atrocities. The phrase [...] "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" [...] was coined by protesters in {{the weeks leading up}} to Reagan's trip. Before the trip, Reagan ignited more controversy when he expressed his belief that the soldiers buried at Bitburg [...] "were victims, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> as the victims in the concentration camps." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was installed}} on October 31 and unveiled on November 1, 1994 {{in front of}} a national audience by Jordan, Reinsdorf and Larry King. [...] Jordan's jersey number was retired during the ceremony. Only Jordan's knee is attached to the base via a triple-steel post. [...] A stationary basketball hoop was almost part of the sculpture too. The sculpture, which is hollow, was designed to withstand the natural elements. After his second retirement following the 1997–98 NBA season, the following quote from the 1992 film A River Runs Through It was added to the base: [...] "At that moment I knew, surely and clearly, that I was witnessing perfection. He stood before us, suspended above the earth, free from all its laws like a work of art, and I knew, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> and clearly, that life is not a work of art, and that the moment could not last." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Beaumont, {{writing in}} The Observer, agrees that {{proponents of the}} concept of [...] "new antisemitism" [...] have {{attempted}} to co-opt anti-Jewish sentiment and attacks by some European Muslims as a way to silence opposition to the policies of the Israeli government. [...] "riticise Israel," [...] he writes, [...] "and you are an anti-Semite <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> as if you were throwing paint at a synagogue in Paris." ...|$|E

[...] If you love your violin, follow this advice and you will not regret it." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{decision}} {{having been}} come to {{not to speak}} of Irene's flight, no view was expressed by any other member of the family as to the right course to be pursued; there can be little doubt, from the general tone adopted in relation to events as they afterwards turned out, that James's advice: [...] "Don't you listen to her, follow her and get her back!" [...] would, with here and there an exception, have been regarded as sound, not only in Park Lane, but amongst the Nicholases, the Rogers, and at Timothy's. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> it would <b>surely</b> have been endorsed by that wider body of Forsytes all over London, who were merely excluded from judgment by ignorance of the story.|$|R
40|$|The Latin term consultatio (consultation) in the 16 th and 17 th centuries {{took the}} {{headlines}} primarily in specialized medical publications, {{and later in}} legal as well. It seems that this term then derivatively became popular in written public debate, or rather in the religious-political controversy. Formally as consultatio (often accompanied by attributes such as utilis, salubris, orthodoxa, catholica [...] .) were presented not only serious professional works, but very often pamphlets etc. However, if Comenius decided to launch its flagship life's work <b>just</b> <b>as</b> Consultatio, he <b>surely</b> <b>just</b> referred to the traditional genre, but - as in other titles of his works - {{he reached into his}} deep sense of the word and engaged it in the service of his plan. In addition, as we know, he had before his eyes a real consultation as well, the assembly or meeting of politicians, representatives of interreligious dialogue, etc...|$|R
2500|$|Prichard and Eisenhower {{exchanged}} correspondence {{during the}} war. [...] Shortly after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, Eisenhower {{wrote a letter}} to Prichard in which he confided [...] "this is a long tough road we have to travel." [...] In an oft-quoted passage, Eisenhower continued his comments to Prichard, noting that [...] "men that can do {{things are going to be}} sought out <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> as the sun rises in the morning," [...] and [...] "fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performances are going to be discovered." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{court found}} that [...] "oppose" [...] is not defined by the statute, so a normal {{definition}} of it may be used, per Perrin v. United States. [...] "Thus, a person can 'oppose' by responding to someone else’s questions <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> as by provoking the discussion," [...] further [...] "we would call it 'opposition' if an employee took a stand against an employer’s discriminatory practices not by 'instigating' action, but by standing pat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor’s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons." [...] The court supposes {{there could be a}} hypothetical case in which an employee describes a [...] "supervisor's racist joke as hilarious," [...] but finds that these [...] "will be eccentric cases, and this is not one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The State Supreme Court {{wrote that}} a scandalous {{publication}} [...] "annoys, injures and endangers the comfort and repose of {{a considerable number}} of persons," [...] and so constituted a nuisance <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> as [...] "places where intoxicating liquor is illegally sold," [...] "houses of prostitution," [...] "dogs," [...] "malicious fences" [...] "itinerant carnivals," [...] "lotteries," [...] and [...] "noxious weeds." [...] The court considered that a newspaper may also endanger safety, because [...] "scandalous material" [...] tended to disturb the peace and provoke assaults. The court cited previous Minnesota decisions that upheld the right of the state to enjoin the publication of [...] "details of execution of criminals" [...] and the teaching of [...] "things injurious to society." [...] Restricting the publication of a newspaper based on its harmful content accordingly fell within the legitimate power of [...] "the people speaking through their representatives" [...] to preserve [...] "public morals" [...] and the [...] "public welfare." [...] The court stated that it had to give heavy deference to such decisions, because [...] "it is the prerogative of the legislature to determine not only what the public interests require but also the measures necessary to protect such interests." ...|$|E
