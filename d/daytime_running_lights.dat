5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has <b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aims to {{determine}} the public perception of the act {{to turn on the}} motor lights during the day in Surabaya, because safety riding is still weighing the pros and contras. Mass media is one of the means to satisfy the human need for information. Media presents the activities or events that happen in people,s lives. Up between the two are inseparable and need each other. The news presented by the mass media is the result of selection of the various issues in society. Not all events or events that occur in the human life displayed by the mass media. Perception is an activity sensing, integrating and pass judgment on physical objects and social objects, and the sensory stimulus depends on the physical and social stimuli in the environment. Sensations from the environment will be processed along with the things that have been studied previously, either it be the expectations, values, attitudes, memories and others (Young, 1956 : 78). This type of research is a qualitative study, using a descriptive study by collecting data through in-depth interviews. Informants in this study were aged over 17 years, using the motor, through an intersection of Mayangkara, based in Surabaya and has a different profession, who understand the problems occurred as regards content and research can provide the data needed by researchers. In the interview involved four people: one person police ranked Ipda, the secretary of the secretariat of Department Transportation of Joyoboyo Surabaya branch, one of the employees of the government authorities in the city of Surabaya, and one student. The results showed that three (informant one, two, and four) of the four informants agreed regulatory motor lights in the daytime / safety riding (<b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> <b>light)</b> is because the rules are very beneficial to motorists and {{to reduce the number of}} road accidents, in addition to the third informant stated his opinion on the rules engine lights on during the day / safety riding (<b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> <b>light)</b> do not agree because the regulation only useless and not fit if the reason is only to minimize road accidents. Broadly speaking, be concluded that the regulation motors turn on the lights during the day is very beneicial because with the lights motorcycle rider then can help other motorists to be more cautious and thus the number of accidents on the road will be reduced.

40|$|Abstract. The {{ability for}} {{motorcycle}} to be detected {{is an important}} aspect in preventing crash involving motorcycle {{which is the most}} dominant vehicle in emerging countries. Widely referred as conspicuity, the crash factor is appropriately addressed by the introduction of mandatory <b>daytime</b> <b>running</b> <b>light</b> (DRL) law and is usually a success story {{in many parts of the}} world. In 2011, there was a motion introduced in the 64 thsession of the United Nations Working Party on Lighting and Light-Signalling (GRE) for amber position lamp (APL) to be made mandatory on motorcycle as additional measure to improve motorcycle conspicuity. An experiment was designed to evaluate conspicuity level of motorcycle headlamp and tail lamp equipped with APL over motorcycle with present DRL setting (baseline). 15 participants simultaneously rated both motorcycles which are placed in parallel, at different distances and times of day. Motorcycle with APL was noticeably better detected from rear than front at 50 meter and 100 meter distance, as well as during night time and twilight. Median conspicuity level between night time and daytime and between night time and twilight was also distinctly different for rear lamp. These findings suggest that APL introduction could enhance motorcycle conspicuity especially for rear lamp position...|$|R
