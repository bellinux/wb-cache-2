Hundreds of different herbal teas are sold in health food stores. Available as pure or blended samples, herbal teas are popular because of their fragrance, antioxidant properties and therapeutic applications (Naithani et al. 2006). Chrysanthemum indicum L. has a long history for the treatment of inflammation, hypertension and respiratory diseases in China (Cheng et al. 2005). Flowers of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat are used as a Chinese natural medicine. <b>Florists</b> <b>Chrysanthemum</b> Flower (Ju Hua) is prescribed for anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic purposes (Duh 1999). Hibiscus sabdariffa Linn. flowers are potentially a good source of antioxidant agents as anthocyanins (Ali et al. 2003). The roots of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine which showed to possess antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects (Lee et al. 2005). Recent studies indicated that the extracts of Paeonia lactiflora Pall. flowers were also rich of polyphenols (Shu et al. 2014). The flowers of Paeonia suffruticosa Andr. are used in Chinese folk medicines for the treatment of diseases related mainly to irregular menstruation and dysmenorrhea (Huang 1994). Flowers and buds of Lonicera japonica Thumb., commonly known as Jinyinhua in traditional Chinese medicines, has been used for the treatment of affection by exopathogenic wind-heat or epidemic febrile disease at the early stage, sores, carbuncles, furuncles and swellings for centuries (Peng et al. 2005). Osmanthus fragrans (Oleaceae), also known as sweet olive, is a flower native to China, which is valued as an additive for tea and other beverages (Lee et al. 2007). Dried petals of Rosa rugosa Thunb. have been widely used as main material in preparation of rose teas in China, which was believed to provide nourishment and favor human health (Vinokur et al. 2006). Tea from Camellia sinensis, used as positive control in the test, is the most widely consumed beverage in the world, and it is an important dietary source of natural phenolic antioxidants (Lachman et al. 2003).|$|E
50|$|The genus once {{included}} more species, but was split several decades ago into several genera, putting the economically important <b>florist's</b> <b>chrysanthemums</b> in the genus Dendranthema. The naming {{of the genera}} has been contentious, but a ruling of the International Botanical Congress in 1999 changed the defining species of the genus to Chrysanthemum indicum, restoring the <b>florist's</b> <b>chrysanthemums</b> to the genus Chrysanthemum.|$|R
50|$|Glebionis segetum was {{formerly}} {{treated in the}} genus Chrysanthemum, but under a 1999 decision of the International Botanical Congress, that genus has been redefined with a different circumscription to include the economically important <b>florist's</b> <b>chrysanthemum</b> (now Chrysanthemum indicum).|$|R

50|$|Glebionis {{is a small}} genus of {{flowering}} plants in the family Asteraceae, native to Europe and the Mediterranean region. The species were formerly treated in the genus Chrysanthemum, but a 1999 ruling of the International Botanical Congress has resulted in that genus being redefined to cover the species related to the economically important <b>florist's</b> <b>chrysanthemum,</b> thereby excluding the species now included in Glebionis.|$|R

40|$|<b>Florist’s</b> <b>chrysanthemum</b> (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) {{belongs to}} the Asteraceae family and {{represents}} {{the second most important}} floricultural crop in the world. Unfortunately most genotypes are sensitive to aphids. Internode explants of 1581 and 4043 genotypes were incubated with A. tumefaciens strain AGL- 0 containing pBIN plasmid with the npt gene as a selectable marker for kanamycin resistance and gcs gene as an aphicidal gene with rbcS promoter. Kanamycin resistant shoots were induced from internodes after 3 weeks. Finally, the shoots were rooted on MS medium containing 30 mg L- 1 kanamycin. Incorporation and expression of the transgenes were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR analysis. Genotype 4043 has been transformed in this study for the first time. Transformation frequency for GCS was 6. 25 and 5 % for genotypes 1581 and 4043, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Background:With the {{objective}} of combining multiple resistant traits from wild relative species in <b>florist’s</b> <b>chrysanthemums,</b> trigeneric hybridization was conducted by crossing two intergeneric F 1 hybrids Chrysanthemum grandiflorum 6 Artemisia vulgaris and Chrysanthemum crassum 6 Crossostephium chinense. Methodology/Principal Findings: To assess post-pollination phenomena, we investigated pollen germination on the stigma and embryo development, using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy and paraffin-embedded sections, respectively. We selected eight putative trigeneric hybrid lines that showed the greatest morphological differences from the parents from among the progeny derived via embryo rescue. The hybridity of one trigeneric hybrid was further confirmed by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization; in addition, the aphid resistance and salt tolerance of this hybrid were {{higher than those of}} the chrysanthemum parent and the C. grandiflorum 6 A. vulgaris F 1 hybrid, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: The enhanced aphid resistance of the hybrid line reflects the inheritance of chromosomes from A. vulgaris, which carries genes that encode bioactive components. The enhanced salt tolerance of the trigeneric hybrid is attributable to inheritance of genetic materials from Chrysanthemum crassum and Crossostephium chinense, which act to maintain the compartmentation of Na+ and K+ ions and their selective transportation among different organs to avert deleterious effects and protect the photosynthetic apparatus. The results indicate that trigeneric hybridization betwee...|$|R
40|$|<b>Florist's</b> <b>chrysanthemum</b> (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) {{belongs to}} the Asteraceae family and {{represents}} {{the second most important}} floricultural crop in the world. Most genotypes are sensitive to aphids and infestations can lower quality and cause transmission of viruses. The protease inhibitor Sea Anemone Equistatin (SAE) carries three domains responsible for the inhibition of both cysteine and aspartic proteases. Artificial diet bioassays showed that SAE is readily toxic when ingested by the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii. We transformed chrysanthemum genotype 1581 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation with the SAE gene {{under the control of the}} chrysanthemum RbcS promoter to induce aphid resistance. Non-choice leaf disk and whole plant bioassays were carried out to analyze deleterious effects of SAE on population growth and survival of both Myzus persicae and A. gossypii. After 7 days, M. persicae populations on specific transgenic lines were up to 69 % smaller relative to control populations in a whole plant bioassay. The mortality of cotton aphids was 11 % on control lines and up to 32 % on transgenic lines after 5 days. The results show that SAE may be a promising agent for the control of some aphid species in transgenic plants.
