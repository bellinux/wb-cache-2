2500|$|St Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should {{love your}} {{neighbour}} as yourself' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar {{of love for}} others. Considering that [...] "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" [...] and quotes Aristotle that [...] "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves," [...] he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, {{the good of the}} whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.|$|E
6000|$|... "How damned foolish this is!" [...] {{burst out}} d'Urberville. [...] "Why, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> {{are the same}} family; and will be quite satisfied!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Uncle Joe, that's true, but if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> are at {{the cabin}} and in peril he may do {{something}} rash trying to save us." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{what was}} he up to? What did <b>HE</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were doing with Mankind? That I thought worth knowing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless him!" [...] he said, fervently, {{a little}} later, as the captain’s foot was heard {{heavily on the}} stair. [...] "Does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are deaf?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> sleep? Ay, <b>he</b> has got {{it himself}} and would open {{our eyes to}} what is coming! What does he imagine we have been about, since the middle watch was set?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. H. It {{would have}} been more useful if he'd not dipped the estate, and sold the Centry. This Hornblower hates us; <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> turn up our noses at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Homos, you know," [...] Mrs. Makely {{explained}} for me, as if {{this were}} the aptest moment, [...] "thinks we all ought to work. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> oughtn't to have any servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{was just}} to show he was run after. I wonder if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> are running after him? Momma, I am tired of him! I wish he wouldn't speak to me any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean about}} Mr. Gerrish? <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> as <b>we</b> all do; {{that it was}} a {{challenge}} to Mr. Peck's friends, and that we must take it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have had}} for supper all that four persons could desire," [...] I replied quickly, fearing lest <b>he</b> might <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{had it in}} mind to depend upon him entirely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anders," [...] he said, turning {{abruptly}} to the interpreter, [...] "ask Chingatok what <b>he</b> <b>thinks.</b> Can <b>we</b> {{pass this}} barrier, and, if not, {{what would he}} advise us to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} the matter is with him?" [...] Fred asked, when, at a late hour, the {{partners}} were alone. [...] "Do you suppose <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> don't {{want to see him}} just because we have been fortunate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr Fogram {{says that}} he will send us one of the Fellows of his college--a young man full of zeal, who is eager for parochial work, and has been taking duty at a parish some miles from Oxford. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> shall be {{satisfied}} with the change." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peterson gave a short toss of his head, {{which was}} covered with a shock of fiery red hair. [...] "What {{are you going to do}} about it? Even if the captain treats you like a dog, what shall you do, Ostag Semmel? <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> are all curs--door mats to wipe feet on!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Under the trees. He saw us, as we took {{leave of}} each other. Poor fellow! <b>he</b> little <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> have parted. This {{will be a}} blow to him, I am much afraid!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{are going}} to knock about on a lee-shore all the {{afternoon}} and run our noses at night--and dead up-wind, too--into the Dons' mouths? No, Jack, my friend. Let Orlando-Furioso-punctilio-fire- eaters go and get their knuckles rapped. The following game is the game, and not the meeting one. The dog goes after the sheep, and not afore them, lad. Let them go by, and go by, and stick to them well to windward, and pick up stragglers, and pickings, too, Jack--the prizes, Jack!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{younger sister}} then put in. 'We must be fools indeed,' says she, 'in my brother's opinion, that <b>he</b> should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can believe <b>he</b> has seriously asked Mrs. Betty to marry him, {{and that she}} has refused him.' ...|$|R
60|$|ALICE. We {{have been}} here a week, and we find that when Lob invited us he knew us all so little that we begin to wonder why he asked us. And now from words he has let drop {{we know that we}} were invited because of {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> have in common.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's somethin' I ain't able to answer," [...] Jim replied gravely. [...] "These old sailors are queer fish, an' {{nobody can}} ever tell {{what kind of}} a scheme they're likely to strike. This much is certain, though. Bob wouldn't listen to us, 'cause <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> don't know the meanin' of sich work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would seem}} that the Onondago expects the French Indians will now strike at the settlements," [...] I remarked to my companions, [...] "and, that our friends at Ravensnest may need our aid; but, at the same time, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> should first return to Mooseridge, and join the surveyors. Which mode of {{proceeding}} strikes you as the best, my friends?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are his equals, father," [...] cried Laura with spirit. [...] "Would you {{put us on}} the footing of beggars? <b>He</b> would <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{cared for}} him only for his money. I wonder that you should think of such a thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You lift {{houses with}} them," [...] said she. [...] "He {{says that in}} large cities they lift whole blocks of houses with them and build stories underneath. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> that <b>we</b> {{can get rid of}} our trouble here if we use jack-screws." ...|$|R
50|$|In a postgame {{interview}} for ESPN Radio, Linehan was strongly critical of Idaho's decision to drop to FCS football, saying,We belong in FBS, period. That's what I believe, that's what everyone believes. We {{know we can}} compete, we belong here. No matter what anyone thinks, even our tone-deaf president. Maybe <b>he</b> doesn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> belong here, but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> belong here.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've seen Norton and <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to}} help you out," [...] Kerr remarked. [...] "Though he argues from single instances, his judgment's often good, and he seems {{convinced}} you can be trusted because you saved a skip of his. Of course, I had my opinion; but as he represents the contractor you are working for, I couldn't urge him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, so {{it appears}} to me," [...] Harvey replied. [...] "It is not {{reasonable}} to suppose the fellow would have left home knowing he {{was like to be}} gone several days, without first having made everything ready for his absence. Thus suddenly remembering something his mother told him to do, is a childish excuse, and shows that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> are a party of idiots to take any stock in him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may ask, Leo, {{but you may}} {{not expect}} an answer. That is my secret, and I mean to keep it {{as a sort of}} {{stimulus}} to your spirits when the hardships of the way begin to tell on you. Ask Chingatok, Anders," [...] continued the Captain, turning to the interpreter, [...] "if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> have enough provisions collected for the journey. I wish to start immediately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you for nothing. By the bye, who {{was that}} spindle-legged, shoe- buckled parson feller we met by now? <b>He</b> seemed to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should poison him!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well now, look here," [...] said he, drawing me {{a little}} on one side. [...] "What made him take sich stock in us Minorcans? Why, he thought {{we used to be}} slaves; what put that in his head, I'd like to know? Did <b>he</b> reely <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ever was niggers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't it {{be better}} to let her hear?" [...] {{suggested}} Mrs. Merrill; [...] "we cannot very well soften that shock: I talked the matter over a little with Mr. Merrill, and <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that <b>we</b> must take time over it, Miss Penniman. Whatever we do, we must not act hastily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it---if we care to do it. He can't go out, {{and neither}} can those other men, and they don't {{know who to}} get. Of course, they could hire a {{professional}} photographer, but he would only take scenery, most likely, while what my father wants particularly is pictures of good hunting and fishing, and pictures of real camp life. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> are just the boys {{to get the right}} kind of pictures-----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{immediate}} danger," [...] said he. [...] "We must have struck {{some sort of}} wreckage, or lumber float. There is a small hole in the bow, just above the water line, {{and several of the}} seams have been opened. Captain Barforth is having the hole closed up and has started up the donkey pump to keep the water low in the hold. He says <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> can make one of the nearby ports without great trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alec {{turned to}} Pierre and spoke rapidly. The latter interjected a {{question}} {{now and then}} and when Alec had finished made a brief reply. [...] "He says," [...] Alec explained, [...] "that he agrees, though <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> ought to let them have some cartridges. He admits the stealing of the furs, but still protests that he wasn't in on the fox affair and {{wants to know if}} we'll let him go in case the Injun refuses to come across." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said <b>he,</b> [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{must go back}} to London on Tuesday. I find my {{staying here}} will be very {{inconvenient}} to the Government." ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain {{thought a}} while before he answered, and then spoke with much solemnity. [...] "Yes," [...] said <b>he,</b> [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could. And I hope the time will soon come when we may." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What Ted's saying isn't exactly accurate. We {{absolutely}} {{wanted to}} do a Blu-ray of The Deadly Spawn, but our license had expired and Ted gave the title to Elite, totally unbeknownst to us. Then, after we spoke to Ted about it, he said <b>he</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> would be interested in doing a Blu and that's why he gave it to Elite." ...|$|R
