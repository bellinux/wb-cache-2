5|$|Razor Ramon and the 1–2–3 Kid were {{scheduled}} to face Jeff Jarrett and The Roadie at <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 1 the month after WrestleMania. The Kid sustained a legit injury, however, {{and was unable to}} compete. As a result, Ramon wrestled a two-on-one handicap match against Jarrett and The Roadie instead. Ramon won the bout, but the feud continued. At <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 2, The Roadie faced the 1–2–3 Kid and defeated him. Ramon and Jarrett wrestled several times, and Ramon regained the Intercontinental Championship on May 19, 1995. He held the belt for three days before dropping it back to Jarrett.|$|E

5|$|The Smoking Gunns {{were given}} a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship at <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 1. Hart pinned Bart Gunn to retain the {{championship}} for his team. Hart and Yokozuna {{then moved on to}} face other competition, and the Gunns did not become serious contenders for the title again until late in 1995, when they defeated Hart and Yokozuna to regain the championship.|$|E
5|$|Bam Bam Bigelow {{was embarrassed}} {{after losing to}} Lawrence Taylor. To redeem himself, he {{challenged}} Diesel to a match for the WWF Championship. During the match, Tatanka turned on Bigelow and caused him to get pinned. Bigelow {{was kicked out of}} the Million Dollar Corporation and attacked by DiBiase's wrestlers. Diesel saved Bigelow from the attack, which led to a friendship being formed between the two. Bigelow defeated Tatanka in a dark match at <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 2. At King of the Ring 1995, Sid, DiBiase's latest addition to the Corporation, teamed with Tatanka in a loss to the team of Diesel and Bigelow.|$|E
5|$|No Way Out is a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced by WWE, {{a professional}} wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 1998 as an <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> event in February of that year and in 2000 was made an annual pay-per-view event for WWE. After the brand extension, the event was made exclusive to the SmackDown brand in 2004, being produced every February. In April 2007, following WrestleMania 23, brand-exclusive pay-per-view events ceased being held, {{with the last of}} which being the SmackDown-exclusive No Way Out 2007. After the event included two Elimination Chamber matches in 2008 and 2009, No Way Out was replaced by WWE Elimination Chamber the following year. The name was revived for the June 2012 pay-per-view event.|$|E
5000|$|Some exegesis, {{including}} Amina Wadud {{interpret the}} first line, [...] "stay quietly <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>houses,</b> and make not a dazzling display, {{like that of}} the former Times of Ignorance" [...] to imply women {{should not be allowed to}} go out at all, rather than stress the limitation of going out for the aim of wanton display.|$|R

5|$|Owen Hart {{challenged}} Bret Hart to a match after Survivor Series, but Bret {{refused to}} fight his brother. The two reunited to face The Quebecers for the Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. Bret sustained a kayfabe injury during the match, which forced the referee {{to stop the}} match. Owen blamed Bret for the loss and attacked him after the match. They faced each other at WrestleMania X, where Owen defeated Bret. The rivalry continued, however, and the brothers feuded throughout 1994 and into 1995. Bret's feud with Lawler remained, but the two did not face each other again until <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 1 in May 1995. The feud was reignited at that time, and they feuded at several pay-per-view events in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} rivalry on the undercard {{was for the}} WWF Tag Team Championship between the team of Owen Hart and Yokozuna and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart). The Smoking Gunns dropped their WWF Tag Team Championship to Hart and Yokozuna at WrestleMania XI, the {{previous}} pay-per-view event. Their rivalry was reignited on the April 23 episode of Action Zone, when the Blu Brothers (Don and Ron Harris) faced the New Headshrinkers (Sionne and Fatu). Hart and Yokozuna interfered in the contest, attacking the New Headshrinkers, causing a disqualification. The Smoking Gunns ran to the ring, attacking Hart and Yokozuna. The Headshrinkers posed with Hart and Yokozuna's tag team belts and celebrated with the Smoking Gunns. The following night, on Raw, the Smoking Gunns were awarded a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> pay-per-view. They made their intentions of winning the title clear by quickly defeating Barry Horowitz and the Brooklyn Brawler. In their last encounter before the event, Bart defeated Hart via pinfall on the May 8 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} rivalry on the undercard {{was for the}} WWF Intercontinental Championship. The feud took place between Razor Ramon, the 1–2–3 Kid, the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett, and his personal enforcer, The Roadie. Ramon and Jarrett faced each other at WrestleMania XI, but Jarrett was disqualified. Jarrett faced Aldo Montoya on the April 8 episode of Superstars of Wrestling in a non-title match, where Jarrett accidentally pinned himself (he never lifted his shoulder off the ground after being slammed to the mat by Montoya). Jarrett was initially announced the winner, but Montoya was later declared the winner. Jarrett and Montoya faced each other again two weeks later, on the April 22 episode of Superstars of Wrestling. During the match, Razor Ramon came to ringside and chased The Roadie backstage. Despite this, Jarrett managed to gain the victory, making Montoya submit to the figure four leglock. The next day on Wrestling Challenge, Ramon and the 1–2–3 Kid were scheduled to square off against Jarrett and The Roadie at <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House.</b> After the 1–2–3 Kid a legit neck injury rendered Kid unable to wrestle, the match was changed into a Handicap match, in which Ramon would face both Jarrett and The Roadie by himself.|$|E

5|$|The most {{prominent}} rivalry {{heading into the}} pay-per-view was between then-WWF Champion Diesel and his storyline rival Sid. At the previous pay-per-view, WrestleMania XI, Diesel defeated Shawn Michaels to retain the WWF Championship, partly due to an interference by Michaels' bodyguard Sid backfiring. The following night, Michaels stated that for a potential rematch, he would give Sid the night off, causing the bodyguard to turn on Michaels by powerbombing him three times. Diesel eventually came out to help Michaels. Michaels was legitimately injured, and this sidelined him for six weeks, effectively shelving plans for a rematch between Diesel and Michaels. Diesel was then scheduled to defend his title against Bam Bam Bigelow, {{a member of the}} Million Dollar Corporation stable, after a staged confrontation between the two on the April 16, 1995 episode of Action Zone, a secondary television program for the WWF. On the same day, on Wrestling Challenge, another secondary television program, in a segment featuring the Corporation, Bigelow was noticeably snubbed, signaling a turn. Over the weekend of April 16, a match between Sid and Diesel was scheduled for <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House,</b> in which Sid could potentially face Diesel for the WWF Championship, depending on whether he retained or lost his title against Bigelow. On the April 24 episode of Raw, Sid stated he was unhappy about this stipulation, as it meant that if Bigelow won, Sid would not get a shot at the title. Diesel retained the title when the Corporation turned on Bigelow, with Tatanka tripping Bigelow as he ran off the ropes. Diesel hit Bigelow with a big boot and executed a powerbomb for the win. After the contest, Bigelow was insulted by Ted DiBiase and attacked by the Corporation. Diesel, who had gone back to the locker room, came to Bigelow's aid. In Sid's match with Razor Ramon on the May 1 episode of Raw, Diesel approached the ring ready to fight Sid, who, along with the Corporation's manager DiBiase, left the arena abruptly. The following week on Raw, DiBiase revealed that he and Sid had been working together for a while, admitting that it was him who told Shawn Michaels to get a bodyguard.|$|E

25|$|Over the Edge: <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> was {{the first}} of what became an annual World Wrestling Federation {{pay-per-view}} (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was also the 22nd pay-per-view event in the <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> series. It was presented by Castrol GTX and took place on May 31, 1998, at the Wisconsin Center Arena in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It {{was the first}} WWF pay-per-view event to have a TV Parental Guidelines rating of TV-14. The company would go on to give all of its pay-per-view events TV-14 ratings from this point through The Great American Bash 2008, with SummerSlam 2008 being the first of their pay-per-views to be rated TV-PG in over a decade.|$|E
25|$|The {{pay-per-view}} garnered 280,000 buys, {{which is}} equivalent to a 0.7 buyrate. The buyrate was down from the inaugural <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> event, which attracted 332,000 buys. The buyrate was slightly better though than the King of the Ring pay-per-view, which aired the previous month and attracted 260,000 buys, equivalent to a 0.65 buyrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{pay-per-view}} {{received a}} 0.9 buyrate, equivalent to approximately 205,000 buys in 1995 (1.0 equated to roughly 230,000 {{homes in the}} domestic market that year). Although this was up on the buyrate for the <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 2 pay-per-view which took place the previous month, the buyrate was down on the 1994 SummerSlam event, which received a 1.3 buyrate.|$|E

Diesel and Michaels won the bout and the titles. However, the titles were returned to Hart and Yokozuna the next day on a technicality following lobbying from their lawyer, Clarence Mason.|$|E
25|$|Diesel's WWF World Heavyweight Championship reign {{continued}} until November 19, {{when he was}} defeated by Bret Hart at Survivor Series. Following the loss, Diesel attacked Hart.

Diesel was the last wrestler eliminated in the Royal Rumble match by Shawn Michaels, which eventually led to a rift between the two men. At <b>In</b> <b>Your</b> <b>House</b> 6 on February 18, Diesel lost a steel cage match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Bret Hart when he was attacked by The Undertaker.|$|E
