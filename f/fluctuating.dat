40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>fluctuate</b> lighting on performance of laying hens. Two programs were applied with 16 hours daily lighting: step-up (normal) lighting program as the control treatment and a <b>fluctuate</b> lighting program of 2 W/m 2 for 45 min and 6 W/m 2 for 15 min. Egg weight, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio, henday egg production and hen-housed egg production of the laying hens were recorded for 46 weeks. No significant difference for hen-day and hen-housed egg production between the step up and <b>fluctuate</b> lighting programs (P > 0. 05) were found. However, <b>fluctuate</b> lighting program resulted in {{a significant increase in}} egg weight (P < 0. 05). Moreover, hens in the <b>fluctuate</b> lighting program consumed significantly less amount of feed and had a better feed conversion ratio than hens in the step-up lighting program (P < 0. 01).

Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{proboscideans}} lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism.
