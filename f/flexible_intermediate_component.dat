40|$|The {{study of}} {{inertial}} forces effects {{at high speeds}} in flexible parallel manipulators, which generate undesired deviations, is a challenging task due to the coupled and complicated equations of motion. A dynamic model of the Revolute Prismatic Revolute (RPR) planar manipulators (specifically 3 -RPR, 2 -RPR and 1 -RPR) with <b>flexible</b> <b>intermediate</b> links is developed based on the assumed mode method. The <b>flexible</b> <b>intermediate</b> links are modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beams with fixed-free boundary conditions. Using the Lagrange multipliers, a generalized set of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) of motion is developed. In the simulations, the rigid body motion of the end-effector is constrained by some moving constraint equations while the vibrations of the <b>flexible</b> <b>intermediate</b> links cause deviations from the desired trajectory. From this analysis, the dynamic performance of the manipulators when tracking a desired trajectory is evaluated. A comparison of the results indicates that in some cases, adding each extra RPR chain in the n-RPR planar manipulators with <b>flexible</b> <b>intermediate</b> links reduces the stiffness and accuracy due to the inertial forces of the flexible links, which is opposite to what would be expected. The study provides insights to the design, control and suitable selection of the flexible manipulators. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R

Rigorous simulations {{were conducted}} by using Aspen PlusTM RATEFRAC Module for the separation of ternary mixtures. According to the equilibrium model, the energy-efficient design of the Petlyuk column requires that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> be extracted from the maximum point in the composition profile of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> in the main column.

This point, considering the nonequilibrium model, corresponds to the stage in which the net mass transfer rate is zero. For the case of two segments per stage, it was found that the heat duties predicted by the equilibrium model are significantly lower than those obtained by using the nonequilibrium model, which is consistent with previous reported results. However, it is important to say that despite of the higher energy duty predicted by the nonequilibrium model, both models predict significant energy savings...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the dynamic model of a planar 3 -RRR flexible parallel manipulator (FPM), {{it is often difficult to}} achieve active vibration control algorithm based on the system dynamic model. To establish a simple and efficient dynamic model of the planar 3 -RRR FPM to study its dynamic characteristics and build a controller conveniently, firstly, considering the effect of rigid-flexible coupling and the moment of inertia at the end of the <b>flexible</b> <b>intermediate</b> link, the modal function is determined with the pinned-free boundary condition. Then, considering the main vibration modes of the system, a high-efficiency coupling dynamic model is established on the basis of guaranteeing the model control accuracy. According to the model, the modal characteristics of the <b>flexible</b> <b>intermediate</b> link are analyzed and compared with the modal test results. The results show that the model can effectively reflect the main vibration modes of the planar 3 -RRR FPM; in addition the model can be used to analyze the effects of inertial and coupling forces on the dynamics model and the drive torque of the drive motor.

40|$|In this dissertation, the cold-drawing {{response}} {{of a commercial}} high-density polyethylene (HDPE) resin has been studied using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and variety of other complementary techniques. Melt-crystallized, isotropic samples of the HDPE have been drawn to various extensions at ambient temperature (21 °C) and at a relatively slow strain rate (0. 0013 s− 1). ^ Using solid-state NMR, the first unambiguous evidence for a major morphological <b>component</b> <b>intermediate</b> to the crystalline and amorphous domains in the cold-drawn HDPE microstructure has been found. Employing an ‘inverse 13 C T 1 filter’ and other filtering techniques, signals from the various components have been selected and compared. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> comprises chains of all-trans conformation but with significant disorder in packing. The chains show fast, intermediate-amplitude motions about their axes and are generally aligned with the draw direction, but with a greater distribution of orientation angles relative to crystalline phase. ^ A quantitative 13 C NMR procedure has been utilized {{in the analysis of}} morphological component composition during cold drawing. In the undeformed material, the NMR-derived composition shows excellent agreement with other common techniques. The mass fraction of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> has been measured by NMR to be as high as 35 % in the cold-drawn HDPE, greater than the contributions from the amorphous domains and monoclinic crystals. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> content dramatically increases by 240 % just after necking, along with a doubling in the monoclinic crystals. At the same time, decreases of about 25 % in the total crystalline and amorphous phases occur. A general re-ordering in the microstructure takes place during neck propagation and strain hardening. The total crystallinity rises by about 8 %, with a corresponding decrease in the monoclinic crystals (50 %) and amorphous material (30 %). ^ Based on 1 H spin diffusion data, a microstructural model of cold-drawn HDPE is offered. The spin diffusion data identify the <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> with tie-molecule bundles that connect small ‘mosaic block’ crystallites (ca. 10 – 15 nm side dimension) along the draw direction. The bundles consist of about 30 chains and are estimated to be about 2. 5 nm in diameter and 3 nm in length. ...|$|R

Data were obtained using an analytical methodology combining chemical fractionation, enzymatic debranching, and offline 2 D size-exclusion chromatography with multiple detection. The 2 D distributions reveal novel {{features in the}} branching structure of high-amylose maize starches. Normal maize starch shows well-resolved structural topologies, corresponding to the amylopectin and amylose macromolecular populations. However, high-amylose maize starches exhibit very complex topologies with significant features between those of amylose and amylopectin, showing the presence of distinct <b>intermediate</b> <b>components.</b> These have the macromolecular size of amylose but similar branching structure to amylopectin, except for {{a higher proportion of}} longer branches. These structural features of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>components</b> can be related to a less tightly controlled biosynthesis of the branching structures in high-amylose maize starch mutants, which may prevent these molecules from maturing into full-size amylopectin.

40|$|Abstract—The use of <b>flexible</b> <b>intermediate</b> bulk {{containers}} (FIBCs), or “big bags ” as {{they are}} commonly known, is becoming widespread {{in a variety of}} industries, including chemical, phar-maceutical, and foodstuffs. Typically, FIBCs, roughly cubic in shape and constructed from woven polypropylene, are used to store and transport powdered or granular material in loads of between 300 – 1000 kg. In many cases, FIBCs are used in the vicinity of sensitive flammable atmospheres which may arise from the presence of dispersed combustible dusts or solvent vapors. Over the years, {{there have been a number}} of serious fires and explosions (particularly during the discharging of the bag con-tents) which have been attributed to static electricity. As a result, various “antistatic ” FIBC designs have been produced containing intrinsic features aimed at minimizing the risk of electrostatic ignition. This paper presents the results of a rigorous assessment of a variety of FIBC designs with regard to electrostatic ignition hazard in flammable atmospheres of minimum ignition energy 0. 12, 0. 25, and 1. 5 mJ. (The minimum ignition energy of methanol, a common industrial solvent, is 0. 14 mJ.) The study involved setting up a test rig to enable the FIBCs to be filled and emptied under controlled conditions of relative humidity. During these operations, the electrostatic activity in terms of surface potentials, electric field, and electrostatic discharge energy was carefully monitored. Incendiary discharges were quantified by using a calibrated propane/oxygen/nitrogen gas probe. The findings of this paper indicate which of the designs can be safely used in various industrial processes without risk of ignition.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a {{comparative}} study of the energy-efficiency performance between conventional distillation sequences and thermally coupled distillation arrangements (TCDS) for the separation of ternary mixtures of hydrocarbons under the action of feedback control loops. The influence of the relative ease of separation of the feed mixture and its composition was analyzed. The feedback analysis was conducted through servo tests with individual changes in the set points {{for each of the}} three product streams. Standard PI controllers were used for each loop. The results show an apparent trend regarding the sequence with a better dynamic performance. Generally, TCDS options performed better for the control of the extreme components of the ternary mixture (A and C), while the conventional sequences offered a better dynamic behaviour for the control of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> (B). The only case in which there was a dominant structure for all control loops was when the feed contained low amounts of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> and the mixture had similar relative volatilities. The Petlyuk column provided the optimal choice in such case, which contradicts the general expectations regarding its control behaviour. In addition, the energy demands during the dynamic responses were significantly lower than those observed for the other distillation sequences. TCDS options, therefore, are not only more energy efficient than the conventional sequences, but there are cases in which they also offer better feedback control properties...|$|R
40|$|In this manuscript, {{we study}} {{properties}} of BLR of well-known reverberation-mapped AGN, {{in order to}} find reliable evidence for intermediate BLR. We firstly check properties of mapped AGN collected from literature in plane of ^ 2 /^ 2 vs /. Commonly, virial BH masses based on observed broad Hα and Hβ should be coincident. However, among the mapped objects, PG 0052 and NGC 4253 are two apparent outliers in the plane of ^ 2 /^ 2 vs /, which indicate BLRs of PG 0052 and NGC 4253 have some special characters. Then based on the 55 public spectra of PG 0052, BLR of PG 0052 is been carefully studied in detail. We find that line width ratio of total observed broad Hα to total observed broad Hβ is ∼ 0. 7, which is much smaller than theoretical/observational value of ∼ 0. 9. Furthermore, flux ratio of total broad Hα to total broad Hβ is about 6. 8 (Balmer Decrement), which is not one reasonable value for BLUE quasar PG 0052 + 251. Moreover, properties of line cores based on PCA technique confirm there is one inner broad component and one seriously obscured <b>intermediate</b> broad <b>component</b> in BLR of PG 0052. If the seriously obscured intermediate BLR was accepted, properties of PG 0052 in the plane of ^ 2 /^ 2 vs / could be well reproduced, which indicates that the intermediate BLR actually is well appropriate to mapped quasar PG 0052 + 251. Finally, the large distance between inner component of BLR and <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> of BLR based on CCF results rejects the possibility that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>component</b> is probably extended part of inner component of BLR.
