However, the exact geometry of such structures and their crustal and upper mantle expressions are still debated. We present an analysis of seismic, structural and morphological features that possibly represent the expression of lithospheric segmentation in the northern Apennines. Geophysical observations show evidence {{for the existence of}} a discontinuity in the lithospheric structure beneath the northern Apennines, characterized by a change in the spatial distribution of intermediate-depth seismicity, along-strike variations in the pattern of crustal seismicity, and a bend in the Moho topography. The near-surface expression of this discontinuity is associated with an abrupt change in the morphology and exhumation history of the northern Apennines in the proximity of the Livorno-Sillaro Lineament. We interpret these features as evidence for <b>incipient</b> <b>tearing</b> of the lithospheric slab beneath the northern Apennines, marking the boundary between domains that underwent contrasting styles of lithospheric deformation, which are either associated with different rates of slab rollback or a transition from underplating to retreat. We suggest that similar types of structures may {{play a crucial role in}} the evolution of convergent plate boundaries, allowing segmentation of orogenic belts and facilitating the development of orogenic curvatures, Ultimately, further tearing along such structures could potentially lead to the occurrence of tearâ€“related magmatism and the formation of slab windows...|$|E

'No,' she said, smiling through two <b>incipient</b> <b>tears</b> as she drew back.

6000|$|But Charles Gould, openly preoccupied now, gave not a sign, made no sound. The impenetrability of the {{embodied}} Gould Concession had {{its surface}} shades. To be dumb {{is merely a}} fatal affliction; but the King of Sulaco had words enough to give him all the mysterious weight of a taciturn force. His silences, backed {{by the power of}} speech, had as many shades of significance as uttered words in the way of assent, of doubt, of negation--even of simple comment. Some seemed to say plainly, [...] "Think it over"; others meant clearly, [...] "Go ahead"; a simple, low [...] "I see," [...] with an affirmative nod, {{at the end of a}} patient listening half-hour was the equivalent of a verbal contract, which men had learned to trust implicitly, since behind it all there was the great San Tome mine, the head and front of the material interests, so strong that it depended on no man's goodwill in the whole length and breadth of the Occidental Province--that is, on no goodwill which it could not buy ten times over. But to the little hook-nosed man from Esmeralda, anxious about the export of hides, the silence of Charles Gould portended a failure. Evidently this was no time for extending a modest man's business. He enveloped in a swift mental malediction the whole country, with all its inhabitants, partisans of Ribiera and Montero alike; and there were <b>incipient</b> <b>tears</b> in his mute anger at the thought of the innumerable ox-hides going to waste upon the dreamy expanse of the Campo, with its single palms rising like ships at sea within the perfect circle of the horizon, its clumps of heavy timber motionless like solid islands of leaves above the running waves of grass. There were hides there, rotting, with no profit to anybody--rotting where they had been dropped by men called away to attend the urgent necessities of political revolutions. The practical, mercantile soul of Senor Hirsch rebelled against all that foolishness, while he was taking a respectful but disconcerted leave of the might and majesty of the San Tome mine in the person of Charles Gould. He could not restrain a heart-broken murmur, wrung out of his very aching heart, as it were.|$|R
