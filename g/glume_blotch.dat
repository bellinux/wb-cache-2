The lowest level of infection was recorded in the year 2000 characterized by the lowest rainfall in this month.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my work}} was to characterise principal problems of breeding programmes aiming at resistance to Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch.</b> Both relative species (S. nodorum and S. tritici) which damage wheat stands particularly at a decisive growth stage, grain formation, are ones {{of the most important}} fungal diseases in cereal crops. Based on our investigations, only 6 % of varieties show apparent features of resistance. The goal of breeding effort is to develop a variety which will exhibit good performance and need minimum fungicide applications. One of problems solved was to increase effectiveness of production of a high inoculum amount and its long-term storage. A cultivation substrate, sterilised grain of cereals (wheat), met these requirements. I succeeded in improving its effectiveness (highly significantly) due to added tuber substrates (potato tuber). A principal issue prior to beginning the investigation was to find an optimum method for inoculation. A methodology for inoculation of plots and short-term installation of plastic foil covers over inoculated stands was developed. Using colour plastic foils instead of transparent ones showed to be more suitable for primary development of infection. There is a high variation in resistant and susceptible reactions of a host plant and as well as in pathogen populations. Differences among isolates are significant, however, use of an inoculum mixture reaches the effect of an isolate of the highest aggressiveness. My experiments aimed at seeking possible mechanisms which lead towards disposition of plants to disease infection confirmed a high correlation between genotype responses to stress and consequent infection development. Susceptibility to Septoria blotch of a genotype is associated with senescence mechanisms of plant organs. There are considerable differences among genotypes, which could be used in breeding. I looked for characters which exhibited sufficient stability in infection experiments between years. I found markedly higher between-year variation in infection symptoms on plant organs and their intensity in comparison with yield loss caused by infection. A collection of testing standards was formed which show high stability of reactions in tolerance characters in the field. Triticum genus is characteristic, among others, of high variation in potential reproduction of an ear including its morphological structure. Since Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> is a typical ear pathogen, a question arises: how highly will its harmfulness be dependent on ear structure. It was found that high-yielding types in which yield is formed by high ear weight can be damaged by Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> more seriously. Novel techniques for seeking tolerant materials using sprays of stands with dessicants during grain formation have been tested in the world. This technique was modified and slowly-affecting dessicant (Harvade 25 F) was used to test a methodology for breeding programmes aimed at tolerance to Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch.</b> The {{objective of}} other experiments was to combine a visual level of infection and yield response in one factor. A so-called factor X indicates change of an absolute value of yield reduction per unit area under disease progress curve. As results show, basic criteria for selection of resistant genotypes are elements of ear productivity and their changes after Septoria blotch infection. It can be concluded that responses of some varieties (Hana and Zdar, or Asta and Siria) were resistant to infection, and particularly with regard to yield tolerance. Some genotypes provided by foreign institutions were studied for their adaptibility to domestic agroecological conditions. Based on combination crosses of resistant and susceptible parents filial generations were analysed for their potential utilissation in breeding using heritability values of visual and yield characters.

Plant-Microbe Interact. 17 : 456 - 466, 2004]. In this study, we sought to identify targets of the signaling pathway that {{may have contributed to}} phenotypic defects of the signaling mutants. A comparative analysis of Stagonospora nodorum wild-type and G alpha-defective mutant (gna 1) intracellular proteomes was performed via two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several proteins showed significantly altered abundances when comparing the two strains. One such protein, the short-chain dehydrogenase Sch 1, was 18 -fold less abundant in the gna 1 strain, implying that it is positively regulated by G alpha signaling. Gene expression and transcriptional enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion analyses of Sch 1 indicates strong expression during asexual development. Mutant strains of Stagonospora nodorum lacking Sch 1 demonstrated poor growth on minimal media and exhibited a significant reduction in asexual sporulation on all growth media examined.

Protein sequence alignments showed the cloned gene, Mak 2, {{is closely related}} to homologues from other dothideomycete fungi. Expression studies revealed Mak 2 is up-regulated during in vitro growth upon nitrogen starvation but is not sensitive to carbon starvation or osmotic stress. Transcript analysis in planta showed Mak 2 to be expressed throughout infection and up-regulated during the sporulation phase of the infection cycle. Fungal strains harbouring a disrupted Mak 2 gene were created by homologous gene recombination. The mutant strains had a severely altered phenotype in vitro with reduced growth rate and failure to sporulate. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that the mutants had near-normal levels of secreted protease activity, were not hypersensitive to osmotic stress and appeared to have melanin synthesis intact. The mak 2 strains were essentially non-pathogenic to wheat leaves. No penetration structures formed and although entry was observed through stomates, the infection rarely continued.

Visual quantification based on a diagrammatic scale can be a practical and efficient strategy that has already proven to be useful against several plant pathosystems, including diseases affecting wheat spikes like <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> and fusarium head blight. Spikes showing different disease severity values were collected from a wheat field with the aim of elaborating a diagrammatic scale to quantify blast severity on wheat spikes.

40|$|Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} that is {{the causal}} agent of leaf and <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> on wheat. S. nodorum is a polycyclic pathogen, whereby rain-splashed pycnidiospores attach to and colonise wheat tissue and subsequently sporulate again within 2 - 3 weeks. As several cycles of infection are needed for a damaging infection, asexual sporulation is a critical phase of its infection cycle. A non-targeted metabolomics screen for sporulation-associated metabolites identified that trehalose accumulated significantly in concert with asexual sporulation both in vitro and in planta. A reverse-genetics approach was used to investigate the role of trehalose in asexual sporulation. Trehalose biosynthesis was disrupted by deletion of the gene Tps 1, encoding a trehalose 6 -phosphate synthase, resulting in almost total loss of trehalose during in vitro growth and in planta. In addition, lesion development and pycnidia formation were also significantly reduced in tps 1 mutants. Reintroduction of the Tps 1 gene restored trehalose biosynthesis, pathogenicity and sporulation to wild-type levels. Microscopic examination of tps 1 infected wheat leaves showed that pycnidial formation often halted {{at an early stage}} of development. Further examination of the tps 1 phenotype revealed that tps 1 pycnidiospores exhibited a reduced germination rate while under heat stress, and tps 1 mutants had a reduced growth rate while under oxidative stress.

To localize this QTL (QSng. sfr- 3 BS) with high resolution, we constructed a genetic map for the QTL target region using information from sequenced flow-sorted chromosomes 3 B of the two parental cultivars ‘Arina’ and ‘Forno’, the physical map of chromosome 3 B of cultivar ‘Chinese Spring’ and BAC-clone sequences. The mapping population of near-isogenic lines (NIL) was evaluated for SNG resistance in field infection tests. NILs segregated for disease resistance as well as for plant height; additionally, we observed a high environmental influence on the trait. Our analysis detected a strong negative correlation of SNG resistance and plant height. Further analysis of the target region identified two linked loci associated with SNG resistance. One of them was also associated with plant height, revealing an effect of QSng. sfr- 3 BS on plant height that was hidden in the RIL population.

A putative mannitol 2 -dehydrogenase gene (Mdh 1) was cloned by degenerate PCR and disrupted. The resulting mutated mdh 1 strains lacked all detectable NADPH-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase activity. The mdh 1 strains were unaffected for mannitol production but, surprisingly, were still able to utilize mannitol as a sole carbon source, suggesting a hitherto unknown mechanism for mannitol catabolism. The mutant strains were not compromised {{in their ability to}} cause disease or sporulate. To further our understanding of mannitol metabolism, a previously developed mannitol- 1 -phosphate dehydrogenase (gene mpd 1) disruption construct [Solomon, Tan and Oliver (2005) Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 18, 110 - 115] was introduced into the mutated mdh 1 background, resulting in a strain lacking both enzyme activities. The mpd 1 mdh 1 strains were unable to grow on mannitol and produced only trace levels of mannitol. The double-mutant strains were unable to sporulate in vitro when grown on minimal medium for extended periods. Deficiency in sporulation was correlated with the depletion of intracellular mannitol pools. Significantly sporulation could be restored with the addition of mannitol. Pathogenicity of the double mutant was not compromised, although, like the previously characterized mpd 1 mutants, the strains were unable to sporulate in planta. These findings not only question the currently hypothesized pathways of mannitol metabolism, but also identify {{for the first time that}} mannitol is required for sporulation of a filamentous fungus...|$|E

In the present paper we consider the resistance of H. chilense to several fungal diseases and the prospects for its transference to cultivated cereals. All H. chilense accessions studied are resistant to the barley, wheat and rye brown rusts, the powdery mildews of wheat, barley, rye and oat, to Septoria leaf blotch, common bunt and to loose smuts, which suggests that H. chilense is a non-host of these diseases. There are also lines resistant to wheat and barley yellow rust, stem rust and to Agropyron leaf rust, as well as lines giving moderate levels of resistance to Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch,</b> tan spot and Fusarium head blight. Some H. chilense lines display pre-appressorial avoidance to brown rust. Lines differ in the degree of haustorium formation by rust and mildew fungi they permit, and in the degree to which a hypersensitive response occurs after haustoria are formed. Unfortunately, resistance of H. chilense to rust fungi is not expressed in tritordeum hybrids, nor in chromosome addition lines in wheat. In tritordeum, H. chilense contributes quantitative resistance to wheat powdery mildew, tan spot and loose smut. The resistance to mildew, expressed as a reduced disease severity, is not associated with macroscopically visible necrosis. Hexaploid tritordeums are immune to Septoria leaf blotch and to common bunt although resistance to both is slightly diluted in octoploid tritordeums.

In agreement with linkage analyses, association mapping by a least squares general linear model (GLM) at marker loci in the region of QSng. sfr- 3 BS revealed the highest association with SNG resistance for SUN 2 - 3 B (p < 0. 05). Association mapping can provide an effective mean of relating genotypes to complex quantitative phenotypes in hexaploid wheat. Linkage disequilibrium (r 2) in chromosome 3 B extended less than 0. 5 cM in 44 varieties, while it extended about 30 cM in 240 RILs, based on 91 SSR and STS marker-pair comparisons. This indicated that the association mapping population had a marker resolution potential at least 390 -fold higher compared to the RIL population. L. Tommasini, T. Schnurbusch, D. Fossati, F.

40|$|The wheat disease tan (or yellow leaf) spot, {{caused by}} Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, was first {{described}} in the period 1934 to 1941 in Canada, India, and the United States. It was first noted in Australia in 1953 and only became a serious disease in the 1970 s. The emergence of this disease has recently {{been linked to the}} acquisition by P. tritici-repentis of the ToxA gene from the wheat leaf and <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> pathogen, Stagonospora nodorum. ToxA encodes a host-specific toxin that interacts with the product of the wheat gene Tsn 1. Interaction of ToxA with the dominant allele of Tsn 1 causes host necrosis. P. tritici-repentis races lacking ToxA give minor indistinct lesions on wheat lines, whereas wheat lines expressing the recessive tsn 1 are significantly less susceptible to the disease. Although the emergence and spread of tan spot had been attributed to the adoption of minimum tillage practices, we wished to test the alternative idea that the planting of Tsn 1 wheat lines {{may have contributed to the}} establishment of the pathogen in Australia. To do this, wheat cultivars released in Australia from 1911 to 1986 were tested for their sensitivity to ToxA. Prior to 1941, 16 % of wheat cultivars were ToxA-insensitive and hence, all other factors being equal, would be more resistant to the disease. Surprisingly, only one of the cultivars released since 1940 was ToxA insensitive, and the area planted to ToxA-insensitive cultivars varied from 0 to a maximum of only 14 % in New South Wales. Thus, the majority of the cultivars were ToxA-sensitive both before and during the period of emergence and spread of the disease. We therefore conclude that the spread of P. tritici-repentis in Australia cannot be causally linked to the deployment of ToxA-sensitive cultivars...|$|E

The main goals of this study were to detect (1) new quantitative trait loci (QTL) for STB resistance in two adapted European biparental populations (Arina/Forno, History/Rubens) and (2) QTL regions for broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) to the above-mentioned diseases during the adult-plant stage in the field. The three resistances were phenotyped across 4 – 7 field environments and phenotypic data revealed significant (P < 0. 01) genotypic differentiation in all cases. Entry-mean heritabilities (h²) ranged from 0. 73 to 0. 93. For STB resistance, correlations between disease ratings and heading date were significant (P < 0. 01), but moderate (r = − 0. 23 to − 0. 30) in both populations. Correlations between STB and plant height were higher in Arina/Forno (r = − 0. 45) and History/Rubens (r = − 0. 55), the latter population segregating at the Rht-D 1 locus. During the initial QTL analysis, 5 QTL were detected for STB resistance in each of the populations, amounting to an explained genotypic variance of 45 – 63 %, thus, showing the same ranges as FHB and SGB resistances in Arina/Forno and FHB resistance in History/Rubens. In total, 7 BSR QTL were found in the meta-analysis with the raw data, including the QTL on chromosome 4 D at the Rht-D 1 locus. A BSR QTL for all three diseases was not found but several BSR QTL for combinations with two diseases were detected. Combining the BSR QTL detected in the present breeding material by applying marker-assisted selection seems a promising approach...|$|E
40|$|Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} that is {{the causal}} agent of leaf and <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> on wheat. Very little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms required for pathogenicity of S. nodorum, despite its major impact on Australian agriculture. S. nodorum is a polycyclic pathogen. Rain-splashed pycnidiospores attach to and colonise wheat tissue and subsequently sporulate within 2 - 3 weeks. Several cycles of infection are needed to build up inoculum for the damaging infection of flag leaves and heads, sporulation is therefore {{a critical component of}} the infection cycle of S. nodorum; our aim is to determine the genetic and biochemical requirements for sporulation for development of control of the pathogen. Disease progression of S. nodorum on wheat cv. Amery was monitored by light microscopy to determine the time point when pycnidia development began. Early pycnidia development was evident 12 days post-infection. This information was used to guide a genomics and a metabolomics based approach to determine the requirements for sporulation in S. nodorum. The genomics approach utilised two cDNA libraries created from sporulating and non-sporulating cultures. EST frequency was used to determine highly expressed genes under the two developmental states. Gene expression from the most highly represented genes during sporulation were confirmed using quantitative PCR. A gene encoding an arabitol 4 -dehydrogenase (Abd 1), was mutagenised, in its absence sporulation was reduced by approximately 20 %. The metabolomics approach isolated metabolites from both in planta infection and in vitro growth. Rapid changes in the abundance of metabolites were detected during the onset of sporulation. Key fungal metabolites identified include mannitol and trehalose. The concentration of both mannitol and trehalose increased dramatically in concert with pycnidia formation. Both mannitol and trehalose have also been linked to pathogenicity in filamentous fungi. Creation of deletion mutants of the gene encoding trehalose 6 -phosphate synthase showed the synthesis of trehalose is required for full sporulation of S. nodorum in planta and in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The fungus Stagonospora nodorum is {{the causal}} agent of leaf and <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> disease on wheat {{and is an}} {{emerging}} model {{for the study of}} the interaction between plants and necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Signal transduction plays a critical role during infection by allowing the pathogen to sense and appropriately respond to environmental changes. The role of signal transduction in the pathogenicity of S. nodorum was analysed by the targeted inactivation of genes encoding a G[alpha] subunit (Gna 1) and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mak 2). Strains carrying the inactivated genes were impaired in virulence and demonstrated a host of phenotypic impairments such as abolished sporulation. Therefore, it was hypothesised that Gna 1 and Mak 2 regulate downstream effector molecules that are critical for pathogenic development. A 2 D gel-based proteomic approach was used to compare the extracellular and intracellular proteomes of the wild-type fungus and signalling mutants for differences in protein abundance. Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and patternmatching against the S. nodorum genome sequence led to the identification of 26 genes from 34 differentially abundant protein spots. These genes possess probable roles in protein cycling, plant cell wall degradation, stress response, nucleotide metabolism, proteolysis, quinate and secondary metabolism. A putative short-chain dehydrogenase gene (Sch 1) was identified and its expression was shown to be reduced in both signalling mutants. The transcript level of Sch 1 increased during the latter period of infection coinciding with pycnidiation. Sch 1 was inactivated by targeted gene deletion. Mutants were able to effectively colonise the host but asexual sporulation was dramatically reduced and pycnidial ontogeny was severely disrupted. Furthermore, the sch 1 mutants showed alterations in the metabolome. GC-MS analysis identified a metabolite which accumulated in the sch 1 mutants. Computational and database analyses indicated that the compound possesses a cyclic carbon backbone. Based on these findings, Sch 1 may be a suitable target for fungicides that inhibit asexual sporulation and the accumulated compound may be used to design novel antifungal compounds. 2 D SDS-PAGE analysis identified increased abundance of another putative short-chain dehydrogenase (Sch 2) and a nitroreductase in the sch 1 -deleted background. It was also shown that Sch 2 was regulated by Gna 1...|$|E

Hereditas, Proceedings 4 th International Triticeae Symposium, September 2001, 135, (2 - 3), 161 - 169 Proceedings 4 th International Triticeae Symposium, September 2001. Sponsorship: CICYT projects AGF 96 - 0463 and AGF 99 - 1036 Hordeum chilense is a South American wild barley with high potential for cereal breeding given its high crossability {{with other members}} of the Triticeae. In the present paper we consider the resistance of H. chilense to several fungal diseases and the prospects for its transference to cultivated cereals. All H. chilense accessions studied are resistant to the barley, wheat and rye brown rusts, the powdery mildews of wheat, barley, rye and oat, to Septoria leaf blotch, common bunt and to loose smuts, which suggests that H. chilense is a non-host of these diseases. There are also lines resistant to wheat and barley yellow rust, stem rust and to Agropyron leaf rust, as well as lines giving moderate levels of resistance to Septoria <b>glume</b> <b>blotch,</b> tan spot and Fusarium head blight. Some H. chilense lines display pre-appressorial avoidance to brown rust. Lines differ in the degree of haustorium formation by rust and mildew fungi they permit, and in the degree to which a hypersensitive response occurs after haustoria are formed. Unfortunately, resistance of H. chilense to rust fungi is not expressed in tritordeum hybrids, nor in chromosome addition lines in wheat. In tritordeum, H. chilense contributes quantitative resistance to wheat powdery mildew, tan spot and loose smut. The resistance to mildew, expressed as a reduced disease severity, is not associated with macroscopically visible necrosis. Hexaploid tritordeums are immune to Septoria leaf blotch and to common bunt although resistance to both is slightly diluted in octoploid tritordeums. Studies with addition lines in wheat indicate that the resistance of H. chilense to powdery mildew, Septoria leaf blotch and common bunt is of broad genetic basis, conferred by genes present on various chromosomes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted from 1983 to 1985 {{to determine the effects}} of dinoseb [2 -(1 -methylpropyl) - 4, 6 -dinitrophenol] on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) yields. Field trials on dinoseb timing and dinoseb plus supplemental pesticides were established in an effort to elucidate the possible factors involved in the yield response of the crop to the herbicide, under weed-free conditions. During the first year (1983 - 1984), dinoseb (1. 7 kg/ha) was applied at several growth stages, from 1 leaf to early booting, to September- and October-planted Yamhill wheat and late October-planted Stephens wheat. Higher yields were obtained in late-planted wheat because of reduced disease attack. The main diseases present during this cropping season were: leaf blotch (Septoria tritici Rob. in Desm.), stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis West.), eyespot foot rot (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides (Fron) Dei.), and <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> (Septoria nodorum (Berk.) Berk.). Early dinoseb applications increased grain yields and prevented or lowered foliar disease attack. Late applications (after the first node stage) decreased yields, probably because of phytotoxicity. However, the general crop response to application times was erratic. Experiments involving supplemental pesticides included, in addition to dinoseb, a) preplant fumigation with 50 g/m² methyl bromide (bromomethane), b) 2. 25 kg/ha phorate 0, 0 - diethyl S-[(ethylthio) methyl] phosphorodithioate preplant incorporated, c) 1. 12 kg/ha benomyl methyl 1 -[(butylamino) carbonyl]- 1 H-benzimidazol- 2 -ylcarbamate applied in February, 1984, and d) repeat applications of 0. 12 kg/ha propiconazole 1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) 4 - propyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl]- 1 -H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole at flag leaf emergence and at heading. Dinoseb increased grain yields and reduced foliar disease infection. December-applied dinoseb plus propiconazole gave the highest yields as a result of effective disease control. Methyl bromide drastically reduced yield, regardless of dinoseb application, because of lodging. Methyl bromide increased plant height and tiller number, and decreased tiller weight. It also increased eyespot attack. Benomyl was the only pesticide that reduced eyespot incidence. Phorate did not affect any of the variables studied. In the second year (1984 - 1985) experiments on dinoseb timing, dinoseb decreased foliar disease infection (primarily leaf blotch) in most cases, when applied to October-planted Stephens wheat, and yield increases were obtained with earlier applications as in the previous year. Supplemental-fungicide experiments included a) benomyl, b) propiconazole (single application when flag leaf was just visible), and c) repeat applications of 1. 12 kg/ha chlorothalonil (2, 4, 5, 6 - tetrachloro- 1, 3 -benzenedicarbonitrile) at 99...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{demand for}} {{organically}} produced food is outstripping {{the ability of}} UK farmers to supply it and the majority is imported. Furthermore, {{there is a major}} shortfall in home-produced organic cereals and cereal products, including straw. In response to this need, the consequences of increasing the area of organically produced cereal crops on pests, diseases and weeds require evaluation. Furthermore, as the area of organic cereals increases, crops may be grown more in the major cereal production regions. This could have consequences for both the organic producer and farmers growing cereals conventionally. Objectives (i) 	review the current state of knowledge on the status and distribution of pests, diseases and weeds in organic and conventionally grown cereals, (ii) 	assess the likely rate of expansion of organic cereal production and the areas where this is most likely to occur, together with any likely or consequent change in the distribution of conventionally grown cereals, (iii) 	assess the distribution of specific cereal cultivars and species in organic and non-organic production in relation to their impact on disease, pest and weed distribution. A specific sub-objective will be to assess the likely impact of the increased use of organically produced seed on seed-borne diseases, (iv) 	try to forecast whether or not the changes in cereal production will affect the current status and distribution of pests, diseases and weeds, and, if so, in which major directions, (v) 	make recommendations for future research, both to ensure that the forecast under paragraph (iii) is correct and that any negative trends are highlighted and, if possible, dealt with. Methods A literature review was undertaken to identify potential risks to conventional and organic production cereals on an extension of the organic area on risks of pests, diseases and weeds. See main report for results. Future work Monitoring of the more important pests and diseases in organic production would be prudent. Any problems for non-organic cereal producers are unlikely to arise for several years because of the small scale and slow increase of organic cereal production, but this should be regarded as a ‘grace’ period to allow for development of appropriate solutions before any potential problems become important in practice. Problems for organic producers may emerge more quickly; these need to be monitored so that cultivar and other recommendations can be developed. It is likely that the best spectrum of cultivars for non-organic and organic production will differ, which would help in restricting disease interactions between the two production systems. Any constraints on production of seed for organic cereal growing should be removed so far as possible. Development of the system of bi-cropping, both for organic and non-organic production, should be continued since there are good indications that this can restrict problems due to slugs, aphids and BYDV, septoria leaf and <b>glume</b> <b>blotch,</b> and probably take all. The importance of using disease resistant cultivars needs to be still further stressed for both organic and non-organic production. The influence of sowing date on disease development, particularly in the autumn, needs more attention. Renewed efforts to develop and introduce production of cultivar mixtures, particularly for organic cereal production, would help to restrict disease development. Fundamental studies on the biology of the major perennial weeds are still needed. Although seed spread can be minimised by frequent cutting, the effects of this on the spread of roots and rhizomes is poorly understood. It is important to maintain a regular watch or survey for indications of any increase in the key seed-borne diseases that may occur in organic cereal production and to determine the reasons for any such increase.

40|$|Septoria tritici blotch (STB), {{caused by}} Septoria tritici (teleomorph Mycosphaerella graminicola), {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases in wheat varieties worldwide, responsible for severe damage of the leaves causing yield losses between 30 and 40 %. Control of STB includes crop rotation, soil tillage, fungicide application, and cultivation of resistant varieties. Profit-making wheat growers are forced to apply narrow crop rotations under reduced tillage. Some fungicides including widely-used strobilurins are no longer effective due to mutations in the highly variable pathogen population of S. tritici. Therefore, resistance breeding using genetic mapping to identify quantitative-trait loci (QTL) associated with STB resistance provides a promising strategy for controlling the disease. The main goal of this study was to detect chromosomal regions for quantitative adult-plant resistance of winter wheat to STB. Besides this, we analyzed the genetic diversity of 24 European varieties after inoculation with four different isolates of S. tritici. Multienvironmental field trials inoculated with S. tritici were applied to test isolates and varieties and to phenotype mapping populations. In detail, the objectives were to (1) compare natural infection and inoculation, (2) evaluate genotypic variation of adult-plant resistance to STB in European varieties, (3) analyze genotype x environment (G x E) interaction, (4) evaluate and analyze phenotypic data including STB severity, heading date (HED), and plant height (PLH) of five mapping populations, (5) construct genetic linkage maps of these populations using AFLP, DArT, and SSR markers, (6) determine number, positions, and genetic effects of QTL for evaluated traits, and (7) reveal QTL regions for multiple-disease resistance within mapping populations using QTL meta-analysis. In all trials, inoculation with one to four preselected isolates was performed and STB severity was visually scored plotwise as percentage coverage of flag leaves with lesions bearing pycnidia. 24 winter wheat varieties were chosen with maximal differentiation in resistance to STB and evaluated across three years including nine environments. Five mapping populations, Florett/Biscay, Tuareg/Biscay, History/Rubens, Arina/Forno, and Solitär/Bussard, each comprising a cross of a resistant and a susceptible variety, with population sizes ranging from 81 to 316, were phenotyped across four to six environments. In parallel, 221 to 491 polymorphic genetic markers were assigned to linkage groups covering 1, 314 to 3, 305 cM of the genome. Based on these linkage maps, the number, positions, and genetic effects of QTL could be determined by composite interval mapping. Furthermore, raw data of different experiments evaluated for resistance to two other pathogens, Fusarium head blight and Stagnospora <b>glume</b> <b>blotch,</b> were used to reveal multiple-disease resistance QTL within Arina/Forno and History/Rubens populations by the software package PLABMQTL. Results of inoculated field trials coincided with not inoculated trials showing natural infection (r = 0. 84 to 0. 99, P < 0. 01), thus inoculation method was accurate to evaluate STB severity in the field. Genotypic variation between 24 varieties ranged from 8 % (Solitär) to 63 % (Rubens) flag leaf area infected. In the analysis of variance, genotypic variance had highest impact followed by G x E interaction (P < 0. 01). Therefore, environmental stability of varieties should be a major breeding goal. The varieties Solitär, History, and Florett were most stable, as revealed by a regression approach. In contrast, disease symptoms of Biscay ranged from 19 to 72 % within the three experimental years. Phenotypic data revealed significant (P < 0. 01) genotypic differentiation for STB, HED, and PLH within all five mapping populations and between the parents. Entry-mean heritabilities (h²) ranged from 0. 69 to 0. 87 for STB, the only exception was Tuareg/Biscay (h² = 0. 38). For HED (h² = 0. 78 to 0. 93) and PLH (h² = 0. 92 to 0. 98) heritabilities were high. All correlations between STB and HED (r = - 0. 18 to - 0. 33) as well as between STB and PLH (r = - 0. 13 to - 0. 45) were negative and moderate. The exception was History/Rubens which is segregating at the Rht-D 1 locus showing considerably higher correlation between STB and PLH (r = - 0. 55, P < 0. 01). The five mapping populations showed a wide and continuous distribution of mean STB severity averaged across three to six environments in field trials at adult-plant stage. In QTL analysis, one to nine, zero to nine, and four to eleven QTL were detected for STB, HED, and PLH, respectively, across five wheat populations using composite interval mapping. One to two major QTL for resistance to STB were detected consistently across environments in each population (QStb. lsa_fb- 3 B, QStb. lsa_fb- 6 D, QStb. lsa_tb- 4 B, QStb. lsa_tb- 6 B, QStb. lsa_hr- 4 D, QStb. lsa_hr- 5 B. 1, QStb. lsa_af- 3 B, QStb. lsa_bs- 7 A) explaining more than 10 % of normalized adjusted phenotypic variance. Altogether, resistance QTL explained 14 to 55 % of adjusted phenotypic variance. Both parents contributed resistant alleles. Major QTL, however, were all from the resistant parent. QTL meta-analysis revealed each of four loci for multiple-disease resistance located on chromosomes 3 B, 4 B, 5 B, and 6 D in Arina/Forno, and on chromosomes 2 B, 4 D, 5 B, and 7 B in History/Rubens. The most effective meta QTL was on chromosome 4 D in History/Rubens closely linked to Rht-D 1. The resistance allele from History reduced disease severity by 9. 8 % for STB and 6. 3 % for FHB, thus explaining 47 % and 60 % of partial phenotypic variance. In general, European wheat varieties showed a wide range of genotypic variation for STB resistance useful for breeding. Although the influence of environment and G x E interaction was high, some resistant varieties which were stable across multiple environments were found (Solitär, History, Florett). Genomic regions associated with STB resistance were mapped across 13 out of 21 wheat chromosomes. Together with the continuous distribution of five segregating populations for flag leaf infection, it can be concluded that the adult-plant resistance to S. tritici was inherited quantitatively depending on several loci explaining part of phenotypic variance. QTL meta-analysis across three severe pathogens, including Fusarium head blight, Stagnospora <b>glume</b> <b>blotch,</b> and STB, within two populations revealed eight loci for multiple-disease resistance with closely linked markers applicable in resistance breeding. Combining detected major QTL as well as meta QTL in present breeding material by applying marker-assisted selection seems a promising approach to the breeding of varieties with improved resistance to Septoria tritici blotch, Fusarium head blight, and Stagnospora <b>glume</b> <b>blotch.</b> Die Septoria-Blattdürre (Septoria tritici blotch, STB) des Weizens wird durch den Erreger Septoria tritici (teleomorph Mycosphaerella graminicola) verursacht. Die gefährliche Blattkrankheit hat in den Weizenanbaugebieten der gemäßigten Breiten weltweit große Bedeutung und führt zu Ertragsverlusten zwischen 30 und 40 %. Das Befallsrisiko kann durch Fruchtfolgegestaltung, Bodenbearbeitung, Fungizidapplikation und den Anbau resistenter Sorten verringert werden. Um Kosten zu reduzieren und das Betriebseinkommen zu steigern, sind Landwirte gezwungen, Weizen in engen Fruchtfolgen mit reduzierter Bodenbearbeitung anzubauen. Die als Fungizid weit verbreiteten Strobilurine haben aufgrund von Mutationen in der sehr anpassungsfähigen Pathogenpopulation von S. tritici ihre Wirkung verloren. Die Resistenzzüchtung liefert durch die Anwendung der genetischen Kartierung zur Lokalisierung quantitativ vererbter Resistenzloci (sog. QTL) einen vielversprechenden Ansatz zur Kontrolle der Septoria-Blattdürre bei Weizen. Im Vordergrund dieser Studie stand die Lokalisation chromosomaler Regionen für die quantitativ vererbte Adultpflanzenresistenz von Weizen gegen STB. Außerdem wurde die genetische Diversität von 24 europäischen Sorten nach Inokulation mit vier verschiedenen S. tritici-Isolaten untersucht. Es wurden Feldversuche in mehreren Umwelten mit ein bis vier ausgewählten S. tritici-Isolaten inokuliert, um Isolate und Sorten zu testen und um Kartierungspopulationen zu phänotypisieren. Diese Isolate wurden so ausgewählt, dass sie nur Adultpflanzenresistenz entdecken. Die Ziele waren im Einzelnen (1) den Krankheitsbefall bei natürlicher Infektion und nach Inokulation zu vergleichen, (2) die genetische Variation für Adultpflanzenresistenz gegen STB in europäischen Sorten zu untersuchen, (3) die Genotyp x Umwelt (G x U) -Interaktion zu analysieren, (4) die phänotypischen Merkmale STB-Befall, Ährenschieben (AES) und Wuchshöhe (WUH) von fünf Kartierungspopulationen zu erheben und varianzanalytisch auszuwerten, (5) genetische Kopplungskarten dieser Populationen mit AFLP, DArT und SSR Markern zu erstellen, (6) Anzahl, Position und die genetischen Effekte der QTL für die erhobenen Merkmale zu bestimmen und (7) Genomregionen für multiple Krankheitsresistenz innerhalb der Kartierungspopulationen mit Hilfe einer QTL Meta-Analyse zu entdecken. In allen Feldversuchen wurde nach der Inokulation der prozentuale Krankheitsbefall mit STB auf dem Fahnenblatt im Mittel über die Parzelle visuell erfasst. 24 Weizensorten, die sich in der Resistenz gegen STB unterscheiden, wurden über drei Jahre in neun Umwelten angebaut. Fünf Kartierungspopulationen, Florett/Biscay, Tuareg/Biscay, History/Rubens, Arina/Forno und Solitär/Bussard, jeweils Kreuzungen aus einer resistenten und einer anfälligen Sorte mit Populationsgrößen zwischen 81 und 316 Genotypen wurden in vier bis sechs Umwelten phänotypisiert. Parallel wurden je Population 221 bis 491 polymorphe Marker den einzelnen Kopplungsgruppen zugeordnet. Die entstandenen genetischen Karten hatten eine Genomabdeckung von 1. 314 bis 3. 305 cM. Auf der Grundlage dieser genetischen Karten konnten die Anzahl, die Positionen und die genetischen Effekte der QTL für die erhobenen Merkmale bestimmt werden. Hierzu wurde das Verfahren der Intervallkartierung unter Einbeziehung von Kofaktoren verwendet. Darüber hinaus wurden die ursprünglichen Daten aus anderen Feldexperimenten zur Untersuchung der Resistenz gegen zwei weitere bedeutende Krankheitserreger, Ährenfusarium und Spelzenbräune, verwendet, um QTL für multiple Krankheitsresistenz innerhalb der Populationen Arina/Forno und History/Rubens zu entdecken. Die Ergebnisse der inokulierten Parzellen stimmten gut mit den Boniturwerten in natürlich infizierten Parzellen überein (r = 0, 84 bis 0, 99, P < 0, 01). Daraus lässt sich schließen, dass die eingesetzte Inokulationsmethodik geeignet war, um den Befall mit STB im Feld auch unter ungünstigen Bedingungen zu gewährleisten und eine ähnliche Differenzierung der Weizensorten wie in der Praxis zu ermöglichen. Zwischen den 24 Weizensorten variierte die infizierte Fahnenblattfläche von 8 % (Solitär) bis 63 % (Rubens) im Mittel über neun Umwelten. Die Varianzanalyse ergab einen hoch signifikanten (P < 0, 01) Effekt des Genotyps und der G x U-Interaktion. Aus diesem Grund ist die Umweltstabilität der Sorten ein wichtiges Zuchtziel. In einem Regressionsansatz zeigten die Sorten Solitär, History und Florett die höchste Umweltstabilität. Im Gegensatz dazu schwankte der Befall der Sorte Biscay zwischen 19 und 72 % innerhalb der Umwelten über drei Versuchsjahre. Die varianzanalytische Auswertung der phänotypischen Daten ergab sowohl innerhalb der fünf Kartierungspopulationen als auch zwischen deren Eltern eine hoch signifikante (P < 0, 01) genotypische Differenzierung für alle drei Merkmale STB, AES und WUH. Die Heritabiltät (h²) für STB lag zwischen 0, 69 und 0, 87, außer bei Tuareg/Biscay (h² = 0, 38). Die Heritabilitäten für AES (h² = 0, 78 bis 0, 93) und WUH (h² = 0, 92 bis 0, 98) waren in allen Populationen sehr hoch. Die Korrelationen zwischen STB und AES (r = - 0, 18 bis - 0, 33) als auch zwischen STB und WUH (r = - 0, 13 bis - 0, 45) waren negativ und signifikant (P < 0, 01), aber von geringer Bedeutung. Die einzige Ausnahme war die Population History/Rubens, die am für die Wuchshöhe relevanten Rht-D 1 -Locus aufspaltet und deshalb eine deutlich höhere signifikant negative Korrelation zwischen STB und WUH aufwies (r = - 0, 55, P < 0, 01). Alle fünf Kartierungspopulationen zeigten im Adultpflanzenstadium eine breite und kontinuierliche Häufigkeitsverteilung der Befallsmittelwerte aus Feldversuchen in drei bis sechs Umwelten. In der QTL-Analyse wurden in den fünf Weizenpopulationen für die drei Merkmale STB, AES und WUH ein bis neun, null bis neun und vier bis elf QTL detektiert. Für die Resistenz gegen STB wurden in jeder Population ein bis zwei Major-QTL kartiert (QStb. lsa_fb- 3 B, QStb. lsa_fb- 6 D, QStb. lsa_tb- 4 B, QStb. lsa_tb- 6 B, QStb. lsa_hr- 4 D, QStb. lsa_hr- 5 B. 1, QStb. lsa_af- 3 B, QStb. lsa_bs- 7 A), die jeweils mehr als 10 % der normalisierten adjustierten phänotypischen Varianz erklärten. Insgesamt erklärten alle 26 gefundenen Resistenz QTL zusammen 14 bis 55 % der adjustierten phänotypischen Varianz in den fünf Populationen. Resistenzallele stammten vom resistenten aber auch vom anfälligen Elter, während sie bei den gefundenen Major-QTL alle vom resistenten Elter kamen. Die abschließende Meta-Analyse entdeckte acht Loci für multiple Krankheitsresistenz, vier in Arina/Forno auf den Chromosomen 3 B, 4 B, 5 B und 6 D, sowie vier in History/Rubens auf den Chromosomen 2 B, 4 D, 5 B und 7 B. Den mit Abstand größten Effekt zeigte der Meta-QTL auf Chromosom 4 D in History/Rubens, der eng gekoppelt ist mit Rht-D 1. Die Resistenz von History reduziert sowohl den Fahnenblattbefall mit STB um 9, 8 % als auch den Ährenbefall mit Fusarium um 6, 3 % und erklärt damit jeweils 47 % bzw. 60 % der partiellen phänotypischen Varianz. Die Studie hat gezeigt, dass in europäischen Weizensorten eine für die Züchtung nutzbare, breite genetische Variation für die Resistenz gegen STB vorhanden ist. Obwohl der Einfluss der Umwelt als auch die G x U-Interaktion bedeutend waren, wurden einige resistente Sorten mit hoher Umweltstabilität gefunden (Solitär, History, Florett). Auf 13 von 21 Chromosomen des Weizens wurden QTL für die Resistenz gegen STB kartiert. Die kontinuierliche Häufigkeitsverteilung des Fahnenblattbefalls in allen fünf segregierenden Populationen zusammen mit der großen Anzahl von 26 gefundenen QTL lässt darauf schließen, dass die Adultpflanzenresistenz gegen S. tritici quantitativ vererbt wird. Die hier vorgestellte QTL-Meta-Analyse innerhalb zweier Kartierungspopulationen über die drei bedeutenden Pathogene Ährenfusarium, Spelzenbräune und STB konnte acht Loci mit eng gekoppelten Markern für multiple Krankheitsresistenz detektieren. Ein vielversprechender Ansatz in der Resistenzzüchtung ist die Anwendung der markergestützen Selektion. Dadurch ist es möglich sowohl die gefundenen Major-QTL als auch die Meta-QTL im Zuchtmaterial zu kombinieren und somit neue Sorten mit verbesserter Resistenz gegenüber Septoria-Blattdürre, Ährenfusarium und Spelzenbräune zu züchten...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the systemic fungicides in the sixties, the phenomenon of resistance to these compounds has become a serious problem in the control of fungal plant diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} contribute to the knowledge about the consequences of fungicide applications in cereals with respect to the emergence of fungicide resistant strains of Septorianodorum, the causal agent of <b>glume</b> <b>blotch</b> of wheat, and of Cercosporellaherpotrichoides, the causal agent of eyespot of wheat, barley and rye. CHAPTER 3. An accurate and reproducible inoculation method was used to inoculate wheat seedlings with spore suspensions of S. nodorum. The effect of postinfectional applications of the systemic fungicides carbendazim and edifenphos with respect to the development of symptoms and the length of the latent period was studied. Both fungicides suppressed the development of symptoms and elongated the duration of the latent period, the extent to which depending on the concentration of each fungicide used. CHAPTER 4. It is suggested that alternate or combined use of two systemic fungicides with a different mode of action can reduce the enrichment of specific resistant forms in a fungal population. To verify these statements, model experiments were carried out under controlled conditions. During 9 passages on living wheat plants, inoculated with spore suspensions of S. nodorum, the fungicides carbendazim and edifenphos were applied either alone or as a mixture in each passage, or applied alternately from passage to passage. After 9 passages, disease control by either fungicide alone was reduced. This tendency was not so pronounced in that variant where the fungicides were applied alternately and nearly absent in that variant where a mixture was applied. Comparable results were obtained in experiments on agar media. A stable edifenphos resistant strain was selected in that variant, where S. nodorum in each passage was cultured on plates with edifenphos. With C. herpotrichoides, experiments were carried out on agar media only, using carbendazim and nuarimol. Here, a strong effect of the alternate exposure of the fungus to these two compounds was present. since the fungus was hardly able to grow on plates with a moderate dosis of carbendazim, after first being cultured on plates with nuarimol. CHAPTER 5. The effect of field applications of thiophanate methyl and edifenphos on the frequency of resistant spores in field isolates of S. nodorum was examined, during five vegetation periods between 1973 and 1977. Two types of carbendazim resistant strains were present in S. nodorum. Weakly carbendazim resistant strains were inhibited at 5 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro and occured at a frequency of about 1 : 7 x 10 6 in populations from unsprayed plots. Highly carbendazim resistant strains occurred at a frequency of about 100 times that low and were hardly inhibited at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. In each year, there was a significant increase in the frequency of weakly carbendazim resistant spores after thiophanate methyl applications in the field. but the absolute figures remained rather low. In no case, an isolate with more than 1 : 10 4 weakly resistant spores was found. There was no clear yearly increase in the frequency of highly carbendazim resistant spores after thiophanate methyl application. Edifenphos resistant spores were present in field isolates of S. nodorum. Their frequency- about 1 : 10 7 in isolates from unsprayed plots-, increased significantly after edifenphos application in the field, but the absolute figures remained rather low. During three years, field trials were carried out with C. herpotrichoides to examine the effect of carbendazim application in the field on the frequency of carbendazim resistant spores in field isolates. Their frequency in isolates from unsprayed plots was about 1 : 7 x 10 8 . This frequency increased after carbendazim applications, but mostly on an insignificant scale only. CHAPTER 6. Fungicide sensitive and resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with respect to their mycelial growth rate, their sporulation capacity and their pathogenicity on agar medium and/or living wheat plants. Weakly carbendazim resistant strains showed a significantly faster mycelial growth on agar media with carbendazim, than sensitive ones, but were almost completely inhibited at 5 μg/ml carbendazim. This growth reduction was accompaniedby an increase in the number of spores, produced per mm 2 mycelium. Highly carbendazim resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. Resistant strians were present with a mycelial growth and spore production equal to that of sensitive ones. Pathogenicity tests with sensitive and highly carbendazim resistant strains on living wheat plants showed the same tendency, as far as the development of symptoms and sporeproduction is concerned. Edifenphos resistant strains of S. nodorum were compared with sensitive ones in tests on agar media and on wheat plants. Resistant strains were strongly inhibited at 200 μg/ml edifenphos in vitro. Edifenphos resistant strains were present with an equal fitness as sensitive ones, when grown in the absence of edifenphos, on agar media and on living wheat plants. The tests with C. herpotrichoides were performed with sensitive mother strains and the corresponding carbendazim. resistant daughter strains. These resistant strains were able to grow and produce spores even at 1000 μg/ml carbendazim in vitro. They produced more spores per mm 2 mycelium when cultured in the presence of carbendazim than in its absence. The properties of carbendazim resistant strains in vitro and in vivo did not differ very much from those of sensitive strains, in the absence of the fungicide. CHAPTER 7. The competitive ability of resistant strains was studied by inoculating wheat plants with different mixtures of resistant and sensitive spores. Carbendazim resistant strains of S. nodorum and C. herpotrichoides could maintain themselves in the mixed population for three passages on wheat plants, even in the absence of any fungicide selection pressure. In case of a postinfectional fungicide application, only carbendazim resistant strains could be reisolated. Edifenphos resistant strains disappeared from the respective populations in the absence of the fungicide, due to a smaller relative reproduction ratio...|$|E
40|$|A partir de 4 rétrocroisements réciproques réalisés avec les variétés de blé tendre « Carala » et « Roazon », une sélection pour la résistance {{partielle}} à Septoria nodorum Berk. a été opérée en prenant en compte, {{in vitro}} et au champ, la durée d’incubation (L. P. I) et, in vitro, la vitesse d’extension des nécroses (P. max). Pour chaque back-cross, 2 lignées se distinguant par la valeur de la durée d’incubation ont été retenues; une lignée L à longue L. P. I. et une lignée R à courte L. P. I. Pour chacune de ces lignées, 4 microparcelles ont été réalisées afin de juger, au champ, de la vitesse de progression de la surface foliaire malade, la contamination étant faite, d’une part, avant épiaison, d’autre part, à l’épiaison. Le poids des grains a été mesuré et comparé à celui de parcelles témoins. Une appréciation de L. P. I. et de P. max a été faite in vitro sur feuilles en survie. Toute augmentation de L. P. I. se traduit par une diminution de P. max et inversement; ces 2 paramètres sont indépendants de la longueur des tiges. Les progressions des diverses épidémies s’expliquent en grande partie par la combinaison de ces 2 paramètres. Le poids relatif des grains par rapport aux témoins varie avec les lignées pour les 2 dates de contamination et, pour juger de la résistance à S. nodorum, il faut, en plus du critère « baisse relative du poids de grains après contamination à l’épiaison », tenir compte de la vitesse de progression de la maladie sur les feuilles. Il apparaît possible d’opérer in vitro, sur feuilles maintenues en survie, une sélection sur L. P. I. et sur P. max. La vitesse d’apparition des symptômes sur épis est inverse de la vitesse d’extension de la surface foliaire malade. En outre, un effet cytoplasmique semble se manifester {{au niveau de}} l’expression de P. max et donc de la progression des épidémies. Le critère de fontes de semis permet de confirmer les niveaux de résistance obtenus. Four reciprocal backcrosses were obtained in 1978 between the susceptible cultivar « Roazon » and the resistant cultivar « Carala », the former being on the cytoplasm of Aegilops ventricosa Tausch. From each backcross two lines were selected, one with a short incubation time or LPI (R line), the other with a long one (L line). These eight lines and the two parents were grown in Versailles during the 1981 - 1982 season on small plots with four replications. The first replication {{was used as the}} check (T), the second (plots A. EPI) was infected with a suspension of spores before the heading stage, and the third (plots EPI) at the heading stage. On each plant of these three replications the following characters were scored : length of stem (H), thousand kernel weight (TKW) and number of seeds per ear (NSE). On the second and third replications the diseased area was evaluated regularly. On the fourth replication which was kept uninfected, small leaf fragments were collected and set on benzimidazole medium in controlled conditions. Two parameters were obtained after four and six days respectively : LPI as the percentage of visible symptoms and Pmax as the average length of the necrotic area. In all the calculations these parameters have been transformed respectively into Arc sin LPI and (2 Pmax) to avoid bias in the variances. Disease progress on the foliage in the field was characterized on replications 2 & 3 by two parameters : - the area S limited by the curve Y = (formula see attached document) (Y being diseased leaf area) and by the abcissa, where x is biological time tB in accordance with the SHEARER and ZADOKS formula for the latent period (see diagrams 4 A, 4 B, 5 A, 5 B), - the slope sr of the regression lines between tB and Log (formula see attached document). Under controlled conditions, significant differences between lines were observed for LPI and Pmax. A highly significant correlation coefficient was found (table 3) between LPI and Pmax (r = 0. 79) in 1982. The same was true for the pooled observations of 1981 and 1982 (r = 0. 87). Depending of both these parameters the best lines were L 12, L 22, R 67. In the field, the check plots showed no significant correlation between H or TKW and LPI or Pmax values. The TKW values were higher for L than for R lines. In the A. EPI plots, significant differences were observed between lines for S (table 3) and sr (table 9). The correlation coefficient between S and Pmax (table 3) was highly significant (r = 0. 88). TKW values of these plots were partially explained by LPI, Pmax and TKW values of the check plots (multiple correlation coefficient r = 0. 87). The relative reduction of TKW (RTKW) was partially explained by LPI and Pmax (multiple correlation coefficient r = 0. 83). The percentages of contaminated seeds was significantly correlated with Pmax (r = 0. 83) and with S (r = 0. 88). The seedling test confirmed the value of the lines L 12, L 22 et R 62. In EPI plots, significant differences were also observed between lines for S (table 3) and sr (table 10). There were significant correlations between S and LPI (r = 0. 74), Pmax (r = 0. 87) or H (r = - 0. 76). But for H the correlation coefficient was different according to cytoplasm (table 11). The only significant correlation for TKW was with TKW from the check plots. RTKW was partially explained by LPI, Pmax and H (multiple correlation coefficient r = 0. 84). The best line was L 22 with a RTKW value of 0. 95. On the ears the symptoms spread in the opposite way to that on foliage, their appearance being faster for the L than for the R lines. The effect of artificial infection in the field depended to a large extent on the growth stage of the plants at infection. This was particularly true for the relation between H and S. The parameters LPI and Pmax obtained under controlled conditions were good predictors of epidemic development in the field; under natural condition, a slow progression of the disease on the leaves involves a low reduction of yield. Three of the lines selected in these backcrosses accordingly seemed resistant enough to avoid consistent losses of yield. Moreover a cytoplasmic effect was detected on the relation between Pmax and the development of disease on leaves (fig. 8). Finally a combination of tests under controlled conditions and in the field is suggested in breeding for partial resistance to <b>glume</b> <b>blotch...</b>|$|E
