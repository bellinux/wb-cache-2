40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I study why {{companies}} give electoral donations to support political leaders. I collected {{and used a}} unique data set on electoral financing at the corporate level in Colombia. The data show that firms consider electoral contributions to be ‘legal bribes’.

These features suggest ‘legal neutralization’: donors can break the law without committing crime...|$|R

50|$|Mario Caluori was {{a member}} of the Parti des travailleurs du Québec (Workers Party) and {{attempted}} to run under its banner in the 1985 election.

5000|$|In {{the midst}} of the 1992 general {{election}} campaign, on 24 March, Labour ran a Party Election Broadcast about a five-year-old girl with glue ear who waited a year for the simple operation to insert vents. This case was contrasted with the ability of those able to afford private treatment - which had been granted tax breaks by the Conservatives - to get treatment quickly. The party hoped to highlight what it saw as the mismanagement and underfunding of the National Health Service (NHS) under the Conservative government. Labour leader Neil Kinnock employed the slogan: [...] "If you want to vote Conservative, don't fall ill".
