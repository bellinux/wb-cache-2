5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> of 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E

40|$|A few simply-stated rules {{govern the}} {{entanglement}} patterns {{that can occur}} in mutually unbiased basis sets (MUBs), and constrain the combinations of such patterns that can coexist (ie, the stoichiometry) in <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> of p^N+ 1 MUBs. We consider Hilbert spaces of prime power dimension (as realized by systems of N prime-state particles, or qupits), where <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> are known to exist, and we assume only that MUBs are eigenbases of generalized Pauli operators, without using a particular construction. The general rules include the following: 1) In any MUB, a particular qupit appears either in a pure state, or totally entangled, and 2) in any <b>full</b> MUB <b>complement,</b> each qupit is pure in p+ 1 bases (not necessarily the same ones), and totally entangled in the remaining p^N-p. It follows that {{the maximum number of}} product bases is p+ 1, and when this number is realized, all remaining p^N-p bases in the complement are characterized by the total entanglement of every qupit. This "standard distribution" is inescapable for two qupits (of any p), where only product and generalized Bell bases are admissible MUB types. This and the following results generalize previous results for qubits and qutrits. With three qupits there are three MUB types, and a number of combinations (p+ 2) are possible in <b>full</b> <b>complements.</b> With N= 4, there are 6 MUB types for p= 2, but new MUB types become possible with larger p, and these are essential to the realization of <b>full</b> <b>complements.</b> With this example, we argue that new MUB types, showing new entanglement characteristics, should enter with every step in N, and when N is a prime plus 1, also at critical p values, p=N- 1. Such MUBs should play critical roles in filling complements. Comment: 27 pages, one figure, to be submitted to Physical Revie...|$|R

5|$|At {{the landing}} zones, Brigadier Hicks was {{informed}} that in Urquhart's and Lathbury's absence, he was acting divisional commander. He was also told to send one of his units—the South Staffordshires (which was not complete and was awaiting its <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> {{of men in the}} second lift)—to Arnhem to help with the advance to the bridge. The South Staffords departed in the morning and linked up with the 1st Parachute Battalion in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months, the wing was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units who were in possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> of aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E

Around this time, II./JG 1 had moved to airfield at Marienehe and also started taking delivery of the He 162. These new jet aircraft would never see widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots, aircraft and fuel. JG 1 could no longer field their <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> or effectively fly operations as required.|$|E

5|$|The frigate Thétis, {{stationed}} to {{the south}} of Brest at Lorient, was selected to carry supplies to Martinique and given a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> of 330 men, 40 cannon and a new captain, Jacques Pinsum. Supplies were loaded, including over 1,000 barrels of flour and 106 soldiers to reinforce the garrison at Martinique. Secrecy was tight: to prevent the British discovering Thétis mission, even the local shore defences were not informed of the frigate's departure early on 10 November 1808.|$|E

For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the team {{departed}} for Australia in late March they had played 74 matches in Britain, winning 49, losing 20, and drawing 5. However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast David Gage featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick {{was not the only}} player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently struggled to find a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> of 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there – a conversion against Devon.|$|E

Furious was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for King George VI. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the Munich Crisis in September 1938, she embarked Nos. 801, 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow, before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.|$|E

40|$|Keratin 5 (K 5) mRNA {{and protein}} are {{shown to be}} {{expressed}} in normal mammary epithelial cells in culture and are absent from tumor-derived cell lines. To extend these findings, the <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> of keratins in normal, immortalized, and tumor cells were compared. It is shown here that normal cells produce keratins K 5, K 6, K 7, K 14, and K 17, whereas tumor cells produce mainly keratins K 8, K 18, and K 19. In immortalized cells, which are preneoplastic or partially transformed, the levels of K 5 mRNA and protein are lower than in normal cells, whereas the amount of K 18 is increased. Thus, K 5 is an important marker in the tumorigenic process, distinguishing normal from tumor cells, and decreased K 5 expression correlates with tumorigenic progression...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the deterioration of the}} warships, decades of peace along the coast had relegated the military to a low importance, and garrisons became severely understaffed due to desertion. By the early 1550s these garrisons were reduced to roughly one third of their <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> of soldiers. During the wokou crisis, defenders had to augment their forces with various militia and mercenary groups like gentry guards, local ruffians, and even Shaolin monks. The Ming government, being committed to the northern frontier defence against the Mongols, could only spare reinforcements to the coast in the form of bandit fighters, ex-pirates, and aboriginal [...] "wolf troops" [...] (狼兵, langbing) led by government-recognized tribal headmen. These assorted troops, euphemistically called [...] "guest troops" [...] (客兵, kebing), were generally ineffective in battle, and were often a burden to the local populace.|$|R

In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of mechanized and tank divisions included two artillery battalions, one multiple rocket launcher battalion, and one surface-to-surface missile battalion.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{each person}} was {{determined}} by how many divine generals they had at their disposal, and {{by the number of}} divine scriptures they had obtained.

40|$|SummaryOne of {{the reasons}} that the {{crystalline}} lenses of vertebrate eyes are highly transparent {{is that most of the}} cells have broken down all of their organelles, including the nuclei.

Only in the peripheral layers—in the cichlid fish Aequidens pulcher, beyond 92 % of the lens radius—are there cells with <b>full</b> <b>complements</b> of organelles. We report here that the optical properties of the lens change between the light-adapted and dark-adapted states in A. pulcher. Changes occur even in cell layers free of organelles, and they occur in parallel with changes in retinal function between the light-adapted (all-cone, color vision) and dark-adapted (all-rod, grayscale vision) states. Depleting the eye of dopamine also caused changes in the optical properties similar to those of dark adaptation. Our results indicate that the refractive index of the organelle-free lens fiber cells can be adjusted quickly and accurately...|$|R

5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents.

All three ships were crewed by a <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> of experienced sailors drawn from the pool of unemployed men stranded in Île de France by the British blockade. This force was followed a month later by the similarly sized frigate Bellone. Hamelin's early cruises were successful: operating initially off the Nicobar Islands, Vénus captured the HEIC armed ship Orient on 26 July. After this however, targets became scarcer and despite the capture {{of a number of}} small merchant vessels, Hamelin was forced to take his squadron further east and south to find British shipping to attack.
