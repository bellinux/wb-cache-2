5000|$|A <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> knot is {{a family}} of knots which are used for adding weight {{to the end of}} a rope, to make the rope easier to throw. In {{nautical}} use, a <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> knot is often tied {{to the end of a}} messenger line, which is then used for pulling a larger rope, such as a hawser. There are several distinct knots which all share the common name, <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> knot. [...] The monkey fist is a well-known <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> knot.|$|E
50|$|The <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> bend {{is similar}} to the sheet bend and the racking bend, and may be used to pass a thick rope to a distant {{receiver}} by first throwing the end of a thinner rope which may be weighted with a monkey fist or a <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> knot.|$|E

25|$|Mooring {{requires}} {{cooperation between}} {{people on a}} pier and on a vessel. Heavy mooring lines are often passed from larger vessels to people on a mooring by smaller, weighted <b>heaving</b> <b>lines.</b> Once a mooring line {{is attached to a}} bollard, it is pulled tight. Large ships generally tighten their mooring lines using heavy machinery called mooring winches or capstans.|$|R

The shark, finding that it was receiving no hurt, had become bolder. Several times it nearly got me, but each time Otoo was there just the moment {{before it was too}} late. Of course, Otoo could have saved himself any time. But he stuck by me.|$|R
25|$|Preparation for the patrols {{began in}} November, {{with all the}} ship's equipment, {{including}} masts, sails, rigging, boats, tackle, steering gear, pumps etc. being carefully inspected and repaired or renewed where necessary. New towing hawsers and <b>heaving</b> <b>lines</b> would also be procured. The ship would additionally be fitted over the cutwater with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of an inch thick and extending 18inches {{above and below the}} waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains. Officers would discard their normal uniforms in preference for reefer jackets, fur cap and gloves.|$|R
5000|$|It {{serves a}} {{somewhat}} similar purpose as a Sheet bend, a Double sheet bend or a <b>Heaving</b> <b>line</b> bend, {{and may be}} used to throw a thick line over {{with the help of a}} thinner line at the end of which there may be a weight such as a Monkey fist or a <b>Heaving</b> <b>line</b> knot.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{hearing that}} Hood had sunk, Electra {{raced to the}} area, {{arriving}} about 2 hours after Hood went down. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and <b>heaving</b> <b>lines,</b> and placed life belts on the deck {{where they could be}} quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 ratings aboard Hood, just three survivors were found. Electra rescued them, and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, Icarus and Anthony joined in the search, and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more were found, only driftwood, debris, and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area.|$|R

50|$|Electra and {{the other}} destroyers were about 60 mi away at the time. Upon hearing that Hood had sunk, Electra raced to the area, {{arriving}} about two hours after Hood went under. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and <b>heaving</b> <b>lines,</b> and placed life belts on the deck {{where they could be}} quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 enlisted men who were aboard Hood, only three survivors were found. Electra rescued these survivors, and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, Icarus and Anthony joined in and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more were found, only driftwood, debris, and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area.|$|R
50|$|The <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> bend is a knot for {{securely}} joining two {{ropes of}} different diameter or rigidity. It {{is often used}} to affix playing strings to the thick silk eyes of an anchorage knot in some stringed instruments. In nautical use, the <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> bend is used to connect a lighter messenger line to a hawser when mooring ships. It is knot number 1463 in The Ashley Book of Knots, and appeared in the 1916 Swedish knot manual Om Knutar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> bend is {{tied the}} same way as the sheet bend with one difference: the final {{crossing}} of the thin end is done in the opposite direction, so the thin end points away from the thin line, essentially in the same direction as the thick end, towards the thick line. This avoid jamming when the thin line is pulled to carry the thick end over a distance where hands can not reach.|$|E
5000|$|A simpler knot {{to use as}} weight while {{throwing}} a rope is <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> knot [...] tied using the same 3 step method as a monkeys fist but with only one turn (light version) or {{one and a half}} turns (heavier version) in the first step, most of the rope weight provided by the turns at the second step, and as third step threading the end through the nearest bight pinched by the turns at the second step and tightening.|$|E

50|$|The monkey's fist knot is {{most often}} used as the weight in a <b>heaving</b> <b>line.</b> The line would have the monkey's fist on one end, an eye splice or bowline on the other, with about 30 feet (~10 metres) of line between. A {{lightweight}} feeder line would be tied to the bowline, then the weighted monkey's fist could be hurled between ship and dock. The {{other end of the}} lightweight line would be attached to a heavier-weight line, allowing it to be drawn to the target easily.|$|E
50|$|With {{the arrival}} on {{scene of the}} anchor {{handling}} vessel Star Sirius, {{it was decided to}} attempt to establish a tow. The master and some personnel were taken out by helicopter and were put back on board the vessel. Efforts to attach a <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> were unsuccessful, and at 11:19 the vessel was confirmed as being grounded at Garths Ness, with oil being seen to flow out into the sea from the moment of impact. At this time, the would-be rescue team were rescued by the helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|The single-strand stopper knot is...variety of knob knots. Generally it is tied as a {{terminal}} knot {{in the end}} of a rope, where it forms a knob or bunch, the general purpose of which is to prevent unreeving. It is found in the ends of running rigging. It secures the end of a sewing thread; it provides a handhold or a foothold in bell ropes and footropes. It adds weight {{to the end of a}} <b>heaving</b> <b>line,</b> and it is often employed decoratively, but it should not be used to prevent unlaying and fraying except in small cord, twine, and the like, as a whippingis in every way preferable for large and valuable material.

50|$|At about 0535, the German {{forces were}} sighted by Hood and, shortly after, the Germans sighted the British ships. Firing {{commenced}} at 0552. At 0601, Hood took a 38 cm (15-inch) shell from Bismarck in the after magazine, which caused a massive explosion, sinking the ship within two minutes. Electra and other destroyers were about 60 nmi km {{away at the}} time. Upon hearing that Hood had sunk, Electra raced to the area, arriving about two hours after Hood went down. They were expecting to find many survivors, prepared hot coffee and rum, set up the medical facilities for the casualties, rigged scrambling nets and <b>heaving</b> <b>lines,</b> and placed life belts on the deck {{where they could be}} quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 enlisted men who were aboard Hood, only 3 survivors were found. Electra rescued these three and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, Icarus and Anthony joined in the search and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more survivors were found, only driftwood, debris, clothing, personal effects, broken rafts and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area. With the sea as cold as it was, survival in the water was measured in minutes. There was little probability that anyone was left alive in the water. (See Battle of the Denmark Strait).|$|R
50|$|Keeper Hanna again {{threw his}} line {{and watched it}} land on the schooner. One of the seamen managed to reach it and bent it around his waist. Then he jumped into {{the sea and the}} keeper, with great effort, pulled him up over the rocky ledge. The keeper now <b>heaved</b> the <b>line</b> a second time and finally it reached the second seaman who wound it around his icy body. Then he too jumped into the ocean. Just as the keeper’s {{strength}} was exhausted in trying to haul ashore the second man, help came {{in the shape of the}} keeper’s assistant and two neighbors, who helped haul the man to safety.|$|R

50|$|A monkey's fist {{can be used}} on two ends of a tow {{lines of}} one side a fish net which is then thrown from one trawler to another, {{allowing}} the net to be cast and set between two boats so the trawl can be used between the two, in pair trawling where the tow or catch is negotiated between both parties. This makes it easier to catch fish given the greater surface area between both boats to turn around and catch missed fish from the sea much more quickly. Once all fish have been hauled up from the sea, tow lines of the fish net is returned by way of thrown both monkey's fists back to the host trawler. Alternatively, a monkey fist {{can be used as a}} weight of a <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> thrown to over to an opposing ship to bring two ships together.|$|E
5000|$|Iolaire was {{carrying}} sailors {{who had fought}} in the First World War back to the Scottish island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. She left the port of Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland late {{on the evening of}} 31 December 1918. At 2:30 a.m. on New Year's Day, as the ship approached the port of Stornoway, a few yards offshore and a mile away from the safety of Stornoway Harbour, she hit the infamous rocks [...] "The Beasts of Holm" [...] and sank. The death toll was officially put at 205, of whom 181 men were islanders but as the ship was badly overcrowded and {{there was a lack of}} proper records, the toll could have been slightly higher. John F. Macleod from Ness, Isle of Lewis, saved 40 lives, swimming ashore with a <b>heaving</b> <b>line,</b> along which many of the survivors made their way to safety. Only 75 of the 280 (officially known) passengers survived the disaster; 73 percent of the people on the yacht perished in the incident.|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{consequences}} of imposing a volume constraint on the maximum power that can be absorbed from progressive regular incident waves by an attenuating line absorber heaving in a travelling wave mode. Under assumptions of linear theory an equation for the maximum absorbed power is derived in terms of two dimensionless independent variables representing the length and the half-swept volume of the line absorber. The equation gives the well-known result for a point absorber wave energy converter {{in the limit of}} zero length and it gives Budal's upper bound in the limit of zero volume. The equation shows that the maximum power absorbed by a heaving point absorber is limited regardless of its volume, while for a <b>heaving</b> <b>line</b> absorber whose length tends to infinity the maximum power is proportional to its swept volume, with no limit. Power limits arise for line absorbers of practical lengths and volumes but they can be multiples of those achieved for point absorbers of similar volumes. This conclusion has profound implications for the scaling and economics of wave energy converters. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 2 table...|$|E
6000|$|As I {{shall not}} make {{mention of the}} Grand Banks on our homeward-bound passage, I may as well here relate, that on our return, we {{approached}} them in the night; and by way of making sure of our whereabouts, the deep-sea-lead was <b>heaved.</b> The <b>line</b> attached is generally upward of three hundred fathoms in length; and the lead itself, weighing some forty or fifty pounds, has {{a hole in the}} lower end, in which, previous to sounding, some tallow is thrust, that it may bring up the soil at the bottom, for the captain to inspect. This is called [...] "arming" [...] the lead.|$|R
50|$|The Pea Island crew {{with the}} help of a mule team then pulled the beach cart with the rescue {{equipment}} and surfboat along the beach towards where the distress signal had been seen. Huge waves washing ashore made this especially difficult. Finally, when the crew arrived at the scene of the wreck, they found that the wave conditions were so great that the surfboat could not be launched, nor could a breeches buoy be used because the beach was so inundated by waves that the anchor for the buoy line could not be placed in the sand. Two surfmen volunteered to swim out in the waves to attempt to reach the wreck. They eventually did reach the schooner and managed to <b>heave</b> a <b>line</b> aboard. Nine times the surfmen went into the water and one by one the passengers and crew were all rescued, starting with the captains three-year-old daughter. According to local lore, Meekins, who was reputedly the best swimmer of the group, made every voyage out to the Newman.|$|R

60|$|The {{schooner}} leaped as {{he spoke}} into the turmoil of roaring spray. In ten seconds she was through the passage, {{and there was a}} sudden and almost total cessation of <b>heaving</b> motion. The <b>line</b> of islands formed a perfect breakwater, and not a wave was formed, even by the roaring gale, bigger than those we find on such occasions in an ordinary harbour. As isle after isle was passed the sea became more and more smooth, and, although the surface was torn up and covered with foam, no great rollers heaved the vessel about. The tight little craft still bent over to the blast, but she cut through perfectly flat water now.|$|R
2500|$|Departing Sydney on 16 July {{using only}} one engine to {{conserve}} fuel, Marion headed through the Strait of Belle Isle and began her oceanographic survey mission. Initially, only Smith and his executive officer, Lieutenant Noble Ricketts, had {{the knowledge of}} how to sample the Arctic waters for temperature and salinity but they trained additional men to handle the instruments used for the survey. At each stop the ship's position was noted and a sounding was made while the temperature and salinity samples were collected. With [...] of sample wire in the water, both winches that handled the sampling equipment failed on 27 July. The crew managed to retrieve the wire in the dark in three hours by using the anchor windlass to <b>heave</b> the <b>line</b> in. In the meantime, one failed winch was repaired using parts scavenged from a spare and the line was spooled back onto the winch. The repair evolution was completed by morning with one winch operational. By July 31, Danish officials in Greenland had radioed permission for Marion to put into Godthaab for repairs to the other winch and the crew worked through the day to remove the two ton winch to shore for repair and replace it on the deckhouse. Marion departed Godthaab that evening with repairs completed.|$|R
6000|$|... (No, the Solomon Islands are not {{as healthy}} as they might be. I am writing this article {{on the island of}} Ysabel, where we have taken the Snark to careen and clean her cooper. I got over my last attack of fever this morning, and I have had only one free day between attacks. Charmian's are two weeks apart. Wada is a wreck from fever. Last night he showed all the {{symptoms}} of coming down with pneumonia. Henry, a strapping giant of a Tahitian, just up from his last dose of fever, is dragging around the deck like a last year's crab-apple. Both he and Tehei have accumulated a praiseworthy display of Solomon sores. Also, they have caught a new form of gari-gari, a sort of vegetable poisoning like poison oak or poison ivy. But they are not unique in this. A number of days ago Charmian, Martin, and I went pigeon-shooting on a small island, and we have had a foretaste of eternal torment ever since. Also, on that small island, Martin cut the soles of his feet to ribbons on the coral whilst chasing a shark--at least, so he says, but from the glimpse I caught of him I thought it was the other way about. The coral-cuts have all become Solomon sores. Before my last fever I knocked the skin off my knuckles while <b>heaving</b> on a <b>line,</b> and I now have three fresh sores. And poor Nakata! For three weeks he has been unable to sit down. He sat down yesterday for the first time, and managed to stay down for fifteen minutes. He says cheerfully that he expects to be cured of his gari-gari in another month. Furthermore, his gari-gari, from too enthusiastic scratch- scratching, has furnished footholds for countless Solomon sores. Still furthermore, he has just come down with his seventh attack of fever. If I were king, the worst punishment I could inflict on my enemies would be to banish them to the Solomons. On second thought, king or no king, I don't think I'd have the heart to do it.) ...|$|R
