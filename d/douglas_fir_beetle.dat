These {{non-native}} plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over [...] of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> <b>beetle,</b> and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100percent of {{the trees in the}} impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.|$|E
40|$|All {{species of}} bark beetles of {{economic}} importance prefer to attack freshly-killed host material. Logging slash, wind-throw, and fire-killed timber provide ideal breeding grounds for bark beetles. A few species, {{mostly in the}} Dendroctonus group, are able to kill living trees. When beetles in the group, raised in preferred host material, cannot find any or enough freshly-killed trees, logs, or slash to enter, they may attack living trees. In the interior of British Columbia, infestations of the <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> <b>beetle</b> can often be traced to logging disturbance...|$|E
40|$|Bark beetles {{are well}} {{described}} in terms of life history and general ecology for the six beetle species of concern in eastern Oregon and Washington, USA: <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dendroctonus pseudotsugae; mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae; western pine beetle, D. brevicomis; spruce beetle, D. rufipennis; fir engraver, Scolytus ventralis; and, pine engraver, Ips pini. Many interactions between bark beetles and other agents and resources have been described. Wildfire, windstorms, disease, other insects, and land management practices can weaken trees and attract bark beetles that become locally epidemic. At low population levels, beetles perform useful functions by creating habitat and forage for many organisms, but outbreaks can cause extensive tree mortality and increase risk of wildfire. Natural control agents such as birds, predatory beetles, parasitoids, and parasites, have been studied, but have not been employed operationally in management strategies. While semichemical-baited traps provide information about population fluctuations locally, large area monitoring relies primarily on aerial surveillance. Stand susceptibility, hazard, or risk-rating systems exist for most of these species, and infestation growth or damage models are available for a few. In most cases, pesticide sprays, attractants and anti-aggregants, and trap-tree techniques have been useful in specific applications. Anti-aggregants have been proven useful in large-scale operations for <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> <b>beetle.</b> Salvage or sanitation of infested, wind- or fire-damaged trees can prevent population build-ups if done promptly. Integration of these methods along with prescribed fire and tree thinning has been recommended. Decision-support tools are becoming more prevalent but each requires validation for different geographic variants. Hayes and Daterman "Bark beetles (Scolytidae) in Eastern Oregon and Washington.

40|$|The montane forests (i. e. below about 2900 m altitude) of the Colorado Front Range have {{experienced}} repeated outbreaks of {{western spruce budworm}} (Choristoneura occidentalis) and <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> bark <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae), both of which locally attack <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The effects were studied of (historically documented) outbreaks of these insects on succession, stand structure, and radial growth of host and non-host species in Rocky Mountain National Park; the most recent budworm (1974 - 85) and bark beetle (1984 -present) outbreaks resulted in the most severe and widespread disturbance of these forests since the late 19 th century. Studies were carried out during 1987 and 1988 in 11 stands representing {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions, and dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> in order to investigate the responses of stands to repeated outbreaks of these pests. The stands were either old (3 ̆e 250 yr) with relatively open understories or young (yr), dense, even-aged post-fire stands. Cores were taken from some <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) for dendrochronological analyses. Young, vigorous post-fire stands showed minimal budworm defoliation, and in these stands only remnant trees from the pre-fire generation appeared to be susceptible to beetle-caused mortality. Dense stands exhibited higher budworm-induced mortality, which hastened the natural thinning process and shifted dominance towards the non-host species. The stands most severely disturbed by these insects were multi-storied stands with high host densities and a wide range of stem sizes. The stand response to these disturbances included the growth release of shade-intolerant, seral species, and in some cases, a higher survivorship among mid-sized individuals of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir.</b> The net result of the combined insect outbreaks is the temporary slowing of the successional trend towards a steady-state <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> forest. Fire suppression, by increasing the density of suppressed <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> has previously been shown to favour increased outbreak severity of western spruce budworm in the N. Rocky Mountains. However, in the Front Range, recent increases in outbreak severity and their synchroneity may also be the result of large areas of forest, (burned during the late 19 th century during European settlement) simultaneously entering structural stages susceptible to insect outbreak...|$|R

40|$|Insects and {{diseases}} exert immense economic loss to forests through reduced tree growth and mortality. In recent years, these {{problems have been}} exacerbated by climate change. For example, in British Columbia, warmer summers and an amelioration of winter temperatures have allowed the mountain pine beetle to expand its range into new areas of British Columbia and Alberta east of the Rocky Mountains. A significant concern is subsequent expansion of this insect into jack pine within the boreal forest. Another concern, as yet unstudied, is the potential expansion of mountain pine beetle northward through lodgepole pine into northern British Columbia and the Yukon. Range expansion and/or increased tree mortality {{is not limited to}} mountain pine beetle. Indeed, many other insects such as <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> <b>beetle,</b> Western balsam bark beetle, and spruce beetle have reached record population levels in British Columbia in recent years. Such population dynamics are likely due to a phenomenon known as the Moran effect, in which populations with the same density-dependent structure erupt simultaneously when synchronized by a landscape-level exogenous variable. The most plausible exogenous variable in forest systems is temperature, especially for uni-or semi-voltine insects dependent upon phenological synchrony. A changing climate, especially increasing temperatures, may not only extend ranges but also bring about simultaneous populations eruptions. There has been a plethora of work on models examining population dynamics of the mountain pine beetle. Predominant approaches have included deterministic process models with relative risk, simulation outputs (Riel et al. 2004), analytical process models designed to mirror system behaviou...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{effect of}} {{competition}} on the brood {{survival of the}} <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> <b>beetle</b> Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, in down or windthrown Douglas-fir Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco was studied {{in the field and}} the laboratory. The investigation of the role of competition in the population dynamics of the beetle had four objectives: (1) to observe and record aspects of the beetle's biology and behavior which influence the intensity of competition; (2) to determine the phloem area necessary for normal development of an individual Douglas-fir beetle larva; (3) to assess the effects of intraspecific competition on the survival of the Douglas-fir beetle; (4) to assess the effects of interspecific competition on the survival of the Douglas-fir beetle. Peak periods of attack during the 1960 season followed periods of warm sunny weather and were distributed throughout the attack period which lasted from April through July. Attacks were recorded on all study trees from April through June. The pattern and density of infestation on down host trees were such that intraspecific competition occurred most frequently {{on the underside of the}} top half of these trees. Predators and parasites also tended to be slightly more abundant in this region. Studies of the gallery pattern revealed that the highest number of eggs per linear inch of egg gallery are laid within the first five inches of egg gallery. Alternate arrangement of the egg groups along the gallery serves to increase the possibility of successful larval development when overcrowding occurs. No difference was noted in the number of eggs laid at invasion densities ranging from one to three per square foot. Maximum brood survival in the laboratory was recorded when individual broods had 1. 5 square feet of phloem in which to develop, or an individual larva had from 1. 6 to 2. 0 square inches of phloem available for feeding. Studies of intraspecific competition under caged conditions in the field revealed brood survival was highest when the larval mine density ranged from 50 to 100 per square foot. Survival decreased with progressive increases in density. A similar relationship existed between percent survival and attacks per square foot, and total egg gallery per square foot. Maximum brood survival in the field was recorded when each larva had 2. 6 to 3. 0 square inches of phloem in which to develop. The ratio of progeny to parent beetles was highest at larval mine densities of 51 to 100 per square foot of bark surface. The findings show that intraspecific competition is an important natural control factor, but that information on nutritional requirements of the beetle and food quality are needed before a more refined assessment of competition can be made. The lack of interspecific competition during the 1960 and 1961 field studies can be traced to different times of seasonal flight, different preferences for position on the tree bole, and low population levels of the Douglas-fir beetle and its competitors...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{provides}} {{new challenges}} to Nordic forestry. Use of non-native species, such as <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir,</b> {{can be a}} means of mitigating the {{effects of climate change}} and meeting the growing demand for biomass. When <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> is grown in Sweden, it is several degrees of latitude north of its normal range, which can affect timing of growth cessation, hardening of seedlings, and seedling storability. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate tolerance to freezing and sub-zero storability of seven <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances and make comparisons with the native Norway spruce. Freezing tolerance and storability were evaluated by measuring the electrolytic leakage of shoots and roots after freezing, complemented with a three-week cultivation test after storage. All provenances of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> used in this study were able to tolerate frozen storage at − 4 °C for about four months. Norway spruce and the interior <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenance, Three Valley, could be stored earlier in the autumn than the southern coastal <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances. Consequently, it should be possible to store <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seedlings with the same routines as for Norway spruce...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} species that will grow well through ongoing climate change has {{increased}} the interest in <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] in Sweden. One {{of the most common}} problems seen in plantations of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seedlings is damage caused by late spring frost, known to be highly correlated with the timing of bud burst. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate spring-related bud development under Nordic conditions of seven <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances and to compare data with a local provenance of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). Results from a field trial and a greenhouse-based study were compared. The interior <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances exhibited an earlier bud burst than coastal provenances, both in the greenhouse and in the field trial. When comparing differences within the groups of interior and coastal <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenances, no differences could be found. The local Norway spruce, only grown in the greenhouse, showed an intermediate bud development profile similar to the interior <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> provenance Three Valley. We therefore suggest that Three Valley could be planted at the same locations as the investigated local provenance of Norway spruce in mid-Sweden. To avoid spring frost damage the <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seedlings need to be frozen stored and planted late in spring. Planting under shelterwood can also help protect the seedlings from spring frost damages. As similar results for bud development patterns of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> and Norway spruce provenances were obtained from the greenhouse and field trials, greenhouse tests could facilitate selection of provenances...|$|R

We conducted field experiments to compare the establishment potential (i. e. post-dispersal seed removal, seed ger- mination, seedling survival and growth) of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> in beech forests, holm-oak forests and heathlands; and compared it with the taxonomically close native conifer Abies alba (Silver <b>fir).</b> <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> seeds were more removed than Silver fir in holm-oak and in heathlands. In all habitats, seed germination was significantly higher for <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> compared to that of Silver fir and, seedling mortality was extremely high in both species due to soil disturbance by wild boars and drought stress. <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> mortality was only lower than Silver fir in beech forests. However, species did not differ in seedling growth. Overall, the probability of invasion success of <b>Douglas</b> <b>fir</b> decreased along the sequential stages of plant estab- lishment in all habitats.
