40|$|Four {{bituminous}} coals of {{the same}} rank but with different thermoplastic properties were oxidized at 40 and 50 °C for one month. The chemical changes due to oxidation were studied by applying Gieseler plastometry, the <b>free-swelling</b> <b>index</b> (FSI), thermogravimetric analysis and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). In general, oxidation at 50 °C produced a greater impairment of coking properties, the different responses to oxidation depending on the parent coal. The main effects caused by oxidation were a loss of thermoplastic properties, a decrease in aliphatic hydrogen and {{a slight increase in}} groups with oxygen functionalities. Both the fresh and oxidized coals were carbonized in a movable-wall oven of 17 kg capacity {{and the quality of the}} resulting cokes was tested by means of the JIS and ASTM standard methods. The results showed that, in certain cases, mild oxidation produced an improvement in coke quality. Oxidation also affected the porosity of the cokes, which may be related to the coke quality. It was found that the higher quality cokes had less macroporosity, whereas the lower quality cokes had a higher pore volume. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union’s Research Programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) research programme under grant agreement No. [RFCR-CT- 2013 - 00007]Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-heating}} of coal is {{a serious}} problem that has always affected the coal industry. Self-heating has been studied around the world for more than 100 years by many investigators, yet no accurate method of predicting self-heating in coal has been developed. The objective of this research was to investigate the factors contributing to the self-heating in coal and to develop methods to predict the self-heating in coal and to develop methods to predict the self-heating susceptibility of various coals. A data bank containing analytical data, transportation histories, and results from laboratory tests was established at Western Kentucky University. A laboratory test that gave very encouraging results is an extraction test using sodium hydroxide solutions. Absorbances of the extract solutions from 15 coal samples obtained from barges of coal shipped from the Illinois Basin coal fields to the New Orleans area compared very well with the incidences of self-heating in the 15 barges. The fact that these coals were shipped in the summer when conditions are more favorable for self-heating to take place may have led to the strong correlation of the alkali extract solution absorbances and the final temperatures of the coal in the barges. Tests with coal samples obtained from barges shipped in the other seasons of the year did not yield very good correlations. The poor correlation between self-heating and the alkali extraction test absorbances was {{due to the lack of}} accurate temperature data, since the temperature of the coal at the time of loading was not available. The correlation of the absorbances of the extract solutions with parameters such as Btu/lb, oxygen, sulfate sulfur, and <b>free-swelling</b> <b>index</b> was very good...|$|E
