25|$|Given {{the thermal}} {{properties}} of the sash, frame, and sill, and {{the dimensions of the}} glazing and thermal {{properties of the}} glass, the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> for a given window and set of conditions can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this straightforward mass-action effect, the rate coefficients themselves can change due to pressure. The rate coefficients and products of many high-temperature gas-phase reactions change if an inert gas {{is added to the}} mixture; variations on this effect are called fall-off and chemical activation. These phenomena are due to exothermic or endothermic reactions occurring faster than heat transfer, causing the reacting molecules to have non-thermal energy distributions (non-Boltzmann distribution). Increasing the pressure increases the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> between the reacting molecules {{and the rest of the}} system, reducing this effect.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of heat {{exchanger}} is called [...] "(dynamic) scraped surface {{heat exchanger}}". This is mainly used for heating or cooling with high-viscosity products, crystallization processes, evaporation and high-fouling applications. Long running times are achieved {{due to the}} continuous scraping of the surface, thus avoiding fouling and achieving a sustainable <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rate</b> during the process.|$|E
40|$|Condensation, a {{two-phase}} <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> processes, {{is commonly}} utilized in industrial systems. Condensation <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> can be optimized by using surfaces in which dropwise condensation (DWC) occurs, and even further optimized using superhydrophobic surfaces. For superhydrophobic condensation, a structured silicon surface with pillars 2. 1 p. m tall, 200 nm in diameter, and a 400 nm pitch was tested. By removing noncondensable gases (NCG) {{from the system}} {{by means of a}} steam trap, the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> of DWC and SHC were found to be greater than that of filmwise condensation (FWC) by a factor of 2, but indistinguishable from each other. The effect of NCG leads to a 5 x reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> for both DWC and SHC. DWC <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> are as much as 50 kW/m 2 less than FWC at the same temperature difference, representing a 25 % reduction. However, the SHC <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> remain above those of FWC by as much as 50 kW/m² at the same temperature difference, representing a 20 % improvement. These studies suggest that SHC may be a useful passive method to improve condensation <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> in the presence of NCG. However, {{it remains to be seen}} if SHC can provide better <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> than DWC under saturated steam conditions. by Travis M. Hery. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Most {{approaches}} to increasing <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> in the convection sections of gas-fired process heaters involve {{the incorporation of}} fins, baffles, turbulizers, etc. to increase either the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> surface area or turbulence or both. Although these approaches are effective in increasing the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates,</b> this increase is invariably accompanied by an associated increase in convection section pressure drop as well as, for heaters firing ‘dirty’ fuel mixtures, increased fouling of the tubes – {{both of which are}} highly undesirable. GTI has identified an approach that will increase <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> without a significant increase in pressure drop or fouling rate. Compared to other types of <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> enhancement approaches, the proposed dimpled tube approach achieves very high <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> at the lowest pressure drops. Incorporating this approach into convection sections of chemical industry fired process heaters may increase energy efficiency by 3 - 5 %.

The feedwater temperature is dependent on the steam production; the steam phase portion is led to the turbines and condensers and returns significantly cooler (...) than the water returning directly from the steam separator (284°C). At low reactor power, therefore, the inlet temperature may become dangerously high.

The basic model is a cylindrical body with a 10 degree conical nose. Four conical ramps, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees serve as shock wave generators.

The main result is a series of comparisons with experimental and CFD data of Stanton Numbers, <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates,</b> skin friction coefficients and viscous length scales computed with the engineering correlations. Good agreement was observed among the laminar correlation, CFD and experimental data. Comparisons of turbulent correlation results with CFD and experimental data produced reasonable agreement in most cases, although the van Driest and Eckert correlations tended to over-estimate <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>rates</b> on cold walls.
