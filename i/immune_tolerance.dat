5|$|Burnet was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing <b>immune</b> <b>tolerance,</b> thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, <b>immune</b> <b>tolerance</b> and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E
25|$|The {{fetus is}} genetically {{different}} from the woman and {{can be viewed as}} an unusually successful allograft.

50|$|Conversely, {{there is}} {{increasing}} interest in the possible therapeutic benefits of blocking CTLA4 (using antagonistic antibodies against CTLA such as ipilimumab (FDA approved for melanoma in 2011) {{as a means of}} inhibiting <b>immune</b> system <b>tolerance</b> to tumours and thereby providing a potentially useful immunotherapy strategy for patients with cancer. This is the first approved immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Another (not yet approved) is tremelimumab.|$|R

25|$|The {{function}} of the blood–testis barrier (red highlight in diagram above) may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. Mature sperm (and their antigens) arise long after <b>immune</b> <b>tolerance</b> is established in infancy. Therefore, since sperm are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm. In fact, {{he is capable of}} making antibodies against them.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is a {{fundamental}} property of the <b>immune</b> system. <b>Tolerance</b> involves non-self discrimination which {{is the ability of}} the normal immune system to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, but not self antigens. Autoimmunity is evoked when this tolerance to self antigen is broken. Tolerance within an individual is normally evoked as a fetus. This is known as maternal-fetal tolerance where B cells expressing receptors specific for a particular antigen enter the circulation of the developing fetus via the placenta.|$|R

40|$|DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin {{specifically}} expressed on dendritic {{cells that}} recognize high-mannose and fucose glycans. This carbohydrate specificity of DC-SIGN enables {{recognition of a}} large array of ligands which include both pathogen-derived as well as endogenous glycoconjugates. Because of the wide expression of DC-SIGN ligands, DC-SIGN is involved in several aspects {{of the immune system}} like <b>immune</b> defense, <b>tolerance</b> induction and cell-cell communication. This broadens the role of DC-SIGN since C-type lectin receptors were primarily considered as pattern-recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to investigate the various implications of DC-SIGN in interacting with foreign and endogenous ligand...|$|R
25|$|Both sFlt-1 and sEng are {{upregulated}} in all {{pregnant women}} to some extent, supporting {{the idea that}} hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of maternal <b>immune</b> <b>tolerance</b> for a foreign placenta, {{it is not surprising}} that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled spiral arteries in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities in the {{maternal}} {{immune system and}} insufficiency of gestational <b>immune</b> <b>tolerance</b> seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward Th1 responses {{and the production of}} IFN-γ. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the natural killer cells of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of T helper cells, alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of regulatory T cells in pregnancy. Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers. It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal erythroblasts as well as cell-free fetal DNA are increased in {{the maternal}} circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an immune response and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|$|E

40|$|Biliary innate {{immunity}} {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of cholangiopathies in cases of biliary disease.

30|$|The {{mammalian}} or mechanistic {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase (also known as DRAK 2) {{and member of}} the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K)-family of kinases (PIKK). The super-family of mTOR/PIKK pathways is directly and indirectly involved in regulation {{of a wide range of}} tissue activities; metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, membrane lipid biosynthesis, growth and development, autophagy and immune cell responses [5, 39, 79, 178, 201, 260 – 267]. The two major constitutive (innate, embryonic) and induced complexes of mTORC 1 and mTORC 2 seem to contribute to tissue function and longevity. Molecular defects or immature biosynthesis of any members of these complex pathways have been involved in initiation of a wide range of metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular complications), infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, COPD), neurological problems (e.g., autism, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s), site-specific cancers (e.g., breast, bladder, peritoneal metastasis) and other age-associated chronic illnesses. The pathways involving <b>immune</b> cell <b>tolerance</b> (<b>immune</b> suppression) are implicated in clinical trials such as allograft acceptance in transplanted host tissues in models of skin allograft, bone marrow or stem cell transplantation for chemotherapy-treated soft tissue sarcoma [5, 39, 79 – 83, 89 – 100, 116, 129 – 133, 245, 247 – 249]. However, mechanism of actions or usefulness of embryonic stem cell transfer for cancer therapy are debatable and yet to be understood or confirmed.|$|R
500|$|Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, [...] (3 September 1899 – 31 August 1985), usually {{known as}} Macfarlane or Mac Burnet, was an Australian {{virologist}} {{best known for}} his contributions to immunology.

500|$|However, later {{studies showed}} that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system {{development}} of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined {{by the age of}} the animal, Joshua Lederberg proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies.

This was first observed with nonlytic anti-CD 4 antibodies, and was recently demonstrated following other therapeutic approaches. Dominant tolerance also plays a role in natural regulation of the immune response, functioning to prevent autoaggressive cells mediating self-destruction. The mechanism by which dominant tolerance is established and maintained remains unclear, and the reported characteristics of regulatory cells in different experimental models vary widely.

40|$|Much {{of what we}} {{understand}} about the anatomy and architecture {{of the immune system}} was revealed through exquisite experiments performed in the 1950 s- 1970 s. These studies identified the role that anatomy played in a number of fundamental immunological phenomena including recirculation, induction of <b>immune</b> priming or <b>tolerance,</b> and the interactions of T and B cells. The recent resurgence of interest in the role of immune architecture and anatomy in basic immunological phenomena is almost entirely due to technological developments in identifying and tracking cells in vivo, not least through the ability to do this dynamically, in real time through the application of multiphoton microscopy. Here we outline the background to our own studies applying multiphoton microscopy to analysis of <b>immune</b> priming and <b>tolerance,</b> the role of adjuvants, T- and B-cell interactions, and the application of these studies in infectious and inflammatory diseases. We then describe the impact that real time in vivo imaging has had on these areas.

5000|$|IL-2 and its {{receptor}} have {{key roles}} in key {{functions of the}} <b>immune</b> system, <b>tolerance</b> and immunity, primarily via their direct effects on T cells. In the thymus, where T cells mature, they prevent autoimmune diseases by promoting the differentiation of certain immature T cells into regulatory T cells, which kill off other T cells that are primed to attack normal healthy cells in the body. IL-2/IL2R also promotes the differentiation of T cells into effector T cells and into memory T cells when the initial T cells is also stimulated by an antigen, thus helping the body fight off infections.
