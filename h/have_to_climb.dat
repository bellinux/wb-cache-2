25|$|In 1957, the KR200 Kabrio {{model was}} released, {{featuring}} a cloth convertible top and fixed side window frames. This {{was followed by}} the KR201 Roadster without window frames, using a folding cloth top, a windscreen, and removable side curtains. A Sport Roadster was later offered with no top and with the canopy fixed into place so that the driver would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> in and out {{at the top of the}} car.|$|E

The P-valve is a urinal built into the suit, which enables a diver to urinate at any time without having {{to get out of}} the water, while keeping him or her dry and clean inside the suit.|$|E

25|$|The raised ranch is {{a two-story}} house, {{in which a}} {{finished}} basement serves as an additional floor. It may be built into a hill to some degree, such that the full size {{of the house is}} not evident from the curb. However, it does not become a raised ranch simply by having two floors. For it to be a raised ranch, you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> a flight of steps to get to the main living floor - if not it is just a bi-level house. Among real estate agents, this term is commonly misused.|$|E
25|$|The traps of the bladderworts {{may have}} derived from {{pitchers}} that specialized in aquatic prey when flooded, like Sarracenia psittacina does today. Escaping prey in terrestrial pitchers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> or {{fly out of}} a trap, and both of these can be prevented by wax, gravity and narrow tubes. However, a flooded trap can be swum out of, so in Utricularia, a one-way lid may have developed to form {{the door of a}} proto-bladder. Later, this may have become active by the evolution of a partial vacuum inside the bladder, tripped by prey brushing against trigger hairs {{on the door of the}} bladder.|$|E
25|$|The NCIS {{report said}} that the detainees had rags in their throats. Both the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) had {{previously}} stated that only one detainee had a rag in his throat. The NCIS described the detainees bonds as loose and easily tied by the prisoners, and {{said that the}}y did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> to the sinks for hanging. Because of the gravity of the events, the NCIS said the guards were expected to wait for NCIS investigators to give their statements (this is standard operating procedure (SOP) when criminal actions are possible). The NCIS report notes that numerous guards, detainees and medical personnel attested to seeing the deceased being transferred from the cellblock to the infirmary. Video records of the cellblock (which did not show the interiors of the cells) did not reveal anything amiss.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway {{also uses}} color and visual art {{techniques}} to convey emotional range in his {{descriptions of the}} Irati River. In Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway, Ronald Berman compares Hemingway's treatment of landscape {{with that of the}} post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne. During a 1949 interview, Hemingway told Lillian Ross that he learned from Cézanne how to [...] "make a landscape." [...] In comparing writing to painting he told her, [...] "This is {{what we try to do}} in writing, this and this, and woods, and the rocks we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> over." [...] The landscape is seen subjectively—the viewpoint of the observer is paramount. To Jake, landscape [...] "meant a search for a solid form.... not existentially present in [...] life in Paris." ...|$|E

Visitors <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> 268 steps to reach the Buddha, though the site also features a small winding road for vehicles to accommodate the handicapped. The Buddha's right hand is raised, representing the removal of affliction, while the left rests open on his lap in a gesture of generosity. He faces north, which is unique among the great Buddha statues, as all others face south.|$|E
2500|$|The {{degree of}} {{commercialisation}} of Mount Everest {{is a frequent}} subject of criticism. Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, [...] "You still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who {{have no idea how}} to put on crampons. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Kinpun village 16km (10mi) is at {{the base}} of Mt. Kyaiktiyo. It is the closest to the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda. From Kyaiktiyo, the foot trail or road starts for the Golden rock. On this approach, there are {{numerous}} granite boulders on the mountain, perched in precarious condition. Near the top of the mountain, there are two large lions guarding the entrance to Kyaiktiyo Pagoda. From this location, known as Yatetaung (the last point for vehicular traffic), pilgrims and visitors <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> to the Golden Rock barefoot, after leaving their footwear behind, as per Burmese custom. The paved mountain track, built in 1999, from the bus terminal at Yatetaung, is along a dusty section with kiosks on both sides and the climb of 1.2km up to the Golden Rock is stiff and takes about one hour to reach. From the base camp at Kinpun, the hiking trek to the pagoda is about [...] and many devotees do this trek as part of the pilgrimage rites. There are also many temples and pagodas, which have been built recently on other hills {{in the vicinity of the}} Kyaiktiyo Pagoda that are visited by pilgrims and tourists by trekking along foot tracks.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1995 tecnico Halcón Dorado Jr. came to AAA {{from the}} UWA {{as it was}} closing its doors. In AAA he quickly found himself partnered up {{with a number of}} other [...] "Juniors", Blue Demon Jr., Máscara Sagrada Jr. and Tinieblas Jr. to form a group that became known as Los Junior Atómicos. Of the four only two of them were {{actually}} sons of the wrestlers they took the name of, Tinieblas Jr. (son of Tinieblas) and Blue Demon Jr. (Son of Blue Demon). The remaining two were billed more as [...] "successors" [...] and not actually children of Máscara Sagrada and Halcón Dorado. During a tag team match earlier in 1996 a Blue Demon Jr. dive onto Karis La Momia ("Karis the Mummy") ended badly, with the storyline being that the dive injured Karis, causing him to grab a char and attack Blue Demon Jr. during the match. The storyline soon saw Karis la Momoa recruit Los Payasos ("The Clowns"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) a trio of [...] "Evil clowns". which brought out Blue Demon Jr.'s fellow Junior Atómicos to even the odds. On May 15, 2015 Karis defeated Blue Demon Jr. to win the Mexican National Cruiserweight Championship during a show Naucalpan, Mexico State. At Triplemanía IV-B the two sides met in a regular eight-man [...] "Atómicos" [...] tag team elimination match where Los Junior Atómicos won by disqualification. Subsequently all eight wrestlers agreed to put their masks on the line in a steel cage match, where each competitor would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> out of the cage in order to keep their mask safe, with the last man remaining in the cage being forced to unmask under Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match" [...] rules.|$|E
