5|$|<b>Hillside</b> Road, {{which runs}} {{parallel}} with South Road several hundred metres to the south, is an arterial route connecting South Dunedin (at its eastern end) with Dunedin's southwestern suburbs. At its western end is Forbury Corner, a road junction linking <b>Hillside</b> Road with suburban arterial routes {{to the suburbs}} of Saint Clair (Forbury Road) and Corstorphine (Easther Crescent), as well as David Street, the major road link between <b>Hillside</b> Road and South Road. Numerous other small residential streets run parallel with David Street between <b>Hillside</b> Road and South Road. The suburb's other main roads include Caversham Valley Road, Playfair Street, Surrey Street, and Glen Road. The latter of these lies at the Glen at {{the eastern end of}} Caversham, providing a link between South Road and the hill suburbs of Maryhill, Balaclava, and Mornington.|$|E
5|$|Trams served Caversham between 1880 and 1954, {{operating}} in <b>Hillside</b> Road, South Road, and David Street. Several bus routes now serve Caversham, connecting {{it with the}} heart of the city. Citibus and Dunedin Passenger Transport run routes from the city centre to Saint Clair and Corstorphine via <b>Hillside</b> Road, and to Lookout Point via South Road. Dunedin passenger transport also runs services between The Octagon and both Mosgiel and Brighton via South Road. Cargill's Corner, at the South Dunedin end of <b>Hillside</b> Road, is a major suburban bus hub.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to <b>Hillside</b> preparatory {{school in}} Surrey as his elder {{brothers}} had done. For {{a child with}} no interest in sport he acquitted himself reasonably well in cricket and rugby for the school. In class, he hated mathematics, was fair at classics, and excelled at English and divinity. <b>Hillside</b> encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including Mark Antony in Julius Caesar and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the potential of terrestrial photogrammetry to calculate erosion associated with surface runoff on <b>hillsides</b> near roads during recent periods. To do this we choose a road embankment located in a valley with hills which have developed abundant grooves erosion. The accuracy of the surveying tool is evident in the evaluation of small <b>hillsides,</b> but is impractical for the study of large <b>hillsides</b> with significant slopes, in which are unknown initial parameters of the topography...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, archaeologists {{discovered}} {{the first evidence}} of possible Roman terracing on the <b>hillsides</b> of the Moselle valley: Land consolidation and the laying out of new farm tracks in vineyards on the Middle Moselle and the upper Lower Moselle exposed the foundations of ancient Celtic houses {{at the foot of}} the <b>hillsides.</b> The archaeological sites on the steep <b>hillsides</b> still being managed today could therefore be viewed as evidence of Roman terracing on these slopes in the 3rd century AD.|$|R

5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 179th Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system. Later in the 1980s, the station was renovated and modernized; {{as part of the}} renovation, the IND-style purple tile band was removed from the station walls, and a design with intertwining blue and orange stripes was added. During a further upgrade that occurred by about 2000, elevators were installed in the station to make it ADA-accessible. The elevators were opened around 2005. Starting in August 2007, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation grates along <b>Hillside</b> Avenue above the station, and sealing other grates, both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the <b>Hillside</b> Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area in the subway system.|$|E

5|$|The Cross Bronx Expressway Extension and the Clearview Expressway were {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} I-78, which was to continue south from <b>Hillside</b> Avenue through Southeast Queens, and west across Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan to the Holland Tunnel. Under these plans, the Clearview would have been extended south to NY27 (Conduit Avenue) and the Belt Parkway, or to the Nassau Expressway and Rockaway Boulevard, in Laurelton near JFK Airport. Later plans had the Clearview ending farther east, intersecting with the Belt Parkway at its interchange with the Southern State Parkway. A 1968 proposal from the Regional Plan Association had the Clearview extension running southeast along 212th Street/Hollis Court Boulevard and Hempstead Avenue, then south along the right-of-ways of the Cross Island and Belt Parkways before ending at the Nassau Expressway. Ultimately, nearly all sections of I-78 between the Holland Tunnel and <b>Hillside</b> Avenue, including the Lower Manhattan Expressway, Bushwick Expressway, and the Clearview extension were cancelled by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971. The only portion to be constructed was the short section of the Nassau Expressway near JFK Airport. This resulted in the renumbering of all of I-78 north of <b>Hillside</b> Avenue to I-295 on January 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line was {{originally}} planned to extend farther along <b>Hillside</b> Avenue into eastern Queens. The line {{would have gone}} {{at least to the}} intersection of <b>Hillside,</b> Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (the latter two both formerly part of Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to go as far as Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The extension to Springfield Boulevard, which on contract drawings was referred to as Route 108-Section 13, would have been a two track extension of the D3 and D4 express tracks, with five stations, at 187th Street, 197th Street, Cross Island Boulevard (today's Francis Lewis Boulevard), 214th Street, and the terminal at Springfield Boulevard. All of these stations, with the exception of Springfield Boulevard, would have had two side platforms. <b>Hillside</b> Avenue was widened in the 1930s between 218th Street and 229th Street, in order to accommodate construction of the proposed Springfield Boulevard station. As part of the extension of the line to 179th Street in 1950, provisions were made to extend this line farther east via <b>Hillside</b> Avenue. East of the 179th Street there are two four track levels both used as train storage. The upper level was intended to be extended eastward, while the lower level was always intended to be used to relay and store trains. The tracks on the upper level are longer than the lower level tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks. The tracks continue until 184th Street.|$|E
