40|$|Abstract: Magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> {{has gotten}} great {{achievement}} {{and has been}} widely used in some special fields. Currently, the researches on magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> have focused on hydraulic design, bearing, axial force in China, and a new magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> with low flow and high head have been developed overseas. However, low efficiency and large size are the common disadvantages for the magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump.</b> In order to study the performance of high-speed magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump,</b> FLUENT is used to simulate the inner flow field of magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> with different rotate speeds, and get velocity and pressure distributions of inner flow field. According to analysis the changes of velocity and pressure to ensure the stable operation of pump and avoid cavitation. Based on the analysis of velocity and pressure, this paper presents the pump efficiency of magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> with different rotated speeds by calculating the power loss in impeller and volute, hydraulic loss, volumetric loss, mechanical loss and discussing the different reasons of power loss between the magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> with different rotated speeds. In addition, the magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> are tested in a closed testing system. Pressure sensors are set in inlet and outlet of magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> to get the pressure and the head, while the pump efficiency can be got by calculating the power loss between the input power and the outlet power. The results of simulation and test are similar, which shows tha...|$|R

It was planned as a multi-purpose building, and also contains an orangery, a saloon and a bathroom which retains original Delft tiles.

2500|$|The 12A engine {{has a long}} thin shaped {{combustion}} chamber, {{having a}} large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An engine <b>driven</b> <b>pump</b> supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This {{is done in the}} [...] "thermal reactor" [...] chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture.|$|E

Based on successful experiences for many years, magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pumps</b> have been aggressively applied to improve the seal life for special services such as sulfur, caustic, ammonia, etc since 2005. The magnetic <b>drive</b> <b>pump</b> has been preferred because of various advantages (easy maintenance, robust design, leak free, etc). However, we have faced important and didactic issues due to inappropriate operating procedures, protection systems and design. Unless the application and operation are taken into a consideration for special services like as molten sulfur and ammonia, the consequences of pump failure could result in devastating damage to pump parts and even fire. This case study will show how the bad actors were improved, lessons learned and guidelines for reliable operation. Users are reluctant to apply protection systems fully compliant with API 685 or vendor recommendations for non-hazardous services based on economic considerations. But they should consider providing minimum protection systems for special services, if not for all pumps...|$|R

50|$|The Thames Tunnel {{was started}} some 800 yds. east of Tilbury Fort, to join Tilbury to Gravesend in 1798.

50|$|Every reactor has {{at least}} one steam <b>driven</b> {{feedwater}} <b>pump</b> which can supply the steam generators with water to cool down the reactor. These turbine <b>driven</b> <b>pumps</b> can cool down the plant even when no electrical power is available to power the motor <b>driven</b> feedwater <b>pumps</b> during a station blackout like the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. In a boiling water reactor, like those in Fukushima, the heat removal capacity of the pumps is limited as the steam that drives the turbines is radioactive and thus has to be stored. This is not the case with a PWR due to the use of steam generators. Steam can simply be removed via a chimney. Water supplies on site are sufficient to keep the plant safe for dozens of days.|$|R
