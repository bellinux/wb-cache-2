5|$|The {{first pick}} in Toronto Raptors' history was Damon Stoudamire, {{a point guard}} from the University of Arizona, who was the seventh overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft. People in the crowd were {{surprised}} by this pick because they expected the Raptors to pick Ed O'Bannon from UCLA. In their second pick of the same draft, Fab Five member Jimmy King from Michigan was drafted in the second round. The Raptors won the first overall pick in 1996, {{but they had to}} <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> due to the expansion agreement with the league. Chris Bosh was selected by the Raptors as the fourth pick overall in the 2003 NBA draft, and he went on to play in three all-star games, while starting in two. Andrea Bargnani, who was selected by the Raptors with the first overall pick of the 2006 NBA draft, became the first European to be picked first overall in the NBA draft.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{an open-air}} canopy that protects all fan seating areas {{from the rain}} and heat was constructed. The canopy however, does have a football-field sized hole in the middle, and does not protect the playing field itself from rain. The renovations were {{completed}} by the first Miami Dolphins pre-season home game in September 2016. Previously, since the field runs east–west (rather than north–south {{as is the case}} in most other stadiums), the north stands were exposed to the full force of South Florida's oppressive heat early in the season. The issue became so problematic that Stephen Ross, who owns the Dolphins and the stadium, successfully petitioned the NFL to have all September home games start at 4 pm. Although the heat gave the Dolphins a substantial home-field advantage against opponents unaccustomed to the sweltering heat, Ross was willing to <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> in order to ensure a more comfortable environment for fans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{choice of}} {{branding}} and distribution {{were part of}} the Zune as a decision of [...] "two strategies in the market right now: cross-brand ecosystems... and singular brand ecosystems... The former is gaining in share and units sold, but the latter has enormous share and won't <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> easily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About fifteen, all told. I {{used to have}} {{an office}} in Wall Street, New York, but I <b>gave</b> <b>that</b> <b>up,</b> as I found the {{confinement}} bad for my health." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you find}} him at all {{remarkable}} otherwise? What dismayed me more than his poetry even was <b>that</b> when he <b>gave</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> {{he seemed to have}} no particular direction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do now," [...] Mary answered. [...] "I {{had other}} {{employment}} in the morning, but I <b>gave</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> last week. I am a salaried official of the Society from last Monday." ...|$|R
2500|$|Randi {{has never}} smoked, taken {{narcotics}} or become inebriated, because, {{as he has}} explained, [...] "that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I {{want to be as}} aware as I possibly can. That means giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some ways, but I'm willing to <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> in order to live in an actually real world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{discovered}} few {{investment opportunities}} himself (and those that he did, often {{failed to make}} money for the firm). Instead, he focused on analyzing the merits of possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved. [...] The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain & Company, but Romney persuaded Bain to <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up.</b> Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself. Viewed as a fair manager, he received considerable loyalty from the firm's members.|$|E
2500|$|While Bain Capital {{was founded}} by Bain executives, the firm was not an {{affiliate}} or a division of Bain & Company but rather a completely separate company. [...] Initially, the two firms shared the same offices – in an office tower at Copley Place in Boston – and a similar approach to improving business operations. However, the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the Bain & Company executives {{had the ability to}} veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest. [...] Bain Capital also provided an investment opportunity for partners of Bain & Company. Bain Capital's original $37 million fund was raised entirely from private individuals in mid-1984. [...] The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain & Company, but Romney later persuaded Bill Bain to <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

50|$|As a child, Mazhar was {{progressive}} and always involved in extracurricular activities. She also dreamt {{of being an}} army officer, but <b>gave</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> in order to pursue her passion of being a star in show business.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's just it. I don't {{know what}} he can do. He {{used to be in}} an office business, but he <b>gave</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> to go into politics. Now, if he gets out, he will have to start all over again." ...|$|R
60|$|I must <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> too, I suppose. (Aloud.) I didn't mean it, Captain Hagberd.|$|E
6000|$|... "But he's {{going to}} <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up,</b> he says." [...] He hadn't said this, {{but she was}} sure he would. [...] "His income is a hundred {{thousand}} dollars a year. Think of that!" ...|$|E

50|$|Born in 1902 in the Wuerttembergian {{village of}} Laudenbach (now part of Weikersheim), Huber first studied law, but <b>gave</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> {{to become an}} artist in Munich. In 1938 he married fellow artist Hildegard Huber Sasse, and in 1942 the couple had a daughter, Ursula.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe they}} have <b>given</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> now. I {{understand}} from my cousin, Mr. Greystock, who has been my truest friend in all my troubles, that the stupid people have found out at last {{that they had not}} a leg to stand on. I daresay you have heard that, Lord Fawn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Part of what I {{came here}} for was the dollar you stole, {{and as soon as}} you <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> the row will be over; but you don't leave this place till I get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on," [...] {{said the}} burglar. [...] "But I moved away. I {{could find no}} other employment. For a while I managed to support my wife and child by passing confederate money; but, alas! I was forced to <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> {{because it did not}} belong to the union. I became desperate and a burglar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This Silesian Project {{fulfilled}} all his (the King's) political views,"--summed {{them all}} well up into one head.

6000|$|... "Not when he supposes {{his wife}} to be fond of him--no.

6000|$|... "Ah! I have <b>given</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> long since. She has an {{idea that}} the house is hers. I do not care to thwart her in that. Perhaps I {{should have done it}} at first; but it is too late now. To-night she was angry with me because I would not read a sermon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{succeeded in}} almost all our plans so far, except in getting the old Boulter house removed," [...] said Gilbert, [...] "and I've <b>given</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>up</b> in despair.

6000|$|... "She mustn't have mine," [...] {{said the}} woman quickly. [...] "That's {{a part of my}} idea. I <b>give</b> <b>that</b> <b>up</b> with the rest.

6000|$|... "Very well. Do {{you leave}} him alone; stay down here, {{and see what}} will come of it.

60|$|DEAR SIR AND MADAM,--This horrible delay must {{be forgiven}} me. It was {{not caused by}} any want of gratitude; but {{by the desire to}} {{acknowledge}} the dedication more suitably (and to display my wit) in a copy of verses.

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Frank replied.

25|$|On July 21, Abraham of Chilhowee led {{his party}} in {{attempting}} to capture Fort Caswell on the Watauga, but his attack was driven off with heavy casualties.
