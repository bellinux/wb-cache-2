40|$|Each {{generation}} of IQ tests {{by the various}} test publishers is eventually revised and renormed, with a test possibly being completely reformulated. We are in the transition phase now, using a whole new series of tests and finding what works and doesn’t work, or which portions to utilize to satisfy various needs. As always, the tests represent both improvements and losses for the gifted. We have seen some extension of test ceilings, which benefits the gifted, and increased emphasis on processing skills, which does not. Wechsler tests continue to be good initial IQ tests for the gifted. Although they rarely yield scores above the 140 s, they offer good diagnostic <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> <b>indications</b> of ability beyond their limits. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), released in August of 2003, replaces the WISC-III. School districts usually have one year, according to American Psychological Association (APA) standards, to begin using a newer version of an IQ test. Therefore, most school districts that employ Wechsler tests should have begun using the new edition this fall. Compared to the WISC-III, the WISC-IV is a substantial reformulation. While the highest IQ score possible is still 160, the WISC-IV does offer additional harder questions at the upper ends {{of a number of}} subtests. The Verbal IQ and Performance IQ scores of its predecessors have been eliminated. The 10 required subtests yield a Full Scale IQ score and four Composite scores: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory and Processing Speed. The Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Reasoning Composites are very good indicators of giftedness. They do an admirable job of assessing verbal abstract reasoning and provide very useful tests of visual reasoning with less timing emphasis. Working Memory and Processing Speed are less correlated with giftedness. The five supplementary tests add flexibility; two substitutions are allowed in different composite areas in deriving Full Scale IQ scores. The Dumont-Willis Indice...|$|E

Hospitals that participated in the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Point Prevalence Surveys (ESAC-PPS) were included. The WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification for ‘antimycotics for systemic use’ (J 02) 2009 version was used. Demographic data <b>and</b> <b>information</b> about <b>indications</b> <b>and</b> diagnoses were collected in 2008 and 2009. From 99 053 patients, 29 324 (29. 6 %) received antimicrobials. Antifungals represented 1529 of 40 878 (3. 7 %) antimicrobials. Antifungals were mainly (54. 2 %) administered orally. Hospital-acquired infections represented 44. 5 % of indications for antifungals followed by medical prophylaxis at 31. 2 %. The site of infection was not defined in 36. 0 % of cases but the most commonly targeted sites were respiratory (19. 2 %) and gastrointestinal (18. 8 %). The most used antifungal was fluconazole (60. 5 %) followed by caspofungin (10. 5 %). Antifungal–antibacterial combinations were frequently used (77. 5 %). The predominance of fluconazole use in participating hospitals could result {{in an increase in}} prevalence of inherently resistant fungi, increasing the need for newer antifungals.

Based on this definition a system’s architecture for smart indicators is proposed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of finger-strategies on number processing is documented by several findings which suggest that finger-based embodied representations could constitute a potential {{bridge between the}} innate number sense {{and the development of}} symbolic numerical abilities. Recent studies show evidence of hand muscle activation during passive observation of Arabic digits, as well as priming on the processing of Arabic stimuli if preceded by pictures of culturally-appropriate canonical finger-numeral configurations. However, little is known about how the sensory-motor and visual systems interact in the adulthood cognition and about the particulars of numerical processing grounding in the brain hemispheres. To fill this gap, a cross-modal priming study was designed, in which participants had to identify lateralized Arabic digits (2 - 3 - 4) while performing covert canonical or non-canonical finger-numeral configurations with their hemisphere-matching or hemisphere-mismatching hand. Results showed that responses to a visual target (e. g., 3) were faster when participants’ hand was fixed in canonical configuration compared to arbitrary finger position, particularly when bodily-hand <b>information</b> <b>and</b> visual stimuli were projected simultaneously into the left hemisphere. This cross-modal priming effect can be taken as evidence of the numerical cognitive-facilitation supported by integrative processing of multiple sensorial <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> as an <b>indication</b> of specialized hemispheric involvement in the semantic processing of number information...|$|R

Aims: To determine the pattern of request for discharge against medical advice of neonates. Methodology: A 5 -year cross-sectional study at the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) of Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH), Sokoto, Nigeria. All babies that were discharged against medical advice (DAMA) between January, 2008 and December, 2012 were recruited. Both baby/maternal <b>information</b> <b>and</b> the <b>indications</b> for the discharge were documented. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 20. 0 Results: Admission to SCBU for the period was found to be 2, 426 (20. 2 %). Forty two (1. 7 %) babies were DAMA; males 17 (40. 5 %), females 25 (59. 5 %); M: F; 0. 7 : 1. 5. Twenty seven (64 %) delivered in UDUTH, 15 (36 %) outside the facility. Birth weights ranged from 1. 0 – 4. 8 kg with mean SD of 3. 03 ± 0. 8. 36 (85. 7 %) were spontaneous vertex deliveries, and term babies accounted for 78. 6 %. Babies delivered vaginally had more DAMA. Birth asphyxia was the commonest diagnosis. The mean duration of hospital stay was 8. 2 ± 5. 4 days.
