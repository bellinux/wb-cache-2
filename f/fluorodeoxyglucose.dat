2500|$|PET {{scanning}} {{with the}} tracer fluorine-18 (F-18) <b>fluorodeoxyglucose</b> (FDG), called FDG-PET, {{is widely used}} in clinical oncology. [...] This tracer is a glucose analog that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by hexokinase (whose mitochondrial form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumors). A typical dose of FDG used in an oncological scan has an effective radiation dose of 14mSv. Because the oxygen atom that is replaced by F-18 to generate FDG {{is required for the}} next step in glucose metabolism in all cells, no further reactions occur in FDG. Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the phosphate added by hexokinase. This means that FDG is trapped in any cell that takes it up until it decays, since phosphorylated sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell. This results in intense radiolabeling of tissues with high glucose uptake, such as the brain, the liver, and most cancers.

50|$|Serotonin is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{found in}} {{the central nervous system}} that has various roles in the regulation of sexual behavior. Serotonin agonists and antagonists have activational or inhibitory effects depending on their concentration and the brain area involved. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that prolongs the effect of serotonin on neurons. Kinnunen et al. (2004) administered fluoxetine to their study subjects to see if the brain is differentially activated in homosexual and heterosexual men through the action of serotonin. After fluorexine administration, they measured glucose metabolism in the brain by using <b>ﬂuorodeoxyglucose</b> positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). They found that the brain response to ﬂuoxetine differs between homosexual and heterosexual men, that is, homosexual men show a smaller reduction of glucose metabolism in the hypothalamus than heterosexual men. In addition, other areas of the brain were differentially activated: the prefrontal association cortex of homosexual men exhibited increased activity after ﬂuoxetine administration while the prefrontal association cortex of heterosexual men did not show any change. The cunate gyrus, lateral anterior cingulate and bilateral hippocampus/ parahippocampal gyrus of heterosexual men exhibited increased activity while decreased activity was seen in portions of their cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that homosexuals and heterosexuals may not only differ in the total number of neurons in various areas of their central nervous systems, but also may differ in the distribution of certain kinds of neurons, such as serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons.|$|E
5000|$|Organofluorine {{chemistry}} {{began in}} the 1800s {{with the development of}} organic chemistry. [...] The first organofluorine compounds were prepared using antimony trifluoride as the F− source. The nonflammability and nontoxicity of the chlorofluorocarbons CCl3F and CCl2F2 attracted industrial attention in the 1920s. In the 1930s, scientists at duPont discovered polytetrafluoroethylene. [...] Subsequent major developments, especially in the US, benefited from expertise gained in the production of uranium hexafluoride. Starting in the late 1940s, a series of electrophilic fluorinating methodologies were introduced, beginning with CoF3. About this time, electrochemical fluorination ("electrofluorination") was announced, having been developed in the 1930s with the goal of generating highly stable perfluorinated materials compatible with uranium hexafluoride. [...] These new methodologies allowed the synthesis of C-F bonds without using elemental fluorine and without relying on metathetical methods. In 1957, the anticancer activity of 5-fluorouracil was described. This report provided one of the first examples of rational design of drugs. [...] This discovery sparked a surge of interest in fluorinated pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. The discovery of the noble gas compounds, e.g. XeF4, provided a host of new reagents starting in the early 1960s. In the 1970s, <b>fluorodeoxyglucose</b> was established as a useful reagent in 18F positron emission tomography. In Nobel Prize-winning work, CFC's were shown to contribute to the depletion of atmospheric ozone. This discovery alerted the world to the negative consequences of organofluorine compounds and motivated the development of new routes to organofluorine compounds. In 2002, the first C-F bond-forming enzyme, fluorinase, was reported.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Fluorodeoxyglucose</b> {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} scanning has an established role in the diagnostic work-up of many malignant diseases {{and also in the}} evaluation of cancer treatment response. <b>Fluorodeoxyglucose</b> {{positron emission tomography}} may, however be non-specific as infectious processes are depicted as well. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient with longstanding leg pain and weakness due to plexopathy developed a few years after treatment for prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen was raised and magnetic resonance imaging showed contrast uptake in thickened sacral nerves, suspicious for metastasis. While <b>fluorodeoxyglucose</b> positron emission tomography showed increased uptake in the plexus region, (11) C-Choline- positron emission tomography did not show any uptake. It was concluded that the FDG uptake reflected plexus neuritis and no tumor. Treatment for pain relief was started.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{metabolic}} test using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose is {{a useful}} tool for the management of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, either for staging purposes or for the evaluation of suspicious masses that can frequently occur after treatment. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the value of the 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose test performed with a dual-head coincident gamma camera (CGC-PET with <b>fluorodeoxyglucose)</b> for the staging and the detection of residual tumor of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: Thirty-eight consecutive patients were included in this retrospective study; the metabolic test comprising CGC-PET with FDG was done in 18 patients for staging work-up (Group 1), and the results were compared to conventional clinical staging procedures that included computed tomography scans and bone marrow biopsy. The remaining 20 patients were evaluated with CGC-PET with <b>fluorodeoxyglucose</b> due to the presence of residual masses or a new lesion (Group 2). RESULTS: The 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose metabolic test, CGC-PET with <b>fluorodeoxyglucose,</b> upstaged 5 (27 %) of the Group 1 patients and detected more lesions (45) than conventional methods of staging (33). Of the 20 patients in Group 2, 11 had positive 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucosetests, and a viable tumor was confirmed in 9 patients. Regarding the 9 patients with negative <b>fluorodeoxyglucose</b> metabolic tests, the 1 -year probability of recurrence was 11. 8 %. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the CGC-PET with <b>fluorodeoxyglucose</b> test were 90 %, 80 %, 82 %, 89 %, and 85 % respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic test comprising CGC-PET with <b>fluorodeoxyglucose</b> had a higher diagnostic accuracy than conventional methods in the staging of Hodgkin lymphoma and thus is a valuable noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of suspicious lesions...|$|E
