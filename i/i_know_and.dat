500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E

[...] has been killed... He loved me, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> I him... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [...] friend". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she [...] "is flogging into her head that [...] loves" [...] a man named Nikolai, although he [...] "doesn't shine in upbringing and education". In the same entry she wrote {{that she did not}} think about marriage because [...] "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she [...] "had it out" [...] with Nikolai and [...] "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she [...] "cannot find a solace" [...] now and is [...] "of no use to anyone".|$|E

500|$|Rapper Snoop Dogg, {{who had a}} {{significant}} role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was mentioned that [...] "Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop's distinctive style made him a superstar before he'd even released a recording of his own" [...] and that his involvement was {{as important to the}} album's success as its production. Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." ...|$|E
500|$|NHK {{announced}} a seven-episode live-action television drama adaptation on March 30, 2009, produced {{in cooperation with}} the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the country's national aerospace agency. Sixteen-year-old actress Nanami Sakuraba was cast for the role of Asumi Kamogawa, and filming for the series began on April 2. The drama was scheduled to air on June 11 but was eventually postponed by one week until June 18. Its airing coincided with the celebration of the International Year of Astronomy. Screenplay for the series was written by Shūko Arai and Daigo Matsui. While writing the script, Arai found himself encouraged by the characters who must overcome various struggles in order to achieve their dreams. He also specified hopes and dreams as central themes in the story. Among the changes made in this adaptation is the removal of Lion-san as a central character. Yaginuma did not make any restrictions for Arai and Matsui as he believed they knew the television audience best. [...] "Nevertheless," [...] he said, [...] "I think the little Asumi <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> the Asumi portrayed by Ms. Nanami are both looking at the same sky." [...] A three-disc DVD compilation box set of the adaptation was released by Geneon Universal Entertainment on December 23, 2009.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{has also}} {{influenced}} numerous music artists. Spice Girls member Melanie C said [...] "Madonna {{was doing the}} girl power thing {{a long time before}} the Spice Girls... 'Express Yourself' is one of the routines that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> I used to really like doing that one because it is where she shows her bra and holds her crotch." [...] In 2010, singer Christina Aguilera paid tribute to [...] "Express Yourself" [...] with the music video of her single, [...] "Not Myself Tonight". She commented [...] "One of my favorite videos ever is 'Express Yourself' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality... I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs. I was paying tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before." [...] James Montgomery from MTV deemed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the primary influence of Aguilera's video with scenes like Aguilera displaying a monocle, standing atop a flight of stairs and crawling across the floor while pouring a black liquid over herself. Similarities were also noted between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and singer Lady Gaga's 2011 single [...] "Born This Way" [...] both in subject matter and composition.|$|E

500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepiwall for HitFix {{called this}} the best overall episode since season four's December 2009 episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001". He {{wrote that the}} episode had [...] "some incredibly funny jokes", but noted that the [...] "most hilarious moments" [...] from [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] came from the main characters themselves. Sepinwall enjoyed Jack's videos to his unborn son, noting it was [...] "...the [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> love best: supremely confident and... oblivious to his own insanity." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club liked that the series had moved on from making the Liz character [...] "asexual and vaguely repellent" [...] for men. In his recap, Rabin much enjoyed the episode and said [...] "If {{the rest of the}} season is as good as the first two episodes, we could have a big-time comeback on our hands." [...] Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote that Paul Giamatti was a delight as his 30 Rock character. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett was thrilled that the Tracy character was a contestant on Cash Cab, noting once the game began [...] "everything felt so right". Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News preferred [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] to the episodes of Community and The Office, which aired on NBC the same night. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student wrote that Giamatti played his part brilliantly, and that his involvement in the main plot was [...] "well-written, well-organized, and by far the best thing about the episode".|$|E
