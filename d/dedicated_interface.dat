40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{methodology}} and a design tool for communication synthesis in reconfigurable embedded systems. Using our design tool, the designer can focus on the functional behavior of the design and on the evaluation of different mappings. All the low-level details of the reconfigurable resource, e. g., a multi-FPGA architecture, are hidden. After the application's tasks have been bound to FPGAs and a multi-configuration schedule has been generated, the communication synthesis step provides the necessary interfaces between tasks. Interface circuitry is automatically inserted to connect communicating tasks, whether they are mapped onto the same or onto different FPGAs. This includes multiplexing several logical communication channels over one physical channel, inserting routing tasks, and providing <b>dedicated</b> <b>interfaces</b> that {{solve the problem of}} interconfiguration communication...|$|R
5000|$|During WinHEC 2004, Microsoft listed speech {{recognition}} {{as part of}} its [...] "Longhorn" [...] mobile PC strategy to improve productivity and listed microphone arrays as a hardware opportunity for the operating system. At WinHEC 2005, Microsoft released additional details pertaining to {{speech recognition}} in Windows Vista with a focus on accessibility, new mobility scenarios, and improvements to the speech user experience. Unlike the speech support included in Windows XP, which was integrated with the Tablet PC Input Panel and required switching between dictation and command modes, Windows Vista would separate the feature from the Tablet PC Input Panel by introducing a <b>dedicated</b> <b>interface</b> for speech input on the desktop and would also unify the previously separate dictation and command modes. In previous versions of Windows, speech recognition would not allow a user to speak a command after dictation or vice versa without first switching between these two modes. Microsoft also stated that speech recognition in Windows Vista would improve dictation accuracy, and support additional languages and microphone arrays. A demonstration of the feature at WinHEC 2005 focused on e-mail dictation with correction and editing commands, and a set of slides dedicated to microphone arrays was also released. Windows Vista Beta 1 would include an integrated speech recognition application. In an effort to persuade company employees to interact with Windows Speech Recognition during its development, Microsoft offered an opportunity to win a Premium model of its Xbox 360 video game console.|$|E
