Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, <b>humulene,</b> xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and {{have the potential to}} be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from <b>humulene),</b> nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Humulene</b> {{is one of}} the {{components}} of the essential oil from the flowering cone of the hops plant, Humulus lupulus, from which it derives its name. The concentration of <b>humulene</b> varies among different varieties of the plant but can be up to 40% of the essential oil. <b>Humulene</b> and its reaction products in the brewing process of beer gives many beers their “hoppy” aroma. Noble hop varieties have been found to have higher levels of <b>humulene,</b> while other bitter hop varieties contain low levels. Multiple epoxides of <b>humulene</b> are produced in the brewing process. In a scientific study involving gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of samples and a trained sensory panel, {{it was found that the}} hydrolysis products of <b>humulene</b> epoxide II specifically produces a “hoppy” aroma in beer.|$|E

40|$|Germacrene A synthase (GAS) from Solidago canadensis catalyzes the {{conversion}} of farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) to the plant sesquiterpene (+) -germacrene A. After diphosphate expulsion, farnesyl cation reacts with the distal 10, 11 -double bond to afford germacrene A (> 96 %) and < 2 % α-humulene, which arises from 1, 11 -cyclization of FDP. The origin of the 1, 11 -activity of GAS was investigated by amino acid sequence alignments of 1, 10 - and 1, 11 -synthases and comparisons of X-ray crystal structures with the homology model of GAS; a triad [Thr 401 -Gly 402 -Gly 403] that might {{be responsible for the}} predominant 1, 10 -cyclization activity of GAS was identified. Replacement of Gly 402 with residues of increasing size led to a progressive increase of 1, 11 -cyclization. The catalytic robustness of these 1, 10 - / 1, 11 -GAS variants point to Gly 402 as a functional switch of evolutionary significance and suggests that enzymes with strict functionalities have evolved from less specific ancestors through a small number of substitutions. Similar results were obtained with germacrene D synthase (GDS) upon replacement of the homologous active-site residue Gly 404 : GDS-G 404 V generated approximately 20 % bicyclogermacrene, a hydrocarbon with a cyclopropane ring that underlines the dual 1, 10 -/ 1, 11 -cyclization activity of this mutant. This suggests that the reaction pathways to germacrenes and <b>humulenes</b> might be connected through a bridged 1, 10, 11 -carbocation intermediate or transition state that resembles bicyclogermacrene. Mechanistic studies using [1 - 3 H 1]- 10 -fluorofarnesyl diphosphate and deuterium-labeling experiments with [12, 13 - 2 H 6]-FDP support a germacrene–humulene rearrangement linking 1, 10 - and 1, 11 -pathways. These results support the bioinformatics proposal that modern 1, 10 -synthases could have evolved from promiscuous 1, 11 -sesquiterpene synthases...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{stability}} during storage of several compounds previously described for distinguishing hop varieties. Volatile compounds of five aromatic cultivars (Styrie, Saaz, Lublin, Mount Hood, and Hallertau) and six bitter cultivars (Northern Brewer, Nugget, Pride of Ringwood, Northdown, Target, and Challenger), stored at different temperatures, were extracted with a Likens-Nickerson simultaneous solvent extractor. Only compounds remaining stable through aging were kept to build an identification flowchart. Although very typical of fresh aromatic hops, farnesene proved much too unstable to be selected for distinguishing aged samples. 3 -Methylbutylisobutyrate, which authenticates all fresh European bitter hops, is also partially destroyed upon storage. On the other hand, bergamotene, alpha- and beta -selinene, methyl geranate, <b>humulene</b> epoxide II, alpha -amorphene, 2 -undecanone, and an unknown compound can be used to distinguish all cultivars whatever the storage temperature.

Photosynthetic rate, electron transport rate, fluorescence, leaf volatile terpene contents and root volatile terpene contents were analyzed. For both types, we found coeluting αpinene+βocimene, limonene, and <b>humulene</b> in leaves; and in the roots we found coeluting αpinene+βocimene, sabinene+βpinene, βmyrcene, limonene, and <b>humulene.</b> At the end of the growing cycle, COX plants tended to have lower pools of terpene compounds in their leaves, with 78. 6 % lower photosynthesis rates and 30. 8 % lower electron transport rates, compared with WT plants at that time. The maximal photochemical efficiency Fv/Fm was also significantly lower (25. 5 %) in COX plants, indicating that these varieties were more stressed than WT plants. However, COX plants had higher (239 %) root terpene contents compared to WT plants. COX plants appear to favor root production of volatile terpenes rather than leaf production.
