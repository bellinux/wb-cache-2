5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus <b>icaco).</b> Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E
25|$|The Tequesta {{gathered}} many plant foods, including {{saw palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) berries, cocoplums (Chrysobalanus <b>icaco),</b> sea grapes (Coccoloba uvifera), prickly pear (nopal) fruits (Opuntia spp.), gopher apples (Licania micbauxii), pigeon plums (Cocoloba diversifolia), palm nuts, false mastic seeds, cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and hog plum (Ximenia americana). The roots of certain plants, such as Smilax spp. and coontie (Zamia integrifolia), were edible when ground into flour, processed to remove toxins (in {{the case of}} coontie), and made into a type of unleavened bread. (Archaeologists have commented, however, {{on the lack of}} evidence for coontie use in excavated sites.) Briton Hammond, the sole survivor of an English sloop that was attacked by Tequestas after grounding off Key Biscayne in 1748, reported that the Tequestas fed him boil'd corn.|$|E
50|$|Chrysobalanus <b>icaco,</b> the cocoplum, Paradise Plum, abajeru and <b>icaco,</b> {{is found}} near sea beaches and inland {{throughout}} tropical Africa, tropical Americas and the Caribbean, and in southern Florida and the Bahamas. It {{is also found}} as an exotic species on other tropical islands, where {{it has become a}} problematic invasive. Although taxonomists disagree on whether Chrysobalanus <b>icaco</b> has multiple subspecies or varieties, it is recognized as having two ecotypes, described as an inland, much less salt-tolerant, and more upright C. <b>icaco</b> var. pellocarpus and a coastal C. <b>icaco</b> var. <b>icaco.</b> Both the ripe fruit of C. <b>icaco,</b> and the seed inside the ridged shell it contains, are considered edible.|$|E

50|$|Chrysobalanaceae is {{a family}} of {{flowering}} plants, consisting of trees and shrubs in 18 genera and about 533 species of pantropical distribution with a centre of diversity in the Amazon.

The widespread species Chrysobalanus <b>icaco</b> produces a plum-like fruit and the plant {{is commonly known as}} the coco plum.|$|E
50|$|Western {{pine forests}} {{are found in}} the {{northern}} and southern plains surrounding the Sierra de los Órganos in Pinar del Río Province and on the northern half of Isla de la Juventud. Annual precipitation is less than 1500 mm, with a dry season from November to April and a rainy season from May to October. The temperature ranges from 21.5 to 28 C, averaging 25 C, and is somewhat less at higher elevations. Pino macho (Pinus caribaea var. caribaea), which may reach heights of up to 30 m, and pino hembra (Pinus tropicalis) dominate the canopy. Other species such include peralejo (Byrsonima crassifolia), palma barrigona (Colpothrinax wrightii), <b>icaco</b> (Chrysobalanus <b>icaco</b> var. hellocarpus), encino (Quercus sagraeana), Calophyllum pinetorum, Erythroxylum minutifolium, Phania cajalbanica, Vaccinium cubense, Hyperbaena columbica, Clusia rosea, Copernicia species, yuraguano (Coccothrinax yuraguana), Aristida species and Andropogon species. Ferritic soils in Pinar del Río, such as in the Cajálbana plateau, are home to Pinus caribaea var. caribaea and an understory rich in endemic species. Mixed pine forests develop over oligotrophic quartzitic yellow soils in northern Pinar del Río province and Isla de la Juventud. They feature Pinus caribaea var. caribaea, P. tropicalis, and, possibly, Quercus sagraeana. Dry, rocky pine forests found on the southern side of the Cajálbana plateau include pines, thorny scrublands, and Agave cajalbanensis, an endemic succulent.|$|E
50|$|Fajardo {{is popular}} among tourists, {{especially}} local tourists, {{because of its}} seafood, hotels, closeness to the small islands of Palomino, <b>Icacos</b> and Palominito, and the many daily trips that are (or were) available to Vieques and Culebra, both by boat and by the four airlines that served Fajardo Airport (now closed): Air Culebra, Air St. Thomas, Isla Nena Air and Vieques Air Link.|$|R
50|$|Leptodactylus nesiotus is {{a species}} of frog in the Leptodactylidae family.
