50|$|The {{driver was}} {{seated on a}} Brooks bicycle saddle, which in {{recognition}} of the lack of vehicle suspension, was carried {{on the end of a}} cantilevered bar that acted as a leaf spring. A wide handlebar on the engine group was used for steering. A squeeze bar the width of this handlebar engaged the clutch. Controls included a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle,</b> a gear <b>lever</b> with two forward and one reverse gears, and a large handbrake lever. The engine unit rotated freely for a full 360° rotation. When used in reverse, the Auto-Truck could either be driven from the saddle, looking backwards over the driver's shoulder; or they could dismount, swivel the engine unit around and control it as a pedestrian-controlled truck from behind.|$|R
50|$|The flight {{commands}} are duplicated, {{with the}} front seat's center stick, <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> rudder pedals and brake pedals mechanically connected to the rear seat's. The rear stick and the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> can be disassembled when carrying passenger(s).|$|R
50|$|The <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> {{assembly}} {{is often}} designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R
5000|$|HOTAS, {{an acronym}} of Hands On Throttle-And-Stick, {{is the name}} given {{to the concept of}} placing buttons and {{switches}} on the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> and flight control stick in an aircraft's cockpit, allowing pilots to access vital cockpit functions and fly the aircraft without having to remove their <b>hands</b> from the <b>throttle</b> and flight controls. Application of the concept was pioneered with the Ferranti AIRPASS radar and gunsight control system used by the English Electric Lightning and is widely used on all modern fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the A-10A/A-10C and others.|$|R
50|$|The {{dual control}} <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> are {{situated}} between the legs, and pivot {{from side to}} side so can be folded out of the way making entry and exit of the aircraft easier.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of each lever {{can be described}} by the current angle indicated. This {{is referred to as}} the <b>Throttle</b> <b>Lever</b> Angle or TLA. The greater the TLA, the greater the engine thrust.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} flown {{for a long}} time with a throttle problem. The pilots had a higher workload because they had to operate the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> for the left and right engines independently.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} column {{passes through the}} straight dashboard and spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> worked in sectors inside the wheel rim. All main bearing were lubricated by a force feed lubricator, located {{in front of the}} dashboard. Sight glasses were attached to the left-hand side of the engine.|$|R
50|$|After {{the second}} circuit Erich Warsitz set the He 178 {{up for the}} landing. The turbine responded to the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> very obediently. Just above the ground he {{corrected}} the machine’s attitude, pulled off a perfect landing {{and came to a}} halt just short of the waters of the Warnow.|$|R
50|$|So for example, if the {{throttle}} valve is {{moved up to}} let more fuel in, it will mean that {{the throttle}} valve has moved into a position which allows more fuel to flow through {{and on the other}} side, the required pressure ports are opened to keep the pressure balance so that the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> stays where it is.|$|R
50|$|Like motorcycles, Morgans had <b>hand</b> <b>throttles,</b> Bowden-wire control mechanisms, and drip lubrication.|$|R
50|$|The engine <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> can {{is turned}} up {{to provide the}} proper {{rotational}} speed.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{pneumatic}} {{die grinder}} throttles (also called triggers) feature a spring-loaded [...] "kickstand" [...] mechanism between the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> {{and the body}} of the grinder. This prevents the throttle from opening (being pressed down towards {{the body of the}} grinder) without operator intervention and inhibits accidental activation. It is similar in principle to the safety catches used on many handguns.|$|R
2500|$|A miswired {{flight control}} system led to two minor {{injuries}} when the left nacelle struck the ground while the aircraft was hovering [...] in the air, causing it to bounce and catch fire on 11 June 1991. [...] The pilot, Grady Wilson, suspected {{that he may have}} accidentally set the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> the opposite direction to that intended, exacerbating the crash if not causing it.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 {{model was}} a larger touring car. Equipped with a rear {{entrance}} tonneau body, it could seat 5 passengers and sold for US$3500. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-4, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 24hp (17.9kW). A 3-speed sliding transmission was fitted. The channel steel-framed car weighed 2350lb (1066kg). This modern Système Panhard car had spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> on steering wheel, a novelty at the time.|$|R

25|$|As {{he moved}} about the {{locomotive}} works of New England gathering experience and {{an eye for}} engineering detail, he also produced his first book, The <b>Throttle</b> <b>Lever.</b> Designed as {{an introduction to the}} steam locomotive, this became the standard U.S. textbook on building locomotives. It not only took Colburn, then not 20, deeper into the world of publishing, but also earned him wider respect amongst railroad men across America – locomotive builders and train operators.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard General Electric J79 jet engine, a Rocketdyne AR2-3 rocket engine was fitted {{at the base of}} the vertical fin. This engine burned a mixture of JP-4 jet fuel and 90% hydrogen peroxide oxidizer solution. The NF-104 carried enough oxidizer for approximately 100 seconds of rocket engine operation. The thrust level could be adjusted to maximum or approximately half power by the pilot using an additional <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> on the left side of the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{features}} a conventional centre stick and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> controls. The pilot {{sits in a}} Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat which has had impressive performance in emergency escapes.|$|R
50|$|On August 11, 2010 fifteen {{people were}} injured as a train entered a curve at the park going between 12 and 17 mph, causing {{five of the six}} cars to tip over. An {{investigation}} determined the operator was not adequately trained in steam locomotive operation which resulted in confusion of the brake and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers.</b> The state fined Tiny Town $30,500 consisting of $1000 per incident the operator operated the train and $500 for not having documented training of emergency and safety procedures.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand-operated}} {{gear and}} rear-wheel brake controls {{are on the}} driver's right {{but there is a}} door for the driver which there was not on the 30-98 or 25. The spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> are on the steering wheel together with an air lever working a valve in the induction pipe (after the throttle). There is also a mixture control (choke) on the dash. Gear and brake levers are well to hand. Accelerator and (transmission) brake pedals were set close together.|$|R
50|$|All {{models were}} {{delivered}} {{from the factory}} with a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle.</b> Options available included a reserve parachute and electric starting. The line was noted for its unusually long three year warranty.|$|R
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{inspected}} {{the wreckage of}} Flight 3130 and {{found that there was}} not a single indication of a rotation on the propeller during the crash. Further inspection on the wreckage revealed that the propeller, mixture and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> were all the way back. This indicated that the engine might have not running at the time of the crash. The engine could have been shut down by Captain Abdul. There are three possibilities that caused the shutdown; those are engine fire, engine failure, or an emergency procedure.|$|R

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|R
50|$|The AIRPASS {{system was}} {{announced}} in late June 1958 and the radar was carried by interceptor aircraft from the early 1960s. It was initially linked to the de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missile. Also known as the Ferranti AI.23. AIRPASS was developed by Ferranti Ltd on Ferry Road in Edinburgh. It introduced the HOTAS (Hands On Throttle-And-Stick) system whereby the radar and gun sight controls were situated on the control column and <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> instead of elsewhere in the cockpit, {{eliminating the need for}} the pilot to take his hands off the controls while making an interception.|$|R
50|$|A Takeoff/Go-around switch (TO/GA) is {{a switch}} on the {{autothrottle}} of modern large aircraft, with two modes: takeoff (TO) and go-around (GA). The mode {{is dependent on the}} phase of flight; usually, on approach to land, the autopilot will be set to approach mode, therefore if the TO/GA switch is pressed it will activate the go-around mode of the autothrottle; conversely, when take-off is set on the autopilot, the switch activates take off mode of the autothrottle. On Boeing aircraft TO/GA modes are selected by a separate switch near the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers,</b> but on Airbus aircraft it is activated by pushing the thrust levers fully forward to the TO/GA detent.|$|R
50|$|The G-36A {{also had}} French {{instruments}} (with metric calibration), radio and gunsight. The throttle was modified {{to conform to}} French pre-war practice: the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> was moved towards the pilot (i.e. backward) to increase engine power. The armament {{which was to be}} fitted in France was six 7.5 mm (.296 in) Darne machine guns (two in the fuselage and four in the wings). The first G-36A was flown on 11 May 1940. After France's defeat in the Battle of France, all contracts were taken over by Britain. The throttle was modified again, four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) guns were installed in the wings and most traces of the original ownership removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{supercharger}} {{was rather}} basic {{in the early}} models, using a single-stage two-speed design directly geared to the engine (unlike the DB 601's hydraulically clutched version) which led to rather limited altitude performance, in keeping with its intended medium-altitude usage. One key advancement was the Kommandogerät (command-device), a mechanical-hydraulic unit that automatically adjusted engine fuel flow, propeller pitch, supercharger setting, mixture and ignition timing {{in response to a}} single <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> dramatically simplifying engine control. The Kommandogerät could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|R
5000|$|Power Console (PI-PD7) - An {{unreleased}} cockpit-sized controller that attaches {{onto the}} SuperGraph unit itself, connecting via the expansion port {{on the front}} side. The peripheral would've added numerous control options such as an eight-way joystick, four action buttons, a flight yoke with two triggers (one on each handle), a <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> a jog dial, three mode switches, an LCD panel, an LED indicator, four additional controller ports and a numerical keypad. The Power Console {{was scheduled to be}} released in Spring 1990 with a suggested retail price of 59,800 yen, but was never released due to its high production cost and the poor sales of the SuperGrafx itself.|$|R
5000|$|Wolfgang Dallach's Sunrise, marketed ready-to-fly or {{in kit form}} by his WD Flugzeug Leichtbau (WDFL), was {{his first}} {{ultralight}} design. In Germany {{it was the first}} ultralight equipped with a four-stroke engine. The Sunrise is a tandem two-seater. Both seats are equipped with a <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> rudder and control stick. Full engine control is available only from the rear seat. The fuselage is built from steel tubes and is fabric covered. The wing has a nose made of fiberglass [...] The main spar is built from CFK. The Sunrise has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with the mainwheels hinged from the fuselage on V-form, cross-connected struts. Some Sunrises have wheel fairings.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 June 2013 - {{collided}} with Manly Wharf after a malfunction of the <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever,</b> causing major {{damage to the}} bow above the waterline, {{as well as the}} timber arrester {{at the end of the}} wharf.|$|R
25|$|The Mirage 2000 is {{available}} as a single-seat or two-seat multi-role fighter. The pilot flies the aircraft {{by means of a}} centre stick and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttles,</b> with both incorporating hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a SEM MB Mk10 zero-zero ejection seat (a license-built version of the British Martin-Baker Mark 10).|$|R
50|$|Peripherals {{specifically}} designed for use with driving simulations include RailDriver by US manufacturer P.I. Engineering. RailDriver is a programmable desktop cab controller with <b>throttle,</b> brake <b>lever</b> and switches designed to work with Trainz, TrainMaster, Microsoft Train Simulator and Rail Simulator.|$|R
