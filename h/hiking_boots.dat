He {{borrowed}} {{a pair of}} <b>hiking</b> <b>boots</b> and a knapsack and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked {{the rest of the}} way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.|$|E
5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown <b>hiking</b> <b>boots.</b> The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as a contrast to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair.|$|E

25|$|Areas {{of recent}} lava flows {{continue}} {{to represent a}} hazard long after the lava has cooled. Where young flows have created new lands, land is more unstable and can break-off into the sea. Flows often crack deeply, forming dangerous chasms, and a fall against 'a'a lava is similar to falling against broken glass. Rugged <b>hiking</b> <b>boots,</b> long pants, and gloves are recommended when crossing lava flows.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{activity}} {{for which they}} are designed, some types of footwear may fit into multiple categories. For example, Cowboy boots are considered boots, but may also be worn in more formal occasions and used as dress shoes. <b>Hiking</b> <b>boots</b> incorporate many of the protective features of boots, but also provide the extra flexibility and comfort of many athletic shoes. Flip-flops are considered casual footwear, but have also been worn in formal occasions, such as visits to the White House.|$|E
5000|$|Upper - The {{upper part}} of a <b>hiking</b> <b>boot</b> is {{intended}} to protect and support the foot with an all-over snug fit. Uppers should be water repellant/proof, but allow the feet to breathe to prevent excess moisture from causing blisters and other discomfort.|$|R
5000|$|For casual riding, riders often wear well-worn show boots, {{but also}} may take {{advantage}} of new boot designs modeled after the athletic shoe or <b>hiking</b> <b>boot</b> that have been created, using space age synthetics and breathable materials to create what essentially is a [...] "tennis shoe with a heel." ...|$|R

The collection included the Storm boot, a three-season fabric <b>hiking</b> <b>boot.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Hiking</b> <b>boots</b> are {{designed}} to provide extra ankle and arch support, as well as extra padding for comfort during hiking. They are constructed to provide comfort for miles of walking over rough terrains, and protect the hiker's feet against water, mud, rocks, and other wilderness obstacles. These boots support the ankle to avoid twisting but do not restrict the ankle's movement too much. They are fairly stiff to support the foot. A properly fitted boot and/or friction-reducing patches applied to troublesome areas ensures protection against blisters and other discomforts associated with long hikes on rugged terrain.|$|E
500|$|Seattle and Aberdeen, Washington were logging {{towns and}} hence, the {{lumberjack}} attire {{was a common}} sight in the thrift stores for the low prices that musicians could afford. Grunge style consisted of ripped jeans, thermal underwear, mom jeans, Doc Martens boots or combat boots (often unlaced), band T-shirts, oversized knit sweaters, long and droopy skirts, ripped tights, Birkenstocks, <b>hiking</b> <b>boots,</b> and eco-friendly clothing made from recycled textiles or fair trade organic cotton. As well, since women in the grunge scene wore the [...] "...same plaid s, boots, and short cropped heads as their male counterparts", women showed [...] "...that they are not defined by their sex appeal." ...|$|E
500|$|The river {{can also}} be {{accessed}} by steep, unmaintained trails called [...] "routes" [...] or [...] "draws" [...] on {{the north and south}} rim. These routes require about two hours to hike down and two to four hours to hike back up, depending on which route is taken. [...] All inner canyon descents are strenuous and require Class 3 climbing and basic route finding skills. Steep talus, impassable ledges, and lack of cover are some of the challenges hikers are faced with. Poison ivy also grows abundantly in the draws and on the canyon floor. Long sleeves and <b>hiking</b> <b>boots</b> are strongly recommended. The flow rate of the Gunnison River should also be considered for those planning on camping in the canyon, as high river levels can wash out the camp sites. The National Park Service warns the following: [...] "Routes are difficult to follow, and only individuals in excellent physical condition should attempt these hikes... Hikers are expected to find their own way and to be prepared for self-rescue." [...] A free back country permit is required for all inner canyon use except at the west end.|$|E

Duke and Kathy Jones sold Hi-Tec Sports USA to Frank Van Wezel in 1990.|$|R
2500|$|Footwear such as {{a tennis}} shoe or a <b>hiking</b> <b>boot</b> is {{considered}} inappropriate for riding both because the shoe {{has little or no}} raised heel and because the heavy tread that provides traction for athletic endeavors can cause the foot to catch in the stirrup and become trapped. [...] Modern synthetic materials have allowed the design of riding boots that will slide from a stirrup but are also comfortable for walking, with a sole using varying hard and soft materials that provides reasonable traction with a minimal amount of raised tread.|$|R
50|$|Gaiters are {{a type of}} {{protective}} clothing for a person's ankles and legs below the knee. Gaiters are worn when walking, hiking, running (especially orienteering and rogaining) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or in snow, with or without snowshoes. Heavy gaiters are often worn when using crampons, to protect the leg and ankle from the spikes of the opposite foot. Gaiters strap over the <b>hiking</b> <b>boot</b> and around the person's leg to provide protection from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from entering {{the top of the}} boot. Gaiters may also be worn as protection against snake bites.|$|R
500|$|Lara Croft's {{likeness}} {{has been}} a model for merchandise. The first action figures were produced by Toy Biz, based on the video game version of the character. Playmates Toys released a series of action figures that depict Croft in different outfits and accessories from the video games, later producing figures modelled after Jolie for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. Graphic designer Marc Klinnert of Studio OXMOX released [...] scale model kits of the character, and later built a full-scale version. Arcade: The Videogame Magazine and PlayStation Magazine promoted life-size Croft statues as contest prizes. Spurred by a rumour that Eidos provided Lara Croft autographs, fans wrote to the company to obtain them. The quantity prompted Eidos to quickly produce autographed cards to meet demand. Tomb Raider: Underworld themes and wallpapers featuring the character were released for the PlayStation 3. Xbox Live Marketplace released Xbox 360 avatars in conjunction with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Eidos released a brand of Lara Croft apparel and accessories, marketed under the label [...] "LARA". The line included wallets, watches, bathrobes, and Zippo lighters. Other third-party apparel are <b>hiking</b> <b>boots,</b> backpacks, leather jackets, and thermoses. Croft's likeness has also appeared on French postage stamps, PlayStation memory cards, and trading cards {{as part of a}} collectible card game. In October 1997, Eidos held an art exhibition titled [...] "Lara Goes Art" [...] in Hamburg, Germany to promote Tomb Raider II. The exhibit featured selected artwork of the character submitted by artists and fans. Pieces included oil and airbrushed paintings, photo comics, and Klinnert's model; SZM Studios provided the computer-generated footage it had created for Die Ärzte's music video and the Brigitte magazine television commercial.|$|E

50|$|Dave Page (born 1939) is {{considered}} the world's leading expert on mountaineering footwear history, {{as well as an}} expert cobbler (a <b>hiking</b> <b>boot</b> repairman). He is a former history professor at the University of Washington and is a cobbler based in Seattle, Washington, United States. He has been resoling mountain boots since 1968. He works closely with boot manufacturers worldwide doing a wide range of innovative resoling and repair work. Forensic anthropologists called on Dave Page to help identify the manufacturer of the boots found on the body of George Mallory. Page has made many historic mountain climbing ascents among contemporaries Fred Beckey and other notable cascade climbers of the 20th century; these included ascents in the Himalayas.|$|R
50|$|Captain Wiles (Edmund Gwenn) is {{sure that}} he killed the man with a stray shot from his rifle while hunting, until it is shown he {{actually}} shot a rabbit. Jennifer Rogers (Shirley MacLaine), Harry's estranged wife, believes she killed Harry because she hit him hard with a milk bottle. Miss Gravely (Mildred Natwick) is certain that the man died after a blow from the heel of her <b>hiking</b> <b>boot</b> when he lunged at {{her out of the}} bushes (still reeling from the blow received at the hands of Jennifer). Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe), an attractive and nonconformist artist, is open-minded about the whole event, and is prepared to help his friends and neighbors in any way he can. In any case, no one is upset at all about Harry's death.|$|R
5000|$|This type of shoe {{generally}} has a soft outsole (as {{compared with a}} road shoe) and a molded internal midsole. They are shaped more like a street or trail shoe with a less exaggerated [...] "rocker" [...] allowing a more normal gait. The outsole usually has a lugged pattern which is like a day <b>hiking</b> <b>boot</b> and is a compromise between an aggressive off shoe and an old-style touring shoe. These shoes have a molded midsole which protects the rider's foot from the pedal and transfers energy more evenly without a pressure point at the exact shoe/pedal contact points. It also allows for the attachment of a clipless pedal cleat and can {{be more or less}} walked in normally. There is almost always a rectangular cutout in the outsole where a piece of the outsole material is removed by the purchaser or bicycle store, under which is the midsole and two oval slots where the cleats are bolted on. Most of these cleats follow Shimano's [...] "SPD" [...] system. Other two-bolt cleat and pedal systems for use with casual cycling and MTB shoes are produced by Crank Brothers, Speedplay and Ritchey, to name a few. Casual cycling shoes normally have a US retail price of under $100. Sizes range from 35 to 50 in European sizing.|$|R

50|$|Sturdy and {{comfortable}} boots or shoes are essential because workers {{are on their}} feet much of the day. <b>Hiking</b> or safety <b>boots</b> are preferred because they protect feet from injury. Open-toed shoes or sandals are not allowed because bare feet can easily be injured. An extra pair of socks is beneficial when it rains or is cold. Gloves of two types are needed. First responders wear welder's gloves or Nomex gloves protect their hands when pushing a hot car or removing a hot car part from the racing surface. Other workers may wear insulated gloves to protect their hands from the cold.|$|R
5000|$|Founded in 1963 by Sante Mazzarolo in Asolo, Italy, {{the company}} started out making <b>hiking</b> and ski <b>boots,</b> but quickly shifted its focus to making boots for motocross racing, and road racing boots shortly thereafter.

40|$|Although {{humans are}} a major {{mechanism}} for short and long distance seed dispersal, there is limited research testing clothing as a vector. The effect {{of different types of}} material (sports versus hiking socks), or different items of clothing (boots, socks, laces versus legs) or the same item (socks) worn in different places on seed composition were assessed in Kosciuszko National Park, Australia. Data was analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA, independent and paired t-tests, Multidimensional Scaling Ordinations and Analysis of Similarity. A total of 24776 seeds from 70 taxa were collected from the 207 pieces of clothing sampled, with seed identified from 31 native and 19 non-native species. Socks worn off-track collected more native seeds while those worn on roadsides collected more non-native seeds. Sports socks collected a greater diversity of seeds and more native seeds than <b>hiking</b> socks. <b>Boots,</b> uncovered socks and laces collect more seeds than covered socks and laces, resulting in 17 % fewer seeds collected when wearing trousers. With seeds from over 179 species (134 recognized weeds) collected on clothing in this, and nine other studies, it is clear that clothing contributes to unintended human mediated seed dispersal, including for many invasive species.

50|$|A climber chooses {{equipment}} {{according to}} the slope and texture of the ice. For example, on flat ice, almost any good <b>hiking</b> or mountaineering <b>boot</b> will usually suffice, but for serious ice climbing double plastic mountaineering boots or their stiff leather equivalent are usually used, which must be crampon compatible and stiff enough to support the climber and maintain ankle support. On short, low angled slopes, one can use an ice axe to chop steps. For longer and steeper slopes or glacier travel, crampons are mandatory for a safe climb. Vertical ice climbing is done with crampons and ice axes (those specific to vertical ice generally being called technical ice axes, or ice tools); climbers kick their legs to engage the front points of the crampons in the ice, and then swing the axe into the ice above their heads. This technique is known as front pointing. The strength of the ice is often surprising; even if the axe goes in only a centimeter or so {{it is enough to}} pull up on. If a climber is leading, they will need to place ice screws as protection on the way up (see climbing system). Most mountaineers would only consider the last scenario true ice climbing; the less steep variations are routine aspects of winter mountaineering.|$|R
5000|$|Kesha has {{declared}} {{that it is}} important for her, with Warrior and her live performances of [...] "Die Young", to display her vocal ability due to the backlash she has received about using excessive auto-tune. Kesha first performed [...] "Die Young" [...] on October 29, 2012 in El Rey Theatre. Emily Zemler of The Hollywood Reporter reviewed the performance, blogging: [...] "If pop music demands an element of theatrical presentation, then Ke$ha angled toward a literal interpretation of her raucous, sexualized pop songs". DJed by Herick Hell, Kesha performed various other songs including [...] "Party at a Rich Dude's House", [...] "Cannibal", and [...] "We R Who We R". Clad in a rhinestone one-piece, Kesha wore a gold diadem while being carried by muscular cabana boy look-a-likes. The set was rife with green laser beams and giant artificial phalli. On November 6, 2012, Kesha made the song's first televised performance on The X Factor Australia's fourth season. On November 20, 2012, Kesha performed [...] "Die Young" [...] at The Today Show in New York, NY. The performance was held in the Rockefeller Plaza, and she wore a camouflage leotard adorned with an upside cross and rainbow-colored paper flowers. Along with [...] "Die Young", she performed her other smash hits, [...] "Blow" [...] and [...] "We R Who We R". Billboard congratulated [...] "Die Young"s performance at the American Music Awards of 2012 as being one of the five best performances that night. On December 4, 2012, Kesha performed [...] "Die Young" [...] at the late-night show Conan. For the music journal, Jason Lipshutz wrote:"Ke$ha's performance of new single [...] "Die Young" [...] was resoundingly Ke$ha-esque: there were flashing neon lasers, skeleton drummer-dancers, an inexplicable headdress at the beginning and a totally explicable crotch-grab in the middle. With blonde pigtails running across her shoulders and black leather <b>boots</b> <b>hiked</b> up to her knees, Ke$ha was often carried on the shoulders of shirtless men with a look of unabashed joy on her face - a fitting image for a single about shirking tomorrow's responsibilities for carnal impulses." ...|$|R
