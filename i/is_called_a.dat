The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E

A four and a five-ball throw would <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> quadruplex and a quintuplex, respectively.|$|R
5|$|If all entries of A {{below the}} main {{diagonal}} are zero, A is called an upper triangular matrix.

5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> polynucleotide.|$|E

5|$|A forced {{variation}} {{that involves}} a sacrifice and usually {{results in a}} tangible gain <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> combination. Brilliant combinations– {{such as those in}} the Immortal Game– are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers.

5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Póvoa de Varzim <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> Poveiro {{which can be}} {{rendered}} into English as Povoan.

The number goes up to 100,000 if adjacent satellite areas are taken into account, ranking it as the seventh largest independent urban area in Portugal, within a polycentric agglomeration of about 3 million people, ranging from Braga to Porto.|$|E
5|$|A nonzero scalar {{multiple}} of an identity matrix <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> scalar matrix. If the matrix entries {{come from a}} field, the scalar matrices form a group, under matrix multiplication, that is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of the field.|$|E

50|$|An island or isle is {{any piece}} of sub-continental land that is {{surrounded}} by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can <b>be</b> <b>called</b> islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> eyot or ait, and a small {{island off the coast}} may <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> holm.

5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> naya or {{a partial}} viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada {{does not deny}} the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} USB device may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). This kind of device <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|A second {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} triggering a TypeIa supernova is {{the merger of}} two white dwarfs whose combined mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. The resulting merger <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. In such a case, the total mass would not be constrained by the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory of}} strings that {{incorporates}} {{the idea of}} supersymmetry <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> superstring theory. There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E
