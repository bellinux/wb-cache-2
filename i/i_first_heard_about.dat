In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the series.

5000|$|The West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum was a {{group of}} mental {{institutions}} built in West Yorkshire, England in the 1880s. Sergio Pizzorno further explained the choice of album title: [...] "The album isn't about the place, <b>I</b> just <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it on a TV documentary, and the words just struck me. I love the way it looked and the feeling it evokes. Apparently, {{it was one of the}} first loony bins for the poor, before that it was mainly rich people who got treatment." [...] The album cover depicts the band [...] "getting dressed up for a party at the asylum, looking in the mirror at the costumes". Inspiration for such cover originated from the artwork of Amon Düül II's album Made in Germany. In an interview with T4, the band said that each track is meant to represent an inmate within the asylum.|$|R
40|$|In {{the winter}} of 1997 I {{was working on a}} {{distributed}} object project using Java RMI. Not surprisingly, the project failed miserably because Java RMI didn’t address performance, scalability, fail-over, security, and transactions; qualities of service that are so vital in a production environment. Although that lesson was not new for me—I had seen the same thing happen with CORBA—the timing of the project was especially interesting. It was at that same time Enterprise JavaBeans was first introduced by Sun Microsystems – had Enterprise JavaBeans been available earlier, that same project probably would have succeeded. At the time I was working on that ill-fated Java RMI project, I was also writing a column for JavaReport Online called the “The Cutting Edge”. The column covered what were then, new Java technologies like Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) and the JavaMail API. I was actually looking for a new topic for the 3 rd edition of “The Cutting Edge”, when <b>I</b> discovered the <b>first</b> public draft of Enterprise JavaBeans, version 0. 8. <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> this technology in 1996...|$|R
40|$|Ruby Payne and her book, A Framework for Understanding Poverty (referred to {{hereafter}} as A Framework), are {{staples of}} multicultural education classes, staff development workshops, {{and the education}} equity milieu. I rarely engage in conversations about poverty or classism in schools without somebody fawning over Payne’s framework, exclaiming the virtues of her the work she’s doing to inform teachers about the “culture of poverty. ” I remember, about six years ago, when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> rumblings <b>about</b> the Ruby Payne phenomenon. I had been frustrated by {{what seemed to be}} a break in critical national dialogue concerning the relationship between poverty and education since Jonathan Kozol’s landmark Savage Inequalities (1992). Finally, I was led to believe, a scholar had emerged to lead the fight for socioeconomic equity in schools. And, like Kozol, she had been a classroom teacher. I was thrilled by the possibilities. Then I read A Framework. And I was horrified. I’ve written recently about several disturbing trends within education equity work that, together, are pulling the progressive umph! out of a once radical movement:...|$|R
2500|$|As one of {{the young}} male {{characters}} in the show he was invited {{to take part in a}} soap calendar for Now Magazine in 2004 alongside fellow actors Ben Freeman and Kelvin Fletcher. The character's final romantic storyline involved an affair with the married Sadie King, played by Patsy Kensit. This storyline received media attention when Kensit reportedly objected to a relationship with a younger actor believing her character should be portrayed as a [...] "more sophisticated man-eater". Kensit however clarified the reasons for this in an interview with Leeds Today News stating [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the storyline, I said 'but he looks like one of James's friends, so boyish and young'. But Karl is so adorable and we had a lot of fun filming those scenes". The brotherly feud which dominated much of Davies' time on the show was used by producers as the vehicle for a high profile attempt to compete with rival soap EastEnders in the television ratings war and to secure Emmerdales place as the second most popular soap opera in the UK. The chosen storyline involved Andy's attempts to kill Robert which led to his father, Jack Sugden being shot. The story was to prove a success securing viewing figures of 7.6 million compared with 6.4 million for EastEnders. This was the first time Emmerdale has secured such a ratings victory.|$|E

As I was in -- in that 48-hour time period read the grand jury presentment, I reached the conclusion that given what had become public about the issues leading up to the presentment and given what was {{said in the}} presentment itself about Coach Paterno's testimony and about what the graduate student said to Coach Paterno, I felt that it would not send the right message if Coach Paterno was able to lead the football team out onto the field of play under those circumstances. So I didn't change my mind {{on the question of whether}} we had established all the key facts that related to Coach Paterno's involvement and/or responsibility. But I had reached the conclusion that, from the standpoint of what the University's values would be interpreted to be by the broader public, that what was known was sufficiently serious as it relates to child sexual abuse that it would send the wrong message about our values as a University if Coach Paterno were allowed to coach as though none of this had ever happened." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> the idea <b>about</b> doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|R
40|$|A symbol {{is unique}} {{as a form}} of {{communication}} in that it holds no meaning standing alone, but rather gains meaning by people. As such a symbol can sometimes lead one astray for its meaning is liquid. A symbol that once represented something beautiful can be used by a sinister group, and through that become an icon of evil. Such a symbol can be found here at Gettysburg College: the Swastika. I found this symbol decorating the floor tiles of the second floor entrance to Breidenbaugh Hall. What the symbol represents may not be as ambiguous as it may seem, as the Swastika has been around almost as long as man has, its significance ever changing. I had a hunch as to its meaning but in order to uncover what indeed was behind this symbol when it was <b>first</b> laid down <b>I</b> must examine multiple the conditions under which the building was constructed, and the times in which it was completed. I had an idea as to the meaning of the symbol in Breidenbaugh Hall before I started my research. The swastika is a symbol that {{has been around for a}} very long time, its common use beginning as early as 1000 B. C. 1 Needless to say, the symbol’s meaning changed over the years granting it volumes of uses. My guess was that the swastika on the floor of Breidenbaugh meant good luck. <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> that meaning behind the swastika when I saw the nose cone of Charles Lindbergh’s airplane at the Air and Space museum: the nose cone has a swastika in its center.

After seeing the movie, I didn’t really DO anything with it until {{we were working on}} “We Are The Others.” But the basic idea of the lyrics was there. It was just supposed to be a song about “we are the others” and a feeling of togetherness. On the one hand, being proud of whoever you are, whether you divert from the norm in whatever way you divert from the norm. But on the other hand, it is also kind of a song for “others”.

When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> this creature - supposedly human, supposedly born of a woman - I could not believe the unthinkable things I was told.
