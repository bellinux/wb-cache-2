40|$|Swiss farmers {{produce a}} {{relatively}} small amount of <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco,</b> but the production is highly protected by a price support agreement between the Swiss cigarette industry and the tobacco farmers which is promoted by the state. The Swiss manufacturing industry {{on the other hand}} benefits from zero tariffs on <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco,</b> high tariffs on cigarette imports and a relatively favourable tobacco control environment. The paper illustrates the existing tobacco policies and arrangements, examines the determinants which help to maintain the given market structure and asks about the possible impact a liberalization of the respective trade policy would bring about. 3 1 INTRODUCTION [...] . ...|$|R

30|$|Determination of {{nicotine}} level in tobacco {{is crucial to}} control, maintain or reduce nicotine levels below the addictive as well as harmful threshold. Therefore, the knowledge {{of nicotine}} level in tobacco is especially important to tobacco industry and {{in the area of}} toxicology to control its harmful effect on health. There are two reports on the levels of nicotine in Ethiopian cigarette tobacco (Geto et al. 2012; Kassa et al. 2013). However, there is no report in the literature on nicotine level of Ethiopian <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves. Hence, it was worth to determine the levels of nicotine in some of Ethiopian <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves based on difference in species, cultivation areas and stalk (leaf) positions.|$|R

30|$|This study {{revealed}} that there was large difference between the heavy metal content of <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves and processed tobacco. The large increment in composition of heavy metals in processed tobacco was observed for all the detected metals. This indicated that the metal contents that determined in cigarette are not only the content of raw leaves itself but also the metal originated from contamination of raw leaves during the process, starting from harvesting to cigarette manufacturing. Therefore, to control further contamination of tobacco leaves with toxic metals, well treatments in handling, transportation and storage of tobacco leaves are recommended.|$|R
30|$|The {{nicotine}} content of tobacco leaves generally ranges from 0.3 to 3  %, though 5  % and even 7  % {{have been recorded}} in some heavy bodied tobaccos (Blakely and Bates 1998). Wang et al. (2008) in a study from China reported the nicotine level ranging from 0.78 to 3.26  % depending upon different leaf position and different treatment. Geto et al. (2012) reported the nicotine level in two brands of Ethiopian cigarette tobacco as 3.84 and 4.26  %, while Kassa et al. (2013) reported the nicotine levels in another two brands of Ethiopian cigarette tobacco as 2.04 and 2.54  %. Thus, the nicotine level of Ethiopian <b>raw</b> (unprocessed) Virginia <b>tobacco</b> leaves (3.26  %) are comparable to the nicotine levels reported in other studies. While the nicotine levels in other two Ethiopian <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves (Gaya 1.11  % and Burley 0.650  %) are lower than that in Virginia but comparable {{to that in the}} other tobacco leaves (Blakely and Bates 1998; Wang et al. 2008).|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, at {{the climax of}} the anti-KANU efforts that were mostly led by Kikuyu politicians, the Kikuyu youth groupings known as Mungiki became indistinguishable from the Kenyan Rastafarians. Both groups spotted dreadlocks, reproductions of the Ethiopian green, yellow and red flag and both were known for heavy smoking of cigarettes, <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> and marijuana. Due to their low-class and peri-urban status, many Kikuyu matatu drivers, {{conductors}} and operators who were reggae lovers inadvertently became members of the Mungiki movement. Even today, the average Kenyan associates the Rastafarian green, yellow and red regalia with Mungiki although the Mungiki sect officially identifies itself with the colours green, white, red and black.|$|R
5000|$|Ybor City was a {{thriving}} immigrant neighborhood during Al López's childhood {{with a population}} of over 10,000.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether occupational exposure to <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> causes respiratory or allergic diseases, {{an excess of}} respiratory symptoms, a decrease in lung function, or parenchymal changes in chest radiography among Finnish cigar workers. METHODS: This cross sectional study included all Finnish cigar workers (n = 106) exposed to <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> and also a group of unexposed matched referents. Data were collected with a self administered questionnaire, flow volume spirometry, measurements of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, chest radiography and skin prick tests. A questionnaire was also sent to former workers of the factory. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chest radiography findings. Nine of 102 tobacco workers had pulmonary fibrosis of at least 1 / 0 (according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 1980 classification) and the corresponding figure was five for the referents. The tobacco workers tended to have a low forced vital capacity (FVC), and they had impaired forced expiratory volume in 1 second and lower means of the maximal expiratory flow at 25 % of the FVC significantly more often than the referents. Diffusing capacity tended to be lower among the referents. The referents more often had atopy and earlier atopic diseases than the exposed workers. These results indicate the possibility of selection among the exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: No excess of prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the tobacco workers was found. According to the questionnaire episodes of allergic alveolitis may have occurred in the cigar factory workers. However, in the absence of impairments in lung function and radiological changes it was not possible to distinguish humidifier fever and allergic alveolitis. In exposure conditions that include humidification of the air humidifier, fever and allergic alveolitis constitute a risk for tobacco workers. No effects were shown of exposure to tobacco dust on lung function...|$|R
40|$|Different {{approaches}} {{have been reported}} in the literature to reduce the tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA) levels in mainstream smoke (MSS). The reduction of TSNA in the <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> is an approach that has received much attention in recent years. Different elements determine the level of TSNA in MSS: During combustion, part of the TSNA in the cigarette filler can transfer into smoke while another portion can undergo thermal degradation. Moreover, it is possible that TSNA can be pyrosynthesized and that concomitant synergetic effects between the blend components can also occur. Depending on their extent, the formation and degradation of nitrosamines during the combustion process might have an important impact on TSNA level in the smoke of blended cigarettes and might lead to MSS TSNA deliveries which would not parallel that of the blend components...|$|R

A wide range of elements and compounds were identified, {{many of which are}} hazardous to health. Nitrogen was found in all samples which should raise concerns due to the known health implications of amines, nitrogen oxides and nitrites. In addition toxic metals such as cobalt, copper, iron, nickel, lead, and zinc were also determined in all samples. The amounts of these metals are equivalent to those in <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco,</b> where they are known to pose health risks. Three types of solvents (acetone, dichloromethane and toluene) were used for the extraction of organic compounds.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these tests {{is an attempt to}} {{contribute}} to new technology of plantlet (Todd's Cells) in mass production for developing economical, safer and quality tobacco production. The study includes two ways of plantlet production and three varieties of Virginia Species Tobacco. The results of parallel testing of tobacco production obtained from plantlets of different origins have shown that the new way of breeding has many advantages. Todd's Cells plantlet was ready for transplantation earlier and it reached the technological maturity in the open field earlier than usual. The time necessary for leaves drying was shorter in 12 hours and so the later processings (redrying, cigarettes production) were done in a shorter time. The plants in the field were more resistant to disease agents because Todd's Cells plantlets had easier adjusted to the environmental conditions. Tobacco leaf yield from Todd's Cells was significantly higher than from the traditionally produced plantlet. Raw material quality was also better. At the end. it is important to line out that the different plantlet production methods of different varieties reacted differently to yield and <b>raw</b> <b>tobacco</b> material quality...|$|R
