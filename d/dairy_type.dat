40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{growing number}} of cohort studies suggest a {{potential}} role of <b>dairy</b> consumption in <b>type</b> 2 diabetes (T 2 D) prevention. The strength of this association {{and the amount of}} dairy needed is not clear. OBJECTIVE: We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the associations of incident T 2 D with dairy foods at different levels of intake. DESIGN: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases (from inception to 14 April 2015) was supplemented by hand searches of reference lists and correspondence with authors of prior studies. Included were prospective cohort studies that examined the association between dairy and incident T 2 D in healthy adults. Data were extracted {{with the use of a}} predefined protocol, with double data-entry and study quality assessments. Random-effects meta-analyses with summarized dose-response data were performed for total, low-fat, and high-fat <b>dairy,</b> (<b>types</b> of) milk, (<b>types</b> of) fermented <b>dairy,</b> cream, ice cream, and sherbet. Nonlinear associations were investigated, with data modeled with the use of spline knots and visualized via spaghetti plots. RESULTS: The analysis included 22 cohort studies comprised of 579, 832 individuals and 43, 118 T 2 D cases. Total dairy was inversely associated with T 2 D risk (RR: 0. 97 per 200 -g/d increment; 95 % CI: 0. 95, 1. 00; P = 0. 04; I 2 = 66 %), with a suggestive but similar linear inverse association noted for low-fat dairy (RR: 0. 96 per 200 g/d; 95 % CI: 0. 92, 1. 00; P = 0. 072; I 2 = 68 %). Nonlinear inverse associations were found for yogurt intake (at 80 g/d, RR: 0. 86 compared with 0 g/d; 95 % CI: 0. 83, 0. 90; P < 0. 001; I 2 = 73 %) and ice cream intake (at ∼ 10 g/d, RR: 0. 81; 95 % CI: 0. 78, 0. 85; P < 0. 001; I 2 = 86 %), but no added incremental benefits were found at a higher intake. Other <b>dairy</b> <b>types</b> were not associated with T 2 D risk. CONCLUSION: This dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies suggests a possible role for dairy foods, particularly yogurt, in the prevention of T 2 D.

Abstract: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between total and <b>types</b> of <b>dairy</b> product intake and risk of developing incident type 2 diabetes, using a food diary. Methods: A nested case-cohort within the EPIC-Norfolk Study was examined, including a random subcohort (n= 4, 000) and cases of incident diabetes (n= 892, including 143 cases in the subcohort) followed-up for 11 years. Diet was assessed using a prospective 7 -day food diary. Total dairy intake (g/day) was estimated and categorised into high-fat (≥ 3. 9 %) and low-fat (< 3. 9 % fat) dairy, and by subtype into yoghurt, cheese and milk. Combined fermented dairy product intake (yoghurt, cheese, sour cream) was estimated and categorised into high- and low-fat. Prentice-weighted Cox regression HRs were calculated. Results: Total dairy, high-fat dairy, milk, cheese and high-fat fermented dairy product intakes were not associated with the development of incident diabetes. Low-fat dairy intake was inversely associated with diabetes in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (tertile [T] 3 vs T 1, HR 0. 81 [95 % CI 0. 66, 0. 98]), but further adjustment for anthropometric, dietary and diabetes risk factors attenuated this association. In addition, an inverse association was found between diabetes and low-fat fermented dairy product intake (T 3 vs T 1, HR 0. 76 [95 % CI 0. 60, 0. 99]; ptrend= 0. 049) and specifically with yoghurt intake (HR 0. 72 [95 % CI 0. 55, 0. 95]; ptrend= 0. 017) in multivariable adjusted analyses. Conclusions/interpretation: Greater low-fat fermented dairy product intake, largely driven by yoghurt intake, was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes development in prospective analyses. These findings suggest that the {{consumption of}} specific <b>dairy</b> <b>types</b> may be beneficial for the prevention of diabetes, highlighting the importance of food group subtypes for public health messages...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} is a user manual for the Dairy Analytics and Nutrient Analysis (DANA) model. DANA provides {{an analysis of}} dairy anaerobic digestion technology and allows users to calculate biogas production, co-product valuation, capital costs, expenses, revenue and financial metrics, for user customizable scenarios, <b>dairy</b> and digester <b>types.</b> The model provides results for three anaerobic digester types; Covered Lagoons, Modified Plug Flow, and Complete Mix, and three main energy production technologies; electricity generation, renewable natural gas generation, and compressed natural gas generation. Additional options include different <b>dairy</b> <b>types,</b> bedding types, backend treatment type as well as numerous production, and economic parameters. DANA’s goal is to extend the National Market Value of Anaerobic Digester Products analysis (informa economics, 2012; Innovation Center, 2011) to include a greater and more flexible set of regional digester scenarios {{and to provide a}} modular framework for creation of a tool to support farmer and investor needs. Users can set up scenarios from combinations of existing parameters or add new parameters, run the model and view a variety of reports, charts and tables that are automatically produced and delivered over the web interface. DANA is based in the INL’s analysis architecture entitled Generalized Environment for Modeling Systems (GEMS), which offers extensive collaboration, analysis, and integration opportunities and greatly speeds the ability construct highly scalable web delivered user-oriented decision tools. DANA’s approach uses server-based data processing and web-based user interfaces, rather a client-based spreadsheet approach. This offers a number of benefits over the client-based approach. Server processing and storage can scale up to handle {{a very large number of}} scenarios, so that analysis of county, even field level, across the whole U. S., can be performed. Server based databases allow dairy and digester parameters be held and managed in a single managed data repository, while allows users to customize standard values and perform individual analysis. Server-based calculations can be easily extended, versions and upgrades managed, and any changes are immediately available to all users.

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and dose–response meta‐analysis of milk and other dairy products in relation to stroke risk. Methods and Results Through a systematic literature search, prospective cohort studies of dairy foods and incident stroke in stroke‐free adults were identified. Random‐effects meta‐analyses with summarized dose–response data were performed, taking into account sources of heterogeneity, and spline models were used to systematically investigate nonlinearity of the associations. We included 18 studies with 8 to 26 years of follow‐up that included 762 414 individuals and 29 943 stroke events. An increment of 200 g of daily milk intake was associated with a 7 % lower risk of stroke (relative risk 0. 93; 95 % CI 0. 88 – 0. 98; P= 0. 004; I 2 = 86 %). Relative risks were 0. 82 (95 % CI 0. 75 – 0. 90) in East Asian and 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 95 – 1. 01) in Western countries (median intakes 38 and 266 g/day, respectively) with less but still considerable heterogeneity within the continents. Cheese intake was marginally inversely associated with stroke risk (relative risk 0. 97; 95 % CI 0. 94 – 1. 01 per 40 g/day).

40|$|Cows are {{the main}} {{economic}} production units of Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s cattle industry. Therefore, demographic information, including overall numbers and survival rates, {{are relevant to the}} Irish agricultural industry. However, few data are available on the demographics of cows within a national population, either in Ireland or elsewhere, despite the recent development of comprehensive national cattle databases in many EU Member States. This study has sought: to determine the rate of cow culling from the national herd; to determine the rate of culling by <b>type</b> (<b>dairy,</b> beef), age, method of exit, date of exit and interval between last calving and exit; to calculate the national cow on-farm mortality rate; and to compare the Irish rates with published data from other countries. This work was conducted using data recorded in the national Cattle Movement Monitoring System (CMMS). Culling refers to the exit of cows from the national herd, as a result of death but regardless of reason, and cow-culling rate was calculated as the number of cow exits (as defined above) each year divided by the number of calf births in the same year. Culling rate was determined by <b>type</b> (<b>dairy</b> or beef), date of birth, method of exit (slaughter or on-farm death), month of exit and interval between last calving and exit. The average cow-culling rate during 2003 to 2006 was 19. 6...|$|R
