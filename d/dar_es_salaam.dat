5|$|In mid-October 1905, Seeadler sent {{a landing}} party ashore at Samanga {{to protect the}} coastal {{telegraph}} line there. By mid-December, she had returned to <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> before proceeding to Kilwa on 17 January 1906. The cruiser was back in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> on 24 January. Another overhaul at Cape Town followed from 10 February to 16 March. By this time, the situation in East Africa had calmed, and the light cruiser , which had also been sent to suppress the Maji-Maji uprising, {{was sent back to}} Germany. Seeadler nevertheless remained in the region, and was formally assigned to the East Africa Station in early 1907. In October 1907, then-Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Hugo Meurer served as the ship's commanding officer. He would hold the position until June 1909.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda {{teams in}} Nairobi, Kenya, and <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> Tanzania, {{attacked}} the cities' U.S. embassies simultaneously with truck bombs. In Nairobi, the explosion collapsed the nearby Ufundi Building and destroyed the embassy, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans; another 4,000 people were wounded. In <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> the bomber {{was unable to}} {{get close enough to}} the embassy to demolish it, but the blast killed 11 Africans and wounded 85. Bin Laden justified the high-casualty attacks, the largest against the U.S. since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, by claiming they were in retaliation for the deployment of U.S. troops in Somalia; he also alleged the embassies had devised the Rwandan Genocide and a supposed plan to partition Sudan.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in 1963, FRELIMO set up {{headquarters}} in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> Tanzania, {{under the leadership}} of sociologist Eduardo Mondlane, and began to call for independence from Portugal.After two years of organisation and failing political manoeuvres in an attempt to seek a peaceful independence, Mondlane began in 1964 a campaign of guerrilla warfare in an attempt to achieve independence for Mozambique.|$|E

5|$|As {{tensions}} in Europe {{rose in the}} aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe. Concurrently, the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up Königsberg at the colony's capital <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day. Königsberg steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.|$|E

5|$|The cruiser then {{returned}} to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Königsberg was ordered to attack British commerce around {{the entrance to the}} Red Sea. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier Koenig from leaving <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to Königsberg. Looff then radioed the German steamer Zieten to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. Königsberg chased after the German freighter Goldenfels, whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. Königsberg was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of Goldenfels to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E

Reginald Robbins succeeded Lockhart as chairman on 28 June 1946. Six more D.H.89As were purchased for £5,700 each. Doves were also ordered that year, but because these aircraft {{could not be}} delivered until 1948, the corporation arranged the delivery of Lodestars from BOAC for £6,000 each including spares. Despite the company expecting the Lodestars to arrive earlier, both types of aircraft arrived the same year, with five Lodestars entering the fleet on 22 February 1948 followed by {{the first of four}} Doves (at a cost of £13,300 each) four days later. The Lodestars were deployed on the Nairobi-Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> service on 21 March, whereas the Doves started working on the Nairobi-Entebbe run on 14 April. A day later, Lodestars were deployed on the Nairobi-Mombasa-Lindi service.|$|R
5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.).

5|$|Later that day, {{the crew}} {{returned}} to haul down the ship's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser.

All ten guns were repaired in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry Götzen of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet. The surviving sailors, organized as the Königsberg-Abteilung (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.|$|E
5|$|The rise of African {{nationalism}} {{generated a}} white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. Mugabe met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, {{it was time to}} move towards armed resistance. Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city. There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed the idea of a government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{efforts of}} {{accelerated}} malaria control towards the long-term goal of elimination had significant impacts in reducing malaria transmission. While these efforts {{need to be}} sustained over time, a scenario of low transmission could bring about changes in individual disease risk perception, hindering adherence to protective measures, and affecting disease-related knowledge. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the potential impact of a successful malaria vector control intervention on bed net usage and malaria-related knowledge. <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam's</b> Urban Malaria Control Program was launched in 2004 with the aim of developing a sustainable larviciding intervention. Larviciding was scaled-up using a stepped-wedge design. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data were collected using a randomized cluster sampling design (2004 [...] 2008). Prevalence ratios (PR) for the effect of the larviciding intervention on bed net usage (N = 64, 537) and household heads' knowledge of malaria symptoms and transmission (N = 11, 254) were obtained from random effects regression models. The probability that individuals targeted by larviciding had used a bed net was reduced by 5...|$|R

5|$|The {{cease-fire}} ended abruptly on 6 April 1994, when President Habyarimana's {{plane was}} shot down near Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the new President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. The pair were returning home from a regional summit in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying {{the implementation of the}} Arusha accords. The attackers remain unknown. Prunier, in his book written shortly after the incident, concluded that it was most likely a coup d'État carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible. At the end of 2010 the French government ordered a more thorough judicial inquiry, which employed ballistics experts. This report reaffirmed the initial theory that Hutu extremists assassinated Habyarimana.|$|E
5|$|To improve Britain's {{cultural}} influence abroad, Wheeler {{had been}} urging {{the establishment of}} a British Institute of History and Archaeology in East Africa, touring East Africa itself in August 1955.

The Institute was initially established in <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> in 1961, although later relocated to Nairobi. Meanwhile, Wheeler had also been campaigning for {{the establishment of a}} British Institute of Persian Studies, a project which was supported by the British Embassy in Tehran; they hoped that it would rival the successful French Institute in the city.

40|$|ABSTRACT:- Examinations Timetabling Problem (ETP) is {{the problem}} of {{assigning}} courses to be examined and candidates to time periods and examination rooms while satisfying a set of constraints. Every University has a different set of constraints and structure of examinations. Thus there is no general ETP model for all Universities around the world [1]. ETP is NP-Hard [2] and therefore no optimal algorithm is known for this problem which can solve a general problem within reasonable time. However, exact methods can be used to provide a benchmark for the heuristic methods. There is no general model for University Timetabling Problems because the problem feature differs from one University to another. In this paper we focus in the formulation of the ETP for the University of Dar as salaam. We formulate, test and compare three Integer Programming models. It is concluded that, although exact methods cannot give a solution to a real-size problem, these models give a good benchmark for testing the performance of other approaches. This paper also gives a direction for better exact models for the University of <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>salaam’s</b> ETP...|$|R

50|$|Wide scale {{growth in}} the {{religion}} across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in 1950s and extend in the 1960s. Particular plans to bring the religion to Uganda began in 1950 involving the cooperation of American, British, Egyptian, and Persian Bahá'í communities and reached a level of coordination and detail that materials were translated into languages widely used in Africa before pioneers reached Africa. In 1952 {{in the region of}} Malawi, then about to become the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Bahá'í Faith enters when Dennis Dudley-Smith Kutendele (sometimes Kutendere), the first African Bahá'í in Tanganyika, and member of <b>Dar</b> <b>es</b> <b>Salaam's</b> first local spiritual assembly, moved to Zomba with his family - the first time an African Bahá'í took the religion to a new country. He was soon joined by pioneer Enayat Sohaili and his family from Iran. As Sohaili was white and Kutendere black it was illegal for them to socialize. So the first Bahá'í Feast they held was meeting in the bush at night. This same year new convert Dunduzu Chisiza left Malawi to help introduce the religion to Rwanda (formerly part of Ruanda-Urundi). In 1956 the area of Malawi was included in the regional National Spiritual Assembly of South and West Africa. John William Allen was the first Auxiliary Board of the region working under Hand of the Cause Músá Baníní.|$|R
