The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists' basic religious rights.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was a {{classical}} liberal in the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill. He believed in <b>individual</b> <b>freedom</b> and responsibility and {{feared that the}} growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, {{the role of the}} state was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission, but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} have described rationalisation {{and the question}} of <b>individual</b> <b>freedom</b> in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.

5|$|Berkman {{eventually}} {{broke with}} Most and aligned {{himself with the}} autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with Josef Peukert, emphasized <b>individual</b> <b>freedom.</b> They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman {{was working for the}} autonomists' publications, Der Anarchist and Die Autonomie, but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to <b>individual</b> <b>freedom</b> and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of <b>individual</b> <b>freedom</b> in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the welfare state. It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, it said, threatened the welfare state and pensioners' benefits.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of <b>individual</b> <b>freedom.</b>|$|E

40|$|Teachers must {{mediate the}} {{persistent}} tension in American society and American education between <b>individual</b> <b>freedoms</b> and civic virtue. This creates philosophical and practical problems for teachers in classrooms who must {{make decisions that}} affect the experiences of individual {{students as well as}} the whole class. Teacher education unsuccessfully attempts to mediate this tension by conceptualizing the work of teaching as "caring" work, and in doing so, regularly obfuscates the role of teachers in constraining <b>individual</b> <b>freedoms</b> in their day-to-day work. In an effort to better conceptualize preparation for the difficult work of mediating the tension between <b>individual</b> <b>freedoms</b> and civic virtue in teaching, this study looks at police training to see how police are prepared to mediate the same tensions. Police unapologetically prepare candidates to constrain <b>individual</b> <b>freedoms</b> and to enforce a particular vision of social order. In an attempt make the familiar world of teacher education strange, this is a case study that uses a grounded theory approach to examine a signature pedagogy of police preparation - scenario training. An analysis of scenario training revealed three signature problems for which candidates were prepared: uncertainty, stress, and the high cost of error. Police were trained to contend with these problems through routines that caused them to draw on both explicit and tacit forms of knowledge. The framing of these problems, as well as the strategies that candidates were taught to contend with them, caused police preparation to privilege enforcement of social order over the protection of <b>individual</b> <b>freedoms.</b> This raises the hypothesis that teacher education, by invoking care as a framework for understanding teachers' work, privileges preparation for nurturing individual students over enforcing order in the classroom or for preparing a citizenry for the common good...|$|R
