5|$|Amid notable controversy, Sörenstam {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} PGA Tour's Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, in May 2003, making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias, who {{qualified}} for the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Vijay Singh, fourth in the world rankings at the time, was particularly critical of her presence; he was quoted saying she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> playing and he hoped she missed the cut, although this statement was later proven to be misquoted and he later apologized. Cheered through each hole, she shot five over par, tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds, missing the cut. After shooting 1-over-par 71 in the first round, finishing in 73rd and on pace to challenge for a weekend spot, Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance.|$|E

Their position was clear, that the equality of all the bishops outranked the leadership of the pope.|$|E

25|$|It was {{in school}} at Otapete Methodist that Olowofoyeku first met a new classmate, Tai Solarin, then known as Augustus Solarin. That was the {{beginning}} of a lifelong friendship that later brought them together again as colleagues at St. Andrew's College, Oyo (1936–1942). Solarin admitted that he was radically changed by Olowofoyeku's final essay in which he made the observation that some of the colonialists were ignorant, and not well-prepared for the duties they were assigned, and therefore <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> running the lives of Nigerians. For this essay, he was punished for his audacity in challenging the status quo, and was suspended from college in his final academic year. He however sat for and passed the final teacher's examination as an external student a year later.|$|E
25|$|From the start, Gifford disliked Rhodes, who {{he thought}} had {{acquired}} {{too much power}} in BSAC and had marginalised him. Cawston supported Rhodes only in those commercial activities likely {{to make a profit}} and not in any less commercial ventures. The four other directors were appointed to represent the other shareholders. The dukes of Abercorn and of Fife, respectively chairman and vice-chairman were appointed to give the company prestige but they took little part in running the company. Neither had previous interest in Africa and Fife <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> experience. Albert Grey, later Earl Grey had an active role as a liaison between Rhodes in South Africa and government officials in London. He and Horace Farquhar, a prominent London banker, completed the first Board.|$|E
500|$|At {{the second}} Bayreuth Festival Parsifal was {{performed}} 16 times; {{at the last}} performance on 29 August, Wagner himself conducted the final scene. Cosima wrote afterwards of how different the orchestra and singers sounded under Wagner. Overall, she and Wagner were entirely satisfied with {{the outcome of the}} festival which, unlike its predecessor, had made a handsome profit.: [...] "ot once did the spirit of toil and dedication {{on the part of the}} artists abate ... I believe one may be satisfied". One dissident voice was that of Friedrich Nietzsche, once a devoted friend of Wagner's but latterly a harsh critic. Nietzsche considered Parsifal an abomination for which Cosima was responsible; she had corrupted Wagner, and as a non-German she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> meddling in matters of German culture.|$|E

[...] Pundit Bill Ballenger of Inside Michigan Politics said that McCotter [...] "really <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> running for president. If {{he wants to have}} any political future, endorsing Mitt Romney now is the smart thing to do." [...] McCotter's neighbor, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, remarked, [...] "He tried it out, obviously it wasn't working. And he's doing the rational thing and dropping out." [...] Steve Kornacki of Salon summarized the overall campaign as [...] "a cautionary tale about what can go wrong when your average backbench member of Congress becomes a minor cable news celebrity and mistakes it for having a genuine national following." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E

[...] Anchoring {{at the small}} Cornish port of Fowey, Barlow took an express coach directly to the Admiralty in London, arriving on 11 January carrying the 48lb (22kg) cannonball {{as evidence of the}} incident and what British historian William James called the [...] "strong spirit of hostility {{on the part of the}} new republic". Historian Edward Pelham Brenton, writing in 1825, noted however that French hostility on this occasion was justified, commenting that [...] "in the then troubled state of Europe Childers and her captain <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> to be prying into the equipments at Brest within gunshot of the forts: if we had seen a French vessel of war running from the Needles to St Helens, and making observations, I suspect we should, at such a crisis, have taken the liberty to bring her to action." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of her career, McLeod's playing style was {{described}} as exuberant and with [...] "boisterous" [...] energy. Her kinetic style of goalkeeping was something that came naturally to her in her youth. Tim Rosenfeld, now a coach at the University of Wisconsin, first saw McLeod in the early 2000s while he was coaching at Penn State University and noted that she was [...] "out of control" [...] and kept coming off her line [...] "going for balls she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> going for." [...] When she eventually transferred to Penn State in 2004, Rosenfeld stated that [...] "she'd make saves {{that no one in the}} world could make, but she'd also made decisions that allowed a bad goal." [...] As a youth player in 2002, the FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship Technical Study Group noted that she was [...] "self-assured in all situations," [...] has [...] "good positioning" [...] and [...] "organized defense well." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{field of}} 34 drivers {{was the biggest}} in an IndyCar series race in 14 years. A typical oval track race has six to eight fewer drivers, except for the Indianapolis 500, which {{normally}} has a 33-car field. ESPN.com senior motorsports writer Terry Blount wrote: [...] "Obviously more cars presents more danger. They wanted {{a whole lot of}} cars cause obviously this is their season finale and they wanted it to be a big deal. Some of the people that were driving in this event yesterday <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> being in it. Some of them had never driven on a track like this. That was a mistake". Chris Powell, president of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, defended the race, saying that the circuit had passed all of the IndyCar Series' accreditation procedures and was deemed suitable for racing. He also went on the record to say that despite the media reporting the concerns of several drivers over the safety of the event, none of those concerns had been raised with him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s the Reverend Jerry Falwell moved from {{presiding}} over the megachurch Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia and hosting the Old Time Gospel Hour, to being involved in politics. Falwell took credit for defeating the Dade County gay rights ordinance {{and the failure of}} the ERA in Florida. He developed a campaign called Clean Up America in 1977 that was a fundraising vehicle for his television show. Falwell sent letters asking for donations, which included questionnaires asking [...] "Do you approve of known practicing homosexuals teaching in public schools?" [...] that he promised would be sent to politicians; he distributed information about how to put together political groups to influence elections and lawmakers. In 1979 Falwell spearheaded a coalition of religious groups that included Catholics, fundamentalist Protestants, Mormons, and Orthodox Jews that he called the Moral Majority, which developed a branch dedicated to political action. Falwell declared in 1965 that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> in politics, but justified his involvement and the inevitable mix of religion and government with evidence that the social problems of abortion, pornography, sexual immorality, and drugs were bringing the United States to a dangerous precipice where communism would prevail over Christianity.|$|E

500|$|In {{his efforts}} {{to carry out his}} orders and {{maintain}} discipline, Stone drew the attention and wrath of his home state's governor, John A. Andrew, and Charles Sumner, the senior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, both powerful and influential Radical Republican politicians. In late September Stone issued general orders that required his men [...] "not to incite and encourage insubordination among the coloured servants in the neighbourhood." [...] When two runaway slaves came into their lines, one of his regiments, the 20th Massachusetts Infantry, promptly caught them and returned them to their owner. This was done in compliance with Stone's orders as well as both Federal and Maryland law. However, many of the 20th Massachusetts were abolitionists, disagreed with Stone's insistence on returning runaways back into slavery, and wrote both their families and their representatives about the incident. Governor Andrew strongly reprimanded the colonel of the regiment, who gave the letter to Stone. After reading it Stone wrote back, its contents summarized by military historian Bruce Catton as follows: [...] "this regiment was in United States service now and the governor <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> meddling with discipline, the young lieutenant and the colonel had properly done what they were told to do and were not subject to reprimand from any governor, and would the governor in future please keep his hand off?" ...|$|E
500|$|Denning {{was noted}} for his {{excellent}} memory, repeating notes almost verbatim in his exams at Oxford {{and on one}} occasion identifying the exact book, page and paragraph of text in a judgment that covered a particular situation. As a judge he attempted to make his decisions and the law publicly understandable, believing that the public {{would not want to}} follow the law unless they believed and understood that it was just. In his cases he referred to the parties by name in his judgments rather than as [...] "plaintiff" [...] and [...] "defendant" [...] and used short sentences and a [...] "storytelling" [...] style of speech shown in the case Beswick v Beswick where his judgment started:Old Peter Beswick was a coal merchant in Eccles, Lancashire. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> premises. All he had was a lorry, scales, and weights. He used to take the lorry to the yard of the National Coal Board, where he bagged coal and took it round to his customers in the neighbourhood. His nephew, John Joseph Beswick, helped him in his business. In March 1962, old Peter Beswick and his wife were both over 70. He had had his leg amputated and was not in good health. The nephew was anxious to get hold of the business before the old man died. So they went to a solicitor, Mr. Ashcroft, who drew up an agreement for them.|$|E
500|$|In a retrospective, Paul Mallinson of Computer & Video Games (CVG) {{wrote that}} the game's {{production}} was [...] "speedy, focused and fun". Castle said that, because the company was creating other titles at the time, development of Command & Conquer was not a [...] "working party"; but lead programmer Joe Bostic later {{said that it was}} [...] "so much fun that I would sometimes marvel that I actually got paid as well." [...] The game's playtesters were enthusiastic about the game during development, which Castle later said had encouraged the team to work harder. The team created live-action FMV cutscenes for the game. These cutscenes contain no professional actors aside from Kucan, who played Kane and was heavily involved in their production. The cast is made up of Westwood team members, and a low budget meant that filming took place in [...] "spare rooms" [...] and warehouses. Castle later said that the team [...] "had no illusions that we were as good as TV or film," [...] but that the cutscenes were not intentionally campy. He credited Kucan with [...] "taking ragtag group of people who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> {{in front of a camera}} and making something reasonably good." [...] To replace the spice from Dune II, the team introduced Tiberium, which was inspired by the 1957 B-movie The Monolith Monsters. Castle said that the team's goal in both cases was to create [...] "a central resource that everybody was fighting over." [...] As with Dune II, the soundtrack was composed by Frank Klepacki.|$|E

500|$|It {{was said}} that they learned that those {{who had gone to}} treat with the King would have been fallen upon by armed men and slain... but that Nicholas Exton, the Mayor of London, having refused to countenance the evil, a deep and wicked plot was spread about and the scandal {{gradually}} uncovered.This event must, then, have occurred [...] "within days" [...] of Exton's election as Mayor. It was important, though, for the King to gain the backing of the City of London, and Exton, on his behalf, attempted to achieve this in October 1387 by requesting, unsuccessfully, that all the craft guilds would take an oath of loyalty to Richard. On the other hand, Knighton's Chronical suggests that although the King attempted to force the City to raise an army for royal use, Exton informed him that the inhabitants [...] "were in the main craftsmen and merchants, with no great military experience" [...] and that the only reason they could ever be raised in arms was to defend the city itself. Nevertheless, the King despatched a warrant for the arrest of the rebel lords, and it was the responsibility of Exton to execute it; however, says Jonathan Sumption, Exton [...] "quailed before such a task [...] resolved that the city <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> executing a warrant of this kind." [...] In December that year he authorised the opening of the city gates to the Lords Appellant (although only [...] "once their victory [...] had become certain"). Indeed, he may have actually greeted the lords outside the city gates and accompanied them back into London. Favent reports that the Duke of Gloucester, a leading Appellant, on hearing Exton's pledges of the city's loyalty, remarked [...] "Now I know in truth that liars tell nothing but lies, nor can anyone prevent them from being told." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} nine hundred people {{attended}} the event. Canadian Online Explorer writer Mark Xamin rated the entire event a {{six out of}} ten, which was lower than the {{seven and a half}} out of ten given to the 2007 Final Resolution event by Chris Sokol, but equal with the second Final Resolution held in December 2008 given by Bryan and Chris Sokol. Final Resolution's rating was lower than TNA's previous event Turning Point, which was given a six and half out of ten. It was also lower than the seven and half given to TNA's next event Against All Odds. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's Royal Rumble PPV event held on January 27, Final Resolution was rated lower as Royal Rumble was given an eight out of ten by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk. In Xamin's review two matches were rated an eight out of ten, his overall highest rating given in the review. The first was the TNA Women's Knockout Championship defense by Gail Kim against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match. Xamin felt it was an [...] "absolutely fantastic match" [...] and that they showed [...] "the world how good women's wrestling can be." [...] The second match given this score was the main event between Kurt Angle and Christian Cage for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Xamin felt it was a [...] "very solid match" [...] and that they put on a [...] "wrestling clinic." [...] The TNA World Tag Team Championship match and the Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match were both rated six out of ten. Xamin stated that in the Tag Team Championship match [...] "Nash looked his age" [...] despite the efforts of Joe and Styles doing [...] "their best to carry the match"; although he felt it was still an [...] "entertaining segment." [...] Xamin also thought that due to Team 3D's creativity in the Ultimate X match they [...] "stole the show in a match they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>business</b> being in." [...] Regarding the overall event, Xamin wrote that [...] "Final Resolution was more about advancing storylines and entertainment value than it was about watching good wrestling." [...] He also believed that Final Resolution had two [...] "stand-out matches (Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong and Angle vs Christian Cage)" [...] despite the rest of the card being [...] "lacklustre at best." ...|$|E
