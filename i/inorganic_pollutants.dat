40|$|In recent years, {{the removal}} of nitrate as a global soil and water {{contaminant}} has been increasingly considered. Various methods have been applied to remove this <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> from water and wastewater. Among them is an integrated " bio-electrochemical reactor" system, which is a novel method for water and wastewater denitrification. The novelty of this system is improved biological denitrification by immobilizing autohydrogenotrophic bacteria directly {{on the surface of}} a cathode, providing easy access to NO 3 - and H 2 as the electron acceptor and electron donor, respectively. The system effectiveness depends on the configuration of reactor, and the operational and environmental parameters. Identification and optimization of these parameters are important to enhance the efficiency of the system.

40|$|Traditional {{techniques}} for remediation of polluted soils {{are based on}} a physical-chemical approach; such techniques are expensive, have adverse effects on soil quality and are often highly expensive. In the scenario of the Green Economy, low cost and impact technologies should be promoted. Phytotechnologies are remediation technologies that use plants for the containment, degradation or removal of contaminants from polluted matrices for the restoration of degraded ecosystems. The process of phytoextraction is substantially based on plant-soil interactions that involves the mass transfer of an <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> from the bulk soil to the plant biomass.

40|$|Abstract—The {{pollution}} of soils by organic contaminants, such as phenols, {{is a serious}} problem because of the high toxicity and persistence in the environment. Mechanochemical treatments (MTs) of polluted soils with minerals, such as clays and oxides, which have surfaces that exhibit catalytic properties, have been suggested to be a new useful strategy to promote both organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> degradation. Nevertheless, much still remains to be studied about the capability of clays to promote pollutant removal by means of the mechanochemical activation of the mineral surfaces. This work investigates the efficiency of the mineral kaolinite in promoting the sequestration of catechol (CAT) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) by MT. A well crystallized kaolinite (KGa- 1 b) was milled for prolonged times with different amounts of organic molecules so as to obtain two different clay:organic compound ratios. Prolonged grinding and a higher clay mineral:organic compound ratio were found to be more effective in promoting a stronger removal than simple contact.

50|$|A {{second source}} of {{circulation}} is water as it follows its natural {{path through the}} water cycle. The water cycle, put simply, represents the path that water takes as it circulates around planet earth.

In the water cycle, both organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutants</b> are biodegraded or filtered out whereas they no longer present much of a threat. This is also true for small amounts of chemicals present in the water.

To elucidate the enrichment of <b>inorganic</b> trace <b>pollutants</b> as result of water re-circulation, a partial and total mass balances were undertaken. A t-Student analysis was performed to ascertain whether the mean contribution of filtered water affected the balance of elements and the enrichment of this water stream. The t-Student revealed the mean contribution of filtered water to total mass balance was statistically significant (p < 0. 05) for Na, Mg, Cl, B, Mn, Se, Cd, Mo, and U at first plant, and Na, Cl, K, Mg, Hg, Li, B, F, Ni, Zn, Mn, Co Sc, Ge, Se, at the second one. High levels of <b>inorganic</b> trace <b>pollutants</b> in filtered water could be affected by limestone purity, electrostatic precipitator gas temperature, use of additives, fluoride and/or sulphate complexes, and the S/F and S/Cl ratios in the scrubber, which may reduce the gaseous retention efficiencies in FGD and increase the emission of metals by entraining and/or evaporation of droplets as particulate matter from gypsum slurry. © 2011 Elsevier B.

In the present paper, the affinity and the removal capacity of montmorillonite/alginate microcapsules for a hydrophobic organic pollutant (4 -nitrophenol) and an <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (copper) were evaluated. The physicochemical processes through sorption and kinetic experiments under different ratios of montmorillonite vs. alginate and initial contaminant concentrations were investigated. The total weight loss and diameter decrease during the drying process were 90 - 96 % and 64 %, respectively. A significant decrease in beads diameter, related to water elimination, has been observed during the first 24 h. Structural modifications that occur during the drying process were evaluated using thermal analysis. From correlation coefficients, the second-order equation depicts properly the adsorption of copper by the microbeads adsorption capacity increases to saturation with time; 3 and 6 h were needed to reach equilibrium on wet and dry mixed microcapsules. The pseudo-second order model properly depicts the adsorption process of 4 -NP onto Na-mont and (Na-mont/SA) mixed microcapsules but failed to reproduce the data observed for the alginate beads.

To these endeavors, leachate samples from collection chamber of landfill lysimeter were sampling and the relevant parameters required for evaluating LPI were measured and monitored in the laboratory.

Three sub-LPIs in terms of LPI in organic pollutant (LPI), LPI in <b>inorganic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (LPI) and LPIor in in heavy metals (LPI) as well as overall LPI had been developed and reported. It can be noted that componenthm of organic fraction in leachate for entire lysimeter operating system had highest against the other counter fraction i. e. inorganic and heavy metals fraction and consequently shows the highest LPI than that of LPIor in and LPI. it can be observed that sub-LPIs and overall LPI has decreased in relation to the increasing ofhm elapsed period of MSW deposited in landfill lysimeter. Results showed that collection system of sanitary lysimeter-A had the highest sub-LPIs and overall LPI than that of other lysimeter operating systems.
