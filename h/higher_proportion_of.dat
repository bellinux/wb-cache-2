5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (<b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (<b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms {{lead to a more}} rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E

5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> rabbits than females, {{as well as an}} overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E

5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May. Jasminum kerstingii {{is part of the}} hartebeest's diet {{at the start of the}} rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> crystalline ice. Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of Pluto, if not as extreme.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer.

Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E

40|$|According to narrative-informed {{approaches}} to psychotherapy, self-narratives {{that no longer}} align with lived experience, and thereby impede coherent meaning-making, often bring individuals into treatment. Exposure to trauma can result in fragmented or disorganized self-narratives, and Emotion-focused Therapy for Trauma (EFTT) (Paivio & Pascual-Leone, 2010) is one treatment approach that helps trauma clients access, explore, and integrate traumatic memories into coherent personal narratives. The Narrative-Emotion Process Coding System (NEPCS 2. 0; Angus Narrative-Emotion Marker Lab, 2015) is a video-based coding system that consists of 10 narrative-emotion markers (i. e., client storytelling processes) that have been divided into three NEPCS marker subgroups, based on their degree of narrative-emotion integration: Problem, Transition, and Change markers. The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the relationship between NEPCS markers and outcome (i. e., recovered vs. unchanged) across stage of therapy in a complex trauma sample receiving EFTT (N = 12 clients). The key hypotheses included: recovered clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Transition markers in the early and middle stages of therapy, and significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Change markers in the late stage of therapy, while unchanged clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Problem markers across all stages of therapy. Additionally, recovered clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> shifting (i. e., movement between one NEPCS marker and a different NEPCS marker), and significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> productive shifting (i. e., movement away from Problem markers), whereas unchanged clients would have <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> unproductive shifting (i. e., movement to Problem markers). Results suggested that, in line with theoretical expectations and previous NEPCS research applications, recovered clients showed significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Transition and Change markers, whereas unchanged clients demonstrated <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Problem markers. Increased levels of NEPCS shifting, or flexibly moving between NEPCS markers, was also associated with recovery. Furthermore, recovered clients demonstrated significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> productive shifting, while their unchanged counterparts demonstrated more unproductive shifting, suggesting that the type of narrative flexibility may be an important prognostic indicator. A direction for future NEPCS research is to elucidate therapeutic interventions that facilitate client movement from unproductive to more productive modes of narrative-emotion processing...|$|R
