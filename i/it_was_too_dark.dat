5|$|An avid {{baseball}} fan, Maxwell {{was among}} {{the founders of the}} Winnipeg Arena baseball club in 1908, and became the team's manager in 1912. At its peak, the team drew as many as 5,000 fans per game. As a player, manager or general manager, Maxwell was a member of eight Arena teams that won the Winnipeg city championship between 1908 and 1923. He was known for his quick, and often barbed, wit; His friends often told a story of an Arenas baseball game where, after failing to convince the umpire that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to play, Maxwell sent his players onto the field with lighted candles. In his later years, he served on the advisory board of the Winnipeg Goldeyes professional club.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, green and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E

5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going {{back and forth from the}} jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
25|$|The {{harvesting}} machines constantly broke down, {{which resulted in}} shooting beginning late in the afternoon, allowing {{for only a few}} hours of light before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to go on. One day, two helicopters were scheduled to drop peanut shells that were to simulate locusts on film; however, Malick decided to shoot period cars instead. He kept the helicopters on hold at great cost. Production was lagging behind, with costs exceeding the budget $3,000,000 by about $800,000, and Schneider had already mortgaged his home in order to cover the overages.|$|E

Although Martin Rackin asked Ritt to change the film's ending, he and Newman decided to keep the original.

500|$|According to Josh Weinstein, {{when the}} episode was first broadcast, many fans felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark,</b> lacked humor and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. Weinstein {{considers}} this episode {{one of the}} most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which he thinks many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein also talks about a [...] "generation gap"—he believes the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E

500|$|On April 24, 1889, McAleer {{broke into}} the Major Leagues in Cleveland, Ohio, where he {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} graceful outfielder. In 1891, when Patsy Tebeau became manager of the Cleveland Spiders, the club became known for its aggressive tactics. Tebeau encouraged players to block and hold runners, while he himself openly challenged and harassed officials. In 1896, the Cleveland manager was jailed for attacking an umpire who [...] "decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to continue a game". On June 27, 1896, McAleer was among several Cleveland players to be fined by a Louisville (Kentucky) judge for their role in the incident. Later that year, the club's notoriety prompted other National League teams to propose a boycott of Cleveland, [...] "until the Spiders mended their ways." [...] McAleer's periodic displays of temper were in keeping with this rowdy environment. During an August 18, 1891 game with the Cincinnati Reds, Reds player Arlie Latham tripped McAleer as he rounded third base; McAleer responded by chasing Latham around the field, while brandishing his bat.|$|E
500|$|Wadsworth {{made her}} fourth depth charge {{attack on a}} U-boat on 29July. At about 17:25, she dropped several charges in what {{appeared}} to be the wake of a submarine proceeding submerged. The conjecture that a U-boat was damaged was supported by the appearance of a large amount of heavy oil on the surface following the attack. Just before 23:00, the warship attacked another supposed submarine wake. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> to evaluate the results; but, not long thereafter, [...] struck a submerged metallic object which caused her to list 10° temporarily. Later, Wadsworths wireless operator intercepted messages sent by a German submarine over a period of about half an hour which suggested that Wadsworth may have damaged a submarine, although as with the depth-charge attack of 21June, no definite proof was forthcoming. Early in August, the destroyer concluded her summer of peak activity by escorting the first United States merchant convoy on the last leg of its voyage to Europe. During the mission, on the 16th, the destroyer dropped a barrage on what was thought to be a submarine.|$|E
500|$|Viewing The Lord of the Rings as {{a holiday}} film, United Artists {{pressured}} Bakshi to complete it on schedule for its intended November 15, 1978, release. Once it was finished, Bakshi {{was told that}} audiences would not pay to see an incomplete story; over his objections, The Lord of the Rings was marketed with no indication that a second part would follow. Reviews of the film were mixed, but it was generally seen as a [...] "flawed but inspired interpretation". Newsdays Joseph Gelmis wrote that [...] "the film's principal reward is a visual experience unlike anything that other animated features are doing at the moment". Roger Ebert called Bakshi's effort a [...] "mixed blessing" [...] and [...] "an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job [...] still falls {{far short of the}} charm and sweep of the original story". Vincent Canby found it [...] "both numbing and impressive". David Denby of New York felt that the film would not make sense to viewers who had not read the book. He wrote that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>dark</b> and lacked humor, concluding, [...] "The lurid, meaningless violence of this movie left me exhausted and sickened by the end." [...] The film, which cost $4 million to produce, grossed $30.5 million. The studio refused to fund the sequel, which would have adapted the remainder of the story. The Lord of the Rings won the Golden Gryphon at the 1980 Giffoni Film Festival.|$|E
