It shows a better processing technology through the contrast, {{the quality of the}} membrane of the <b>hot-galvanized</b> steel pipe of inside surface coated LLDPE under the condition of special phosphorization process is equal to that as the result of rotoblasting technology. At the same time, anti-corrosion effect is better than before because of multi-layered and differently plated coatings. A Y-interface technology of independent intellectual property rights is used in interface...|$|E

However, the issue of accidents involving crash barriers at toll plazas turns into horrific nightmare for road users. It have been investigated that accidents at the toll plaza gates due to impacts of the vehicles with concrete crash barriers with results in damage and fatalities. Therefore, the following study is to conduct a simulation test for crash barrier Tensile Wire Fracture toughness (TWFT) system. TWFT system that used hot rolled galvanized steel materials with small displacement rate of 4. 0 x 10 - 4 m which was considered suitable {{as a replacement for}} the existing concrete crash barrier. The data analysis were generated by the software Elfen. The graph of displacement, direct shear and effective stress were generated as for the <b>hot-galvanizes</b> steel material model. Elastic energy, kinetic energy and inelastic dissipated energy were compared between these two materials. The results shows that the hot-rolled galvanized steel have the energy to return the material to its original form and the level of damage shows that the concrete material failure are greater than the hot rolled galvanized steel materials. In conclusion, the material for a new alternative crash barrier is likely to reduce the rate of death due to accident and damage with regards to road furnitures and vehicle...|$|R
