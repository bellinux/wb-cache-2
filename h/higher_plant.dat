5|$|A {{tree nursery}} was {{established}} at Kinloch in 1960 {{in order to}} support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as sundew, butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 <b>higher</b> <b>plant</b> and fern taxa have been recorded.|$|E

500|$|Distributed over 90% of the Australian continent, the {{variegated}} fairywren {{is found}} in scrubland with plenty of vegetation providing dense cover. It prefers rocky outcrops and patches of Acacia, Eremophila or lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta) in inland and northern Australia. They {{have been reported to}} shelter in mammal burrows to avoid extreme heat. In urban situations such as suburban Sydney, these wrens have been said prefer areas with more cover than the related superb fairywren, though a 2007 survey in Sydney's northern suburbs has proposed that variegated fairywrens may prefer areas of <b>higher</b> <b>plant</b> diversity rather than denser cover as such. Forestry plantations of pine (Pinus [...] spp.) and eucalypts are generally unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.|$|E
500|$|Cytokinins are a {{class of}} plant hormones named for their control of cell {{division}} or cytokinesis. The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They {{are involved in the}} promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all <b>higher</b> <b>plant</b> tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.|$|E

40|$|AbstractChloroplast transit {{peptides}} {{from the}} green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been analyzed and compared with chloroplast transit peptides from <b>higher</b> <b>plants</b> and mitochondrial targeting peptides from yeast, Neurospora and higher eukaryotes. In terms of length and amino acid composition, chloroplast transit peptides from C. reinhardtii are more similar to mitochondrial targetting peptides than to chloroplast transit peptides from <b>higher</b> <b>plants.</b> They also contain the potential amphiphilic α-helix characteristic of mitochondrial presequences. However, in similarity with chloroplast transit peptides from <b>higher</b> <b>plants,</b> they contain a C-terminal region {{with the potential to}} form an amphiphilic β-strand. As in <b>higher</b> <b>plants,</b> transit peptides that route proteins to the thylakoid lumen consist of an N-tenninal domain similar to stroma-targeting transit peptides attached to a C-terminal apolar domain that share many characteristics with secretory signal peptides...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMuaraWahau coal {{belongs to}} Wahau Formation which was {{deposited}} during Early Miocene in terrestrial environments. Organic geochemistry {{study has been}} performed to characterize the biomarker composition of the coal. Saturated hydrocarbon fraction comprises n-alkanes with carbon numbers from 14 to 40. Bimodal distribution peaking at n-C 16 and n-C 31 are detected. Additionally, unusual peak is also remarkable at n-C 38. The long chain n- alkanes peaking at n-C 31 might be derived from <b>higher</b> <b>plants.</b> The origin of short chain n-alkanes (n-C 14 to n-C 21) are less specific, probably originate from <b>higher</b> <b>plants</b> and/or algae. Other related identified biomarkers which confirm the significant contribution of <b>higher</b> <b>plants</b> are olean- 13 (18) -ene, olean- 18 -ene and urs- 12 -ene. The presence of longer-chain n-alkanes especially unusual high amount of n-C 38 is interesting to be noted as this compound has been reported only from some Kalimantan coals. Considering the abundance of <b>higher</b> <b>plants</b> biomarkers in MuaraWahau coal, it is hypothesized that the C 38 n-alkane was likely derived also from <b>higher</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

50|$|Outcrossing, cross-fertilization or allogamy, {{in which}} {{offspring}} are {{formed by the}} fusion of the gametes of two different plants, {{is the most common}} mode of reproduction among higher plants. About 55% of <b>higher</b> <b>plant</b> species reproduce in this way. An additional 7% are partially cross-fertilizing and partially self-fertilizing (autogamy). About 15% produce gametes but are principally self-fertilizing with significant out-crossing lacking. Only about 8% of <b>higher</b> <b>plant</b> species reproduce exclusively by non-sexual means. These include plants that reproduce vegetatively by runners or bulbils, or which produce seeds without embryo fertilization (apomixis). The selective advantage of outcrossing appears to be the masking of deleterious recessive mutations.|$|E
