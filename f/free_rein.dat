5|$|The band's {{record deal}} was {{relatively}} poor for the time: a £5,000 advance over five years, low royalties and no free studio time. However, it did include album development, and EMI, unsure {{of exactly what}} kind of band they had signed, gave them <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> to record whatever they wanted.|$|E
5|$|The next day, on September 26, Larry Holden {{returned}} {{to shoot the}} sequence where Leonard attacks Jimmy. After filming was completed five days later, Pearce's voice-overs were recorded. For the black-and-white scenes, Pearce was given <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> to improvise his narrative, allowing for a documentary feel.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{business}} groups, the IoD represents individual members, not companies and businesses themselves. Every member’s voice carries equal weight within the organisation, and members retain their {{membership of the}} IoD throughout their career. This allows the IoD <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> to speak out {{on behalf of the}} business community and discuss individual companies in public.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{were they}} left undisturbed; {{for in the}} {{cauldron}} of Borgia politics a stew was simmering that demanded all that family's attention, and of whose import we guessed something when we heard that Cesare Borgia had flung aside his cardinalitial robes to put on armour and give <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> to the boundless ambition that consumed him.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the regency's {{alliance}} with Dušan was paying dividends for the Serbian ruler alone, {{as he had}} <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> to plunder and occupy all of Macedonia and Epirus. By the end of 1345, only Thessalonica, held by the Zealots, Serres and the surrounding region, which remained loyal to the regency, along with Berroia, which still held out under Manuel Kantakouzenos, remained outside Serbian control.|$|E
5|$|After {{making the}} {{decision}} to use a new character rather than Dizzy, Codemasters allowed Big Red Software <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> to develop the new game, only stipulating that it must be ready for release within 12weeks. By this point Big Red Software was already familiar with platform adventure games. The game retained the Dizzy graphic adventure title engine. Pete Ranson had previously designed graphics for every Dizzy game bar the first, graphics were shared between Dizzy games and some were also recycled for Seymour Goes to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, Richard Taylor {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> on material from The Lord of the Rings universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually {{for the first time}} in the game's cut scenes. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when telling a story, and he was pleased to have Weaving on the project as the primary storyteller.|$|E
50|$|A book {{interview}} with David Freeman at BBC Radio Oxford led to Maslanka's contributing anecdotes and puzzles to many programmes {{and he was}} eventually given his own programme PDQ which gave Maslanka a <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> for his peculiar blend of comedy and conundrums.He was also invited by the World Service to broadcast his humorous puzzle anecdotes to the hostages during the Gulf War.|$|R
60|$|I {{was carried}} away by so sublime a theme; and remembering that I had no {{critical}} hearer, I gave <b>free</b> <b>reins</b> to fancy, forgetting for the moment that some undiscovered thought or feeling had prompted her questions. And while I spoke of the mountains, she hung on my words, following me closely in my walk, her countenance brilliant, her frame quivering with excitement.|$|R
60|$|MAN. I {{left off}} {{to watch and}} be sober. I gave <b>free</b> <b>reins</b> to sin; I sinned against {{the light of the}} Word and the {{goodness}} of God; I have grieved the Spirit, and He is gone; I tempted the devil, and he has come to me; I have provoked God to anger, and He has left me; I have so hardened my heart that I cannot turn.|$|R
5|$|Ferdinand {{had been}} {{involved}} in affairs after marrying Imelda Marcos. Ferdinand's most public affair was with American actress Dovie Beams in 1966. While staying in one of the President's safe houses, she recorded her affair with the President. These tapes were later played in a press conference, causing great humiliation for Imelda. They stayed married through a deal; Imelda had <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> on her projects in exchange for delivering votes for Ferdinand in the second election.|$|E
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for getting rid of the hated Apokaukos,. She, however, was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E
50|$|The {{incident}} also {{damaged the}} prestige of the Wahhabi establishment. Saudi leadership sought and received Wahhabi fatawa to approve the military removal of the insurgents and after that to execute them, but Wahhabi clerics also fell under suspicion for involvement with the insurgents.In part as a consequence, Sahwa clerics influenced by Brethren's ideas were given <b>freer</b> <b>rein.</b> Their ideology was also thought more likely to compete with the recent Islamic revolutionism/third-worldism of the Iranian Revolution.|$|R
25|$|During the {{production}} of The Land Before Time, development work was already beginning on the studio's next feature. Sullivan had been keen to fund the next feature {{with a combination of}} the studio's own revenue and Irish investment, as opposed to Hollywood producers; the deal with Goldcrest Films (which had an Irish office) would make this possible. Working under Goldcrest also afforded director Don Bluth <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> over the development of the story than under Amblin and Spielberg.|$|R
5000|$|In {{harmony with}} its {{emphasis}} on utilizing and developing the natural spiritual gifts of {{all the members of the}} Church, the LFC gave a <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> to women within its church body to hold non-ordained ministries, offices, and responsibilities than many of its contemporary Lutheran counterparts. [...] The LFC also strongly emphasized the importance of foreign missions (with missions fields in Madagascar and the Cameroons) and spent more of its financial resources on foreign missions and supported a larger number of foreign missionaries than many of its contemporary Lutheran church bodies of comparable size.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E
5|$|The band {{rented a}} house, {{and hoped that}} living communally would foster good {{relations}} and a happier recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused {{to live in the}} house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly <b>free</b> <b>rein.</b>|$|E
50|$|No other metal {{has been}} so {{completely}} controlled {{by a group of}} U.S. producers for their own selfish interests cadmium has been. And we find it hard not to suspect that illegal price rigging and manipulative practices are taking place again.Efforts by the Cadmium Lobby to prevent the importation of cadmium from Japan under the guise of 'dumping' is not only unfair, but constitutes a very obvious sham. Their purpose is most transparent --- by limiting the importation of this critical and strategic material, U.S. cadmium producers would have an even <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> to control the sale and distribution of this metal.|$|R
500|$|In 1968, the Nixon-Agnew ticket faced two {{principal}} opponents. The Democrats, at a convention marred by violent demonstrations, had nominated Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Maine Senator Edmund Muskie as their standard-bearers. The segregationist former Governor of Alabama, George Wallace, ran as a third-party candidate, and {{was expected to}} do well in the Deep South. Nixon, mindful of the restrictions he had labored under as Eisenhower's running mate in 1952 and 1956, was determined to both give Agnew a much <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> and to make it clear his running mate had his support. Agnew could also usefully play an [...] "attack dog" [...] role, as Nixon had in 1952.|$|R
2500|$|As Walton's {{second term}} on the CFA {{came to an}} end in 1971, he was praised for his {{leadership}} of the commission. Washington Post architectural critic Wolf Von Eckardt said Walton's CFA had [...] "probably done more advising {{than at any time in}} its history", and that it had brought [...] "a fresh and contemporary" [...] vision to architecture in the nation's capital. Walton gave a <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> to Gordon Bunshaft, who was much more aggressive and brusque during Walton's second term than the first. At the same time, Walton himself became a trusted advisor to Lady Bird Johnson, helping strengthen her city beautification efforts and giving them a political boost.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the {{development}} {{stage of the}} production of Prometheus, director Ridley Scott considered German-Irish actor Michael Fassbender to be his top choice to portray David. In January 2011, Fassbender was confirmed to have joined the cast of Prometheus. Fassbender was provided with {{a significant amount of}} <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> for modeling the character as he saw fit. Rather than taking inspiration from the previous Alien installments, Fassbender studied Sean Young's character Rachael, a replicant in Blade Runner, noting her vacant demeanor. Fassbender drew inspiration from a number of other film performances, including Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 in , David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, and Dirk Bogarde in The Servant. Additionally, Fassbender modeled his walk around American Olympic diver Greg Louganis.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was {{due in part to}} the <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Hanover, Germany. Although he was not officially part of the Bauhaus movement, Buchheister {{was a close friend}} of Wassily Kandinsky and paralleled many of the social and artistic goals of the Bauhaus school. With regard to constructivism, Buchheister was {{typically}} more playful and improvisational than his contemporaries, becoming interested in the Dada movement after a collaboration with Kurt Schwitters in the late 1920s which led him to incorporate more varied materials such as acrylic glass, aluminum, wood, and twine into his compositions. This direction was given much <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> after World War II and the end of Nazism. He died in Hanover in 1964.|$|R

5000|$|The US Marine Corps Combined Action Program unit {{assigned}} to the Vietnamese village of Bun Hou, Tango Niner, has been very successful in suppressing Viet-Cong operations in the area, and now starts putting a crimp in the get-rich-off-overtaxing-the-villager schemes of the local ARVN District Chief, Captain Nghu. Nghu, in return, manages to arrange the planting of drugs within the Marines' compound, and the subsequent [...] "discovery" [...] of the drugs by the Marines' chain of command.

5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a <b>free</b> <b>rein.</b> Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of the Zhengde Emperor on April 19, 1521, {{mourning}} ceremonies were initiated that cancelled all other ceremonies, including the reception of foreign embassies. The newly appointed Grand Secretary, Yang Tinghe, soon turned against the powerful eunuch influence at court, which had grown even more powerful under the Zhengde Emperor. Although Ming officials were of the opinion that only foreign tributary states listed during the beginning of the dynasty should be accepted at court, it was the eunuchs who wanted to expand commercial ties with new foreign countries. These desires were given <b>free</b> <b>rein</b> under the Zhengde Emperor, who was intrigued with and desired to learn about foreign and exotic peoples. However, with his death, eunuch influence at court was challenged by Yang Tinghe, who announced the rejection of the Portuguese embassy under Pires and Andrade the day after the emperor's death; the embassy was forced to leave and arrived back in Canton in September.|$|E

50|$|After {{being held}} captive {{for a number}} of months, the men break out of the {{fortress}} and escape cross-country to where they left their biplane. Finding the biplane sewn inside a large fabric covering, the men are unable to get away and are resignedly recaptured by the women. They are treated well nonetheless and soon learn that they will be given a <b>freer</b> <b>rein</b> when they have mastered the women's language and proved they can be trusted. Van remarks upon Terry's personal difficulty in dealing with the women who steadfastly refuse to conform to his expectations of how women should act, though Jeff seems perfectly enamored of the women and their kindness.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Arundhati Roy’s {{search for}} {{identity}} asserts {{that she could}} not write until it comes from within. She firmly states {{that she could not}} be a writer for hire. Arundhati Roy eschews traditional practices and gives <b>free</b> <b>reins</b> to her individual vision. Her literature is neither a means of escaping reality nor a vehicle for parading political, social, religious, and moral ideas. What differentiates Arundhati Roy from the other Indo-Anglican novelists is her capacity to transform the alienation experiences into the monument of living art. Arundhati Roy's characters alienate in order to involve themselves in a frantic quest for their identity. KEY WORDS/DESCRIPTIONS: Search for identity, trivial and insignificant, psychological and emotional, untouchables, Indo-Anglican novelists, alienation and identity, quest for identity. 1...|$|R
