5000|$|Working in the Petrochemicals Department of the DuPont Co. in 1957, Eleuterio {{discovered}} that certain catalysts convert propylene to a mixture containing ethylene and butene, a reaction he recognized as olefin metathesis. In follow-up experimentation, Eleuterio demonstrated that cyclic olefins such as norbornene and cyclopentene could be polymerized to linear polymer, a reaction since dubbed ring-opening metathesis polymerization, as claimed in a patent first filed in 1957. [...] Eleuterio's discovery {{resulted from a}} fundamental investigation of propylene polymerization using a molybdena-on-alumina catalyst modified with metal hydrides. This experimental designed yielded an <b>ethylene-propylene</b> co-polymer together with ethylene and butene by-products rather than the expected polypropylene. He then extended his experimentation to internal olefins and cyclic olefins, substances that are not normally polymerized by could serve as olefin metathesis substrates. Many researchers followed on Eleuterio's initial discovery, culminating in the 2005 Nobel Prize to Chauvin, Grubbs, and Schrock {{for the development of}} olefin metathesis for organic synthesis. [...] Nobel Laureates Grubbs and Schrock honored Eleuterio for his discovery of olefin metathesis.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A diblock copolymer of Poly (Styrene-b- [ethylene-co-propylene]) {{has been used as}} a stabilizer in non-aqueous dispersion polymerizations of methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate in n-heptane. The particles thus produced were stabilized by well defined surface layers of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains. The dependence of the particle size on the stabilizer, monomer and initiator concentrations was studied. Both seeded and one-shot polymerization techniques were investigated. Polymer particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy to determine particle shape and size. The long term stability of both types of polymer particles suggests that the anchoring efficiency in both systems was good. Rheological studies confirmed the sphericity of the particles and showed the particles to be non-flocculated under shear. The thickness of the surface layer was determined from viscosity studies of the dispersions at 298, 308 and 318 K. Solution viscosities dispersions at of a narrow distribution standard of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer in n-heptane and in a binary liquid mixture of n-heptane and n-propanol (79 : 21, v/v) at 298, 308 and 318 K were obtained in order to estimate the root-mean-square end-to-end distance of free <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains. The thickness of the surface layer was observed to increase on raising the temperature and to decrease on changing the solvency of the dispersion medium from a good solvent to almost a theta solvent for the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains. The dimensions of the surface layer were slightly larger than the dimensions of the free <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains in solution suggesting that long <b>ethylene-propylene</b> chains terminally anchored at the interface are only slightly extended over random coil dimensions. Calculations of the mean separation distance between adjacent stabilizing <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains indicated close-packing of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains at the particle-liquid interface which may contribute to the slight extension of the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chain conformation. The theta-conditions for <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer in a mixture of n-heptane and n-propanol were determined using samples obtained by hydrogenating polyisoprene standards. The solvency of the dispersion medium for the stabilizing <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chain on the polymer particles was reduced until flocculation occurred, and this was achieved by cooling the dispersion system to find the critical flocculation temperature or by adding a non-solvent (n-propanol) for the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains at constant temperature to find the critical flocculation volume. The polymer dispersions just retained stability at theta conditions and started to lose stability when the dispersion medium was changed to slightly worse than a theta system for the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> chains. The close correspondence of the flocculation conditions to the theta conditions for free <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer chains confirms that the steric stabilization mechanism is operative for these dispersions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the effects of the {{switching}} frequency of a periodic switching polymerization process (PSPP) with a Ti-based Ziegler-Natta catalyst on the microstructures of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymers in polypropylene/poly(ethylene-co-propylene) (PP/EPR) in-reactor alloys. The compositions and structures of PP/EPR in-reactor alloys are investigated by solvent fractionation, C- 13 NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), successive self-nucleation and annealing (SSA) by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and statistical deconvolution. The sequence distributions of <b>ethylene-propylene</b> random copolymer (EPR) and <b>ethylene-propylene</b> segmented copolymer (EPS) are successfully deconvoluted from the C- 13 NMR spectra of fractionated samples. The results are consistent with the expected effects of the switching frequency on the composition and microstructures of EPR and EPS. A higher switching frequency between the homopolymerization of propylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene increases not only the ratio between the EPS and EPR but also the fractions of long PP segments and long PE segments in the EPS. The effect of the mean residence time on the composition and microstructure of PP/EPR in reactor alloys is also discussed...|$|E

The comparison between the experimental diffraction intensities with the calculated intensities for ordered and disordered pseudohexagonal chain aggregates has allowed us to clarify some features {{of the structure of}} the pseudo-hexagonal form of the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymers: (i) the methyl groups of the propylene monomeric units are included in the crystalline phase; (ii) the pseudo-hexagonal packing of the nearly trans-planar copolymer chains corresponds locally to relative shifts of neighboring chains nearer to those observed in the monoclinic and in the more common orthorhombic form of polyethylene; (iii) the ratio between the integrated intensities of the main peaks on the first layer line and on the equator can be accounted for by conformational disorder, implying a waviness of the nearly trans-planar chains and departures from strictly 180 degrees of internal rotation angles in the backbone chains; (iv) some further partial disorder (intermolecular translational along c and intermolecular rotational around c) should be introduced to account for the broadness of the nonequatorial peaks.

40|$|International audienceIn this article, <b>ethylene-propylene</b> copolymer/lamellar {{graphite}} nanocomposites were processed {{to be used}} in rotational molding. The {{addition of}} graphite aims at increasing the thermal conductivity of polyolefin and reducing processing cycle time. This article describes the different ways to get a well-controlled dispersion of fillers in the matrix. For that, the control of the filler/matrix interactions is necessary. Graphite was treated with a concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid solution to lead to a graphite intercalation compound (GIC). By heating at high temperature, expanded lamellar graphite is so obtained. As the graphite surface energy is higher than polyolefin matrix one, the initial graphite and expanded graphite were treated with stearic acid, commonly used in the case of calcium carbonate, in order to match the surface energy of the hydrophobic matrix.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the microstructural and the mechanical properties of poly-(propylene-ethylene) bi-phasic copolymers. The copolymers investigated covered a comonomer content ranging between 4 and 23 percent ethylene. Nine grades were considered, with variables such as the melt flow index, the degree of crystallinity, the molecular weight distribution and the effect of a nucleating agent being examined. These copolymers have been characterised in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the interrelationship between the morphological structure and their physical, mechanical, thermal and thermo-mechanical properties. The toughness of the copolymers can be enhanced at low temperatures by increasing the ethylene content, at the expense of a loss in stiffness. A study of the microstructure using the scanning electron microscope indicates that a good balance between these two properties can be achieved through a uniform size and spatial distribution of the <b>ethylene-propylene</b> rubber particles within the polypropylene homopolymer matrix.

The flow behaviour of post-consumer recycled polyolefins, their blends and layered-silicate nanocomposites was studied by capillary rheometry and freesurface melt state elongational measurements to assess suitability for foaming applications.
