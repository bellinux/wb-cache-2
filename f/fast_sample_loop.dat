40|$|A low-field medium-resolution NMR spectrometer, with an {{operating}} frequency of 29 MHz for 1 H, has been assessed for on-line process analysis. A flow cell that incorporates a pre-magnetisation region {{has been developed}} to minimise the decrease in the signal owing to incomplete polarisation effects. The homogeneous esterification reaction of crotonic acid and 2 -butanol was monitored using a simple sampling loop; {{it was possible to}} monitor the progression of the reaction through changes in CH signal areas of butanol and butyl crotonate. On-line analysis of heterogeneous water-toluene mixtures proved more challenging and a <b>fast</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>loop</b> system was devised for use with a 5 L reactor. The <b>fast</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>loop</b> operated at a flow rate of 8 L min− 1 and a secondary <b>sampling</b> <b>loop</b> was used to pass a sub-sample through the NMR analyser at a slower (mL min− 1) rate. It was shown that even with super-isokinetic sampling conditions, unrepresentative sampling could occur owing to inadequate mixing in the reactor. However, it was still possible to relate the 1 H NMR signal obtained at a flow rate of 60 mL min− 1 to the composition of the reactor contents...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{simulation}} model for lab-on-a-chip systems, the three approaches of <b>sample</b> <b>loop,</b> hydraulic focusing and dielectrophoretic focusing were investigated with a view to increasing sensitivity. The bonding rate can be increased significantly using <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> and hydraulic focusing. Both approaches involve a considerable extension of the measurement period, though the target bonding rate can be achieved more quickly with <b>sample</b> <b>loop</b> than with hydraulic focusing. By using suitable analytes which can be deflected using dielectrophoresis, the bonding rate can be significantly increased without any extension of the measurement period...|$|R
