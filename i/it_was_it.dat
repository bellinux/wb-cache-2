5|$|Sergey Zagraevsky, {{a modern}} art historian, {{surveyed}} hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from {{the eleventh century}} onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes. First onion domes displayed on some pictures of twelfth century (two miniatures from Dobrylov Evangelie). He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes. He explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>It</b> seems logical that elongated, or onion, domes {{were part of the}} same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.|$|E

Of this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few days before I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke then, but now I understood how a prisoner feels these things.|$|E
25|$|The school survived its denigrators; it {{merged with}} King's College {{for a period}} after 1831 and moved 60 years later to its present {{location}} in Deer Park, which was then a rural area. The government of Ontario then stopped funding UCC in 1900, thus making it a completely independent school. By 1910, however, UCC was dealing with declining enrollment and capital and considered selling the Deer Park campus for $1.125 million and moving again to become a full boarding school on a property purchased in Norval, Ontario. Plans were halted by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War and the college remained where <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>It</b> eventually thrived there, both physically and culturally, as the buildings were expanded and bright instructors attracted.|$|E

25|$|A {{major issue}} {{at all levels}} was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's {{practice}} of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace. If it was the former, Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy for his pager messages. The city and department argued that Duke could not set or amend policy so {{what he said was}} irrelevant. And even if <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> did not matter since the pager messages could be disclosed under the California Public Records Act. The plaintiffs argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was all that mattered.|$|E
25|$|In 1361, Prince Vojislav {{started a}} war with the Republic of Ragusa over some territories. Ragusans then asked most eminent persons in Serbia to use their {{influence}} to stop these hostilities harmful for the both sides. In 1362 the Ragusans also applied to stavilac Lazar and presented him with three bolts of cloth. A relatively modest present as <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> testifies that Lazar was perceived as having some influence at the court of Tsar Uroš. The peace between Prince Vojislav and Ragusa was signed in August 1362. Stavilac Lazar is mentioned as a witness in a July 1363 document by which Tsar Uroš approved an exchange of lands between Prince Vojislav and čelnik Musa. The latter man had been married to Lazar's sister, Dragana, since at least 1355. Musa's title, čelnik ("headman"), was of a higher rank than stavilac.|$|E
25|$|But {{that it was}} not {{the intent}} of the Amendment to {{denounce}} every act done to an individual which was wrong if done to a free man, and yet justified in a condition of slavery, and to give authority to Congress to enforce such denunciation, consider the legislation in respect to the Chinese. In slave times, in the slave states, not infrequently every free negro was required to carry with him a copy of a judicial decree or other evidence of his right to freedom or be subject to arrest. That was one of the incidents or badges of slavery. By the Act of May 5, 1892, Congress required all Chinese laborers within the limits of the United States to apply for a certificate, and anyone who, after one year from the passage of the act, should be found within the jurisdiction of the United States without such certificate might be arrested and deported. In Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, the validity of the Chinese deportation act was presented, elaborately argued, and fully considered by this Court. While there was a division of opinion, yet at no time during the progress of the litigation, and by no individual, counsel, or court connected with <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> suggested that the requiring of such a certificate was evidence of a condition of slavery, or prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment.|$|E

500|$|Chrysippus had a {{long and}} {{successful}} career of resisting the attacks of the Academy and hoped not simply to defend Stoicism against the assaults of the past, but also against all possible attack in the future. He took the doctrines of Zeno and Cleanthes and crystallized them into what became the definitive system of Stoicism. He elaborated the physical doctrines of the Stoics and their theory of knowledge and he created much of their formal logic. In short, Chrysippus made the Stoic system what <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>It</b> was said that [...] "without Chrysippus, {{there would have been}} no Stoa".|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Gadget" [...] was a {{laboratory}} euphemism for a bomb, {{from which the}} laboratory's weapon physics division, [...] "G Division", took its name in August 1944. At that time it did not refer specifically to the Trinity Test device as it {{had yet to be}} developed, but once <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> became the laboratory code name. The Trinity Gadget was officially a Y-1561 device, as was the Fat Man used a few weeks later in the bombing of Nagasaki. The two were very similar, with only minor differences, the most obvious being the absence of fuzing and the external ballistic casing. The bombs were still under development, and small changes continued to be made to the Fat Man design.|$|E

500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic.

[...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails to pack the band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or too lazy to move forward".|$|E

[...] Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to. She said: [...] "It was embarrassing and insulting—there were a lot of reasons why I didn’t want to tell the story.

In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> just kind of bummed us out a bit."
