When approaching a crosswalk with an embedded pavement flashing light system, drivers are more apt to slow down and yield to pedestrians than when drivers approach a crosswalk with another type of lighted <b>warning</b> <b>device.</b> Also, compared to a crosswalk with no <b>warning</b> <b>device,</b> drivers are more likely to slow down and yield to pedestrians when the embedded pavement flashing light system is in place.|$|R

Level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> are examples of such systems where technically safe states within the system boundary can influence road user performance, giving rise to other hazards that degrade safety of the system. Chris will discuss the challenges that have been encountered to date in developing a safety argument in support of low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> The design and failure modes of level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> {{are known to have}} a significant influence on road user performance; however, quantifying this effect is one of the ongoing challenges in determining appropriate reliability and availability targets for low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractConstruction workers {{suffer the}} most {{electrocution}}s among all industries. Major reasons for electrocution {{in the construction}} industries are workers contact with the power line or material handling equipment contact with the power line.

For the prevention of equipment related accidents, a low cost <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> has been developed using IC CD 4033. Warning device for the worker is envisaged by using elastic conductive cuffs around the wrist of the worker.

40|$|Railway level {{crossings}} {{have the potential}} to bring motor vehicles and trains into fatal contact. In Australia there are approximately 9, 400 public railway {{level crossings}} across the country, protected either passively (64 %) or by active/automated systems (28 %). Passive crossings provide only a stationary sign warning of the possibility of trains crossing. Their message remains constant over time. Active systems, by contrast, activate automatic <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., flashing lights, bells, barrier, etc.) as a train approaches. Using a driving simulator, this paper compares driver compliance at railway level crossings equipped with either active or passive <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> including a stop sign, rumble strips, flashing lights/bell and in-vehicle auditory warning. This paper describes the driving simulator data collection and findings and subsequently draws conclusions on driver compliance with respect to different types of <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> The results indicate that drivers behave differently and are more compliant at active crossings than at passive crossings...|$|R
40|$|Control at railway level crossings, {{using either}} road rumble strips or {{in-vehicle}} auditory <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> {{has the potential}} to improve safety. This article evaluates driver behavior of these two devices and two conventional crossing devices (flashing lights and a stop sign) using a driving simulator. Rumble strips have been seen to encourage drivers to reduce speed earlier on approach to a level crossing but did not affect stopping compliance. In-vehicle auditory warnings have produced high compliance and, overall, have produced behavior comparable to that seen for conventional flashing lights. However, the detailed design features of such devices require further development before more concrete conclusions can be drawn. Contributing factors of age, gender, speed, and types of <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> were all found to significantly affect driver behavior at crossings. Overall, the results indicate that drivers behave differently and demonstrate higher signal compliance at actively protected crossings than at passively protected crossings for alternative and conventional <b>warning</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the findings of}} three experiments that concern driver reaction to acoustic signals that might be used for backup <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> Intelligent <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> are under development that will use vehicle-based sensors to warn backing drivers {{of the presence of}} objects behind the vehicle. The research described here {{is part of a larger}} project concerned with the human factors of these <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> Specifically, the questions of interest center around what warning information to provide, when to present it, and how to display it. Based on previous work (Lerner, Kotwal, Lyons, and Gardner-Bonneau, 1996; Huey, Harpster, and Lerner, 1996), this research focuses on acoustic signals, which are seen as more suitable for backup warnings than are visual displays. The three experiments were conducted dealing with different aspects of driver perception and response to backup warning signals, with the objective of contributing to the development of a set of recommendations f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{air quality}} in schools has been {{associated}} with adverse health effects. Indoor air quality can be improved by increasing ventilation. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve ventilation behavior in primary schools. We used indoor CO(2) concentrations as an indicator. In 81 classes of 20 Dutch primary schools, we applied three different interventions: (i) a class-specific ventilation advice; (ii) the advice combined with a CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and (iii) the advice combined with a teaching package. The effectiveness of the interventions was tested directly after intervention and 6 weeks after intervention by measuring the CO(2) concentrations and comparison with a control group (iv). Before intervention, the CO(2) concentration exceeded 1000 ppm for 64 % of the school day. The class-specific ventilation advice without further support appeared an ineffective tool to improve ventilation behavior. The advice in combination with a CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> or the teaching package proved effective tools and resulted in lower indoor CO(2) concentrations when compared with the control group. Ventilation was significantly improved, but CO(2) concentrations still exceeded 1000 ppm for more than 40 % of the school day. Hence, until ventilation facilities are upgraded, the CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and the teaching package are useful low-cost tools. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: To improve ventilation behavior and indoor air quality in schools, CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and teaching package combined with a class-specific ventilation advice, are effective tools, while giving the ventilation advice solely, is not effective. Although ventilation is significantly improved through behavioral change, the ventilation rate is still insufficient to maintain good air quality during the full school day. Therefore, the improvement of the ventilation facilities is recommended. Hence, until ventilation facilities in schools are upgraded, the CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and the teaching package are useful low-cost tools to improve current indoor air quality...|$|R
