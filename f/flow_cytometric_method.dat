40|$|Determination of the {{proportion}} of neutrophils in the peripheral blood is important for diagnostic purposes in medicine and for evaluating new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. To measure the neutrophil concentration in rat blood, a fast and accurate <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> was developed. Rat neutrophils were quantified by using primary antibodies that recognize the RP 1 antigen and secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> was calibrated by comparing cytometric results with data from a manual differential count. The results obtained by these 2 methods correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 91 and were in agreement according to subsequent statistical analysis. To confirm {{the usefulness of the}} method in preclinical applications, the production of neutrophils in rats was stimulated by pegfilgrastim. Blood samples were taken at predetermined time points, and the pharmacodynamic profile was determined. These results confirmed that the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> for neutrophil quantification is accurate and much faster than the manual microscopic method. Moreover, the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> is easy to use, suggesting that it could become the method of choice for preclinical applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of flow cytometric antifungal susceptibility testing {{has been studied}} using the fluorescent anionic membrane potential probe, bis-(1, 3 -dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol [DiBAC 4 (3) ]. The in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of amphotericin B was performed on 8 Candida isolates from clinical specimens and 2 ATCC strains by flow cytometry with the results compared {{to those of the}} National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M 27 -T, broth macrodilution method. The <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> is based on an increase of fluorescence given out by DiBAC 4 (3) in fungi when they are killed by antifungal agents. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amphotericin B ranged from 0. 25 to 1 microg/mL. All results agreed within +/- 2 dilution between the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> and the M 27 -T method. MIC with ATCC strains were within recommended ranges of M 27 -T.

40|$|Background Fluorescently labeled ligands and <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>methods</b> allow {{quantification}} of receptor-ligand binding. Such methods require calibration of the fluorescence of bound ligands. Moreover, binding of unlabeled ligands can {{be calculated}} based on their abilities to compete with a labeled ligand. In this study, calibration parameters were determined for six fluorescently labeled N-formyl peptides that bind to receptors on neutrophils. Two of these ligands were then used to develop and validate competitive binding protocols for determining binding constants of unlabeled ligands. <b>Methods</b> Spectrofluorometric and <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>methods</b> for converting relative <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> intensities to number of bound ligand/cell were extended to include peptides labeled with fluorescein, Bodipy, and tetramethylrhodamine. The validity of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> competitive binding protocols was tested using two ligands with different fluorescent properties that allowed determination of rate constants both directly and competitively for one ligand, CHO-NLFNYK-tetramethylrhodamine. Results Calibration parameters were determined for six fluorescently-labeled N-formyl peptides. Equilibrium dissociation constants for these ligands varied over two orders of magnitude and depended upon the peptide sequence and the molecular structure of the fluorescent tag. Kinetic rate constants for CHO-NLFNYK-tetramethylrhodamine determined directly or in competition with CHO-NLFNYK-fluorescein were statistically identical. Conclusions Combination of spectrofluorometric and <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>methods</b> allows convenient calculation of calibration parameters {{for a series of}} fluorescent ligands that bind to the same receptor site.

In this report, we describe a new <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> approach for determination of in vitro cell-mediated cytotoxicity utilizing three-color <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> assay. <b>Methods</b> This method is based on monoclonal antibody staining of either effector or target cells to evaluate cytotoxicity with increased accuracy by utilizing fluorospheres for calibration. The basic strategy involves labeling effector or target cells with a specific fluorescent-conjugated monoclonal antibody, in {{addition to}} staining with annexinV-FITC and propidium iodide to identify apoptotic/dead cells. The effector and target cell populations as well as conjugates were clearly and easily identified by this approach. Results We obtained significant correlation between cytotoxicity calculated by this technique and 51 chromium release assay results. The integration of fluorospheres allowed us to determine the absolute number of events reflective of the cumulative cell death rather than a cross-sectional, percentage-based cytotoxicity assessment in the target cell population {{at the time of}} analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} {{significant}} progress {{in the last two}} decades on the design of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) for adoptive immunotherapy targeting tumor-associated antigens. Structurally CARs consist of a single chain antibody fragment directed against a tumor-associated antigen fused to an extracellular spacer and transmembrane domain followed by T cell cytoplasmic signaling moieties. Currently several clinical trials are underway using gene modified peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with CARs directed against a variety of tumor associated antigens. Despite the improvements in the design of CARs and expansion of the number of target antigens, there is no universal <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> available to detect the expression of CARs on the surface of transduced lymphocytes. Methods Currently anti-fragment antigen binding (Fab) conjugates are most widely used to determine the expression of CARs on gene-modified lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The limitations of these reagents are that many of them are not commercially available, generally they are polyclonal antibodies and often the results are inconsistent. In an effort to develop a simple universal <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> to detect the expression of CARs, we employed protein L to determine the expression of CARs on transduced lymphocytes. Protein L is an immunoglobulin (Ig) -binding protein that binds to the variable light chains (kappa chain) of Ig without interfering with antigen binding site. Protein L binds to most classes of Ig and also binds to single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) and Fab fragments. Results We used CARs derived from both human and murine antibodies to validate this novel protein L based <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>method</b> and the results correlated well with other established methods. Activated human PBLs were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing two human antibody based CARs (anti-EGFRvIII, and anti-VEGFR 2), two murine antibody derived CARs (anti-CSPG 4, and anti-CD 19), and two humanized mouse antibody based CARs (anti-ERBB 2, and anti-PSCA). Transduced cells were stained first with biotin labeled protein L followed by phycoerythrin (PE) -conjugated streptavidin (SA) and analyzed by flow cytometry. For comparison, cells were stained in parallel with biotin conjugated goat-anti-mouse Fab or CAR specific fusion proteins. Using protein L, all CAR transduced lymphocytes exhibited specific staining pattern ranging from 40 to 80 % of positive cells (compared to untransduced cells) and staining was comparable to the pattern observed with anti-Fab antibodies. Conclusion Our data demonstrate the feasibility of employing Protein L as a general reagent for the detection of CAR expression on transduced lymphocytes by flow cytometry. </p...|$|E

In this procedure, the RBCs in the samples were lysed by ammonium chloride treatment and the white cells (WBCs) were detected by flow cytometry according to their specific light-scattering properties. The identity of the WBC subpopulations was confirmed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies specific for each cell type. Flow cytometric determination of WBCs in filtered RBCs correlated with numbers obtained by both a hemocytometer (r = 0. 76) and a radioimmunoassay (r = 0. 79). Total numbers of WBCs in RBCs measured by flow cytometry were 59 +/- 13 percent (n = 7) of those measured by electronic particle counting, 32 +/- 6 percent (n = 25) by hemocytometer, and 48 +/- 11 percent (n = 29) by radioimmunoassay. Lymphocytes added to filtered RBCs in a concentration of 1. 37 cells per microL were detected at an average of 0. 56 +/- 0. 22 cells per microL (n = 3).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have developed novel three color whole blood <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>methods</b> for tracking of infused platelets and measurement of their function in vivo. RESULTS: These methods were used to demonstrate that circulating P-selectin-positive (degranulated) platelets rapidly lose surface P-selectin to the plasma pool, but continue to circulate and function. CONCLUSIONS: 1) These studies strongly suggest that the measurement of platelet surface P-selectin in platelet concentrates stored in the blood bank should not be used as a predictor of platelet survival or function in vivo. 2) The described methods provide the means to answer many previously difficult to address questions about in vivo platelet function in transfusion medicine...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis (programmed cell death) Â¡sa {{critical}} element in normal physiology {{and in many}} disease processes. Phosphatidylserine (PS), one component of cell membrane phospholipids, is nor mally confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Early {{in the course of}} apoptosis, this phospholipid is rapidly exposed on the cell's outer surface. Annexin V, an endogenous human protein, has a high affinity for membrane-bound PS. This protein has been labeled with fluorescein and has been used to detect apoptosis in vitro. We describe the use of radiolabeled annexin V to detect apoptosis in vivo. The results are compared to histologie and <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>methods</b> to identify cells and tissues undergo ing apoptosis. Methods: Annexin V was coupled to hydrazinoni-cotinamide (HYNIC) and radiolabeled with 99 mTc. Bioreactivity of 99 mTc-HYNICannexin V was compared with fluorescein isothio-cyanate (FITC) -labeled annexin V in cultures of Jurkat T-cel...|$|R
40|$|The {{monoclonal}} antibody ELK 3 - 51 was previously developed to detect adducts of the 2 -nitroimidazole EF 5. Direct immunofluorescence {{was used to}} detect adducts of EF 5 or of a platinated derivative cis-[PtCl 2 (NH 3) EF 5] in SCCVII cells treated under aerobic or hypoxic conditions. Fluorescence measurements of these cells using both image and <b>flow</b> <b>cytometric</b> <b>methods</b> were compared, giving similar profiles. Platination significantly decreased immunofluorescence levels (approximately 4 -fold less than EF 5) after 3 h in hypoxia, but also increased levels after exposure in air (approximately 1. 5 x) such that the hypoxic ratio decreased from approximately 50 to approximately 13. Platinated EF 5 also showed significantly greater cytotoxicity than its parent in both aerobic and hypoxic cells. These {{results are consistent with}} targeting of EF 5 to DNA, which was confirmed qualitatively by confocal microscopy...|$|R
