5000|$|Peter Bennett {{was born}} as Pietro Benedetto in The Bronx, New York. As a distant cousin to singer Tony Bennett, Peter changed {{his last name}} in the early 1950s as his famous {{relation}} had. Peter and Tony both knew they had family from a similar Italian locale and remained close through the music business. Pete Bennett first entered the entertainment world as a drummer. In 1956 {{at the age of}} twenty one he sat in with trombonist and big bandleader Tommy Dorsey at New York's Paramount Theater. An historic engagement that held a reunion of Dorsey and his former boy singer of the early 1940s, Frank Sinatra. Bennett made his television debut in 1961 performing on drums his first single, [...] "Fever," [...] with his group Pete Bennett And The Embers on ABC-TV's Dick Clark's American Bandstand. His behind the scene work helping singer Bobby Vinton plug his early 1962 recordings for Epic Records first introduced Bennett to the world of music promotion. By the summer of '62, Peter was working his new found magic pushing Nat King Cole's Capitol Records single Ramblin' Rose into the top 10, a return for Nat after four years. In 1963 Bennett began a long-standing business relationship with accountant, turned personal manager Allen Klein. Klein at the time held exclusive representation of soul and R & B legend Sam Cooke. Bennett helped Cooke's return to the top 10 charts promoting classics such as [...] "Another Saturday Night" [...] and [...] "Shake." [...] By 1964 Klein and Bennett found themselves {{at the center of the}} British invasion. Following the American release of The Beatles second LP, [...] "With The Beatles," [...] and its unprecedented success, Klein arranged business deals to handle the stateside affairs of other leading UK groups including The Rolling Stones, The Animals and Herman's Hermits. It fell on Pete Bennett's shoulders to persuade disk jockeys coast to coast to break iconic musical time pieces such as [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", [...] "The House Of The Rising Sun" [...] and [...] "I'm Henry VIII, I Am" [...] into nationwide number one hits. Peter believed, and told many colleagues, that the [...] "B" [...] side of The Stones single, [...] "Satisfaction," [...] "The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man," [...] was an ode to himself. On August 15, 1965 Bennett drove Mick Jagger and Bobby Vinton to The Beatles performance at Shea Stadium in New York City. While watching the opening number, [...] "Twist And Shout" [...] from the dugout area, several teenage girls noticed Jagger and began a frenzied screaming fit. Bennett grabbed Jagger yelling, [...] "We gotta <b>get</b> <b>outta</b> <b>here</b> or we're gonna get killed!" [...] Swiftly departing this mini-mania, they missed the rest of the show. A year later Frank Sinatra sought Bennett's assistance in making his 1966 Reprise Records release, [...] "Strangers In The Night" [...] his first chart topper in eleven years. Pete also found his services requested by Elvis Presley. In 1969, at the end of a long career slump, Bennett helped push the single release [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] to number one, Presley's first in seven years. Bennett was a backstage guest at Presley's opening night comeback to the concert stage at The International Hotel in Las Vegas in July 1969. In 1970 Perry Como recorded [...] "It's Impossible," [...] a ballad in his easy going style he believed could break through the rock and soul wave that kept him at the bottom for over a decade. Phone calls and a few back favors owed to Bennett helped this violin laden lament give Como, a singer with 14 number one records to his credit, his first top 10 hit since 1958.|$|E

And the one after that, that’s my final album. It’s called Kill the King. The last album is Kill the King. Simply because ever since my first album, I've put the title of 'King of the South' on me and to make yourself the king is to make you a target. And in chess, the object is to kill the king.
