5|$|St. John's {{architecture}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> style {{from the}} rest of Canada, and its major buildings are remnants of its history {{as one of the first}} British colonial capitals. Buildings took a variety of styles according to the means available to build them.|$|E
5|$|The Kirtlandian <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> fauna, {{including}} four species distinguishing it from other ages. The species include the dinosaurians Pentaceratops sternbergii, Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus, and Kritosaurus navajovius, {{with the only}} non-dinosaurian being Melvius chauliodous, a fish taxon.|$|E
5|$|Humidity {{levels are}} usually very high all year round. Manila <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> dry season from December through May, and a {{relatively}} lengthy wet season {{that covers the}} remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures. In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods. Typhoons usually occur from June to September.|$|E

5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its tip and is much simpler and generalized in structure, making it clearly distinguishable {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> plica mediana and its plicae fimbriatae are large and stick to the entire underside of the tongue. The plica sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when {{in flight}} and at all times of the day. They are more noisy {{early in the morning}} and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud {{distinctive}} call has been translated as Kadow-Kadang or Curra-wong, akin to a croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as Wheeo. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct,</b> more melodious call.|$|E
5|$|The huge, vaulted lid of N. rajah, {{the largest}} in the genus, is another {{distinguishing}} characteristic of this species. It is ovate to oblong in shape and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> keel running down the middle, with two prominent lateral veins. The spur {{at the back of the}} lid is approximately 20mm long and unbranched.|$|E

5|$|In the aye-aye, the sublingua is not {{shaped like}} a brush like it is in most lemurs. Instead, there is a {{thickened}} area along the plica mediana or lytta which has a hook-shaped structure on the end. Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray mouse lemur <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> plica mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposing}} side is Siam, a Siamese cat who controls all of West Ikebukuro {{and is the}} leader of the Siam Army. Siam's principal henchman and general of the Siam Army is Kline, who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> hatred for humans and sees them only as her potential slaves. Acting as Siam's bodyguards are A-Ko and I-Ko, two Manx cats. Having been previously discriminated against for their lack of tails, A-Ko and I-Ko pretended to have tails, fearing rejection from Siam.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 5–6.5μm, broadly , smooth, and {{strongly}} amyloid (it turns black when treated with Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) {{are embedded in}} the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26–36 by 5–10μm, and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick. The flesh of the gills is homogeneous, and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> , a well-differentiated hypoderm (a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle), and a filamentous tramal body (gill tissue); it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{has held}} many titles and honorary {{military}} positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders {{in her own}} countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end of the foot <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped operculum, which is reinforced by a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's foot is rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the attachment point for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The lichen <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> {{prothallus}}—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at {{the edge}} that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E

In 1938, Herbert F. Copeland proposed a four-kingdom classification, elevating the protist classes of bacteria (Monera) and blue-green algae (Phycochromacea) to phyla in the novel Kingdom Monera.|$|R
