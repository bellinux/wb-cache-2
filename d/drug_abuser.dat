40|$|This thesis {{attempted}} {{to determine if}} there were personality characteristic differences, as measured by the MMPI, between <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who left treatment prematurely and <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who remained in treatment {{for an extended period of}} time. In addition, it was {{attempted to}} determine if there were personality characteristic differences between <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who entered treatment voluntarily and <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who were required by law to obtain treatment. The MMPI protocols of 59 male <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> were divided into four groups and subjected to a two by two multivariate and Univariate Analysis of Variance. Results show that no significant differences were found between <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> admitted voluntarily and <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> admitted involuntarily. Significant differences were found between <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who left treatment prematurely and <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who remained in treatment for an extended period of time. <b>Drug</b> <b>abusers</b> remaining in treatment scored higher on scales Two, Seven, and Eight of the WI, while <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> who left treatment scored higher on the Lie scale.

40|$|During 1985 many <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> {{who lived}} in Edinburgh {{were found to be}} {{infected}} with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As a result an alternative counselling and screening clinic for testing for antibodies to HIV was established for use by <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b> Four hundred and forty one patients were counselled in the first year, and over 60 % were either <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> or their sexual contacts. One hundred and fourteen (26 %) patients were positive for HIV antibody, and 100 (88 %) of these were current or former <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b> The HIV seropositivity rate in <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> was 52 % but was only 7 % in their sexual contacts. Services were provided for these people as well as counselling before and after the test. The cost of this counselling service for the first year was 27, 000 pounds or 61. 22 pounds per patient. The unexpected mobility of 23 % of the Edinburgh <b>drug</b> <b>abusers,</b> particularly to other areas of Britain, suggests that similar services need to be set up elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the frequency and nature of chronic liver disease among intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> attending the <b>Drug</b> Advisory and Treatment Centre in Dublin. Between 1 May and 31 December 1979, 139 <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> attended the Centre; 127 were intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>abusers,</b> and of these, 46 agreed to have liver biopsies. On the basis of the biopsies and interviews and physical examinations, the authors suggested that six-tenths of the ntravenous <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> attending the <b>Drug</b> Advisory and Detoxification Centre had some form of chronic liver disease, with just under one in five suffering from chronic aggressive hepatitis. The authors stated that these results demonstrated the magnitude of the healthcare needs in relation to liver disease among intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> in Ireland, and highlighted an area where active immunisation against hepatitis B and non-A and non-B-hepatitis was urgently needed...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} {{variables that}} discriminate needle-sharing among <b>drug</b> <b>abusers,</b> 224 male <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> were studied. They had {{been admitted to}} a 30 -day inpatient drug treatment program over a 19 -month period (September 1983 through March 1985). The variables examined were divided into three categories: demographic (age, race, education), personality (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory [MMPI] scores and MMPI deviant scores), and drug use patterns (drug of choice, use of single or multiple [mixed] drugs, severity of drug use, and place of use). Three variables were identified that discriminated needle-sharers from other <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b> Compared with other <b>drug</b> <b>abusers,</b> needle-sharers used more multiple drugs, {{were more likely to}} use a "shooting gallery," and had more problems related to drug use. No demographic or personality variables discriminated needle-sharers from nonsharers. The data suggested that needle-sharing is widespread in the drug culture. Needle-sharing was not confined to a particular racial group, educational level, or personality type. These findings can be used to structure education programs about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b> <b>Drug</b> treatment programs appear to provide an important opportunity to educate <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> about AIDS and related health issues associated with needle-sharing...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} examine the role of police force in facilitating access the health {{services}} to people who use Narcotic drugs in Tanzania. Specifically, the study aimed to identify health related services available to <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> in Tanzania, examine the attitude of Police towards people who abuse drugs and establish whether attitude of Police hinders <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> access to health services. Case study research design guided the study. Face to face interviews with respondents was used to collect primary data using structured a questionnaire. Secondary data were also collected, this involved systematic identification, location and analysis of documents containing information related to the subject matter. Findings show that the attitude of majority of police officers towards facilitating access to treatment among <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> is negative and it hinders such <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> to access treatment. The main reason is that majority of police officers {{are not aware of}} the current policy on treatment of <b>drug</b> <b>abusers.</b> The study recommends that there should be an effective coordination between opioid dependence treatment systems and the criminal justice system. Medical Assisted Treatment services should actively involve police officers in the planning, implementation and monitoring of drug dependence treatment services. There should be clear definition of the role of Police Officers in facilitating access to treatment for <b>drug</b> <b>abusers...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>abusers</b> {{typically}} consume {{not just}} one but several types of drugs, starting from alcohol and marijuana consumption, and then dramatically lapsing into addiction to harder drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, or amphetamine. The brain of <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> presents various structural and neurophysiological abnormalities, {{some of which may}} predate drug consumption onset. However, how these changes translate into modifications in functional brain connectivity is still poorly understood. To characterize functional connectivity patterns, we recorded Electroencephalogram (EEG) activity from 21 detoxified <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> and 20 age-matched control subjects performing a simple counting task and at rest activity. To evaluate the cortical brain connectivity network we applied the Synchronization Likelihood algorithm. The results showed that <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> had higher synchronization levels at low frequencies, mainly in the θ band (4 – 8 Hz) between frontal and posterior cortical regions. During the counting task, patients showed increased synchronization in the β (14 – 35 Hz), and γ (35 – 45 Hz) frequency bands, in fronto-posterior and interhemispheric temporal regions. Taken together 'slow-down' at rest and task-related 'over-exertion' could indicate that the brain of <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> is suffering from a premature form of ageing. Future studies will clarify whether this condition can be reversed following prolonged periods of abstinence...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{prevalence}} of drug abuse among welfare recipients in Houston, TX and compare the work activities and employment barriers of <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> in order to better understand the potential effects of welfare reform for this population. Four hypotheses were tested comparing the work activities and employment barriers of <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> to others on welfare and the relative importance of drug abuse and employment barriers in predicting work activity. ^ This cross-sectional study examined the characteristics and work activities of 447 welfare recipients (81 <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> and 366 non-abusers) who were surveyed between October 1998 and April 1999 in Houston, TX. Subjects were introduced and recruited to participate in the study through a flyer, door to door visits, and peer driven recruitment/referral. ^ About 18 % were found to be <b>drug</b> <b>abusers,</b> which is consistent with the national average (10 – 33 %) among welfare recipients. Compared to others on welfare, <b>drug</b> <b>abusers</b> were less involved in work activities, and had more employment barriers. Employment barriers were found to be more predictive of welfare to work activities than drug abuse. The results suggest that alleviating employment barriers should be stressed in programs aimed at welfare recipients with drug abuse problems. ...|$|R
