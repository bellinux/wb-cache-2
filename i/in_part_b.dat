Part B is optional and may be deferred if the beneficiary or his/her spouse is still working and has group health coverage through that employer. There is a lifetime penalty (10% per year on the premium) imposed for not enrolling <b>in</b> <b>Part</b> <b>B</b> unless actively working and receiving group health coverage from that employer, or covered by programs of the Veterans Health Administration.|$|E
2500|$|One {{route is}} to follow the {{prescriptive}} guidance <b>in</b> <b>Part</b> <b>B.</b> This states that insulation and “filler materials” used for external cladding should be of limited combustibility but other elements, including the core of an external rainscreen panel, aren’t covered by this definition. The building inspection regime is under pressure, competition between Local Authority Building Control and private approved inspectors has driven down costs, which must impact on quality. Local authority budget cuts have {{reduced the number of}} building control officers.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{prominent}} test {{of executive}} dysfunction {{is known as}} the Trail-making test. This test is composed of two main parts (Part A & Part B). Part B differs from Part A specifically in that it assesses more complex factors of motor control and perception. Part B of the Trail-making test consists of multiple circles containing letters (A-L) and numbers (1-12). The participant’s objective for this test is to connect the circles in order, alternating between number and letter (e.g. 1-A-2-B) from start to finish. The participant is required not to lift their pencil from the page. The task is also timed as a means of assessing speed of processing. [...] Set-switching tasks <b>in</b> <b>Part</b> <b>B</b> have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function. Throughout this task, some of the executive function skills that are being measured include impulsivity, visual attention and motor speed.|$|E
