Currently, the mammal {{population}} is threatened due to many reasons such as wildfires and poaching.The reserve {{is famous for its}} <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia), which represent most part of the few remaining wild <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> in the world. There is estimated to be 1000 tamarins in the reserve and surrounding areas. Currently the <b>Golden</b> Lion <b>Tamarin</b> Conservation Project (GLTCP) is attempting to save the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> from extinction.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, in {{an effort}} to save the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> from extinction, some of the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> have been removed from small, {{isolated}} unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.|$|R

The objetives {{of this study were}} to estimate the marmoset (CM) population in two fragments with reintroduced <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> to quantify the association and characterize the interactions between species. The CM population density (0, 09 ind/ha) was higher than that of the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> (0, 06 ind/ha). The mean association index between tamarins and marmosets varied among groups and seasons (winter= 62 % and summer= 35 %). During the winter, competition resulted in increases in territorial and foraging behavior when associated with marmosets. Evidence of benefits during the summer was reduced adult vigilance while associated to marmosets. <b>Golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> were also observed feeding on gums obtained from tree gouges made by the marmosets.

5000|$|A {{study has}} shown that {{increased}} predation has caused significant decreases in the population numbers. A survey conducted in 1992 found the number of wild population of <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> to be 562 individuals in 109 groups. Currently, the average group size includes 3.6 to 5.7 individuals and densities from 0.39 groups/km to 2.35 groups/km. [...] These predatory attacks occur at the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> sleeping sites. The predators make those sleeping sites, which are mainly tree holes (about 63.6%), larger in order to attack the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins,</b> sometimes wiping out the entire family. The preferred sleeping sites of most <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> are tree holes in living trees next to other larger trees with {{a small percentage of}} canopy cover. These sleeping sites not only provide a place for sleep, but also offer protection and easy access to foraging sites. Most of the tree holes are lower to the ground, so they are easier to enter. Tree holes that are located in living trees are drier, warmer, and have a lower number of insects and therefore a decreased percentage of transmitted diseases. A smaller percentage of canopy coverage allows the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> to detect the predators faster, and being surrounded by other large trees allows them access to escape routes. Due to degradation of their habitats, there are fewer trees that can support entire social groups and some have to resort to using bamboo (17.5%), vine tangles (9.6%), and bromeliads (4.7%) as a sleeping site, making them more susceptible to predators. <b>Golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> are known to use different den sites, but do not change sites often. They are more likely to reuse secure sites that will offer protection. However, the disadvantage of doing so is that predators are able to learn where these sites are located. <b>Golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> also scent mark their den holes, so they can quickly return to them in the afternoon time when predators are most active. While excessive scent makes it easier for <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> to find their sleeping sites, it also helps predators locate their prey. Moreover, increased deforestation has decreased habitat space, providing predators easy access to their prey, causing a decline in the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> population.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia, mico-leão-dourado [...] ), {{also known}} as the golden marmoset, is a small New World monkey of the family Callitrichidae. Native to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil, the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> is an {{endangered}} species with an estimated wild population of about 3,500 individuals spread between four places along southeastern Brazil, and a captive population maintained at about 490 individuals among 150 zoos.|$|R
40|$|Deforestation has a {{major impact}} on forest-dwelling species survival, as species lose their habitat or can no longer subsist in the small {{fragments}} of forests that are left. In this review, the effectiveness of the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia) as a flagship species to protect the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest is discussed. The <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> was almost extinct in the wild in the 1960 s and the captive population was not well established. After research on captive breeding biology, the captive population began to grow in the 1970 s and the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve was created to protect the species in the wild. In the 1980 s, long-term research was started on the ecology and behavior of <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins,</b> along with a reintroduction program of captive-born animals and community environmental education. Zoos contributed the 146 captive-born reintroduced tamarins, and provided critical information on social behavior, nutrition and health used for reintroduction strategies. In 1994, 6 threatened groups that were isolated in small fragments were rescued and translocated to a protected forest. Both translocation and reintroduction programs have been successful as measured by survival and reproduction after release, and both established growing populations, as well as protected habitat. Furthermore, conservation education and habitat restoration have resulted in the development of forest corridors to connect the remaining habitat fragments, allowing dispersal of <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins.</b> By saving the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin,</b> more than 12, 000 ha of Atlantic Forest is now protected by federal law and with this habitat, many other species are also protected. The <b>Golden</b> Lion <b>Tamarin</b> Conservation Program can {{serve as a model for}} conservation activities worldwide, as the program integrates field and captive conservation efforts and shows how extensive research is able to contribute to effective conservation and education activities...|$|R
50|$|In 1987, estrous {{synchrony}} {{was reported}} in female <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> by French and Stribley. Their subjects consisted of five adult female <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> that were housed in two groups. Two females were housed with adult males and three females (a mother and two daughters) were housed with an adult male and infant male. They reported a 2.11 day difference in peak cycle estrogen for the two groups, which was less than the 4.5 day difference that they calculated would be the difference based on <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarins</b> having a 19-day estrous cycle. Schank reanalyzed their study {{with the help of}} computer simulation and reported that a 2.11 day difference was not likely statistically significant. Monfort and colleagues conducted a study with eight females housed in pairs and found no evidence of synchrony.|$|R

25|$|The {{forests that}} <b>golden</b> lion <b>{{tamarins}}</b> {{need in order}} to survive are cut down for timber and to make room for cattle ranches, farms and urbanization. Sometimes very small areas or 'pockets' of forest are left but these are too small for the tamarins to survive in.

50|$|The <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> has a diverse, {{omnivorous}} diet {{consisting of}} fruits, flowers, nectar, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates. They rely on microhabitats for foraging and other daily activities and tamarins will use bromeliads, palm crowns, palm leaf sheaths, woody crevices, lianas, vine tangles, tree bark, rotten logs, and leaf litters. The <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> uses its fingers to extract prey from crevices, under leaves, and in dense growth; a behavior known as micromanipulation. It {{is made possible}} by elongated hands and fingers. Insects make up to 10-15% of its diet. Much of the rest is made of small, sweet, pulpy fruits. During the rainy season, the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> mainly eats fruit, however during drier times, it must eat more of other foods like nectar and gums. Small vertebrates are also consumed more at these times as insects become less abundant.|$|R

50|$|The <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> {{gets its}} name from its bright reddish orange pelage and the extra long hairs around the face and ears which give it a {{distinctive}} mane. Its face is dark and hairless. It is believed that the tamarin gets its hair color from sunlight and carotenoids in its food. The <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> is {{the largest of the}} callitrichines. It is typically around 261 mm and weighs around 620 g. There is almost no size difference between males and females. As with all New World monkeys, the <b>golden</b> lion <b>tamarin</b> has tegulae, which are claw-like nails, instead of ungulae or flat nails found in all other primates, including humans. Tegulae enable tamarins to cling to the sides of tree trunks. It may also move quadrupedally along the small branches, whether through walking, running, leaping or bounding. This gives it a locomotion more similar to squirrels than primates.|$|R

Electrophoretic analyses of captive and free-ranging animals (N = 31) of two allopatric morphotypes, Leontopithecus rosalia chrysopygus and L. r. chrysomelas, were similar to the L. r. rosalia findings insofar as they also revealed limited genetic polymorphism. Computation of the Neigenetic distance measurements showed that the three morphotypes were genetically very similar, although discernible differentiation had occurred at two loci. These data are consistent with the occurrence of recent reproductive isolations of these subspecies...|$|R
