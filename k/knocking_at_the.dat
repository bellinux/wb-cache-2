25|$|Callum, who was {{battling for}} custody over Max, {{attacked}} David and the Platt family for months {{until one day}} when, after the Platt's return from a week-long holiday, Sarah Platt was babysitting Max. Whilst they were watching a scary movie, Gemma Winter, Callum's friend, came <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door of Callum's flat. She had been beaten up by a thug. When Max was playing in his room, he found Callum's gun. Callum threatened Sarah that if she told anyone about the gun then he would release a video of Bethany dealing and taking drugs to the police. Sarah flees with Max, refused to speak to anyone about it and told Bethany {{to stay away from}} him. However, he continued threatening the Platts. Sarah confided in Jason Grimshaw to finish him off. He attacked Callum in the Rovers and told him to stay away. He was then arrested for possession of the gun but was released without charge due to lack of evidence. When Callum arrived at the Platts' house to collect Max, David and Jason prevented him. Furious, Callum and two of his thugs lead Jason into the ginnel and beat him up. Sarah found Jason and called an ambulance. Jason's parents Eileen and Tony were told that he might not walk or talk again. Max, who had witnessed the attack on Jason, told David and Kylie what he saw after he appeared terrified when Callum came to collect him. Max gave a statement to the police. Before Callum was arrested, he spiked Sarah's drink and knocked her unconscious. He threatened Bethany that he would kill Sarah if she did not lie for him. The day after, on Lily Platt's 2nd birthday, Bethany revealed to the Platts that she made a statement against Max. The family was disgusted as they knew she was lying. Sarah informed Tony about Callum and the following day, he took matters into his own hands by beating up Callum in the ginnel, only to be stopped by Liz. Callum continued to attack the Platts because he needed money to pay off a dangerous drug dealer. Sarah lures him to the house and records what he is saying. Callum finds her 'phone and starts attacking Sarah, and Kylie comes in and beats him over the head with a wrench, killing him. They bury his body in a manhole in the garage and Sarah is traumatized.|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{where the}} mail carrier Pechkin <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door, and Galchonok answers [...] "Who's there?", {{is very similar}} to a similar episode in the American {{educational}} cartoon serial [...] "The Electric Company" [...] (1971) where <b>the</b> plumber <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door and is answered by a parrot.|$|R
60|$|Three days afterward, {{there came}} a <b>knock</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door--there had been other <b>knocks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door before this, of course; but I am dealing merely {{with the history of}} the clock. The girl said a couple of men were outside, and wanted to see me, and I went to them.|$|R

2500|$|There was {{a special}} case {{established}} under the State Management Scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in Carlisle. During the 20th century elsewhere, both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed, and there were differences between parishes; in the 1960s, at closing time in Kensington at 10:30pm, drinkers would rush over the parish boundary {{to be in good}} time for [...] "Last Orders" [...] in Knightsbridge before 11pm, a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries. Some Scottish and Welsh parishes remained officially [...] "dry" [...] on Sundays (although often this merely required <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back door of the pub). These restricted opening hours led to the tradition of lock-ins.|$|E
2500|$|Dravid {{had been}} <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> doors of Indian {{national}} cricket team {{for quite a}} while with his consistent performance in domestic cricket. So much so, that when the selectors announced the Indian team for the 1996 World Cup sans Dravid, an Indian daily newspaper carried a headline â€“ [...] "Rahul Dravid gets a raw deal". However, they could not ignore him any longer after the World Cup. Dravid made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup replacing Vinod Kambli. He wasn't particularly impressive with the bat scoring just three runs before being dismissed by Muttiah Muralitharan but took two catches in the match. He followed it up with another failure in the next game scoring just four runs before getting run out against Pakistan.|$|E

2500|$|A {{follow up}} report was {{published}} on February 18, 1890 with the title, [...] "A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station." [...] In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished {{a few days}} later with the subtitle [...] "More Tales of a Fishy Flavor." [...] In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that a Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his shoulder as he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.|$|E
2500|$|The {{residents}} of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena's room for {{shelter from the}} hurricane. They drown out {{the sound of the}} storm with prayers and hymns ("Oh, Doctor Jesus") while Sportin' Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of Judgment Day. Clara desperately sings her lullaby ("Summertime" [...] ). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death ("Oh there's somebody <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door"). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song. ("A red-headed woman"). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake's boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out to try to save him, handing her baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves [...] "Alright, Big Friend! We're on for another Bout!" [...] The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} provided embarrassing {{details of}} the crime to the jury. He described how Hitchen and Williamson moved from Royal Oak in the Strand to Rummer Tavern {{and came to the}} Talbot Inn, where the under-marshal ordered a bedroom. Along the way in each bar Hitchen offered either beer or wine and showed disgraceful manners. Williamson said he wanted to leave the marshal but was not allowed to, being forced to leave his hat with him and receiving a little money in return. According to Williamson's testimony he was persuaded to follow the marshal into the room, where he [...] "did all that a beastly appetite could prompt him to". Williamson reported going to his relative, Joseph Cockrost, who took him back to the tavern and asked to be informed as soon as the prisoner appeared, which happened the following Saturday. In his testimony Cockrost mentioned <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door after seeing [...] "filthy actions" [...] through the keyhole. When opening the door he took the marshal by the collar and threatened him, saying, [...] "I'll whip you through the Gills" [...] when he laid his hand on the sword. Testimonies were given by a servant of the tavern proving to have seen the same scene with the prosecutor, a constable, John Carter, watchmen and some character witnesses. Interestingly, the constable opposed the watchmen, who were probably trying to accuse Williamson of inventing the story. At last, the prisoner was acquitted of actual sodomy and found guilty on the second charge, assault. For [...] "sodomitical practices" [...] Hitchen was fined [...] Â£20 and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and standing in the pillory near the end of Catherine Street, in the Strand.|$|E
