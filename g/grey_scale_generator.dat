40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to develop a}} working {{methodology}} to color a <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> image. This thesis is based on approach of using a colored reference image. Coloring <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> images has no exact solution till date and all available methods are based on approximation. This technique of using a color reference image for approximating color information in <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> image is among most modern techniques. Method developed here in this paper is better than existing methods of approximation of color information addition in <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> images in brightness, sharpness, color shade gradients and distribution of colors over objects. Color and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> images are analyzed for statistical and textural features. This analysis is done only on basis of luminance value in images. These features are then segmented and segments of color and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> images are mapped on basis of distances of segments from origin. Then chromatic values are transferred between these matched segments from color image to <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> image. Technique proposed in this paper uses better mechanism of mapping clusters and mapping colors between segments, resulting in notable improvement in existing techniques in this category...|$|R
40|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> {{method is}} {{commonly}} used for investigating differences in material appearance. Specifically, for testing color difference equations, perceived color differences between sample pairs are obtained by visually comparing to differences {{in a series of}} achromatic sample pairs. Two types of <b>grey</b> <b>scales</b> are known: linear and geometric. Their instrumental color differences vary linearly or geometrically (i. e., exponentially), respectively.

An implementation of this definition leading to a decreasing family of convex hulls with increasing precision is proposed.

40|$|At {{real-time}} endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) {{with the}} convex probe, both B-mode <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> images and color Doppler {{images can be}} obtained. The <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> texture of B-mode ultrasound images refl ect the tonal and structural properties of the underlying tissue. 1 These properties are represented by the intensities and variation of the image pixels. <b>Grey</b> <b>scale</b> texture analysis, {{which is based on}} fi rst and second order statistical features, objectively quantifi es texture beyond what is visually perceived by the human eye. 2, 3 These methods are well established and were fi rst described by Haralick et al. 4 They have been applied successfully to ultrasound images of breast, 5 liver, 6 endometrial, 2 and prostate 3, 7 pathologies.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of power Doppler and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> ultrasonography, assess {{the relationship between}} severity measures and neovascularity, and describe the intra-tendon distribution of neovascularity in chronic tennis elbow. Design: Between group cross sectional study. Setting: Sports medicine clinic and radiology centre. Participants: 32 affected elbows (median and range of duration: 10; 3 – 120 months) and 18 unaffected contralateral elbows in 25 patients (mean age 50 years) with lateral elbow pain, and 38 unaffected elbows in 19 asymptomatic participants (mean age 45 years) underwent a clinical examination (reference standard test) and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> and power Doppler ultrasonographic examination. Main outcome measures: Ultrasound examination with power Doppler identified neovascularity and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> ultrasound changes (lateral epicondyle bony spurring or irregularity, maximum anterior–posterior thickness, and echo characteristics) of the common extensor tendon. Results: Power Doppler had a strong positive likelihood ratio of 45. 39, whereas a combined null finding in power Doppler and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> ultrasonography resulted in a robust negative likelihood ratio of 0. 05. <b>Grey</b> <b>scale</b> changes were generally not as diagnostically accurate. Common extensor tendon neovascularity was equally distributed between the superficial and deep part of the tendon, and clinical severity measures did not correlate with neovascularity scores. Conclusions: Neovascularity identified with power Doppler ultrasonography when compared to <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> changes (alone or in combination with Doppler) was diagnostically superior in identifying chronic tennis elbow. The lack of both neovascularity and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> changes on ultrasound examination also substantially increase {{the probability that the}} condition is not present and should prompt the clinician to consider other causes for lateral elbow pain...|$|R

The results of the analysis demonstrate that while the analog process governs the <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> character of capsule images, {{there is a significant}} contribution from the digital process.

Then we show that our algorithm solves this problem for the one-dimensional problem with O(knlogm/m) expected time, which is sub- linear, where rn and n are the sizes of pattern and text. For the two-dimensional problem, the expected time is O(kn 2 log m/m 2) where rn 2 and n 2 are the sizes of pattern and text. The results are useful for time series analysis and graphics where <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> matching is more suitable than character matching...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} and feasibility of harmonic power Doppler and digitally subtracted colour coded <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> imaging {{for the assessment}} of perfusion defect severity by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in an unselected group of patients.  DESIGN—Cohort study.  SETTING—Regional cardiothoracic unit.  PATIENTS— 49 patients (mean (SD) age 61  (11) years; 27  women, 22  men) with known or suspected coronary artery disease were studied with simultaneous myocardial contrast echo (MCE) and SPECT after standard dipyridamole stress.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Regional myocardial perfusion by SPECT, performed with 99 mTc tetrafosmin, scored qualitatively and also quantitated as per cent maximum activity.  RESULTS—Normal perfusion was identified by SPECT in 225  of 270  segments (83 %). Contrast echo images were interpretable in 92 % of patients. The proportion of normal MCE by <b>grey</b> <b>scale,</b> subtracted, and power Doppler techniques were respectively 76 %, 74 %, and 88 % (p    80 % of maximum counts, compared with 65 %, 69 %, and 61 % at <  60 % of maximum counts. For each technique, specificity was lowest in the lateral wall, although power Doppler was the least affected. <b>Grey</b> <b>scale</b> and subtraction techniques were least accurate in the septal wall, but power Doppler showed particular problems in the apex. On a per patient analysis, the sensitivity was 67 %, 75 %, and 83 % for detection of coronary artery disease using <b>grey</b> <b>scale,</b> colour coded, and power Doppler, respectively, with a significant difference between power Doppler and <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> only (p <  0. 05). Specificity was also the highest for power Doppler, at 55 %, but not significantly different from subtracted colour coded images.  CONCLUSIONS—Myocardial contrast echo using harmonic power Doppler has greater accuracy than with <b>grey</b> <b>scale</b> imaging and digital subtraction. However, power Doppler appears to be less sensitive for mild perfusion defects.    Keywords: myocardial contrast echo; SPECT; coronary artery disease; dipyridamole stres...|$|R
