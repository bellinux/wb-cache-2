40|$|Wind turbine is a {{very good}} source of green energy. But {{building}} it needed a higher cost compare to other type of green energy. Therefore, choosing the right location to build the wind turbine is very important. Many cases have shown that if the location chosen is not appropriate, it will lead to pure lost since the turbine {{may not be able to}} function well. Besides that, choosing whether to build a low speed or <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is also important. This solely depends on the location chosen to build the turbine. Therefore the process of wind mapping is very important in the initial steps of building a wind turbine. During the wind mapping process, wind speed data of the chosen location is collected for a period of time. Usually from weeks up years. Then the sets of data are analyses, calculated and stimulated in graph. Later then when all the data have been analyses, calculated and stimulated we will know whether the location of studies is suitable or building wind turbine or not, and the type of wind turbine we should build. Later the data obtain is also used to study when is exactly the right time to use the wind turbine in its optimum condition as the wind speed varies throughout the whole year. From this we can alternate the usage of wind turbine energy and domestic electric supply. Although the effect may seem small, but we are actually minimizing energy waste due to excessive usage...|$|E

In this respect contribution of the farmers of the north and the east is immense and continue to receive attention of legislators and planners. As a result the largest ever irrigation scheme Mahaweli became a reality. However even in spite of a development project of that magnitude people of the Dry Zone still continue to face hardships due to lack of adequate supply of water for cultivation during the South – West Monsoon (“Yala” Season). It is high time we focussed our attention on a viable system to supplement existing irrigation systems in the dry zone. In this backdrop a wind based Lift Irrigation system is suggested due to high wind potential in this season. It is essential to develop a system which requires low maintenance, is less labour intensive and highly productive. The study was focussed on developing a wind based electric water pumping system in order to replace the existing multi bladed wind water pump which has high failure rate. In the new system the water pump and the wind turbine are not required to be located at the same place and wind turbine can be installed in a good wind site. As a solution, <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> driven electric centrifugal pumping system was developed. This system works using Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) base optimal controller to harvest the maximum power from the available wind without using a battery backup. This system was a wind sensor less application method and wind estimator was developed to have wind estimation for the controller by using PMG output voltage (Ve) and PMG output power (Pe) at a given instance. DC motor driven centrifugal pump voltage was controlled to have maximum available power using a Buck Boost controller. PI controller was used to provide the duty ratio for PWM generator that uses for the Buck Boost controlling. Maximum power point base optimum voltage finder provides the MPPT commands to the system to drive in maximum power points relevant to each and every wind speeds. Centrifugal pump model for the variable speeds were developed in experimental base method and capacity of the pump is 1 Hp with maximum flow rate of 2. 3 l/s for the system. The NACA 4415 two bladed wind rotor was used with permanent magnet generator. It was modelled and simulated using MATLAB Simulink 7. 9 and simulated the performance of wind turbine generator and electrical centrifugal pump by optimal controlling (Maximum Power Point Tracking). Dynamic simulation was done for 1 s wind data for one hour and steady state analysis was done for analyze the maximum performance. Performance comparisons of the newly developed system as against multi bladed water pump system developed by NERD Centre, at Higurakgoda site, had been carried out and benefits were identified.

Typical off the shelf commercially available <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are optimized to produce rated output power at design <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> of 9 m/s to 15 m/s and performance significantly degrades at off- design lower <b>wind</b> <b>speeds.</b> Such <b>high</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> are not available in South East Asia in general and Pakistan in particular.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings from}} the past 3 year′s research on the effects of environmental noise on sleep and identifies key future research goals. The past 3 years have seen continued interest in both short term effects of noise on sleep (arousals, awakenings), as well as epidemiological studies focusing on long term health impacts of nocturnal noise exposure. This research corroborated findings that noise events induce arousals at relatively low exposure levels, and independent of the noise source (air, road, and rail traffic, neighbors, church bells) and the environment (home, laboratory, hospital). New epidemiological studies support already existing evidence that night-time noise is likely associated with cardiovascular disease and stroke in the elderly. These studies collectively also suggest that nocturnal noise exposure may be more relevant for the genesis of cardiovascular disease than daytime noise exposure. Relative to noise policy, new effect-oriented noise protection concepts, and rating methods based on limiting awakening reactions were introduced. The publications of WHO′s ′′Night Noise Guidelines for Europe′′ and ′′Burden of Disease from Environmental Noise′′ both stress the importance of nocturnal noise exposure for health and well-being. However, studies demonstrating a causal pathway that directly link noise (at ecological levels) and disturbed sleep with cardiovascular disease and/or other long term health outcomes are still missing. These studies, as well as the quantification of the impact of emerging noise sources (e. g., <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> rail, <b>wind</b> <b>turbines)</b> have been identified as the most relevant issues that should be addressed in the field on the effects of noise on sleep in the near future...|$|R

Offshore wind energy attracts more investments day by day with its advantages such as <b>higher</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds,</b> larger <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and lower GHG emissions. In order for developing projects that will power the grids with renewable electricity extracted from wind, governments provide extensive policy supports primarily as feed in tariffs (FiTs).

This paper investigates whether profitable utilization of Turkey‟s offshore wind power potential is possible under the current support mechanisms and, if possible, how much of it is in fact economically viable. A model is built in Excel to calculate the free cash flows and NPV for economic analysis. Results show that none of the wind classes are able to produce a positive NPV.

Currently, doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> technology with gearbox is dominating the world market share. However, {{the problems associated with}} induction generator based <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are reactive power consumption, mechanical stress and poor power quality.

Thispaper investigates possible improvements in gridtransient stability while integrating the large-scalevariable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> driven synchronousgenerator. A dynamic modeling and simulation of a gridconnected variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> (VSWT) drivensynchronous generator with controllable power inverterstrategies suitable for the study was developed, testedand verified. This dynamic model with its controlscheme can regulate real power, maintain reactivepower, generate voltage, and speed at different windspeeds. For this paper, studies were conducted on astandard IEEE 9 bus system augmented by a radiallyconnected wind power plant (WPP) which contains 28 variable <b>speed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> with controllable powerinverter strategies. Also {{it has the potential to}} controlthe rotor angle deviation and increase the criticalclearing time during grid disturbance with the help ofcontrollable power inverter strategy...|$|R
