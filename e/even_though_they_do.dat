5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not yet have}} wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating {{with a man who}} possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E
25|$|As in all animals, reptilian muscle action {{produces}} heat. In large reptiles, like leatherback turtles, the low surface-to-volume ratio allows this metabolically produced heat to {{keep the}} animals warmer than their environment <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have a warm-blooded metabolism. This form of homeothermy is called gigantothermy; {{it has been suggested}} as having been common in large dinosaurs and other extinct large-bodied reptiles.|$|E
25|$|The villagers {{hold the}} {{officials}} and the castle in the high regard, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not appear {{to know what the}} officials do. The actions of the officials are never explained. The villagers provide assumptions and justification for the officials' actions through lengthy monologues. Everyone appears to have an explanation for the officials' actions, but they often contradict themselves and there is no attempt to hide the ambiguity. Instead, villagers praise it as another action or feature of an official.|$|E

25|$|There {{may or may}} not be any marker used to {{join the}} {{relative}} and main clauses. (Note that languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in fact have a gap, since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun.) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized, as in Turkish and in English reduced relative clauses.|$|E
25|$|Another claim {{frequently}} {{made about}} John's time in Salamanca, by scholars {{trying to explain}} the origins of John's mystical thought, {{is that it was}} here he was exposed in detail to mystical thought. In the first biography of John, published in 1628, it is claimed, on the basis of information from John's fellow students, that he in 1567 made a special study of mystical writers, in particular of Pseudo-Dionysius and Saint Gregory the Great. Much weight has been put on this evidence by later writers. However, others have doubted the veracity of this anecdote, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not dispute that John may have studied mystical theology in this period.|$|E
25|$|Tinnitus is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} a symptom of adulthood, and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of tinnitus, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not express the condition or its effect on their lives. Children do not generally report tinnitus spontaneously and their complaints may not be taken seriously. Among those children who do complain of tinnitus, there is an increased likelihood of associated otological or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere’s disease or chronic suppurative otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12% to 36% in children with normal hearing thresholds and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss and approximately 310% of children have been reported to be troubled by tinnitus.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Africanized honey bee in Central America is {{threatening}} the ancient art of keeping Melipona stingless bees in log gums <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The honey production from a single hive of Africanized bees can be 100kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3–5kg of the various Melipona stingless species. Thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown, but they are well adapted {{to exist in the}} wild, {{and there are a number}} of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so their fate remains to be seen.|$|E
25|$|Crocodiles are {{the most}} social of reptiles. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not form social groups, many species congregate in certain {{sections}} of rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking. Most species are not highly territorial, {{with the exception of}} the saltwater crocodile, which is a highly territorial and aggressive species. A mature male will not tolerate any other males at any time of the year. Most other species are more flexible. There is a certain form of hierarchy in crocodiles: the largest and heaviest males are at the top, having access to the best basking site, while females are priority during a group feeding of a big kill or carcass. A good example of the hierarchy in crocodiles would be the case of the Nile crocodile. This species clearly displays all of these behaviours. Studies in this area are not thorough, however, and many species are yet to be studied in greater detail. Mugger crocodiles are also known to show toleration in group feedings and tend to congregate in certain areas. However, males of all species are aggressive towards each other during mating season, to gain access to females.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} accidentally {{introduced}} into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast water transfer in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact; the consequences are quite complex as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them while consuming other invasive species. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many important to the angling industry. The goby's robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species. Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby's ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and quagga), may result in greater bioaccumulation of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large scale spread of the zebra mussel, which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes.|$|E

Goldfrapp called their writing relationship a [...] "democracy", playing off one another while in the recording studio.

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E

500|$|Considered {{rare for}} Disney animals, Pascal and Maximus do not speak. The idea to make Pascal and Maximus mute was {{inspired}} by the performances of actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in Silent films. Identifying themselves as [...] "huge fans" [...] of Chaplin, Greno and Howard suggested {{that it would be a}} good idea to have a character like the actor featured in the film. Additionally, the directors explained in an interview with Orange that Pascal and Maximus' silence was also inspired by the roles of Princess Aurora's animal friends in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959), following the film's rules and guidelines that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not talk, they remain [...] "very expressive" [...] nonetheless and [...] "act and understand without words." [...] Maximus particularly [...] "belongs to the grand tradition of Disney creatures that are full of personality even though they don't talk." [...] One film critic observed that Pascal and Maximus [...] "have personalities all their own, making use of techniques harkening back to the silent era". Howard explained that [...] "Pantomime acting is a great challenge for our animators" [...] because, according to animator Jin Kim, Pascal and Maximus both [...] "had to be funny without speech", forcing the animators to exaggerate their emotions and facial expressions. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that [...] "Pascal ... doesn't speak, but manages to convey himself with eye rolls and changes of color."

2500|$|Excepting the {{shoreline}} of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt, designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny {{in the west}} to Prestongrange in the east. With an average width of [...] the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone. Similarly, suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.|$|E
