5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1958, {{outer space}} {{has been the}} subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community.

5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they accept {{a wide range of}} organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with lettuce and aphids.|$|E
5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> used {{to reduce}} the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. The beetles make the dung {{unavailable}} to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|The Morgan breed {{is known}} for its versatility, and is used for a number of English and Western events. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> shown in many disciplines, {{including}} dressage, show jumping, Western pleasure, cutting and endurance riding. They are also used as stock horses and for pleasure riding and driving. They are frequently seen in driving competitions, including combined driving and carriage driving. Morgans were the first American breed to compete in the World Pairs Driving competition, representing the US. They can be seen as mounts for 4-H and Pony Club participants and therapeutic riding programs, due to their gentle disposition and steady movement.|$|E

Since 1995, there have been over fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe, of which only nine <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> cured. Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity, though a small number of older wild-born adults held in zoos have died, and a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in Asian elephant populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook nests in {{holes in}} trees {{between one and}} twenty metres (3-70 ft) above the ground. The holes are generally vertical, and mostly in eucalypts, though other trees such as coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia) have been recorded. Some sites are reused for up to 20 years, especially if broods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> raised in them before. Boobooks may also evict other birds such as galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) to use their hollows, and have used sites abandoned by babblers, crows and ravens.

5|$|Later queens {{also left}} their {{mark on the}} Rova through major {{construction}} projects. Queen Rasoherina had Marivolanitra relocated to Mahazoarivo {{to make room for}} Manampisoa ("Adding What is Pleasant"), built from 1865 to 1867 for use as her personal residence. A Protestant chapel (Fiangonana) was erected during the reign of RanavalonaII, who also ordered the exterior of the wooden Manjakamiadana to be encased in stone. Plans to build a private residence for RanavalonaIII were abandoned in 1896 at the time of French colonisation of the island. According to one source, partial electrification of the Rova may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> tested on Christmas Day 1892. Following this experiment, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and Queen RanavalonaIII began working with a contractor to purchase and install the necessary equipment to expand electrification throughout the Rova, but this initiative was also interrupted by the advent of French colonisation.|$|E
5|$|Nhu {{then decided}} that his men {{would go to}} Lâm Thao to {{reinforce}} their colleagues. On the way, they stopped at {{the nearby town of}} Kinh Khe, where the instructor, Nguyen Quang Kinh, and one of his two wives were slain by VNQDĐ members in an apparent revenge killing. Kinh had previously been affiliated with the VNQDĐ, whose members took him away. His wife had tried to follow him, so the VNQDĐ captured her as well. French intelligence reports speculated that Kinh had been killed because he would not join his former colleagues. Nhu then led his men through Lâm Thao. The plan was that they would help to consolidate the other unit's control on the town until the afternoon. They were hopeful that the attack in Yên Bái would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> completed by then, and that the mutineers and people of Yên Bái would come to Lâm Thao and stage their forces before attacking the barracks at Phu Tho. However, they were not fast enough.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> bred in captivity, {{both for}} {{falconry}} and for release {{back into the}} wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.|$|E

5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, dry grass, hair, sheep’s wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
