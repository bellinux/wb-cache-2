The friendship grew from Voss flying as Richthofen's wingman in combat, and disregarded the disparity <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|Criss Angel {{was born}} on December 19, 1967, at Hempstead General Hospital in Hempstead, on Long Island, New York. He is of Greek descent. Angel was raised in Elmont until fourth grade, when {{his family moved to}} East Meadow, New York. His father, John Sarantakos, owned a {{restaurant}} and doughnut shop. He developed an interest in magic at age seven and performed his first show at the age of twelve, for which he was paid $10. His main early influence was Harry Houdini. By fourteen, Angel was performing throughout high school at restaurants in East Meadow, including the Wine Gallery. Angel's first major illusion was making his mother float <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> den. Early in his career he was helped by animal breeder and reality-television host Marc Morrone, who helped Angel find and train a set of doves for his act.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 2017 footage emerged of Daniel Alvarado (Brazo de Platino) {{and other}} members of the Alvarado family, notably his nephews José (Máximo Sexy), Felipe Alvarado (La Máscara), Psycho Clown and Robin, {{destroying}} an expensive car belonging to Gutiérrez. The vandalism was reportedly motivated by the fact that Gutiérrez had spoken out against Felipe Alvarado as a possible the head of the wrestlers' union after the death of Alvarado's father. The head of the CMLL wrestlers' union had been in the Avarado family for over a decade and the Alvarado family believed it should go to someone <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> The following day CMLL reportedly fired both Felipe and José Alvarado.|$|E

5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E

40|$|A discovery-oriented {{process study}} was {{conducted}} to explore the effectiveness of family therapists' interventions at increasing fathers' involvement in therapy sessions and <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> at home. A team of seven undergraduate raters were trained to rate the degree of fathers' participation <b>in</b> sessions and <b>their</b> predicted involvement <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> at home. Three clinical judges recorded the type and frequency of therapist interventions used in each session to increase fathers' involvement. Nineteen videotaped family therapy sessions were used to analyze the interaction between therapists' interventions and fathers' involvement. Findings suggested that interventions addressing fathers' involvement, especially those addressing fathers' involvement with their children, promoted greater change in fathers' involvement <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Results also suggested that interventions addressing fathers' complaints, mothers' interference with fathers' parenting, couples' closeness, and cooperation in parenting predicted greater change in fathers' family involvement. The study presented a beginning step towards developing a guide for the clinical implementation of interventions aimed at increasing fathers' involvement...|$|R
