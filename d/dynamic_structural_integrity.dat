40|$|The well {{documented}} {{increase in the}} use of high performance composites as structural materials in aerospace components is continuously raising the demands in terms of <b>dynamic</b> performance, <b>structural</b> <b>integrity,</b> reliable life monitoring systems and adaptive actuating abilities. Current technologies address the above issues separately; material property tailoring and custom design practices aim to the enhancement of dynamic and damage tolerance characteristics, whereas life monitoring and actuation is performed with embedded sensors that may be detrimental to the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> of the component. This publication explores the unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT) as an additive in the matrix of Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP), for producing structural composites with improved mechanical performance as well as sensing/actuating capabilities. The successful combination of the CNT properties and existing sensing actuating technologies leads to the realization of a multifunctional FRP structure. The current volume presents {{the state of the art}} research in this field. The contributions cover all the aspects of the novel composite systems, i. e. modeling from nano to macro scale, enhancement of structural efficiency, dispersion and manufacturing, integral health monitoring abilities, Raman monitoring, as well as the capabilities that ordered carbon nanotube arrays offer in terms of sensing and/or actuating in aerospace composites...|$|R

40|$|Modular {{construction}} {{is a relatively}} {{a new form of}} high-rise construction, which involves the assembly of prefabricated structural modules. In contrast to traditional on-site construction methods, it allows for parallel processes to occur where the modules can be manufactured offsite, before or during preliminary on-site works, and then be transported to the site and assembled progressively. However, modular construction raises some concerns, such as load bearing capacity and <b>structural</b> <b>integrity,</b> in comparison to traditional in-situ construction. Hybrid construction processes may also be required in order to satisfy load capacity requirements, particularly for high-rise buildings. <b>Structural</b> <b>integrity</b> must be fully engineered into the modules during the early design processes and include consideration of manufacturing, handling, transportation and lifting issues as well as their long-term post-assembly <b>integrity.</b> <b>Structural</b> <b>integrity</b> may also need to encompass the capacity to resist seismic forces for buildings constructed in earthquake-prone areas. The purpose of the paper is to specifically examine how the overall <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> is maintained through the use of modular construction. Moreover, the main aim of this paper is also to investigate the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> of modular construction specifically for high-rise buildings.

40|$|In the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> {{assessment}} of a pressurized water reactor pressure vessel (RPV) during pressurized thermal shock (PTS) events, the thermal history of the coolant water and the heat transfer coefficient between the coolant water and RPV are dominant factors. These values can be determined {{on the basis of}} thermal-hydraulics (TH) analysis simulating PTS events and Jackson-Fewster correlation. Subsequently, using these values, <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> assessments of RPV are performed by structural analysis; e. g., loading that affects crack propagation is evaluated. Three-dimensional TH and structural analyses are recommended for precise assessments of the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> of RPV. In this study, we performed TH and structural analyses simulating typical PTS events using three-dimensional models of cold-leg, downcomer and RPV to more accurately assess the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> of RPV. From these analyses, we obtained loading histories from the reactor core region of RPV in which a crack is postulated in the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> assessment. We discuss the conservativeness of current analysis methods on the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> {{assessment of}} RPV through the comparison of loading conditions due to PTS events.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> of a {{jet pump}} {{assembly}} of a {{boiling water reactor}} (BWR) under hydrodynamic loading was evaluated. This arrangement, which has a riser joined {{with a couple of}} jet pumps by the transition piece, is part of the reactor recirculation system. It is submerged in water under pressure. The main function is to induce forced flow through the core of the reactor. A <b>dynamic</b> <b>structural</b> analysis was carried out with the finite element method. The first ten modes of vibration and their natural frequencies were calculated. The first five natural frequencies are in the range between 25 Hz and 40 Hz. In this analysis, it was considered that the jet pump assembly is supported at the riser brace. The restrainer bracket keeps together the riser with the two jet pumps and there is free movement at the slip joints...|$|R

40|$|Buildings, {{structures}} and systems of large scale and high value (e. g. conventional {{and nuclear power}} plants, etc.) are designed for a certain, limited service lifetime. If the standards and guidelines of the time {{are taken into account}} during the design process, the resulting structures will operate safely in most cases. However, in the course of technical history there were examples of unusual, catastrophic failures of structures, even resulting in human casualties. Although the concept of <b>Structural</b> <b>Integrity</b> first appeared in industrial applications only two-three decades ago, its pertinence has been growing higher ever since. Four nuclear power generation units have been constructed in Hungary, more than 30 years ago. In every unit, VVER- 440 V 213 type light-water cooled, light-water moderated, pressurized water reactors are in operation. Since the mid- 1980 s, Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) analyses of Reactor Pressure Vessels (RPV) have been conducted in Hungary, where the concept of <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> was the basis of research and development. In {{the first part of the}} paper, a short historic overview is given, where the origins of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Integrity</b> concept are presented, and the beginnings of <b>Structural</b> <b>Integrity</b> in Hungary are summarized. In the second part, a new conceptual model of <b>Structural</b> <b>Integrity</b> is introduced.
