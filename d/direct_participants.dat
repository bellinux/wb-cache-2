5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed. Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not <b>direct</b> <b>participants</b> in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E

Still, though British organisers {{wanted it to be}} otherwise, no officials from any Commonwealth realm other than the UK participated in the event itself; the governments of those countries considered the ceremony to be a religious rite unique to Britain: as Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent said at the time: [...] "in my view the Coronation is the official enthronement of the Sovereign as Sovereign of the U.K...

2500|$|However, the {{simplicity}} of this analysis tends to disappear with recent studies. In 1987, historian Claudia Koonz, in [...] "Mothers in Fatherland, Women, the Family and Nazi Politics" [...] questioned this statement and acknowledged some guilt. She states as follows: [...] "Far from being impressionable or innocent, women made possible State murder {{in the name of}} interests that they defined as maternal." [...] For her, the containing of housewives just allowed them to assert themselves and grasp an identity, especially through women's associations led by Nazi Gertrud Scholtz-Klink. They therefore helped to stabilize the system. The women took pleasure in politics and eugenics of the state, which promised financial assistance if the birth rate was high, so they would help to stabilize the system [...] "by preserving the illusion of love in an environment of hate." [...] In addition, if Gisela Bock denounced the work of her colleague as [...] "anti-feminist", others as [...] refuse to stop at a strict choice between complicity and oppression and are more interested in how Nazism included women in their project for Germany. Recent work from historian Wendy Lower (consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum), demonstrates that a substantial number of women were accomplices to Nazi atrocities, and sometimes <b>direct</b> <b>participants.</b> Such realities make it abundantly clear that by the time the war ended, German women had traversed the full-circle of being once sheltered incubators for the Aryan future to effectual contributors in the Nazi concentration camp system.|$|E

40|$|If a ligand binds with unequal {{affinity}} to {{two distinct}} states of a protein, then the equilibrium {{between the two}} states becomes {{a function of the}} concentration of the ligand.

These conclusions are independent {{of whether or not the}} ligand is a <b>direct</b> <b>participant</b> in the reaction.

Absorption was experimentally manipulated using 2 different sets of test session instructions. The first, participant-oriented, instruction set <b>directed</b> <b>participants</b> to absorb themselves in the erotic film presentation, imagining that they were active participants in the sexual activities depicted. The second, spectator-oriented, instruction set <b>directed</b> <b>participants</b> to observe and assess the erotic film excerpt as impartial spectators. The participant-oriented instruction set was found to elicit greater subjective absorption in women than the spectator-oriented instruction set, and women reported greater subjective sexual arousal in the former set compared with the latter. Thus, {{it appears that the}} degree to which a woman becomes absorbed in an erotic stimulus may affect her subsequent subjective sexual arousal. Also, women reported greater degrees of positive affect when they took a participant-oriented perspective than when they viewed the erotic materials as impartial spectators. Thus, participants who were highly absorbed in the erotic film excerpt were more likely to view the stimulus favorably. By contrast, the degree to which women became absorbed in the stimulus had no effect on their reported negative affect. Future directions for examining female response patterns are suggested. <br /...|$|R
