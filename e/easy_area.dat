40|$|The {{assessment}} of alleged inflicted injury in children {{is never a}} particularly <b>easy</b> <b>area.</b> This is exemplified by sit-uations where injuries are subtle and/or hidden. In 1977, Meadow [1] introduced the term ‘‘Munchausen syndrome by proxy’ ’ to describe certain clinical scenarios where child carers, most often mothers, had allegedly either induced or fabricated disease in a child, resulting in considerable medical attention and treatment. The term derived from Munchausen syndrome, a psychological condition that forms part of the deception syndromes where an affected individual wanders from doctor to doctor, pathologically lying and simulating illness {{in order to gain}} treatment and/ or hospital admission [2, 3]. In Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP), the psychological benefits are thought to derive from using a substitute or proxy...|$|E

Multiple explanations have been invoked for this rise and include increased mammographic screening, an aging population, and changes in the prevalence of accepted risk fac-tors associated with prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen (e. g., delayed childbearing and earlier menarche). However, no explanation is more contentious than the putative role of weakly estrogenic environmental contaminants such as the pesticide DDT and the industrial products polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Although widespread use of both types of compounds effectively ceased in the United States during the 1970 s, their ability to accumulate and to persist in adipose tissues has raised fears about their contribution to breast cancer development in recent years.

Methods and Results: <b>Easy</b> Leaf <b>Area</b> uses the color ratios of each pixel to distinguish leaves and calibration areas from their background and compares leaf pixel counts to a red calibration area to {{eliminate the need for}} camera distance calculations or manual ruler scale measurement that other software methods typically require. Leaf areas estimated by this software from images taken with a camera phone were more accurate than ImageJ estimates from flatbed scanner images. Conclusions: <b>Easy</b> Leaf <b>Area</b> provides an easy-to-use method for rapid measurement of leaf area and nondestructive estimation of canopy area from digital images...|$|R

Aiming at letting the traffic policemen arrive at the congested intersections quickly, the model of arranging the traffic police is established. This model is a complex optimization problem so it is solved by an intelligent optimization algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm. A little change {{is given to the}} algorithm so that it is more suitable for the model. Also the process of solving the model with improved Particle Swarm Optimization is given. This model can work out the optimal positions of the traffic police kiosks and the number of policemen in each police kiosk, so the best plan of arranging the police in the <b>easy</b> congested <b>area</b> is acquired. It proves that using this method to arrange the traffic police in the <b>easy</b> congested <b>area</b> can ensure the policemen arriving at the congested intersections in minimum time, preventing the congestion or the spreading of the congestion as soon as possible...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to find out}} if there are any {{differences}} between what teacher trainees expect and what teachers claim {{in a number of areas}} in English teaching at upper secondary schools. More specifically, are there any differences in expectations and claims between the two groups when it comes to the use of course books, the national tests, setting grades, grammar teaching and the use of movies in course A English. The involved trainees were on their last year of teacher training and the involved teachers had worked for a maximum of two years. In order to carry out the research, both quantitative- and qualitative interviews with teacher trainees and teachers were done. In the quantitative interviews, trainees and teachers answered questions about the mentioned topics and were also asked to write what they expect or claim to be the most difficult and <b>easy</b> <b>area</b> in the English teaching classroom. In addition, the qualitative interviews with six trainees and teachers gave voices to what the two groups declared. According to my findings, there are differences in all but one topic. The conclusion also suggests what can be made in teacher training education in order to declare the gap between trainees and teachers become smaller...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{experiences}} and perceptions of general practitioners and community nurses in discussing preferences for place of death with terminally ill patients. Design Qualitative study using semistructured interviews and thematic analysis. Participants 17 general practitioners and 19 nurses (16 district nurses, three clinical nurse specialists). Setting 15 general practices participating in the Gold Standards Framework for palliative care from three areas in central England with differing socio-geography. Practices were {{selected on the basis}} of size and level of adoption of the standards framework. Results All interviewees bar one had experience of discussing preferred place of death with terminally ill patients. They reported that preferences for place of death frequently changed over time and were often ill defined or poorly formed in patients’ minds. Preferences were often described as being co-created in discussion with the patient or, conversely, inferred by the health professional without direct questioning or receiving a definitive answer from the patient. This inherent uncertainty challenged the practicability, usefulness, and value of recording a definitive preference. The extent to which the assessment of enabling such preferences can be used as a proxy for the effectiveness of palliative care delivery is also limited by this uncertainty. Generally, interviewees did not find discussing preferred place of death an <b>easy</b> <b>area</b> of practice, unless the patient broached the subject or led the discussions. Conclusions Further research is needed to enable development of appropriate training and support for primary care professionals. Better understanding of the importance of place of death to patients and their carers is also needed...|$|E

It {{still remains}} {{the case that}} there has been very little {{attention}} given to African Traditional Religion in Southern Africa by both Western and African authors. It is not an <b>easy</b> <b>area</b> to research for it no longer exists in its undisturbed coherent form, but only as preserved in fragmented bits of culture. This thesis attempts some reconstruction of Basotho religion just prior to their settlement in Lesotho and the arrival of the Christian traditions. It makes use of whatever sources are available both written and oral including interviews in the field. It also employs Cumpsty's theory of religion to raise some questions about what might be expected given what is known of the pre-history of the people. Through a critical analysis of various Basotho cultural elements, oral prayers, sayings, beliefs, songs, rites of passage and other customs, a picture of early Basotho religion begins to emerge focused around the Supreme Being, Water Snake, and his different manifestations. It seems that we are looking at a group who had never been settled until they came to Lesotho, although they may have remained in particular places for considerable periods of time. On the other hand they were probable not, as some other groups were, consciously migrating, looking for a place of their own. It may well be this situation which is reflected in the constant prioritizing of the high god (Water Snake) in their dealings with the ancestors, and even their direct dealings with Water Snake, {{while at the same time}} other aspects of transcendence do not become emphasized...|$|E
