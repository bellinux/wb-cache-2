40|$|Volume {{management}} {{is critical for}} assessment of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This multicenter prospective cohort study compared the impact of surgical clipping versus endovascular coiling on postoperative hemodynamics and pulmonary edema in patients with SAH. Hemodynamic parameters were measured for 14 days using a transpulmonary thermodilution system. The study included 202 patients, including 160 who underwent clipping and 42 who underwent coiling. There were no differences in global ejection fraction (GEF), cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, or global end-diastolic volume index between the clipping and coiling groups in the early period. However, extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) were significantly higher in the clipping group in the vasospasm period. Postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) level was higher in the clipping group and was significantly correlated with postoperative brain natriuretic peptide level. Multivariate analysis found that PVPI and GEF were independently associated with high EVLWI in the early period, suggesting cardiogenic edema, and that CRP and PVPI, but not GEF, were independently associated with high EVLWI in the vasospasm period, suggesting noncardiogenic edema. In conclusion, clipping affects postoperative CRP level and may thereby increase noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in the vasospasm period.

Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of the patients who underwent curative surgery with lymphadenectomy for EGJ cancer. Tumor specimens were categorized by histology and location into four types—centered in the esophagus[*] Results A total of 92 EGJ cancer patients were studied. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 35. 5 months. Tumors were categorized as 12 type E (SQ), 6 type E (AD), 27 type Ge and 47 type G; of these 7 (58. 3 %), 3 (50 %), 19 (70. 4 %) and 14 (29. 8 %) and 23 patients, respectively, had lymph node metastases. No patients with type E (AD) and Ge tumors had cervical lymph node metastasis; those with type G tumors had no nodal metastasis at cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes. Multivariate analysis showed that type E (AD) tumor was an independent prognostic factor. Conclusions We should distinguish type Ge tumor from type E (AD) tumor because of the clinicopathological and prognostic differentiation. Extended gastrectomy with or without lower esophagectomy according to tumor location and lower mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy are recommended for EGJ cancer.

With the approval of newly developed chemotherapeutic agent of miriplatin, we have firstly conducted the phase I study of CDDP powder (DDP-H) and miriplatin combination therapy and reported its safety and efficacy for treating unresectable HCC in such cases. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for the combination of transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE) and transarterial chemotherapy (TAC) using miriplatin and DDP-H for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Transarterial chemotherapy using DDP-H was performed through the proper hepatic artery targeting the HCC nodules by increasing the dose of DDP-H (35 – 65 [*]mg/m 2) followed by targeting the HCC nodules by transarterial oily chemoembolization with miriplatin. Results A total of nine patients were enrolled {{in this study and}} no DLT was observed with any dose of DDP-H in all cases in whom 80 [*]mg (median, 18 – 120) miriplatin was administered. An anti-tumour efficacy rating for partial response was obtained in one patient, while a total of four patients (among eight evaluated) showed stable disease response, leading to 62. 5 % of disease control rate. The pharmacokinetic results showed no further increase in plasma platinum concentration following miriplatin administration.

40|$|Background. The {{effect of}} dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors on the {{regression}} of carotid IMT remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to clarify whether sitagliptin, DPP- 4 inhibitor, could regress carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in insulin-treated patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM). Methods. This is an exploratory analysis of a randomized trial in which we investigated the effect of sitagliptin on the progression of carotid IMT in insulin-treated patients with T 2 DM. Here, we compared the efficacy of sitagliptin treatment {{on the number of}} patients who showed regression of carotid IMT of ≥ 0. 10 [*]mm in a post hoc analysis. Results. The percentages of the number of the patients who showed regression of mean-IMT-CCA (28. 9 % in the sitagliptin group versus 16. 4 % in the conventional group, P[*]=[*] 0. 022) and left max-IMT-CCA (43. 0 % in the sitagliptin group versus 26. 2 % in the conventional group, P[*]=[*] 0. 007), but not right max-IMT-CCA, were higher in the sitagliptin treatment group compared with those in the non-DPP- 4 inhibitor treatment group. In multiple logistic regression analysis, sitagliptin treatment significantly achieved higher target attainment of mean-IMT-CCA ≥ 0. 10 [*]mm and right and left max-IMT-CCA ≥ 0. 10 [*]mm compared to conventional treatment.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is proposed as a potential approach to resolving their dysbiosis; however, its safety and efficacy have not been confirmed. This single-arm, open-label, non-randomized study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FMT for Japanese patients with UC as the first registered clinical trial in Japan. Methods: We enrolled 10 patients with active UC despite medical therapy. The donors were the patients' relatives and were carefully screened for infectious diseases. Fecal material was administered via colonoscopy, and the primary endpoint was {{the presence or absence}} of serious adverse events related to FMT. The secondary endpoint was a change in partial Mayo score at 12 weeks post-FMT. Scores ≤ 2 were considered a clinical response.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 10 daily rTMS in NP patients. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study at 7 centers. Seventy NP patients {{were randomly assigned to}} 2 groups. A series of 10 daily 5 -Hz rTMS (500 pulses/session) of primary motor cortex (M 1) or sham stimulation was applied to each patient with a follow-up of 17 days. The primary outcome was short-term pain relief assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes were short-term change in the short form of the McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ), cumulative changes in the following scores (VAS, SF-MPQ, the Patient Global Impression of Change scale [PGIC], and the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), and the incidence of adverse events.

Lacrimal gland function {{has been shown}} to decrease with aging, a known potent risk factor for dry eye. We have previously found that orally administrated royal jelly (RJ) restored tear secretion in a rat model of dry eye. We examined the effects of RJ oral administration on dry eye in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Forty-three Japanese patients aged 20 - 60 years with subjective dry eye symptoms were randomized to an RJ group (1200 mg/tablet, six tablets daily) or a placebo group for 8 weeks. Keratoconjunctival epithelial damage, tear film break-up time, tear secretion volume, meibum grade, biochemical data, and subjective dry eye symptoms based on a questionnaire were investigated at baseline, and at 4 and 8 weeks after intervention. Adverse events were reported via medical interviews. In the RJ group, tear volume significantly increased after intervention (p = 0. 0009). In particular, patients with a baseline Schirmer value of ≤ 10 mm showed a significant increase compared with baseline volume (p = 0. 0005) and volume in the placebo group (p = 0. 0051). No adverse events were reported. We also investigated the effect of RJ (300 mg/kg per day) administration using a mouse model of dry eye.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Narcolepsy is a sleep {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and {{rapid eye movement}} (REM) sleep abnormalities. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a novel narcolepsy-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is located adjacent to the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 B (CPT 1 B) gene encoding an enzyme involved in β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. The mRNA expression levels of CPT 1 B were associated with this SNP. In addition, we recently reported that acylcarnitine levels were abnormally low in narcolepsy patients. To assess the efficacy of oral L-carnitine {{for the treatment of}} narcolepsy, we performed a clinical trial administering L-carnitine (510 mg/day) to patients with the disease. The study design was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over and placebo-controlled trial. Thirty narcolepsy patients were enrolled in our study. Two patients were withdrawn and 28 patients were included in the statistical analysis (15 males and 13 females, all with HLA-DQB 1 * 06 : 02). L-carnitine treatment significantly improved the total time for dozing off during the daytime, calculated from the sleep logs, compared with that of placebo-treated periods. L-carnitine efficiently increased serum acylcarnitine levels, and reduced serum triglycerides concentration. Differences in the Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36) vitality and mental health subscales did not reach statistical significance between L-carnitine and placebo. This study suggests that oral L-carnitine can be effective in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy patients.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood {{is a useful}} approach to estimate prognosis, monitor disease progression, and measure treatment effects in various malignancies. However, clinical relevance of CTCs is controversial. We attempted to detect viable CTCs in the peripheral blood of gastric cancer patients using a telomerase-specific viral agent. Methods We took a 7. 5 -ml blood sample from 65 treatment-negative gastric cancer patients before surgery and 10 healthy volunteers. We detected viable CTCs in the blood samples after incubating them with a telomerase-specific, replication-selective, oncolytic adenoviral agent carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (OBP- 401). GFP-positive CTCs were defined as having a diameter of at least 7. 735 [*]μm; this threshold was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. GFP-positive cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope. Results There {{was a significant difference}} in overall survival among the patients with 0 – 4 and those with ≥ 5 GFP-positive CTCs in the stage I–IV disease group and stage II–IV advanced disease group. The number of GFP-positive CTCs was not related to cancer stage. Among the pathological findings, the number of GFP-positive CTCs was only significantly related to venous invasion, although there were trends towards more GFP-positive CTCs with disease progression (tumour depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, lymphatic invasion, and histological type). Conclusions There was a significant relationship between the number of GFP-positive CTCs and overall survival in the patients with gastric cancer. The detection of CTCs using OBP- 401 may be useful for prognostic evaluation.

40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) -approved vasodilators improve right ventricular (RV) function {{in patients with}} PAH. However, whether PAH-approved drugs ameliorate RV morphology and function in lung disease-associated pulmonary hypertension (lung-PH) remains unclear. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the changes in RV volume and ejection fraction (RVEF) in 14 consecutive severe lung-PH patients treated with PAH-approved vasodilators. Severe lung-PH {{was defined as a}} mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) of ≥ 35 mmHg or an MPAP of ≥ 25 mmHg with a cardiac index (L/min/m 2) of < 2. Right heart catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were performed at baseline and at 3 months after starting sildenafil with or without other PAH-approved drugs. Follow-up was conducted at 3 months in 11 participants; compared with baseline values, MPAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) decreased by 18 % and 37 %, respectively. Baseline CMR imaging revealed an elevated RV end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI; mL/m 2) of 117. 5 ± 35. 9 and a below-average RVEF of 25. 2 % ± 7. 2 %; after 3 months, RVEDVI decreased by 23. 7 % (P = 0. 0061) and RVEF increased by 32. 9 % (P = 0. 0165). Among the 11 patients, 3 were thought to be a stable and homogenous subset in terms of background lung disease and medical management administered. These 3 patients exhibited similar ameliorations in PVR and RVEF, compared with the other 8 patients. PAH-approved drug treatment may improve RV dilatation and systolic function among patients with severe lung-PH.

40|$|Background: Macrolides have {{antibiotic}} and immunomodulatory activities, {{which may}} have a favorable effect on the clinical outcome of patients with infections, including influenza. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of combination therapy with an anti-influenza agent, oseltamivir, and a single-dose formulation of azithromycin (AZM), which {{has been used for}} influenza-related secondary pneumonia, on influenza patients. The primary endpoint was a change in the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines. Secondary endpoints were the time required for resolution of influenza-related symptoms, incidence of complications, and adverse reactions. Methods: Patients with seasonal influenza were enrolled in this multicenter, open-label, randomized study. Patients were stratified according to the presence of a high risk factor and were randomized to receive combination therapy with oseltamivir plus an extended-release formulation of AZM (combo-group) or oseltamivir monotherapy (mono-group). Results: We enrolled 107 patients and randomized them into the mono-group (56 patients) or the combo-group (51 patients). All patients were diagnosed with influenza A infection, and none of the patients had comorbid pneumonia. Statistically significant differences were not observed in the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines between the 2 groups. The maximum temperature in the combo-group was lower than that in the mono-group on day 3 through day 5 (p = 0. 048), particularly on day 4 (p = 0. 037). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, randomized, clinical trial of oseltamivir and AZM combination therapy for influenza. Although the difference in inflammatory cytokine expression level was not statistically significant, combination therapy showed an early resolution of some symptoms.
