40|$|Moisture has a {{considerable}} {{influence on the}} structural performance of unbound granular (UBG) pavements. Multioffset ground-penetrating radar {{has the potential to}} quantify moisture within these materials by measuring the permittivity of pavement layers. To enable moisture estimates from these field measurements, relationships between permittivity and volumetric moisture are required. This paper describes the use of a modified free-space (MFS) laboratory approach to measure the permittivity of compacted UBG material samples and to develop these relationships. Material samples were compacted within <b>form</b> <b>ply</b> boxes; various density and moisture conditions were targeted. A vector network analyzer was used to measure the phase shift between a fixed pair of ground-coupled dipole antennas as a result of sample insertion and an initial ply sheet reference measurement. Frequency-dependent permittivity values for the samples were then determined over the range of 1. 0 to 2. 0 GHz {{on the basis of these}} measurements. Mean values over this range were then related to the volumetric moisture content of the samples. An indicative moisture–permittivity relationship was proposed on the basis of MFS measurements of samples from several quarries. Overall, the permittivity results from the MFS approach showed reasonably good agreement for samples at higher moisture contents compared with relationships in the literature that are based on time domain reflectometry. However, for drier samples, the MFS permittivity values were higher than the literature predictions. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed, and an overview of the advantages and limitations of using the technique for characterizing UBG materials is given...|$|E

40|$|Large fibre {{reinforced}} {{composite structures}} can give much lower strengths than small test specimens, so {{a proper understanding}} of scaling is vital for their safe and efficient use. Small size (scale) specimens are commonly tested to justify allowable stresses, but could be dangerous if results are extrapolated without accounting for scaling effects. On the other hand large factors are sometimes applied to compensate for uncertainties, resulting in overweight designs. The most important variables of scaling effects {{on the strength of}} composites with open holes have been identified from experimental tests as notch size, ply and laminate thickness. In this study, these have been scaled both independently and simultaneously over a large range of combinations. The specimens are fabricated from commercially available (Hexcel Composites Ltd.) carbon/epoxy pre-impregnated tapes 0. 125 mm thick (IM 7 / 8552). The material is laid up by hand in unidirectional [04]ns with n = 2, 3, 4, and 8 (i. e., 2, 3, 4 and 8 mm thick) and multidirectional laminates; two generic quasi-isotropic lay-ups, one fabricated with blocked plies [45 n/ 90 n/− 45 n/ 0 n]s and the other with distributed layers [45 / 90 /− 45 / 0]ns with n = 2, 4 and 8 are examined. It is shown that the critical failure mechanism in these laminates {{is in the form of}} fibre microbuckling or kinking. The unnotched compressive strength in unidirectional specimens thicker than 2 mm is found to be limited by the stress concentration developed at the end tabs and manufacturing induced defects in the <b>form</b> of <b>ply</b> waviness, fibre misalignment and voids rather than specimen size (scaling). In the open hole specimens, for both lay-ups, the strength reduction observed is due to hole size effect rather than specimen thickness or volume increase.

40|$|The {{ability to}} breathe air {{represents}} a fundamental step in vertebrate evolution that {{was accompanied by}} several anatomical and physiological adaptations. The morphology of the air-blood barrier is highly conserved within air-breathing vertebrates. It is formed by three different plies, which are represented by the alveolar epithelium, the basal lamina and the endothelial layer. Besides these conserved morphological elements, another common feature of vertebrate lungs is that they contain {{a certain amount of}} fluid that covers the alveolar epithelium. The volume and composition of the alveolar fluid is regulated by transepithelial ion transport mechanisms expressed in alveolar epithelial cells. These transport mechanisms have been reviewed extensively. Therefore, the present review focuses on the properties and functional significance of the alveolar fluid. How does the fluid enter the alveoli? What is the fate of the fluid in the alveoli? What is the function of the alveolar fluid in the lungs? The review highlights the importance of the alveolar fluid, its volume and its composition. Maintenance of the fluid volume and composition within certain limits is critical to facilitate gas exchange. We propose that the alveolar fluid is an essential element of the air-blood barrier.

40|$|Balanced and {{symmetric}} laminates are {{pervasive in}} design {{practice for the}} simple reason that thermal warping distortions are associated with non-symmetric laminate designs. Design practice, particularly in the Aerospace sector, has become entrenched and risk averse, hence the reluctance to move away from this simple design rule. However to unlock the full potential of composite laminates, the coupling interactions between in-plane and out-of-plane, must now be considered. Thermally stable laminates can now be achieved through sophisticated tailoring design strategies, leading to mechanically coupled materials properties with immunity to thermal warping distortion. This unique quality is known as the hygro-thermally curvature-stable (HTCS). The Extension-Twisting (and Shearing-Bending) coupled laminate is one particular class of coupled laminate with HTCS properties, which is an enabling technology for tilt-rotor aircraft. This class of laminate may be derived using standard ply angle orientations i. e.  45,  45, 0 and 90 °, which in comparison to free <b>form</b> angle <b>ply</b> orientations, developed through an optimisation technique, will facilitate the requirement for ply terminations, whilst preserving the Extension-Twisting coupling behaviour within the entire laminate tapered design. Free form angle laminates make thickness tapering virtually impossible, particularly if maintaining consistent coupling behaviour within the entire laminate is a design constraint. Extension-Twisting coupled laminates derived from standard angle orientations with HTCS properties are shown to exist only for 8 -, 12 -, 16 - and 20 -ply number groupings, and an assessment of the configurations for each twist magnitude and buckling load strength is presented for each case. The limited number of groupings these coupled laminate solutions is shown to be the result of employing unidirectional material. The above restrictions for UD material may be relaxed for laminates with balanced Plain weave material, which are shown to be inherently thermally curvature stable. Balanced Plain weave material results in a broader design space for mechanically coupled laminates; irrespective of the ply angle orientations and ply number grouping. This benefit provides more flexibility for laminate tailoring and thickness tapering; where the mechanical coupling behaviour and immunity to thermal warping distortions is maintained throughout, it also opens up the possibility of changing the coupling behaviour through a novel ply termination strategy. Where standard ply angle orientations are a design constraint, seven unique classes of mechanically coupled laminates exist with interactions between Extension, Shearing, Bending, and Twisting. Alternative woven cloth architecture are also considered. For instance, 5 -Harness Satin (5 HS) weave material, possesses straighter load-carrying fibres and low crimp angle, gives rise to improve mechanical performance in comparison to Plain weave material, in which maximum fibre kinking potentially exists. However, due to the unsymmetric nature of the 5 HS weave architecture, a single layer of this material is shown to be thermally unstable, therefore a method is presented to predict the thermal warping curvature and eliminate their effect by applying suitable lamination strategies...|$|R
40|$|In time of {{helicopter}} flight, {{rotor blades}} produce significant vibration and noise {{as a result}} of variations in rotor blade aerodynamic loads with blade azimuth angle. For this reason future helicopters need to be improved with respect to environmental and public acceptance. Significant vibration and noise reduction can be achieved without the need for complex mechanisms in the rotating system using active twist control of helicopter rotor blades by an application of the macro-fibre composite (MFC) actuators. In this case MFC actuators are implemented in the <b>form</b> of active <b>plies</b> within the composite skin of the rotor blade with orientation at 450 to the blade axis to maximize the shear deformations in the laminated skin producing a distributed twisting moment along the blade. The present investigations are devoted to the comparative study of optimal active twist solutions obtained for the helicopter rotor blades with C and D-spars. The baseline helicopter rotor blades consist of C or D-spars made of uni-directional GFRP, skin made of + 450 /- 450 GFRP, foam core, MFC actuators embedded into the skin and balance weight. To investigate an active twist of the helicopter rotor blades, the steady-state thermal analysis using 3 D finite element models has been developed. In this case thermal strain analogy between piezoelectric strains and thermally induced strains is used to model piezoelectric effects. 3 D finite element models of the rotor blades have been built by ANSYS, where rotor blade skin and spar thin parts are modelled by the linear layered structural shell elements SHELL 99, and spar and foam by 3 D 20 -node structural solid elements SOLID 186. The node-offset option is applied for the joint skin-thin spar structure with location of finite element nodes at the top surface to preserve the rotor blade profiles. Optimisation problems for the optimum placement of actuators in different helicopter rotor blades have been formulated on the results of parametric study using the finite element method. Due to large dimension of the numerical problems to be solved, an optimisation methodology is developed employing the method of experimental design and response surface technique. As the design parameters, the values characterising blades spar geometry, skin lay-up, position and size of actuators are chosen. The non-linear optimisation problems are solved by the random search method taking into account the producers requirements on location of centre of gravity and elastic axis, cross-section mass, first torsion eigenfrequency and admissible strains. The optimisation results have been obtained for two helicopter rotor blades and two possible applications of active materials. Comparative study of optimal design solutions for helicopter rotor blades with C and D-spars is presented for a designer convenience...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) {{remains a}} major cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide, particularly in young children and the elderly. It is responsible for a spectrum of diseases ranging from otitis media, to potentially fatal conditions such as pneumonia and meningitis, and is estimated to cost health services billions of dollars each year. The interaction of S. pneumoniae with the host generally begins in the nasopharynx, and invasive disease is almost invariably preceded by nasopharyngeal colonisation. In some circumstances, S. pneumoniae may translocate from the nasopharynx to the lungs where pneumonia can develop, and inflammation is believed {{to play a role in}} this process. The presence of pneumococci in the lungs also triggers an inflammatory response, which is important for clearance of the bacteria. However, a prolonged inflammatory response leads to tissue damage, and is linked with a poor prognosis of disease. It has been shown that respiratory epithelial cells are able to play an active part in the response to respiratory pathogens by releasing chemokines that are responsible for neutrophil recruitment, and it has recently been shown that infection of type II pneumocytes with S. pneumoniae leads to the release of interleukin (IL) - 8. In order to determine the role of specific pneumococcal factors in eliciting a CXC chemokine response from type II pneumocytes (A 549) and nasopharyngeal cells (Detroit- 562), monolayers of these cells were infected with wild type (WT) S. pneumoniae 039, or mutants deficient in choline binding protein A (CbpA), pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), or pneumolysin (Ply), and the CXC chemokine mRNA response was measured by real-time RT-PCR. Release of IL- 8 was also measured by ELISA. In response to WT D 39, both A 549 and Detroit- 562 cells showed a significant increase in CXC chemokine mRNA, and IL- 8 protein. This response was increased 2 -fold when a CbpA-negative (ACbpA) mutant was used to infect cells, suggesting that CbpA may have an inhibitory effect on the CXC chemokine response of these cells. Further investigatiDn demonstrated that this activity is dependent on the N-terminal region of CbpA and that all three N-terminal domains are required for this effect, as deletion of any one of these domains had the same effect on the CXC chemokine response as removing CbpA altogether. Infection with a PspA-negative mutant (APspA) led to a 2 -fold decrease in the CXC chemokine response of A 549 cells, compared to infection with WT D 39 at 2 h, but no difference was seen in the response of Detroit- 562 cells to this mutant compared to WT D 39. Thus, PspA appears to have the ability to stimulate an early CXC chemokine release from A 549 cells. Deletion of the first of 2 regions of the N-terminal a-helical domain of PspA reduced the ability of S pneumoniae to elicit a chemokine response to the same degree as removing PspA altogether, indicating that it is this region that is responsible for the chemokine inducing ability of PspA. Ply appeared to have no effect on the CXC chemokine response of A 549 cells with no obvious difference seen in the response of these cells to APly compared to WT D 39. However, infection of Detroit- 562 cells with APly led to a 2 -fold decrease in IL- 8 mRNA and protein release compared to WT D 39. Using D 39 strains producing mutant <b>forms</b> of <b>Ply</b> with reduced cytotoxicity and/or complement activating abilities, the role of the cytotoxic activity of Ply was demonstrated to be important in generation of a chemokine response from both cell lines. Infection of A 549 or Detroit- 562 cells with mutants producing Ply with only 0. 02 % or 0. 1 % haemolytic activity led to a 2 -fold decrease in IL- 8 release compared to that elicited by WT D 39. The complement activating ability of Ply also appeared to be important in the generation of a CXC chemokine response from A 549 cells. Cells infected with a mutant that produced Ply with no complement activating ability released significantly less IL- 8 than cells infected with WT D 39. This activity of Ply did not appear to have an effect on the CXC chemokine release of Detroit- 562 cells. Thus all three virulence factors investigated had some role in the ability of S. pneumoniae to generate a CXC chemokine response from respiratory epithehal cells, although their roles and the cell lines that were affected differed.

On this reason future helicopters need to be improved with respect to environmental and public acceptance. Significant vibration and noise reduction can be achieved without the need for complex mechanisms in the rotating system using active twist control of helicopter rotor blades by an application of MFC actuators. In this case MFC actuators are implemented in the <b>form</b> of active <b>plies</b> within the composite skin of the rotor blade with orientation at 450 to the blade axis to maximize the shear deformations in the laminated skin producing a distributed twisting moment along the blade. The present investigations are devoted to the methodology development for the optimal design of active rotor blades using MFC actuators to obtain high piezoelectric actuation forces and displacements with a minimum actuator weight. A number of theoretical and experimental studies have been performed to estimate an active twist of helicopter rotor blades required to effect noise and vibration reduction benefits, as well as to improve the overall performances of helicopters [1 - 3]. The objective of the present study is development of the methodology, based on the planning of experiments and response surface technique, for the optimal design of active rotor blades using MFC actuators to obtain high piezoelectric actuation forces and displacements with minimal actuator weight and energy applied. 3 D structural static analysis with thermal load is carried out to characterise an active twist of the helicopter rotor blade. The full scale helicopter rotor blade consists of C-spar made of uni-directional GFRP, skin made from + 450 /- 450 GFRP, foam core, MFC actuators embedded into the skin, balance weight and root. To investigate an active twist of the helicopter rotor blade, the steady-state thermal analysis using 3 D finite element model has been developed. In this case thermal strain analogy between piezoelectric strains and thermally induced strains is used to model piezoelectric effects. 3 D finite element model of the full scale helicopter rotor blade has been built by ANSYS, where the rotor blade skin, spar “moustaches” and root are modelled by the linear layered structural shell elements SHELL 99, and the spar and foam - by 3 D 20 -node structural solid elements SOLID 186. The node-offset option is applied for the joint skin-spar “moustaches” structure with a location of the finite element nodes at the top surface to preserve the rotor blade profile. An optimisation problem for the optimum placement of actuators in the full scale helicopter rotor blades has been formulated on the results of parametric study of model scale helicopter rotor blades using the finite element method. Due to a large dimension of the numerical problem to be solved, an optimisation methodology is developed employing the method of experimental design and response surface technique. The points of experiments in the domain of factors are distributed as regular as possible. In the present approach a form of the equation of regression is unknown previously. Synthesis of the equation from the bank of simple functions is carried out in two steps: selection of perspective functions from the bank and then step-by-step elimination of the selected functions. In the first step all variants are tested with the least square method and the function, which leads to the minimum of the sum of deviations, is chosen for each variant. In the second step the elimination is carried out using the standard deviation or correlation coefficient.

40|$|The cholesterol-dependent cytoiysins (COGs) are a {{group of}} toxins {{produced}} by several genera of Gram-positive bacteria, that bind to and form large oligomeric pores in target cell membranes that contain cholesterol. In addition to cell lysis, {{a great number of}} other biological functions have been described for many members of the group, including induction of cytokine release and complement activation. Some of the COGs {{have been shown to be}} critical virulence factors of their producing organisms and immunisation with a number of the COCs has been shown to be protective against disease caused by those producing organisms. The COCs are also being used in a diverse array of applications that utilise their pore-forming and toxic properties, including anti-cancer therapy, anti-viral therapy and celi biology. Pneumolysin (PLY) is a member of the CDCs produced by S. pneumoniae and is an important virulence factor and vaccine candidate. A deletion mutant of PLY, il 6 PLY, has been described (Kirkham et al., 2006 b), and this mutant is capable of cell binding but incapable of pore formation. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tagged <b>forms</b> of <b>PLY</b> and il 6 PLY were produced and the tagged toxins had similar haemolytic and cytotoxic effects to the parent toxins. Toxin binding to host cells was visualised by epifluorescence microscopy and laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Binding of the tagged toxins to erythrocytes could also be measured by flow cytometry and an increase in the quantity of bound toxin could be detected in a dose-dependent manner over a large range of toxin concentrations. Rod-like structures were observed on membranes treated with Ll 6 eGFPPlY and these were further studied by SEM. These rod-like structures may be responsible for the strong aggregation effect observed upon ~ 6 PlY treatment of erythrocytes. lntermedilysin (IlY) is a member of the CDes produced by S. intermedius. It is unique within the group in that it exhibits human-specific cytolysis and initial studies suggested that this is due to binding of a different ceilular receptor to other toxins of the family and that this receptor was a protein (Nagamune et ai, 1996). eGFP-tagged forms of IlY and Ll 61 lY were produced to allow tracking of the localisation of IlY and for use in development of a quantitative binding assay. It was confirmed that these proteins could be easily visualised by fluorescence microscopy and that binding could be detected by flow cytometry. A two-hybrid screen was also used to screen for proteins from a human brain eDNA library that were capable of interaction with IlY in order to identify candidate protein receptors for !LY, however no likely receptor candidates were identified. In order to determine which region is responsible for the human specificity of intermedilysin, a bank of chimeras between IIY and PLY was created. The chimeric toxins were expressed and purified and the specificity of the mutants was determined by haemolytic assay on human and rabbit erythrocytes. The specificity of the chimeric toxin was determined by the origin of the C-terminal 53 / 56 residues, indicating that the latter part of domain 4 is responsible for the human specificity of intermedilysin. To further resolve the region involved in human specificity or cholesterol-binding, a series of small substitution mutants was created. These revealed that the promiscuous cell binding activity of the other COCs was conferred by residues in the undecapeptide loop as this property could be transferred to by introduction of the typical undecapeptide sequence. Surface-plasmon resonance analysis of substitutions of PLY was used to detect any mutants possessing reduced binding affinity. However, problems with aggregation of purified proteins prevented quantitative data from being collected. Anthrolysin a (ALa) is a toxin produced by Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. It is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) group of toxins, many of which are potential vaccine candidates that protect against their producing organisms. Pore formation by ALa was studied by transmission electron microscopy and pores were found to be consistent with those formed by other members of this toxin family. A novel genetic toxoid of anthrolysin 0, t. 6 mALO, was constructed and characterised and was able to bind to cells but was incapable of poreformation or haemolysis. The capacity of the haemolytic and non-haemolytic forms of ALa to protect against challenge with the toxin or B. anthracis was determined. Immunisation with both active and non-haemolytic forms of ALO elicited protection against lethal Lv. challenge with ALa but neither was protective against B. anthracis a murine Lp. challenge model. Immunisation with another CDC, pneumoiysin, did not confer cross-protection against challenge with ALO.

40|$|Polymer matrix {{composites}} {{are finding}} increased use in structural applications, in particular for aerospace and automotive purposes. Mechanical fatigue {{is the most}} common type of failure of structures in service. The relative importance of fatigue has yet to be reflected in design where static conditions still prevail. The fatigue behavior of composite materials is conventionally characterized by a Wöhler or S-N curve. For every new material with a new lay-up, altered constituents or different processing procedure, a whole new set of fatigue life tests has to be repeated for such a characterization. If the active fatigue damage micromechanisms and the influence of the constituent properties and interface were known, it would be possible, at least qualitatively, to predict the macroscopic fatigue behavior. A study of the fatigue damage mechanisms would also give indications of the weakest microstructural element, which is useful information in materials selection for improvement in service properties. In tensile fatigue of a multidirectional laminate, the critical elements are the longitudinal plies which are the last to fail. Although failure of neighboring off-axis plies as well as delamination will influence the fatigue process, an understanding of the behavior of the longitudinal <b>plies</b> <b>forms</b> an important foundation. Effects of plies of other directions may then be interpreted based on this foundation. Fatigue of longitudinal plies is therefore focused on in the present study. The underlying fatigue damage mechanisms were investigated for unidirectional O' carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP) in tension-tension fatigue. By use of a surface replication technique the evolution of fatigue damage could intermittently be monitored during the course of fatigue testing. In the CFRPS, the matrix was an epoxy resin or polyetheretherketone (PEEK). In the GF/PP system, the matrix was modified with maleic anhydride (MA) to achieve a stronger fibermatrix interface. The macroscopic fatigue behavior was characterized by fatigue life diagrams. A statistical method has been devised to systematically characterize fatigue life data in terms of fatigue life diagrams. On the microscopic level, the CF/epoxy and GF/MA-PP composites have relatively strong interfaces and showed localized and scarce fiber breaks from which matrix cracks propagated perpendicular to the fiber direction. In CF/epoxy, fiber bridged cracks with squeezed fiber tips appeared. Conversely, CF/PEEK and GF/PP have weaker interfaces, and the principal mechanisms were extensive and distributed debonding or longitudinal matrix cracking followed by further fiber breakage. Macroscopically, the weak interface composites showed shorter fatigue lives and more rapid fatigue degradation. This suggests that higher interfacial strengths lead to improved fatigue performance. Modeling studies were undertaken for the two observed mechanisms; debonding from a fiber break, and fiber bridged cracking. The stochastic breakage of fibers next to a growing debond was parametrically investigated with a shear lag model. The stress profile in the surviving fibers becomes attenuated and more distributed as the debonds grow. This results in longer axial distances between fiber breaks, and hence a more jagged and uneven crack propagation. A larger variability in strength along the fibers has basically the same break distributing effect. With a more homogeneous stress distribution caused by long debonds, the variability in fiber stress at failure of the intact fibers decreases. This can explain the experimentally observed lower scatter in fatigue life of composites exhibiting a more homogeneous distribution of damage caused by debonding. Furthermore, the experimental results of fiber bridged cracking was modeled with a fracture mechanics approach. The crack growth curve can be plotted in terms of the effective stress intensity factor where the contribution of the cohesive crack surface forces from the bridging fibers are taken into account. This curve falls somewhat closer to that of the neat matrix material compared to the unbridged crack, but the difference is still considerable. Besides the fiber bridging, there should therefore be other active toughening mechanisms that slows the crack propagation down to account for the fatigue resistant behavior of the tested material. In fatigue of multidirectional laminates, tension-compression loading has shown to be more detrimental than tension-tension loading. The reason for this behavior has not been entirely clarified. The adverse effect of the compressive load excursions is partly caused by the formation of transverse cracks. This was verified by counting transverse cracks in cross-ply laminates. Since debonding is the subcritical mechanism which leads to transverse cracking and eventually influences ultimate failure, the debonding was studied in low cycle fatigue of a single transverse fiber. In tension, contact zones developed at the crack tips for sufficiently large debonds. Due to the inherent geometry and the mismatch in elastic properties of the constituents, an opening zone appeared at the crack tips of the debond in compression. This was also verified by finite element analysis. Since debond propagation is more suseptible to mode I loading, the sensitivity to tension-compression loading is explained by the effective opening zone in compression.
