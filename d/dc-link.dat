40|$|This paper {{presents}} a grid-side inverter based supercapacitor direct integration scheme for wind power systems. The inverter {{used in this}} study consists of a conventional two-level inverter and three H-bridge modules. Three supercapacitor banks are directly connected to the <b>dc-links</b> of H-bridge modules. This approach eliminates the need for interfacing dc-dc converters and thus considerably improves the overall efficiency. However, for the maximum utilization of super capacitors their voltages should be allowed to vary. As a result of this variable voltage space vectors of the hybrid inverter get distributed unevenly. To handle this issue, a modified PWM method and a space vector modulation method are proposed and they can generate undistorted current even in the presence of unevenly distributed space vectors.

40|$|As a {{well-established}} multilevel converter topology, the cascaded H-bridge (CHB) {{is suitable for}} large-scale PV grid-integration due to its high-voltage and high-power capability, high power quality, modular structure, and multiple <b>DC-links</b> which are able to incorporate {{a large number of}} PV generators. Since PV system grounding is required by most countries grid codes and the modulation process of the CHB introduces high potentials upon the DC-side of the converter, galvanic isolation between the PV and the grid is essential to avoid the potential induced degradation (PID) of the PV modules, and to prevent the leakage current, {{as a result of the}} PV panel-to-ground parasitic capacitance, from flowing through the converter and ground, posing serious safety concerns. PV isolation can be achieved by the implementation of isolated DC/DC converters. The DC/DC converters connect the PV sources to the CHB converter through <b>DC-links,</b> performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and necessary DC voltage amplification, while the imbedded high-frequency transformers isolate the PV from the AC-side. The thesis presents the system validation and documents the performance evaluation of the CHB converter with isolated DC/DC converters for large-scale PV grid-integration, featuring different power and voltage level configurations, tailored with two control approaches, and through specific case studies. Two isolated DC/DC converter topologies, namely the boost-half-bridge (BHB) and the flyback are implemented. The CHB converter provides good quality voltage and current waveforms and is capable of medium-voltage grid-connection of the PV system. The system can be well regulated with voltage-oriented control (VOC) schemes both in the synchronous frame using Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers, and in the stationary frame using Proportional-Resonant (PR) controllers. Both DC/DC converters are able to perform MPPT under Standard Test Conditions (STC) and track the varying input voltage reference signal in a wide range fast and accurately. Compared with the flyback, the BHB converter presents lower ripples on the control variables and offers better MPPT efficiency at a higher component count. As the building block of the multiphase DC/DC converters, which feature high-voltage and high-current capability with modular and interleaved structures, the BHB makes a competitive candidate for this application...|$|R

40|$|High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) {{transmission}} {{systems are}} used {{all over the}} world in frequency-conversion schemes, non-synchronous AC interconnections, submarine <b>DC-links</b> and in many other projects where they enhance AC system stability. HVDC system has many advantages such as fast power flow control, stable and economical operation for long-distance transmission. But the large-scale usage of HVDC transmission is limited by several factors {{and one of the most}} important factors is the high cost of conversion equipment. A proposed converter model for the HVDC rectifier system is presented for a possible reduction of the high cost of conversion equipment. This thesis presents an investigation into the viability of a hybrid diode-thyristor HVDC rectifier. In a standard HVDC system, a 12 -pulse thyristor-bridge is used. In this thesis, the CIGRE benchmark based HVDC system operating with a weak AC system is presented as the standard model. In the proposed hybrid circuit, the lower 6 -pulse thyristor-bridge (which is connected with a Y-Y transformer), is replaced by a cheaper diode-bridge. This reduces the overall capital cost of the 12 -pulse rectifier, but has implications regarding the operational behaviour of the HVDC terminal and system. The operational behaviour of this hybrid diode-thyristor rectifier under static and dynamic conditions and the comparison with the standard model are verified with the well-known simulation package called EMTP-RV. Due to unbalanced harmonic cancellation between diode-bridge and thyristor-bridge, the proposed HVDC system generates more characteristic harmonics than the standard model on both AC and DC side. So, an extra filtering unit is needed which will increase the cost of the proposed HVDC model. In the proposed model, only one controller block is needed for the thyristor-bridge as the diode-bridge does not need the controller block. So the cost will be reduced in the proposed model due to the requirement of a single controller block. The controller for optimizing the PI parameters of the proposed HVDC model is designed by using ITAE (Integral of Time multiplied by the Absolute value of the Error) criterion, which is one of the synthetic indexes for evaluating the control system's performance. DC fault is the most severe fault for the converter valves at the rectifier end and it represents one serious operational difficulty with the introduction of the proposed model. It is very difficult to recover from a DC fault like the standard model because of the uncontrolled diode-bridge. So an AC breaker (which is costly equipment) is added to the system to recover from the faul...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a modular PMSG and {{converter}} topology, suitable for utility interface of large wind turbine has been has been explored. A comprehensive analysis on different sinusoidal {{pulse width modulation}} has been performed an Matlab/Simulink® environment. Through analytical calculation, it is proved that multilevel converters can have higher energy efficiency compared to traditional two-level inverters. The possible solutions to draw sinusoidal current from the generator windings, where they are interfaced with single phase diode rectifiers are investigated and the proposed solution is simulated {{and the results are}} confirmed by laboratory tests. The laboratory results show that the combination of a single phase diode rectifier with a boost chopper which operates at continuous mode of operation presents a cost effective solution for reducing the torque ripple and controlling power factor of the generator. Moreover, a mathematical modeling of the boost chopper interconnected with a single phase diode rectifier performed and an algorithm for maximum power point tracking without measuring wind speed has been proposed. The algorithm is simulated and the results show satisfactory performance. The algorithm is implemented in dSPACE, but due the limited available RAM the dSPACE could not operate satisfactory. A more powerful DSP card is needed to implement the algorithm. The Robicon Perfect Harmony drive has been chosen to investigate the possibility of utilizing available VFD for direct grid connection of wind energy systems. The simulation results demonstrate that in order to utilize this drive some modifications must be done in the topology of the drive. It is shown that the capacitances of the <b>dc-links</b> are a decisive factor for direct grid connection of PMSG. A value of less than 4. 5 mF for a 23 -level multilevel converter causes an increase in the third harmonic of the output voltage of the multilevel converter which makes it unacceptable for direct grid connection. A laboratory test is performed on a 50 kW PMSG to investigate the voltage stress in the generator coils when the output voltage of the PMSG is in maximum amplitude. It was observed that the amplitude of the voltage stress was less than induced voltage in each coil, but high dv/dt appears across each coil which may finally destroy the insulation. It is supposed that the switching functions of the IGBTs in the inverter side cause the problem and by using a multilevel converter instead of two-level inverter a smoother transition for the voltage stress from one level to another can be achieved. More practical tests are needed to accurately determine the level of voltage stress. Also an alternative topology for the grid side inverter has been proposed to reduce the losses and improve the THD profile of the converter output voltage. It is suggested to do analytical and practical tests on the proposed topology. All the simulations have been performed in Matlab/Simulink environment...|$|R
40|$|Three-phase {{multi-level}} topologies {{have been}} drawing increased {{attention in the}} past two decades. The numerous advantages of multi-level supply include: good power quality (low voltage distortion and dv/dt), good electromagnetic compatibility, operation with a lower switching frequency (lower switching losses), high voltage capability, smaller common mode (CM) voltage (reducing the stress in the motor bearings). There are various topologies of multilevel converters. The main ones are the neutral point clamped (NPC), the flying capacitor (FC) and the cascaded converters. Another alternative is the dual two-level inverter configuration supplying an open-end winding machine. This topology has received growing attention due to its simple structure. The open-end topology has the advantages that the additional diodes used in the neutral- point-clamped (NPC) voltage source inverter (VSI) are not needed, leading to a saving in the overall number of components. Furthermore, the issue of proper capacitor voltage balancing does not exist if the supply is two-level at each winding side. Application of such a dual-inverter supply (with equal <b>DC-links)</b> enables drive operation with voltage waveform equivalent to the one obtainable with a three-level VSI. The advantages of multi-phase variable speed drives over the three-phase ones are numerous and include an increase of fault tolerance, the possibility to have several multi-phase machines connected in series and drive them independently with a single VSI and, when the machine is equipped with a concentrated winding, other, higher harmonics {{can also be used to}} increase the developed torque. This thesis explores the possibility of combining the multi-phase and open-end- winding multi-level topologies. In particular the five-phase open-end-winding topology is considered. General properties of the five-phase AC motor drives with sinusoidal winding distribution are at first reviewed, along with the previously developed two- level space-vector modulation algorithm for a five-phase two-level VSI. A mathematical model of the converter is developed and a detailed study of the available switching states and corresponding voltage space vectors is conducted. It is shown that, due to the large number of switching states available in the topology together with the additional requirements when driving a multi-phase machine, the design of a suitable modulation scheme is extremely challenging. Three different space-vector modulation methods are proposed in the thesis. The developed methods are relatively simple to implement since they consider each inverter individually hence breaking down the problem into one of simpler complexity. The three modulation methods and the performance of the five- phase drive are verified using simulations. Finally, a laboratory prototype is described, which utilises two two-level five- phase inverters connected across an open-end-winding five-phase induction machine. The three modulation schemes are implemented using a fast prototyping control system (dSP ACE) and the performance of the modulation techniques is compared. The motor is controlled in V/fmode, in open loop. It is demonstrated that two of the methods produce multi-level output waveforms and that one method offers superior performance, with reduced converter losses.

40|$|Quando um conversor opera com uma larga diferenÃa entre os nÃveis de tensÃo de entrada e de saÃda, normalmente Ã possÃvel identificar uma reduÃÃo significante no seu desempenho. A razÃo disto Ã o aumento da quantidade de energia processada, que primeiramente precisa ser armazenada em um elemento passivo (indutor), antes de ser entregue Ã carga. Ã possÃvel dizer que quÃo maior for a quantidade dessa energia âindiretaâ, menor serÃ a eficiÃncia do sistema. Tal situaÃÃo Ã especialmente crÃtica para inversores e retificadores com correÃÃo de fator de potÃncia (PFC), visto que a razÃo cÃclica dos interruptores abrange praticamente todos os possÃveis valores. Em casos em que a diferenÃa entre o valor de pico da tensÃo CA e o valor mÃdio da tensÃo CC Ã grande, o Ãndice de modulaÃÃo Ã desviado consideravelmente de 1 e, consequentemente, maiores perdas sÃo esperadas. Para lidar com tal situaÃÃo, Ã proposto um retificador com caracterÃstica abaixadora e elevadora utilizando uma funÃÃo chamada de bypass. Esta funÃÃo permite que o retificador escolha entre os dois barramentos o que melhor se adapta ao nÃvel de saÃda desejado em funÃÃo do ponto de operaÃÃo da tensÃo senoidal de entrada, maximizando a eficiÃncia. Algumas das vantagens esperadas com a utilizaÃÃo da funÃÃo bypass sÃo: reduÃÃo das perdas totais por meio da operaÃÃo parcial com estÃgio Ãnico; maior nÃmero de nÃveis de tensÃo, reduzindo a corrente de modo comum e o volume do filtro de entrada, alÃm de resultar em menores esforÃos de tensÃo sobre os semicondutores; e, finalmente, reduÃÃo de perdas adicionais e no tamanho do sistema, visto que o conversor Buck de saÃda Ã projetado para apenas uma fraÃÃo da potÃncia total. Em adiÃÃo, sÃo apresentadas possÃveis configuraÃÃes de conversores de potÃncia para o carregamento de baterias de veÃculos elÃtricos.

As caracterÃsticas do sistema proposto, incluindo princÃpio de operaÃÃo, estratÃgia de modulaÃÃo, equaÃÃes de dimensionamento e cÃlculos de perdas e eficiÃncia, sÃo descritas em detalhes. Finalmente, a viabilidade do conceito de bypass Ã demonstrada por meio de resultados experimentais obtidos a partir de um protÃtipo de 22 kW. When {{operating}} with large differences between {{input and output}} voltage levels, it is normally possible to identify a significant reduction {{on the performance of}} practically all topologies in regard of conversion efficiency. Reason for this is the increasing amount of processed energy that needs to be firstly stored in a passive element (inductor) before reaching the load. It is therefore possible to say that the higher the amount of such âindirectâ energy is; the lower will be the converter efficiency. Such situation is especially critical when considering the operation of inverters or controlled rectifiers with power factor correction (PFC) because the converter sweeps practically all the possible values of duty cycle. In the case the difference between peak AC value and DC value is large; the modulation index will strongly deviate from 1. Consequently, even higher amount of losses are expected. In order to deal with the above referred drawbacks, it is proposed a 5 -level three-phase PFC rectifier with an innovative approach, named bypass concept. This function allows the converter to switch between one of the available <b>DC-links</b> that best matches the required output levels depending on the operating point of the sinus wave, thus maximizing the efficiency. Furthermore, the referred bypass function enables direct access to the required lower voltage level by the load, reducing significantly the amount of losses. The 5 -level operation allows the voltage steps to be lower than those found in three and two-level topologies, from where lower harmonic contents, reduction of common mode current and EMI are observed. Finally, the output DC-DC converters are designed for {{only a fraction of the}} nominal power, having a rather reduced impact on additional losses and also on the converter size. In addition, possible power electronics configurations for charging of EVs are presented. Suitable three-phase PFC rectifier topologies with sinusoidal input currents and controlled output voltage are analyzed and proposed, and their functionality and basic characteristics briefly described. Analytical formulas for calculating the current stresses on the power semiconductors are provided, and in order to evaluate comparatively the performance of selected topologies, dimensionless benchmark factors are derived concerning the semiconductor stresses and the volume of the main inductive components. The characteristics of the proposed system, including the principle of operation, modulation strategy, dimensioning equations and calculated losses and efficiency, are described in detail.

40|$|Abstract- The {{instantaneous}} {{response of}} the distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is very important while compensating rapidly varying balanced, unbalanced and nonlinear loads. Any change in the load affects the <b>dc-link</b> voltage directly. The proper operation of DSTATCOM requires variation of the <b>dc-link</b> voltage within the prescribed limits. Conventionally, a proportional-integral (PI) controller is used to maintain the <b>dc-link</b> voltage to the reference value. It uses deviation of the capacitor voltage from its reference value as its input. However, the transient {{response of the}} conventional PI <b>dc-link</b> voltage controller is slow. In this paper, a fast-acting <b>dc-link</b> voltage controller based on the energy of a <b>dc-link</b> capacitor is proposed. Mathematical equations are given to compute the gains of the conventional controller based on fast-acting dclink voltage controllers to achieve similar fast transient response. The detailed simulations are carried out on MATLAB environment to validate the proposed controller.

40|$|In a {{switched}} reluctance (SR) drive, {{the transfer}} of the de-fluxing energy in stator windings back to the <b>dc-link</b> results in a large <b>dc-link</b> capacitance. This limits its applications where weight and size of the drive are restricted. This thesis describes a control technique for the <b>dc-link</b> capacitance minimisation in an SR drive. The proposed control technique maintains the constant power transfer between the de supply and the H-bridge converter. The average <b>dc-link</b> current over a switching period is kept constant. When the output of the integrator, i. e., the average <b>dc-link</b> current, reaches a predefined value proportional to the torque demand, appropriate switching takes place. This is achieved by integrating the <b>dc-link</b> current in each switching period. This technique is called <b>dc-link</b> current integration control (DLCIC). The de-fluxing current from the outgoing phase is not fed back to the <b>dc-link</b> capacitor. Instead, it is transferred to the incoming phase to prevent a negative <b>dc-link</b> current, which causes a fluctuation in the capacitor voltage. Extensive simulation studies of the DLCIC and other techniques reported in literature have been performed and the simulation results from DLCIC are compared with those from other techniques such as Hysteresis Current Control (HCC) and Pulse Width Modulation Current Control (PWMCC). It has been shown that the peak-to-peak voltages across the <b>dc-link</b> capacitor from DLCIC are the lowest amongst other techniques. The operational speed range of the DLCIC is determined and the optimal turn-on and turn-off angles are proposed. Filter components under the DLCIC operation has been designed and compared with the filter for HCC. It is shown that the weight of the filter for DLCIC is far lower than that for HCC. The proposed control technique have been validated by experiments. The experimental results show that at the <b>dc-link</b> voltage ripple which results from DLCIC is much lower than that from HCC. This demonstrates that DLCIC can minimise the <b>dc-link</b> capacitance in an SR machine drive. ...|$|E
