However, Glen Taylor later headed a group to purchase {{the team with the}} NBA approving the transaction in October 1994.

50|$|If the Treasury {{purchases}} assets via auction, {{and that}} purchase exceeds $300 million, any new employment contract for a senior officer may {{not include a}} golden parachute provision {{in the case of}} <b>involuntary</b> termination, <b>bankruptcy</b> filing, insolvency, or receivership. This prohibition only applies to future contracts; golden parachutes already in place will remain unaffected.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, {{a number}} of LaRouche entities, {{including}} the Fusion Energy Foundation, were taken over through an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> proceeding. The government's use of a sealed order in this proceeding {{was regarded as a}} rare legal maneuver.|$|E
25|$|As a {{threshold}} matter, bankruptcy cases are either voluntary or involuntary. In voluntary bankruptcy cases, {{which account for}} {{the overwhelming majority of}} cases, debtors petition the bankruptcy court. With <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> creditors, rather than the debtor, file the petition in bankruptcy. Involuntary petitions are rare, however, and are occasionally used in business settings to force a company into bankruptcy so that creditors can enforce their rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} to {{this was on}} Nov. 12, when Resorts reached a tentative agreement with certain bondholders, several bondholders petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, to put the company into <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> to protect legal claims they might have against Trump, the real estate investor Griffin outbid for Resorts the prior year. As a result, this literally wiped out or greatly reduced the investments of the bondholders, so that Mr. Griffin could sue Trump and yet still retain a significant portion for himself.|$|E

500|$|During the {{bankruptcy}} trial in September 1989, an FBI agent destroyed evidence (credit card receipts, cancelled checks, and FEC filings) immediately {{after he had}} promised the court he would preserve them. On October 25, 1989, Judge Martin V.B. Bostetter dismissed the government's <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> petition, finding {{that two of the}} entities involved were nonprofit fund-raisers and therefore not subject to <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> actions. According to the LaRouche movement, Bostetter said the government's actions amounted to bad faith regardless of whether government agents and attorneys had intended this outcome. He found that the government's actions and representations in obtaining {{the bankruptcy}} had the effect of misleading the court as to the status of the organization, leading to a [...] "constructive fraud on the court". In 1993, an appeals court decision said that Bostetter had specifically rejected that view, and said that the defendants had [...] "greatly distorted the character of much of the evidence". [...] Appeals that went {{all the way up to}} the U.S. Supreme Court found that the matter of the <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> would not change the outcome of LaRouche's conviction.|$|E
500|$|In {{testimony}} {{submitted to}} the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 13, 1998, the LaRouche-affiliated Schiller Institute claimed that [...] "he inability to repay lenders and other crediters [...] was the consequence of an unprecedented <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> proceeding initiated by the Justice Department against those companies in 1987, initiated in an ex parte, in camera proceeding".|$|E

Bryan wrote, [...] "the court will not allow a delving into any details of alleged infiltration ... for the reason that ... this would divert the jury from the issues raised in the indictment." ...|$|E

50|$|While in {{the process}} of {{changing}} its retail format, a group of creditors forced an <b>involuntary</b> petition for <b>bankruptcy</b> under Chapter 11 on March 15, 1999, seeking court supervision of the company's restructuring.

500|$|During the trial, {{a search}} of the {{personal}} files of Oliver North was ordered by Judge Keeton to look for evidence that North had led an effort to harass and infiltrate the LaRouche movement, causing an additional delay in the trial. The search produced a May 1986 telex from Iran-Contra defendant General Richard Secord to North, discussing the gathering of information against LaRouche. [...] After this memo surfaced, Judge Keeton ordered {{a search of}} Vice President George Bush's office for documents relating to LaRouche. Another delay came when the trial was halted to give time for the FBI to search their files for exculpatory documents. The trial was delayed again when federal agents seized LaRouche properties as part of the <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> procedure in 1988.|$|E
500|$|In early April 1987, the {{government}} charged {{in court that}} LaRouche organizations may {{have been trying to}} sell properties for cash to more easily conceal their assets and avoid paying $21.4million in contempt of court fines. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> petition on April 20, 1987, to collect the debt from Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. In a rare procedure, the companies were seized before the bankruptcy came to trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney S. David Schiller wrote in a brief that the debtors had a [...] "pattern of transferring or commingling substantial corporate assets to their members and other insiders for little or no consideration and for non-business purposes". [...] The trustees later reported they were only able to locate about $86,000 in assets.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1916, in {{violation}} of his parole, Shea left New York State and moved to Chicago. He joined Timothy D. [...] "Big Tim" [...] Murphy's Irish American gang, and was allegedly involved {{in a number of}} crimes. His main jobs were labor racketeering and extortion bombing, and he was well known as bomb terrorist. His cover was working as a bartender at the Halsted Street Hotel. His co-employee was William Rooney, an ex-"slugger" [...] for the Teamsters. Rooney was tried in April 1917 for jury tampering, and Shea defended Rooney in court in regard to the charge (which was dismissed). In May 1917, the saloon's license was revoked when Chicago officials learned that Shea actually managed the saloon and may have invested in it in violation of the terms of his parole. On May 29, Shea was arrested for complicity in a payroll robbery after the alleged thieves used his saloon as a hideout. Shea was released and not charged. In June 1919, Chicago police suspected Shea of involvement in a bank robbery. [...] While searching for Shea's automobile, the vehicle was blown up on June 4. [...] Police did not arrest or indict Shea in connection with either event. Shea later became an officer in an automobile dealership. The dealership entered <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> in 1920, and investors in the company accused Shea of fraud. [...] Once again, no arrest or conviction was made. In November 1922, Chicago police alleged that Shea led an auto theft ring, but no arrest was made.|$|E

50|$|The 9/11 {{attacks and}} Context Books' office {{location}} in lower Manhattan created a massive financial setback for the company, which lost phone access {{for three months}} and found two of its titles released in September 2001 to languish.

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{increasing}} competition from better-funded national chains, leasing difficulties at some mall locations and what Bean describes in hindsight as several [...] "bad decisions" [...] combined to push Pizza Haven into filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

6000|$|I {{have become}} {{impressed}} {{with the belief that}} the act approved March 2, 1867, entitled [...] "An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States," [...] is productive of more evil than good at this time. Many considerations might be urged for its total repeal, but, if this is not considered advisable, I think it will not be seriously questioned that those portions of said act providing for what is called <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> operate to increase the financial embarrassments of the country. Careful and prudent men very often become involved in debt in the transaction of their business, and though they may possess ample property, if it could be made available for that purpose, to meet all their liabilities, yet, on account of the extraordinary scarcity of money, they may be unable to meet all their pecuniary obligations as they become due, in consequence of which they are liable to be prostrated in their business by proceedings in bankruptcy at the instance of unrelenting creditors. People are now so easily alarmed as to monetary matters that the mere filing of a petition in bankruptcy by an unfriendly creditor will necessarily embarrass, and oftentimes accomplish the financial ruin, of a responsible business man. Those who otherwise might make lawful and just arrangements to relieve themselves from difficulties produced by the present stringency in money are prevented by their constant exposure to attack and disappointment by proceedings against them in bankruptcy, and, besides, the law is made use of in many cases by obdurate creditors to frighten or force debtors into a compliance with their wishes and into acts of injustice to other creditors and to themselves. I recommend that so much of said act as provides for <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> on account of the suspension of payment be repealed.|$|E
50|$|Although {{almost all}} {{bankruptcy}} cases are filed voluntarily by the debtor, the Bankruptcy Code also {{provides for the}} filing of an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> case against a person or business entity by creditors. The purpose of the filing of a petition for <b>Involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> case is usually as a means by creditors to collect on debts.|$|E
50|$|Debtors {{may also}} be forced into {{bankruptcy}} by creditors {{in the case of}} an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> but only under Chapters 7 or 11. However, in most instances the debtor may choose under which chapter to file. In the case of an <b>involuntary</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> the debtor may also choose to convert from the forced chapter 7 or 11 proceeding into a proceeding under another chapter.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{analysis}} of the company and its situation in October 2008 Richard Aboulafia, Vice President, Analysis, Teal Group in his consultant's report on Eclipse said: [...] "With numerous lawsuits from suppliers and customers, Eclipse faces the prospect of <b>involuntary</b> or voluntary <b>bankruptcy</b> ... we doubt that Eclipse can survive as an ongoing business. There is a chance that additional cash injections would keep it alive for another year or two. But for now, our forecast calls for production to end in 2009." ...|$|R

[...] In 2002, the bankruptcy court ruled that some former partners could not escape liability for the firm's debts.

50|$|On April 14, 2009, the {{liquidators}} of Madoff International Limited of London {{filed for}} Chapter 15 bankruptcy recognition in West Palm Beach, Florida, and sued Peter Madoff, to recover a 1964 Aston Martin DB2/4 automobile {{worth an estimated}} $200,000. In March and May 2008, Madoff International wire-transferred 135,000 pounds ($198,207) {{to buy a car}} for Peter Madoff, and delivered it to him at his residence in Palm Beach. Madoff International's listed assets are as much as $500 million and debt of more than $1 billion in its bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy is designed to block U.S. lawsuits against foreign companies with U.S. operations while they reorganize overseas. Investors who filed an <b>involuntary</b> personal <b>bankruptcy</b> petition against Madoff want his business’s U.K. unit's bankruptcy moved to New York because “overlapping discovery, related assets and common creditors” among the various cases mean they should be in the same court.|$|R
