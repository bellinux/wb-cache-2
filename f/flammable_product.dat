While serving as a Royal Navy armed transport she was damaged in a fire, with loss of life, in Baltimore, Maryland, in October 1917. Investigating officials, after the fire, were convinced the vessel {{was the target of}} arson, and that the arsonists were German agents—an enemy of the United Kingdom and the United States, during World War I. [...] Several suspects were arrested. However, it was later determined that the fire on Pier 9, that triggered the fire on board Kerry Range, was due to an electrical malfunction that triggered oakum, a <b>flammable</b> <b>product</b> once used to pack seams on ships. Three crew members lost their lives. Firefighting officials towed the blazing vessel away from the pier, to help prevent it igniting nearby Pier 8, and scuttled her. It took over a day to completely put out the fires on the hulk. Some press reports at the time wrote she was a complete write-off. However, the damaged vessel was salvaged and sold to the Steam Navigation Company of Canada in 1918.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree {{decades after}} the {{pioneering}} development of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil, {{the arrival of the}} new century has seen a worldwide boom in the automotive biofuel industry. Although fire safety of biofuels has not been perceived so far as a potential barrier to sustainability of their development, very limited scientific work {{can be found on the}} matter. This paper is a first contribution to the discussion of these issues within the fire safety community. It aims at identifying research needs from an initial overview based on existing safety data pertaining to currently available biofuels for transport. The paper comprises a first analysis of fire risk typology presented by such biofuel technologies, including first lessons from recent accidents. At first sight, when considering aspects of fire safety from a technical point of view, it seems a simple problem, but analysis shows that from the point of view of safety of biofuels, it is not correct to summarize the regulatory position by simply saying that fuel ethanol is a <b>flammable</b> <b>product,</b> whereas biodiesel is not. Clearly, a more in-depth analysis of fire safety issues is needed that will also have to consider significant changes in biofuel technologies in the future...|$|E
40|$|International audienceYears after {{pioneering}} {{development of}} sugar cane ethanol in Brazil (started {{in the mid}} 70 's), with the new century venue we are assisting of a booming industry regarding biofuels for transportation in general, at international level. However, fire safety has not appeared so far as a potential bottleneck for future sustainable development, nor has it been anticipated that fire safety misleading judgements or lack of safety management might act as a non technical barrier for sustainable development. This paper is a first contribution to discuss these issues within the fire safety community aiming at identifying research needs and bring a first overview based on life cycle and whole value chain perspectives of biofuels for transport. This contribution is a first output from a National research program named BIOSAFUEL piloted by INERIS, comprising a first analysis of fire risk typology presented by socalled in Europe 1 st generation technologies of biofuels. When the first statement is to consider that fire safety aspects {{are not likely to}} be that much critical on a technical point of view, the analysis is showing that safety related issues -and more especially fire safety related issues- with biofuels are not correctly summarized by simply saying that fuel ethanol is a <b>flammable</b> <b>product</b> whereas biodiesel is not, from a regulatory point of view. A more in-depth analysis is needed, that will, in addition, have to consider significant changes in biofuel technologies in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of an accident’s occurrence {{is a key}} aspect {{to take into consideration}} in the field of risk assessment. Aspects such as the human factor, which is a major cause of undesired events in process industries, are usually not considered explicitly in the frequency estimation, mainly due to the uncertainty and complexity associated to them. Failure frequencies are modified by a fuzzy modifier that has been developed in order to introduce the human factor in their estimation. The model includes variables such as Organizational Factors, Job Characteristics Factor and Personal Characteristics Factor. Applying this methodology, new values of frequencies have been obtained. To develop the fuzzy modifier the opinion of experts has been taken into account through the completion of a questionnaire.

40|$|Statistically, {{accidental}} {{residential and}} vehicle fires cause ~ 3000 fatalities, and ~$ 10 billion in damages {{per year in}} the United States. To reduce the hazard, many <b>flammable</b> <b>products</b> are protected with bromated flame-retardants. However, studies have proven their use to pose major environmental and health hazards. A recent EPA mandate calls to phase out common formulations by 2014. To fill the void, incorporation of replacements is critical, however few offer such efficient and versatile protection. This dissertation intends to provide solutions through research and development of non-toxic zinc and calcium hydroxystannate (ZHS, CHS) nanoparticle based flame retardants for common textiles. Using low-temperature solution synthesis methods, single crystalline ZHS micro- and nanocubes have been successfully grown on pure tin substrates. Cube morphology was controlled by altering reaction time and chemical reagents. Their thermal decomposition process was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravitational analysis and electron microscopy. An endothermic peak near ~ 540 K is attributed decomposition of ZHS into ZnSnO 3. Furthermore, successful incorporation of hydroxystannate nanomaterial surface-coatings onto cotton, nylon and polyester textile fibers is achieved using a novel sustainable solution chemistry method. Alteration of the driving force/kinetics of nucleation and growth in these systems through control of precursor concentration, reaction time and temperature is used to tailor the coating particle morphology and mass loading. Associated fire-retardancy properties have been assessed and characterized by using standardized NFPA 705, ASTM D 6413, and cone calorimetry tests. Hydroxystannate-coated nylon and polyester textiles demonstrate marginal, if any, performance increase, partially resulting from the scaffolding effect. However, hydroxystannate-coated cotton exhibits pronounced improvements in flame retardancy via physical mechanisms including morphology induced thermal and oxygen barrier properties, and thermally induced endothermic phase changes. As a result, the hydroxystannate nanomaterial systems display superior time-to-ignition and peak heat release rates (PHRRs) in comparison with the leading commercial flame retardant cotton. Furthermore, the strong correlation between burn-rates and PHRRs suggests that burn-rate analysis may provide a simplified method of estimating these values when compared to expensive cone calorimetry. This research advances the understanding of hydroxystannate flame retardant surface coatings...|$|R

The Co 3 O 4 (20 - 40 nm) and NiO (8 - 15 nm) nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on the graphene surface, which has been demonstrated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy clearly shows that graphene, GNS-Co 3 O 4 and GNS-NiO are well dispersed in PA 6 due to the electrostatic interaction. The visible increment in decomposition temperature and reduction in maximum decomposition rate are observed from thermogravimetric analysis for both PA 6 /GNS-Co 3 O 4 and PA 6 /GNS-NiO composites. Testing in the cone calorimeter shows that incorporating GNS-Co 3 O 4 and GNS-NiO confers PA 6 with improved fire safety, {{as evidenced by the}} obvious delay in time to peak heat release and visible reduction in heat release rate, CO production rate and total smoke production. The result of the smoke density chamber indicates that GNS-Co 3 O 4 and GNS-NiO perform better than bare graphene in inhibiting the smoke emission. The <b>flammable</b> gaseous <b>products</b> are largely reduced with the addition of GNS-Co 3 O 4 and GNS-NiO as revealed from the thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the basic {{principles}} of triage in mass burns disasters and discuss the experience of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Nigeria, in the December 2006 disaster at Abule-Egba, Lagos, Nigeria. It is hoped that the experience gained will help in the planning for and management of similar disasters in the developing countries with limited facilities. Burn injury has been described as the severest form of trauma and its management is very challenging as it is often accompanied by numerous pathophysiological changes. Successful management requires expert management by well-trained personnel in equipped and dedicated centres. In mass disasters the total number of victims may exceed the capability of the facility and its staff and a system for sorting out the patients and caring for those that will benefit from the facilities available needs to be developed. Other patients will either be sent to other medical facilities for further treatment or discharged after initial care for future follow-up. Documented experiences in the management of mass burns disasters from petroleum pipeline explosions from developing countries are rare. However, petroleum pipeline explosions, especially in the Lagos area of Nigeria, are relatively common. These cases have been associated with a variety of factors. The resulting morbidity and mortality have been high. LASUTH has a dedicated burns centre, which has received and managed many burn patients. Triage is the medical process of screening patients according to their need of treatment and the resources available. The aims and objectives of triage are discussed, its various levels described, and the final goals elaborated. All the burn victims involved in the 2006 disaster were studied, together with the triage carried out at different levels and the consequent sorting of the patients. Standard burns management was carried out. A total of 385 patients sustained burns of various degrees from the fire resulting from the explosion. On site, emergency department (ED) and intra-hospital triage were carried out. Ninety patients were brought to the LASUTH ED. Of these, 51 patients (56. 67 %) received first-aid treatment and were either discharged for out-patient follow-up or referred to secondary health care facilities. Twenty-eight (31. 11 %) out of the remaining 39 patients with burns in more than 70 % total body surface area (TBSA) were categorized as unsalvageable and 11 (12. 22 %) with less than 70 % TBSA as salvageable. All the patients in the unsalvageable group died (i. e. 100 % mortality), while one patient died in the salvageable group (mortality rate, 9. 09 %). The mortality rate for the ruptured petroleum product pipeline incident was 84. 16 %; the fatality rate for all patients seen at LASUTH was 32. 22 %. The need for caution in the handling of petroleum products is discussed and the effectiveness of the triage system used is highlighted. In conclusion, burns from <b>flammable</b> petroleum <b>products</b> can be very dangerous and proper triage should therefore be carried out, with salvageable patients being managed by experts in dedicated burns centres...|$|R
