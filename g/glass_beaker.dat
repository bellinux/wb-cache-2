25|$|Its {{collections}} of prehistoric implements and Roman and Anglo-Saxon antiquities found in Canterbury, Thanet and East Kent {{have since been}} shared with local museums: for example the nearly perfect Anglo-Saxon <b>glass</b> <b>beaker</b> with hollow tears found at Reculver is now at Herne Bay Museum.

The remaining collections are currently stored at the Museum of Canterbury, with some objects on display.|$|E
25|$|In 669 CE, {{long after}} the fort was {{abandoned}} in the fourth century, King Egbert granted land to the priest Bassa to build Reculver church. Most of the church was pulled down in 1809 leaving two towers as navigational aids, and sea erosion has removed half of the fort. Anglo-Saxon finds include a large <b>glass</b> <b>beaker</b> with tears found at Broomfield in 1830, a fifth or sixth century wheel-made pottery bowl known as the Marshside Bowl found by the son of farmer Jack Harbour, and a large blue glass bead found near Reculver.|$|E
25|$|The main gallery was {{redesigned}} in 1994, {{the glass}} balustrade on the staircase and mezzanine are {{the work of}} Danny Lane, the gallery covering contemporary glass opened in 2004 and the sacred silver and stained-glass gallery in 2005. In this latter gallery stained glass is displayed alongside silverware starting in the 12th century and continuing to the present. Some of the most outstanding stained glass, dated 1243–48 comes from the Sainte-Chapelle, is displayed along with other examples in the new Medieval & Renaissance galleries. The important 13th-century <b>glass</b> <b>beaker</b> known as the Luck of Edenhall is also displayed in these galleries. Examples of British stained glass are displayed in the British Galleries. One {{of the most spectacular}} items in the collection is the chandelier by Dale Chihuly in the rotunda at the Museum's main entrance.|$|E
50|$|Remnants of two Kassite <b>glass</b> <b>beakers</b> {{were found}} in the ruins of Hasanlu, in {{northwest}} Iran. The site was burned to the ground in the later part of the ninth century BCE, preserving many objects often lost in other sites, {{after the end of the}} Kassite rule. The glassworks found inside one of the structures had been preserved from the Kassite era as precious keepsakes, based on the richness of the other artifacts found alongside the glass fragments. The building the pieces {{were found in}} has been determined to be a temple, and it is theorized that the <b>glass</b> <b>beakers</b> were utilized in ritual and devotional practices.|$|R

50|$|In Scandinavia, {{there was}} a great import of goods, such as coins (more than 7 000), vessels, bronze images, <b>glass</b> <b>beakers,</b> {{enameled}} buckles, weapons, etc. Moreover, the style of metal objects and clay vessels was markedly Roman. For the first time appear objects such as shears and pawns.|$|R
500|$|The {{meteorite}} never cools, but begins shrinking {{and local}} scientists cannot discern its origins. As the stone shrinks, it leaves behind globules of colour which {{are referred to}} as such only by analogy, as they fall outside the range of anything known in the visible spectrum. The stone is eventually destroyed by a bolt of lightning and the lab specimens are destroyed when placed in a <b>glass</b> <b>beaker,</b> but, in the following season, Gardner's crops come in unnaturally large and abundantly. When he discovers that, despite their appearance, they are inedible, he becomes convinced the meteorite has poisoned the soil. Over the following year, the problem spreads to the surrounding vegetation and local animals, altering them in unusual ways. Plant life around the farmhouse becomes [...] "slightly luminous in the dark", and Gardner's wife eventually goes mad, forcing him to lock her up in the attic. During this time, Gardner slowly begins to isolate his family {{from the rest of the}} town and Pierce becomes his only contact with the outside world.|$|E

30|$|As {{the focus}} of this study was the {{morphological}} characterization of calcite pseudomorph particles, the ash was first sieved to 2  mm, then washed several times with deionized water until the pH of the dispersion dropped from 9.5 to 10 to around 6 to 6.5. Each time, water was added to the ash in <b>glass</b> <b>beakers,</b> stirred, and then let it fully settle before centrifugation.|$|R

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} finds in the eastern mound were many fragments of decorated bronze panels with a dancing warrior carrying a spear. These panels have probably adorned a helmet of the Vendel Age type, common in Uppland (the only foreign examples being the Sutton Hoo and Staffordshire helmets). There were also finds of gold which probably had adorned a scramasax, but according to another interpretation, {{they were part of}} a belt. The dead was also given several <b>glass</b> <b>beakers,</b> a tafl game, a comb and a hone.|$|R

30|$|Batch {{adsorption}} {{reactions were}} done in Borosil <b>glass</b> <b>beakers</b> covered with foil paper to avoid photolytic reaction and were stirred on a magnetic stirrer (250  rpm) at room temperature. The standard concentration of malachite green was taken as 10  ppm, from which different aliquots {{of the sample was}} taken of the experiment. The concentration of malachite green before and after each experiment was determined by measuring the absorbance in visible region using UV–Vis absorption spectrophotometer. Different parameters like dosage effect and stirring time were studied. All the adsorption studies {{were done in}} neutral pH.|$|R

50|$|Disputes among Attila's sons {{caused the}} {{disintegration}} of his empire shortly {{after his death in}} 453. The Germanic peoples either regained their independence or left the Carpathian Basin (like the Heruli and the Sciri, respectively). Warriors' graves from the next century yielded large number of swords, spears, arrow heads, axes and other weapons. Other archaeological finds, including a <b>glass</b> <b>beaker</b> from Zohor, shows that the local inhabitants had close contacts with the Frankish Empire and Scandinavia.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 17th century, Lehmann adapted the {{techniques}} of using copper and bronze wheels to engrave gems to engrave glass. Though both intaglio (Tiefschnitt, “deep cut”) and high relief (Hochschnitt, “high cut”) engraving on glass had been practiced since ancient times, Lehmann was the earliest modern glass engraver to develop an advanced technique and a personal style. His earliest dated work is a <b>glass</b> <b>beaker,</b> dated 1605. In 1609, he received an exclusive privilege from Emperor Rudolf II in Prague for engraving glass.|$|E

50|$|A {{few of his}} flower pieces only {{depict a}} single variety of flowers such as carnations, {{but most of the}} time he painted a mixture of a {{restricted}} number of blooms in which tulips dominate. The flowers are typically set against a dark background and are held in simple clear <b>glass</b> <b>beakers</b> with prunts in the lower register only, in order to allow the stems of each flower to be followed through to the base. His flower pieces show a greater formal elegance and refined simplicity than Brueghel's usually more elaborate flower pieces. This may possibly be due to Bosschaert's formative influence.|$|R

Then he gave the king a little hanger, and a belt to wear it by his side; and showed him how to buckle it on and take it off, and how to draw it out, and put it in again.|$|R
