In that case, there are usually two main ways to compute a given (dis) similarity measure M between two genomes G 1 and G 2 : the rst model, that we will call the matching model, consists in making a one-to-one correspondence between genes of G 1 and genes of G 2, {{in such a way that}} M is optimized. The second model, called the exemplar model, consists in keeping in G 1 (resp. G 2) exactly one copy of each gene, thus deleting all the other copies, in such a way that M is optimized. We present here dierent results concerning the algorithmic complexity of computing three dierent similarity measures (number of common intervals, MAD <b>number</b> and <b>SAD</b> <b>number)</b> in those two models, basically showing that the problem becomes NP-complete for each of them as soon as genomes contain duplicates.

Dentro de esta coyuntura, el presente trabajo de revisión {{conceptual}} intenta proveer un nuevo modelo para comprender el fenómeno. La violencia no solo es un motor de cambio entre los agentes sociales que mantienen los bordes de la identidad, sino que se articula o desarticula hacia fuera en tanto se pueden establecer pactos de hospitalidad (amistad) entre las hinchadas. No obstante, lejos de desaparecer, la violencia se canaliza hacia dentro del club. Por el contrario, aquellas hinchadas que no celebran pactos de amistad, disminuyen la violencia dentro de sus filas pero la exteriorizan. Al ser un deporte nacido de la lucha bélica, el futbol está condenado a la violencia. | Given {{the tragic}} and <b>sad</b> <b>numbers</b> of the killed persons in Argentina resulted from clashes {{and acts of}} hooliganism, the present paper explores {{not only in the}} nature of violence, a point well and widely debated in the media, but also in the State inefficiency to eradicate the problem.

Violence not only is a key factor to promote the solidarity among citizens, but also keep the borders of community and its sense of security. Our thesis is that those hooligans who celebrate hospitality with others are penchant to exert violence inner wards while the violence does not disappear, but she is re-channelled towards the boundaries. The lack of hospitality reduces the internal violence but increase the hostility beyond the limits of community.

Material and Methods: The investigation was carried out during over a 3 -year period (from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009) in the area of Novi <b>Sad.</b> The <b>number</b> (N = 10 469) of daily CVD (ICD- 10 : I 00 -I 99) hospital admissions was collected according to patients' addresses. Daily mean levels of NO 2 and SO 2, measured in the ambient air of Novi Sad via a network of fixed samplers, have been used to put forward outdoor air pollution. Associations between air pollutants and hospital admissions were firstly analyzed by the use of the linear regression in a single polluted model, and then trough a single and multi-polluted adjusted generalized linear Poisson model. Results: The single polluted model (without confounding factors) indicated that there was a linear increase in the number of hospital admissions due to CVD in relation to the linear increase in concentrations of SO 2 (p = 0. 015; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 0. 144 - 1. 329, R 2 = 0. 005) and NO 2 (p = 0. 007; 95 % CI: 0. 214 - 1. 361, R 2 = 0. 007).

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how metrics of {{biodiversity}} and abundance scale in ecologically disturbed and disrupted systems. Natural disturbances have {{a fundamental role in}} structuring ecological communities, and the study of these processes and extension to novel ecological disruptions is of increasing importance due to global change and mounting human impacts. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of natural disturbance in determining basic ecological properties of an ecosystem, including species diversity, membership, and relative abundances of those species, as well as overall productivity. Although estimating ecological metrics at both the species and community level is of critical importance to conservation goals, predicting the impacts of disturbance and disruption, including anthropogenic changes, on ecosystems is a major problem for ecological theory for several reasons. Disturbances are diverse in type, create patches that are internally heterogeneous, interact with site-specific disturbance legacies, and have different effects over multiple spatial and temporal scales. In contrast, empirical studies providing the basis for development of models tend to focus on short time-scales and relatively homogeneous systems with steady-state dynamics. Sites that experience single disturbances or are part of disturbance regimes also pose a challenge to ecological theory because they represent open, non-equilibrium systems that are not tractable with equilibrium mathematics. Additionally, the spatial scale at which a disturbance is studied will affect the conclusions that are drawn about communities or their component species. Nevertheless, the ubiquity and importance of disturbance to ecosystems continues to motivate a search for generality in disturbance and landscape ecology. In this dissertation, I apply an information entropy based theory of macroecology to ecosystems in transition, or have otherwise experienced ecological disruption. This leads to comparable results between systems, and forms a basis for cross-system comparisons of ecosystems in transition. The maximum information entropy inference procedure (MaxEnt) has been proven to produce the least-biased estimates of a probability distribution, given prior knowledge of a system. Empirical values make up the prior knowledge of the system, and constrain the mean, variance, or higher moments of a given distribution. An extension of the MaxEnt procedure, the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) takes a macroecological approach to estimating plot- to landscape- to biome-scale species diversity, abundance, and energetics metrics, using only the relationships between four non-adjustable state variables S 0 (total species), A 0 (area under consideration), N 0 (total abundance), and E 0 (total metabolic energy), and no adjustable parameters to characterize the scaling of diversity and abundances of species in a system. Until this work, METE has mainly been tested in steady-state and minimally disturbed systems. In Chapter 1, “Disturbance macroecology: a comparative study of plant species’ abundances and distributions in different-age post-fire stands of Bishop pine (Pinus muricata),” I investigate how metrics of biodiversity and abundance are scale in a plant community that is largely structured by a dominant, disturbance-dependent species. We target two different-aged stands in a region of high wildfire activity, one a characteristically mature stand with a diverse understory, and one more recently disturbed by a stand-replacing fire 17 years previously. We compare the stands using various macroecological metrics of species richness, abundance and spatial distributions that are predicted by METE, which does not rely on steady-state or equilibrium assumptions, and is therefore well-suited to be a null model for ecosystems in transitional states. Ecological patterns in the mature stand more closely match METE predictions than do data from the more recently disturbed stand. This suggests METE’s predictions are more robust in late successional, slowly changing, or steady-state systems than those in rapid flux with respect to species composition, abundances, and body sizes. These findings highlight the need for a macroecological theory that incorporates natural disturbance and other ecological perturbations into its predictive capabilities, because most natural systems are not in a steady state. In Chapter 2, “Macroecology for management: Testing an information-entropy-based theory of macroecology against anthropogenic disruption of high-Sierra meadows, I investigate the extent to which anthropogenic changes to an ecosystem, in the form of grazing by large, introduced herbivores, are detectable using METE, and small (< 1 ha) replicate census plots. Anthropogenically-induced ecological disruptions (anthropogenic disruptions) have been overlooked by macroecological theory because they represent ecosystems in various states of transition that result from non-natural selection on the community. While critically important to understand for conservation reasons, anthropogenic disruptions are, in general, not comparable to each other, nor to other ecological disturbances that are natural in origin. Here, we use METE {{to examine the effects of}} an anthropogenically-induced novel disturbance regime of grazing by horses in high Sierra Nevada meadows on the species-abundance distributions (<b>SAD),</b> <b>number</b> of singleton species, and the species-level spatial abundance distributions (SSADs) (a measure of spatial aggregation) for all species in three pairs of grazed and ungrazed meadows, each meadow containing a system of plots set up across a moisture gradient. We find that number of singleton species may be a better indicator of ecological disruption than the shape of the SAD in systems where the differences in community structure are subtle. We also find that the METE SSAD performs better than all other models tested for both grazed and ungrazed plots. We suggest ways of augmenting tests of the METE SSAD to refine theory for management relevance. In Chapter 3, “Empirical tests of within- and across-species energetics in a diverse plant community,” I (with my coauthors) test the metabolic predictions of METE for herbaceous plants in a subalpine meadow. METE is an extremely general macroecological theory that predicts spatial, abundance and metabolic rate distributions of species, and the interrelationships of these metrics for any system defined by a set of basic community state variables. It therefore also predicts body-size distributions if a metabolic scaling relationship between metabolism and body size is assumed. Many fundamental properties of ecological systems and interactions are tied to body size, and a related metric, the metabolic rate distribution, both within and across species. Extensive tests of METE’s macroecological predictions in multiple ecosystems and with multiple taxa generally support its species diversity and abundance predictions, but two related predictions had not been evaluated against full community census data until this study: the distribution of metabolic rates of individuals within species as a function of the abundance of the species, and the distribution of average individual metabolic rates across species. We show that while METE realistically predicts the distribution of individual metabolic rates across the entire community, the within and across species predictions generally fail. We also test the energy-equivalence type prediction that arises as a consequence of the prediction for the distribution of average individual metabolic rates across species. We suggest several possible explanations for the empirical deviations from theory, and distinguish between the expected deviations caused by ecological disturbance and those deviations that might be corrected within the theory. Taken together, these results indicate that it is possible to extend macroecological theory to ecosystems that experience natural disturbances and other ecological disruptions. Because we find that there are regular empirical deviations from theory in ecosystems that have experienced some sort of disturbance, we can conclude that the values and ratios of the four state variables (A 0, S 0, N 0 and E 0) used by METE are not sufficient to describe the dynamics of real ecosystems. These regular deviations, however, are interesting in their own right, because they suggest where ecological processes may influence the shape of empirical macroecological distributions. This will provide a framework for comparing and eventually predicting the various effects of disturbance on biodiversity, in the contexts of disturbance regimes, anthropogenic change, and mixtures of both...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - PhD (Clinical Psychology) The {{overarching}} aim of {{this research}} was to ascertain why it is that individuals with bipolar affective disorder (BAD) sometimes have depressive episodes and at other times have manic episodes. Most of the existing research has considered the disorder in its entirety without considering the two poles of the disorder separately. Studies of cognitive styles among euthymic people with bipolar affective disorder (BAD) without use of mood induction (MI) techniques to access those cognitive styles give misleading impressions of the normality of those cognitions. The aim of the first study was to assess dysfunctional attitudes of participants with BAD, and control participants with no previous psychiatric histories, after mood inductions (MIs). Sad and happy moods were induced within 49 individuals with BAD and 37 healthy controls. Dysfunctional attitudes were measured following MIs using the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale – short form (DAS- 24) which has three subscales of achievement, interpersonal, and goal attainment. It was hypothesized that within individuals with BAD the sad MI would help in accessing dysfunctional attitudes in all three domains relative to the happy MI. This was supported. It was also hypothesized that the MIs would not affect dysfunctional attitudes within controls. This was also supported. When diagnosis was entered as a between group variable, achievement dysfunctional attitudes were significantly higher in individuals with BAD compared to controls after a happy induction. Both sad and happy moods provoked higher levels of dysfunctional attitudes within individuals with BAD. Euphoria may be related to elevated achievement dysfunctional attitudes, raising the risk for mania. The aim of the second study was to investigate the congruency hypothesis, that exacerbations in manic and depressive symptoms are a function of the interaction of interpersonal or achievement dysfunctional attitudes with life events in congruent domains. The same 49 individuals with bipolar I (n = 40) and bipolar II (n = 9) disorders participated in a longitudinal study of life events, using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS; Brown & Harris, 1978). Data were obtained for 44 of the 49 individuals. LEDS was conducted at 6 and 12 -months. Mixed models analysis with autoregressive correlation (AR 1) was used. Internal State Scale (ISS) activation (ACT) score assessed monthly was the dependent variable; DAS- 24 achievement dysfunctional attitudes and number of achievement life events were the independent variables. We hypothesized that after a happy mood induction, achievement dysfunctional attitudes in interaction with achievement life events would predict manic symptom increases (e. g., Lozano & Johnson, 2001; Scott & Pope, 2003). In support of our hypothesis we found, when predicting ACT, achievement DAS after happy induction in interaction with achievement life events lagging three months before the activation month, showed significant effects after inclusion of baseline ACT and medication compliance. At high levels of DAS achievement after happy induction, as the number of achievement life events lagging 3 months from the activation month increased, so did activation. This supported the congruency hypothesis. Further, we hypothesized that interpersonal dysfunctional attitudes, after a sad mood induction, would interact with interpersonal life events to predict manic symptom increases. Interpersonal DAS after sad induction in interaction with interpersonal life events lagging one month before the activation month showed significant effects when predicting ACT, after inclusion of baseline ACT and medication compliance. At high levels of interpersonal DAS after sad induction, as the number of negative interpersonal life events increased, so did ACT scores as predicted by congruency hypothesis. We also hypothesized that interpersonal DAS after sad induction would interact with interpersonal life events which would predict depressive symptoms. This hypothesis was not supported. Unexpectedly though, the interaction of interpersonal DAS after <b>sad</b> induction and <b>number</b> of achievement life events lagging one month from the BDI score was significant after inclusion of baseline BDI and compliance with medications. At high levels of interpersonal DAS after sad induction, as the number of negative achievement events increased, the BDI score decreased. The events however were non-congruent with the DAS. The results are discussed in light of theory, analyses employed and mood induction. We further compared individuals with BAD and a healthy control group on Rosenberg’s (1965) self-esteem scale and a measure of instability of self-esteem. It was found that individuals with BAD had lower self-esteem on Rosenberg’s positive, negative and total self-esteem scales than the healthy control group. In addition, on positive, negative and total SE instability, individuals with BAD had higher self-esteem instability score than the healthy control group. We then tested the buffering hypothesis of self-esteem. That is, self-esteem would buffer the individual against occurrence of life events. We found support for the buffering hypothesis, as individuals with high self-esteem, after experiencing negative life events in the interpersonal domain, had lower levels of BDI and ACT scores. In contrast individuals with low self-esteem had higher levels of BDI and ACT scores, after occurrence of interpersonal life events. More specifically, the number of negative events in the interpersonal domain was predictive of BDI scores in low self-esteem individuals. However, {{it was found that the}} long-term threat posed by negative interpersonal events, predicted ACT scores in low self-esteem individuals. Also, individuals with low self-esteem instability tended to respond to life events with increased depressive and manic symptoms as opposed to individuals with high SE instability. The results concerning self-esteem instability were contrary to expectations. We suggested that the interactive effect of trait self-esteem and self-esteem instability might provide reasons for the current results. In the last study, it was hypothesised that high social rhythm disruptive (SRD) life events would increase manic and depressive symptoms of the disorder through disruption of social rhythms as proposed by Ehlers et al. (1988). We did not directly test the above hypothesis. However, we found that maximum SRD interacted with the number of interpersonal events at Lag 3 months to predict BDI such that at higher levels of maximum SRD, once the number of interpersonal events at Lag 3 months increased, BDI score increased. Similarly, maximum SRD interacted with long-term threat for interpersonal events at Lag 4 months to predict ACT, such that at higher levels of maximum SRD, as the long-term threat for interpersonal events at Lag 4 months increased, the ACT score increased. Also, maximum SRD interacted with long-term threat for achievement events at Lag 4 months to predict ACT such that at high levels of maximum SRD, as long-term threat for achievement events at Lag 4 months increased the ACT score increased. The above results were aligned with predictions. However, we also found that at high levels of maximum SRD, as the long-term threat for achievement events at Lag 2 months increased, ACT score decreased, contrary to predictions. In light of the findings of this study, the theory of social rhythms may need to be modified to account for the interaction of SRD with achievement and interpersonal life events to cause symptom exacerbations in mania and depression. This research has contributed to an explanation why individuals with bipolar disorder have manic episodes at some times and depressive episodes at other times. A combination of variables, such as level of self-esteem, instability of self-esteem, dysfunctional attitudes, SRD, achievement and interpersonal life event occurrences, and participants’ mood at the time of event occurrence, decides whether an individual will have depressive or manic episodes...|$|R
