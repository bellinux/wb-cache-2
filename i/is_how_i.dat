500|$|Much of Dignity {{was written}} in Duff's own home, as she felt [...] "comfortable and free" [...] there. She said that she knew from the {{beginning}} that she wanted to write the album with the assistance of songwriter and producer Kara DioGuardi, due to their previous work history on songs such as [...] "Come Clean" [...] and [...] "Fly". Another reason that Duff wished to work with her was that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies. She added, [...] "I helped with the melodies, but that's not my strongest suit.

[...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through.

500|$|As he {{had worked}} with Sellers, he also came to know Spike Milligan, with whom he became a firm friend, and best man at Milligan's second marriage: [...] "I loved The Goon Show, and issued an album of it on my label Parlophone, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> got to know Spike." [...] The album was Bridge on the River Wye. It was a spoof of the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, being based on the 1957 Goon Show episode [...] "An African Incident." [...] It was {{intended}} {{to have the same}} name as the film, but shortly before its release, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Martin edited out the 'K' every time the word Kwai was spoken, with Bridge on the River Wye being the result. The River Wye is a river that runs through England and Wales. The album featured Milligan, Sellers, Jonathan Miller, and Peter Cook, playing various characters.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Smile" [...] {{are taken from}} a note that Dennis Flemion of The Frogs hid inside Vedder's {{notebook}} while he was onstage performing. The words used in the note are taken from the Frogs songs [...] "This <b>Is</b> <b>How</b> <b>I</b> Feel" [...] and [...] "Now I Wanna Be Dead". Flemion is given credit in the vinyl, but the credit is absent from the CD version. The lyrics to [...] "Red Mosquito" [...] were inspired by the events surrounding Pearl Jam's June 24, 1995 concert at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, which happened {{on the same day}} Vedder was hospitalized due to food poisoning. Vedder only made it through seven songs and the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of the short tour that it was on. For the first time on a Pearl Jam album a band member other than Vedder contributed lyrics, with Gossard writing the lyrics to [...] "Mankind". Gossard also sang lead vocals on the track.|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Pascu {{experienced}} {{his first}} significant success in music with the album Mixed Grill {{and the single}} [...] "Ţara arde şi babele se piaptănă" [...] ("The Country Is Burning and Old Women Are Combing Their Hair", referencing a Romanian proverb). A poll conducted by the journal Evenimentul Zilei nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nationwide station Radio Contact awarded Pascu its [...] "Composer of the Year" [...] title. Mixed Grill marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. [...] Hits such as [...] "Gizzi" [...] and [...] "Mi-am luat colac" [...] ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider {{him one of the}} pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like El Negro and Pacha Man. The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: [...] "When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits me, that this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> write. I won't stick to any one musical genre." [...] In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the harmonica.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions between West and Brion {{were largely}} exploratory, {{with the two}} experimenting with {{a broad spectrum of}} sounds. West would construct a song's basic structure, bringing in samples, drum beat programming and occasionally unfinished rap verses. After brainstorming over the musical direction the album could go, he would then select from a variety of unique instruments that Brion provided (and played) and attempt to incorporate their distinctive sound into the song's texture. West envisioned the album as like the creation of a film: visualizing the songs as scenes, outlining each {{in such a way that}} they efficiently conveyed their respective social or introspective context, and ensuring that all synchronized within the fabric of the complete set. This sentiment was shared by Jon Brion who said, [...] "He thinks in frequency ranges. I can recognize when someone sees music architecturally, which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> work. I see it as a spatial thing: left to right, front to back, up and down. It's animated and it's moving in real time. Kanye has that. He tries things out until it fits, until it sits where it is supposed to sit and everything has the correct emotional function. He has real instincts like any great record-maker." ...|$|E
500|$|Four singles were {{released}} from the album: [...] "Welcome to the Black Parade", [...] "Famous Last Words", [...] "I Don't Love You", and [...] "Teenagers". The Black Parade has received generally favorable reviews, and the band achieved its first number one single in the United Kingdom with [...] "Welcome to the Black Parade". The album debuted at number two on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart and is also certified as Platinum by the RIAA, {{as well as a}} Platinum certification in the United Kingdom and Gold certifications in both Argentina (by the CAPIF) and Chile (by the IFPI Chile). The Black Parade was given the Platinum Europe Award by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for 1 million sales in Europe. The limited edition boxed set also earned My Chemical Romance a Grammy Award nomination. In the video game Guitar Hero II (Xbox 360 version), the song [...] "Dead!" [...] was added to the game's track list prior to the earlier PlayStation 2 version, and the three songs [...] "Teenagers," [...] "Famous Last Words" [...] and [...] "This <b>Is</b> <b>How</b> <b>I</b> Disappear" [...] are available for download. The Black Parade has sold two million copies in the United States as of 2016, and three million worldwide. The record was reissued as a 10th Anniversary Edition on September 23, 2016 in celebration of the album's release.|$|E

Kelly confesses she went to juvenile detention in Berks County, Pennsylvania, at age 14 for doing something [...] "like Thelma & Louise, but with a boat", a reference to the 1991 road movie starring Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon on the run from their troubled, caged lives. Jim said during a birthday trip to a museum at age seven, his father bought him a plastic toy triceratops, a three-horned dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period, which Dwight insists is not a good dinosaur. Pam remembers the name of one audience member by comparing her to k.d. lang, the Canadian singer known for her extremely short hair.|$|E
