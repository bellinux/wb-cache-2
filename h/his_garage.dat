5|$|Bo Randall {{first became}} {{interested}} in making knives after he purchased a Bill Scagel knife that was being used to scrape paint off of a boat without showing any signs of wear or damage. He made his first knife in <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> at Lake Ivanhoe, Florida using an auto spring.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Force India {{committed}} {{an error}} when bringing their drivers in early. Liuzzi {{made contact with}} Sutil which damaged his front wing. The team had been expecting Liuzzi to pit before Sutil, but the latter {{was the first to}} arrive into the team's pit stall. It was only after both drivers had returned to the circuit that the team realised they had accidentally placed Liuzzi's tyres on Sutil's car and Sutil's tyres on Liuzzi's. Buemi was pushed back into <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> and became the race's first retirement with accident damage on the second lap. Hamilton was running close behind Vettel but despite his car's straight-line speed advantage, he was unable to affect an overtaking manoeuvre. Hamilton later dropped further away from Vettel. Trulli became afflicted with an gearbox issue which meant he was unable to select second gear, and his mechanics pushed his Lotus T127 back into <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> where they attempted to rectify the issue without success. Alonso recorded lap times faster than teammate Massa which reduced the gap to 1.1 seconds by the conclusion of lap six. Trulli was released from <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> by his team but drove slowly around the circuit and elected to retire on the next lap.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his 37th lap Bernhard {{reported}} a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris. He had difficulty turning into the track's right-hand turns and fell to fourth place behind di Grassi and Tréluyer. The tyre degraded further which damaged his car's bodywork, but he cautiously returned to the pit lane for a replacement front nose, and Webber took over his position. Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's tyre carcass which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> for ten-minute bodywork repairs. Then his front-axle energy retrieval system was changed, forcing Webber to remain in <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, kept the lead after the pit stops. The first full course caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car flipped over but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E

5|$|Between 1959 and 1962, Balabushka {{handcrafted}} between 20 and 30 cues {{per year}} on a part-time basis. Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of his product, Balabushka's name quickly became known amongst professional players. By the end of 1962, Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he could fill given his time constraints. Balabushka accordingly sold {{his interest in the}} pool room, converted <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> into a carpentry shop, and by 1964 was building cues full-time, while continuing to hone his cuemaking abilities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1958, nearing his 37th birthday, Lindwall stepped up his bid to reclaim his Test place. He {{committed}} him to an intense fitness program that included a 5km daily run followed by vigorous exercises to increase his abdominal and back strength. He set up equipment in <b>his</b> <b>garage.</b> Lindwall was determined to add to his Test tally of 212 wickets, which was just four behind the Australian record of Clarrie Grimmett. He was unmoved by a 6000-pound offer from an English newspaper to cover the 1958–59 Ashes series as a journalist, instead wanting {{to play in the}} series.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{managed to}} recover from his morning trouble to post the fourth fastest time in the second Practice Session on Friday afternoon. The Ferraris were still leading, but Massa was fastest, just 0.035 seconds ahead of Räikkönen. However, {{one of the major}} surprises came from Scuderia Toro Rosso, as Scott Speed posted the third quickest time, with Vitantonio Liuzzi posting the fifth quickest time. During the session, Liuzzi was {{involved}} in a bizarre incident with Anthony Davidson; Davidson exited <b>his</b> <b>garage,</b> and smashed his Super Aguri into the side of Liuzzi's Toro Rosso; knocking his front wing off in the accident. Alonso finished the second practice session eighth.|$|E

Epstein was able to renegotiate a more {{favourable}} commission of 49% in August 1964, but then became embroiled in a three-year court battle with Byrne regarding payment of monies due, during which time potential sponsors lost interest. In August 1967 Epstein died, from what was ruled an accidental overdose of a prescribed drug. Jacobs was found hanged in <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> on 15 December 1968. Byrne later retired to the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|Massa {{was slow}} to {{accelerate}} leaving the turn six hairpin on lap 49, giving Alonso the opening he needed to take the lead. Smedley was later heard apologising to Massa over the radio. De La Rosa made his one and only pit stop of the event for super-soft compound tyres on lap 51. Di Grassi, at turn one on the same lap, hit a kerb damaging his car's rear suspension, which meant {{it was not possible}} for him to continue competing in the race. He was pushed into <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> by his team to retire. Vettel placed pressure on Massa by setting consecutive fastest laps to reduce the time gap between them. Petrov was on course to score one point but was told by his team to shift early into seventh gear on lap 58 otherwise his maximum revolutions per minute would be changed to a lower setting. De La Rosa attempted to lap Kovalainen around the inside of the second corner on the 60th lap but the two cars made contact. De La Rosa sustained damage to a section of his front wing while Kovalainen drove to <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> and got out of his car to become the race's fifth (and final) retirement on lap 61.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{moved up}} a {{position}} as he passed Button for fifth position at turn three on the same lap. On lap twenty-eight, Trulli drove back to <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> to retire with a hydraulics failure that was caused by his power steering becoming heavy during the safety car period. Vettel set a new fastest lap of the race of 1:54.098, extending his lead over Alonso to 3.5 seconds. Button, who was under pressure from Hülkenberg and Kubica, made a pit stop {{at the end of}} lap twenty-eight for intermediate tyres and rejoined in fifteenth place. Kovalainen was sent into a spin by Buemi, having been passed by Petrov two laps later.|$|E

5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into <b>his</b> <b>garage</b> with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
