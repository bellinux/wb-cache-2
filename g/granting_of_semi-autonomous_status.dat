50|$|The entire {{territory}} of modern-day Croatia {{was part of}} Austria-Hungary during World War I. Its territory was administratively divided between the Austrian and Hungarian parts of the empire; Međimurje and Baranja were in the Hungarian part (Transleithania), the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia was a separate semi-autonomous entity formally {{under the jurisdiction of}} Hungary, Dalmatia and Istria were in the Austrian part (Cisleithania), while the town <b>of</b> Rijeka had <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>status.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because <b>of</b> its <b>semi-autonomous</b> <b>status</b> as {{a county}} palatine, Durham {{had not been}} {{represented}} in Parliament during the medieval period; by the 17th century {{it was the only}} part of England which elected no MPs. In 1621, Parliament passed a bill to enfranchise the county, but James I refused it the royal assent, as he considered that the House of Commons already had too many members and that some decayed boroughs should be abolished first; a similar bill in 1624 failed to pass the House of Lords. During the Commonwealth, County Durham was allowed to send members to the First and Second Parliaments of the Protectorate, though the privilege was not maintained when Parliament reverted to its earlier electoral arrangements from 1658. After the Restoration, Durham's right to return MPs was recognised in 1661, and finally confirmed by statute which came into effect in 1675; the county was to return two members, and the same Act also established Durham City as a parliamentary borough with its own two members.|$|R

50|$|At {{first the}} princes and other conservatives {{successfully}} resisted the king's reform agenda, {{but as the}} older generation was replaced by younger and western-educated princes, resistance faded.

In 1887 Devrawonge visited Europe to study government systems. On his recommendation the king established Cabinet government, an audit office and an education department.
