40|$|To {{pass the}} examination, the most {{important}} thing to be considered by the students is the examination preparation. There are so many kinds of examination faced by the students, one of it is national examination. Therefore, the national examination should be prepared well by the students, school, and parents since it is a tool to measure students competency of achievement which held by education unit in order to obtain learning confession and it is a requirement of finishing education level. This research is aimed to describe and differentiate the preparation of students with <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> achievement and the students with low learning achievement in facing national examination. This is a comparative quantitative descriptive approach supported with interview. The target of the research is students of SMA Adabiah Padang, with 327 students as the population. There are 80 students placed as sample. The research finding reveals that (1) physical preparation of students with <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> achievement and the students with low learning achievement in facing national examination is in well prepared category (2) psychology preparation for both students with <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> achievement and the students with low learning achievement is in well prepared category, (3) the preparation in mastering the learning material for both students with <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> achievement and the students with low learning achievement is in well prepared category,(4) the analysis of t test result reveals that there is a significant difference between students with <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> achievement and the students with low learning achievement of SMA Adabiah Padang.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine the effect of learning models on mathematics achievement viewed from student 2 ̆ 7 s leraning activity. The learning models compared were TAI with scientific approach, PBL with scientific approach, and classical with scientific approach. This experiment was quasi-experimental. It uses 3 x 3 factorial planning. The population was the entire 8 th grade students of State Junior high School in Grobogan regency in the academic year 2014 / 2015. The sampling technique used was stratified cluster random sampling. The sample consisted of students of SMP N 2 Tegowanu, SMP N 3 Godong and SMP N 5 Purwodadi. Data collection instruments used were learning achievement test and student learning activity questionnaire. Hypothesis examination used was variance analysis (anava) with unequal cell. Conclusions acquired from this thesis are as follows: 1) PBL using scientific approach gives better mathematics learning achievement compared to TAI and classical Learning, TAI using scientific approach gives better mathematics learning achievement compared to classical learning. 2) student 2 ̆ 7 s mathematics achievement with <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> activity is better than those with intermediate and poor learning activity, intermediate learning activity is better than those with poor learning activity. 3) on TAI using scientific approach, student 2 ̆ 7 s mathematics achievement with <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> activity is as good as those with intermediate <b>learning</b> activity, <b>high</b> <b>learning</b> activity is better than those with poor learning activity, and intermediate learning activity is good as those with poor learning activity.

For students with intermediate learning activity; TAI, PBL and classical learning gives the same good result. For students with poor learning activity; TAI, PBL and classical learning gives the same good result on student 2 ̆ 7 s learning achievement.
