5|$|The High Courts are the {{principal}} civil courts of original <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> each state and union territory. However, a High Court exercises its original civil and criminal jurisdiction only if the subordinate courts are not authorized by law to try such matters for lack of pecuniary, territorial jurisdiction. High courts may also enjoy original <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> certain matters if so designated specifically in a state or federal law.|$|E
5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that supplies and communication {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|E

After his death an anti-Byzantine uprising led by four brothers broke out. One of the brothers, David, was killed by Vlachs in the present-day border region between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. In 1018, the Byzantines conquered the whole territory of the Bulgarian Empire and the Archbishop of Ohrid acquired ecclesiastic <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> 1020 over the Vlachs living there.|$|E
5|$|During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general appellate <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> {{criminal}} cases.

The Court could hear original habeas petitions, but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post-conviction unless the sentence had already been completed. Thus, {{the majority of the}} Marshall Court's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division.|$|E

The Grand Lodge of Scotland and Grand Lodge of Ireland (taken together) have approximately 150,000 members. In the United States, total membership is just under two million.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, in a {{district}} court case, Deady {{ruled in favor of}} Marcus Neff in a lawsuit against Sylvester Pennoyer concerning unpaid legal fees to John H. Mitchell and a sheriff's auction of Neff's land to Pennoyer. The case would become the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of Pennoyer v.

Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, several state {{highways}} concurrent with US 322 were removed, including Route S44, Route 51, Route 42, Route 48, and Route 55.

However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban.

5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
