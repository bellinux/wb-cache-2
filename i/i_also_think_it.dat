The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.8, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.8 percent of all television-equipped {{households}}, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very well. I think it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for. Mulder and Scully do not solve the case, and that is something I had been interested in doing for some time."

My listeners come {{to me to be}} entertained but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> critical to bond with them in a personal way. It's okay for them to know who I am - challenges and all." ...|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} This Addiction, Skiba {{expressed a}} desire to return to the band's punk rock roots: [...] "That's how we started as a band, and over the years I think we evolved into kind of more of a rock band with punk roots." [...] Elaborating on the album's sound in a November 2009 interview, he called it [...] "a rock record but our punk rock upbringing definitely shines through, more so than our last few records. The vibe is similar to our humble beginnings. It's a step forward but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has glimmers of our past in it." [...] He also described the album as more straightforward, with a [...] "less is more" [...] approach that included reducing the number of guitar overdubs, with many of the songs including only one guitar track: [...] "We wanted a record that we could easily play live. For the most part, it's pretty bare bones while still sounding full and big." [...] The album does, however, include some synthesizer as well as a trumpet solo in the style of Neutral Milk Hotel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{industry}} {{has been accused of}} making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only can be treated through bio-medical procedures, but should be treated by them. Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr Sami David, a fertility specialist and one of the pioneers of {{the early days of the}} IVF treatments, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: [...] "It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort. [...] Now it's a first resort. [...] I think that's an injustice to women. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> can harm women in the long run." [...] IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to ‘sell’ corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the ‘healthy’ or ‘normal’ body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring.|$|E
2500|$|The lead single, had an on air, on sale release, Roberts {{stated that}} Universal Records wanted {{to release the}} track that way, {{as it was the}} way they were {{releasing}} all of their new work. The release of this nature, was due to illegal downloading, and the record label was attempting to avoid illegal downloads as much as possible as Roberts stated, [...] "it's now harder for artists". Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's always been about the chart position. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> takes the excitement out of the charts because it's not a competition anymore." [...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes. Roberts performed at G-A-Y, after rehearsing the entire day prior to the event during which time she changed her set-list around, performing the track [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime" [...] with a drum and bass edit, in addition to performing a remix of her single [...] "Lucky Day". For the performance Roberts wore five-foot hair extensions that touched the ground, which proved restricting for her movements, in addition to wearing shorts with [...] "big pompoms on the back". Writing as a guest blogger for site Holy Moly, Roberts discussed the event saying [...] "the crowd was incredible. I had to take my in-ears out because they were so loud I thought, ‘They’re gonna deafen me and I’m not gonna {{be able to do the}} rest of my set’. I was so taken aback, it was amazing. Such a good atmosphere; everyone wanted to have a good time".|$|E

She does not believe in life-after-death, urging that we should remember death and remember that it's the end.

I am glad he has done this. I love the sentiments of those old-time men, and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions. He shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break off from Great Britain, and set up a new government for themselves, several of the States instructed their delegates to go for the measure, provided each State should be allowed to regulate its domestic concerns in its own way. I do not quote; but this in substance. This was right; I see nothing objectionable in it. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> probable that it had some reference to the existence of slavery among them. I will not deny that it had. But had it any reference to the carrying of slavery into new countries? That is the question, and we will let the fathers themselves answer it.|$|E
6000|$|... 115. (11th April.) I was {{interrupted}} yesterday, and I am glad of it, for here happens just {{an instance of}} the way in which the unjust distribution of the burden of charity is reflected on general interests; I cannot help what taint of ungracefulness you or other readers of these letters may feel that I incur, in speaking, in this instance, of myself. If I could speak with the same accurate knowledge of any one else, most gladly I would; but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> right that, whether people accuse me of boasting or not, they should know that I practise what I preach. I had not intended to say what I now shall, but the coming of this letter last night just turns the balance of the decision with me. I enclose it with the other; you see it is one from my bookseller, Mr. Quaritch, offering me Fischer's work on the Flora of Java, and Latour's on Indian Orchidaceæ, bound together, for twenty guineas. Now, I am writing a book on botany just now, for young people, chiefly on wild flowers, and I want these two books very much; but I simply cannot afford to buy them, because I sent my last spare twenty guineas to Mr. Shields yesterday for this widow. And though you may think it not the affair of the public that I have not this book on Indian flowers, it is their affair finally, that what I write for them should be founded on as broad knowledge as possible; whatever value my own book may or may not have, it will just be in a given degree worth less to them, because of my want of this knowledge.|$|E

500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy {{felt the}} video was unique and commented that [...] "There aren't many popstars {{who could make}} a video {{featuring}} doves, balloons, a galloping horse, a giant inflatable elephant and a mass grope-fest {{in the middle of}} LA... {{and get away with it}} [...]" [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly complimented its sexuality and said that the video could [...] "best described as either a makeout flash mob, a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade gone wild, or some serious [...] "the touch, the feel of cotton" [...] guerrilla marketing." [...] MuuMuse-editor Bradley Stern praised the concept of the video as [...] "incredible" [...] and complimented the inclusion of the horse. Popjustice called the music video a [...] "lovely pervoramic pop moment." [...] Due to its sexual content and nature, the music video was censored and banned in numerous Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In an interview with Spanish television channel Cuatro, Minogue responded to the censorship and said: [...] "I <b>think,</b> yes, <b>it's</b> sexy but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> very touching and sensual and the message is love." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with trance sound she expressed of a tough childhood growing up as a classically trained musician and that pop music was banned {{from the house and}} only composers such as Beethoven, Chopin, Stravinsky and other classical giants were permitted as far as music was concerned. [...] "My parents really wanted me to become this world class performer the moment {{i was old enough to}} play the piano. Not a moment of rest was permitted when it came to music. I was forced to practise the piano and cello, enter competitions and win nearly weekly and if i so much as came second place, my parents would be hugely disappointed. They would enter me into every competition under the sun, whether it was for acting, poetry, music or anything else art related. It was a lot of pressure. But <b>i</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> the only reason i'm as obsessively driven and relentless with music as i am now. I'm determined to keep going regardless of the challenges".|$|R

In an interview with Radio Times in 2013, he stated: [...] "I think it's all about falling in love with the person and that is overlooked, really. I hate it when people 'confess' or 'reveal' their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> goes beyond that. You don't just fall in love with someone's body, do you?

In 2005, Sayles confirmed this to be an early draft of the script, intercepted through Spielberg's email by a hacker. In late August 2004, David Boreanaz was rumored and later reported to have the lead role. Boreanaz was actually in consideration for Fantastic Four. Sayles was still rewriting the script in September 2004, with the film on track for a winter 2005 release. Sayles' next draft, which involved genetically engineered human-dinosaur mercenaries, was scrapped.|$|E
5000|$|The {{release of}} the film was overshadowed {{somewhat}} by the huge success of Hammer's The Curse of Frankenstein, released the same year, {{and it was a}} relative financial failure, a fact Val Guest attributed to the intelligence of the script, saying, [...] "It was too subtle and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> had too much to say. No one was expecting films from Hammer that said anything but this one did… audiences didn't want that sort of thing from Hammer. This was the last film Hammer made in association with Robert L.

5000|$|Speaking to Kerrang! in 2008, band founder Tuomas Holopainen reminisced {{that the}} band got really ambitious after the debut album [...] "that {{was never meant}} to be {{released}} as a proper record. It happened almost by accident, so we decided to put everything into making Oceanborn great." [...] He added: We were all such amateurs when it came to recording. We didn't really know what we were doing, so we were just experimenting with a lot of different things, we even brought in this string trio who were complete shit, then another violin, then another violin on top. So we ended up with 'Moondance' having 20 tracks of violin, just because we hadn't done this before and didn't know what we were doing! It's a pretty stuffed album, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> one of our best because you can hear the excitement of trying all these new things. It seems strange that this became a breakthrough album, because back at the time the music was so funny. It was really operatic, {{and when you look at}} the pictures, they look pretty horrific. According to Kerrang!, [...] "for all its Royal Albert Hall grandiosity, Oceanborn was actually recorded in a Finnish school." ...|$|R
5000|$|Camus {{presents}} {{the reader with}} dualisms such as happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. He emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality; for Camus, this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In Le Mythe, dualism becomes a paradox: we value our own lives in spite of our mortality {{and in spite of}} the universe's silence. While we can live with a dualism (I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come), we cannot live with the paradox (I think my life is of great importance, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is meaningless). In Le Mythe, Camus investigates our experience of the Absurd and asks how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves? ...|$|E
