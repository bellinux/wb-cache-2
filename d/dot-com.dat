A money-losing company's lifespan was measured by its burn rate, {{the rate at which}} a non-profitable company lacking a viable business model spent its existing capital. Many <b>dot-coms</b> ran out of capital and were acquired or went through liquidation; the domain names were purchased by old-economy competitors, speculators or cybersquatters. Several companies and their executives were accused or convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders' money, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined top investment firms including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch millions of dollars for misleading investors.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} 21 ‘internet-specific strategies’ {{and the performance of}} internet-trading ventures. ‘Internet-specific strategies’ are defined as business strategies specifically relevant in the internet-trading context.

The results of a large survey of 406 internet ventures in the UK were quite controversial. Despite {{the fact that we have}} found statistically significant correlations between the majority of ‘internet-specific strategies’ and venture performance in at least one industrial sector, the coefficients were weak and the regression model proved statistically insignificant. This raises questions over the validity of practitioner-led theories about internet business. Business on the internet might be just business...|$|R
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of flexible exchange rate regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the <b>Dot-com</b> bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the <b>Dot-com</b> bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E
5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied <b>dot-com</b> boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E

Even so, the Bay Area's technology industry continued to expand and growth in Silicon Valley accelerated that the United States Census confirmed that year that San Jose had overtaken San Francisco in terms of population. The commercialization of the Internet {{in the middle}} of the decade rapidly created a speculative bubble in the high-tech economy known as the <b>Dot-com</b> bubble. This bubble began collapsing in the early 2000s and the industry continued contracting for the next few years, nearly wiping out the market.

We use the event-study methodology {{to assess the impact of}} 885 business model changes undertaken by 20 <b>dot-coms.</b> Combining the concept of business models with finegrained longitudinal data, we argue for the value of external indicators to management when engaging in internal change.
