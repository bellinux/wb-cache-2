50|$|Vibratory feeders, {{commonly}} known as a bowl feeder, are self-contained devices, consisting of a specially shaped bowl designed to orient the parts to a specific orientation. A vibrating drive unit, upon which the bowl is mounted and a variable-amplitude control box controls the bowl feeder. Usually included is an out feed accumulation track (linear or gravity) to convey parts along and discharge into the assembly machine comes in many shapes and sizes. The drive unit, available in both electromagnetic and pneumatic drives, vibrates the bowl, forcing the parts to move up a circular, inclined track. The tooling (hand made) is designed to sort and orient the parts in to a consistent, repeatable position. The track length, width, and depth are carefully chosen to suit each application, component shape and size. Special bowl and track coatings are applied according to shape size and material of the component which aids traction, damage to the product and lower acoustic levels. A variable speed control box is used for controlling the vibration speed of the bowl feeder, and can control the flow of parts to the out <b>feed</b> <b>track</b> via sensors.|$|E

In this process, parts that are at undesirable orientations are dropped into the resource area and sent back to the track.|$|E

40|$|Assembly {{automation}} is {{well established}} as hard automation in the manufacturing industry with proven economic advantages in mass production. Modern industries are adopting mass customization as a new strategy to handle the increasing diversity in customer demands. The main challenge is to produce an increasing variety of products with mass production efficiency. Conventional assembly tooling is not flexible enough to handle the product variations. Also the existing flexible assembly tooling usually operates at lower throughput rates. Hence new type of assembly tooling is needed to impart flexibility, while retaining the capability of high throughput rates. This research is aimed to redesign the existing part-feeders and <b>feed</b> <b>tracks</b> into modular, parametric tooling. An approach for developing the modular, parametric part-feeders is presented. Using this approach, some parametric nonvibratory feeders are designed and developed. Conceptual designs for modular, parametric gravity <b>feed</b> <b>tracks</b> are also presented...|$|R

40|$|One {{focus of}} this study was to detect local coherences between deep-sea benthic {{bacterial}} community patterns and an ice-edge related input of organic material (Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean) as well as physical disturbances (Ardencaple Canyon, Greenland Sea).

A further aim was to assess the local impact of small biogenic structures (Macrofaunal crawling and <b>feeding</b> <b>tracks,</b> burrows, plough traces, faeces, Tentorium semisuberites) on benthic bacterial communities by increasing microhabitat heterogeneity through the modification of near-bottom flows and hence deposition patterns in deep-sea surface sediments.

During dry months the feeding rate was greater than wet months. Physical analysis of faeces composition confirmed conclusions drawn from observations.

40|$|Because insect herbivores {{generally}} {{suffer from}} high mortality {{due to their}} natural enemies, {{reducing the risk of}} being located by natural enemies is of critical importance for them, forcing them to develop a variety of defensive measures. Larvae of leaf-mining insects lead a sedentary life inside a leaf and make conspicuous <b>feeding</b> <b>tracks</b> called mines, exposing themselves to the potential risk of parasitism. We investigated the defense strategy of the linear leafminer Ophiomyia maura Meigen (Diptera: Agromyzidae), by focusing on its mining patterns. We examined whether the leafminer could reduce the risk of being parasitized (1) by making cross structures in the inner area of a leaf to deter parasitoids from tracking the mines due to complex pathways, and (2) by mining along the edge of a leaf to hinder visually searching parasitoids from finding mined leaves due to effective background matching of the mined leaves among intact leaves. We quantified fractal dimension as mine complexity and area of mine in the inner area of the leaf as interior mine density for each sample mine, and analyzed whether these mine traits affected the susceptibility of O. maura to parasitism. Our results have shown that an increase in mine complexity with the development of occupying larvae decreases the probability of being parasitized, while interior mine density has no influence on parasitism. These results suggest that the larval development increases the host defense ability through increasing mine complexity. Thus the feeding pattern of these sessile insects has a defensiv...|$|R

We studied the activity pattern, feeding behaviour, prey abundance and hunting success to evaluate possible links between environmental conditions, feeding ecology and evolutionary success of this ancient fish.

40|$|As {{hovering}} feeders, hawkmoths {{cope with}} flower motions by tracking those motions to maintain {{contact with the}} nectary. This study examined the <b>tracking,</b> <b>feeding</b> and energetic performance of Manduca sexta feeding from flowers moving at varied frequencies and in different directions. In general we found that tracking performance decreased as frequency increased; M. sexta tracked flowers moving at 1 ·Hz best. While feeding rates were highest for stationary flowers, they remained relatively constant for all tested frequencies of flower motion. Calculations of net energy gain showed that Summary energy expenditure to track flowers is minimal compared to energy intake; therefore, patterns of net energy gain mimicked patterns of feeding rate. The direction effects of flower motion were greater than the frequency effects. While M. sexta appeared equally capable of tracking flowers moving in the horizontal and vertical motion axes, they demonstrated poor ability to track flowers moving in the looming axis. Additionally, both feeding rates and net energy gain were lower for looming axis flower motions. Key words: hawkmoth, flower <b>tracking,</b> <b>feeding</b> rate...|$|R
40|$|The European beaver is a ‘keystone species’ of Loire {{riverine}} ecosystem {{and present}} in the islands of Mareau-aux-prés (Loiret, France) since 1982. Our study {{is located in a}} mosaic of five islands (13 hectares) within the National Nature Reserve of St-Mesmin (Loiret, France), constituting the first Conservation Unit of the national programme of conservation of genetic resources of Populus nigra. The central island constituted the main source of food, with young shoots coming from stumps of black poplar (Populus nigra). In september 2012, the vegetation of such island was uprooted and the bar level lowered {{in order to maintain the}} flow capacity of the river. Modification of such feeding habitat is at the origin of our study, with a particular view of the consequence on genetic resources of Populus nigra, especially on mature trees located in the other four islands. Scientific questions focuss on (i) what were the feeding habits of the beaver family (4 to 6 individuals) before maintenance operation? (ii) how have they changed their feeding habits after such fluvial work, and what will be the impact on other vegetated islands? (iii) what is the impact of foraging activity by beavers on the genetic diversity of black poplar? To answer these issues, we have recorded data on Salicaceae vegetation (species, circumference, density of trees), presence of beaver (slides, lodges) and herbivory pressure (fresh or old traces on the bark, girdling percentage of these trees, cut trees). All of these data are georeferenced and were recorded before and after fluvial works (in september 2012). The results will be presented and discussed in terms of species selectivity, circumference of the tree, density of poplar and willow stumps acting as barrier to the consumption of adult stems, <b>feeding</b> <b>tracks</b> and forest composition and structure (in competition with underneath non-preferred Acer negundo) ...|$|R
