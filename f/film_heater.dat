40|$|Transparent, conductive, and {{flexible}} Ag nanowire (NW) -polyimide (PI) composite films were fabricated by a facile solution method. Well-dispersed Ag NWs result in percolation networks on the PI supporting layer. A series of films with transmittance values of 53 – 80 % and sheet resistances of 2. 8 – 16. 5 Ω/sq were investigated. To further verify the practicability of the Ag NWs-PI film in optoelectronic devices, we utilized it in a <b>film</b> <b>heater</b> and a flexible solar cell. The <b>film</b> <b>heater</b> {{was able to}} generate a temperature of 58 °C at a driving voltage of 3. 5 V within 20 s, indicating its potential application in heating devices that require low power consumption and fast response. The flexible solar cell based on the composite film with a transmittance value of 71 % presented a power conversion efficiency of 3. 53 %.

In this paper, the AgNW based <b>film</b> <b>heaters</b> on Chinese Xuan paper (CXP) substrates were fabricated by a drop-coating method. The fabricated AgNW/CXP <b>film</b> <b>heaters</b> exhibited high heating temperature (78. 1 degrees C) at low input voltage (3 V) and short response time less than 15 s.

Thermal coupling could be reduced by etching a trench between the waveguides. A rib structure under the trench between the waveguides was proposed to further reduce the thermal coupling.

The resulting film integrates {{the advantages of the}} two conductive materials; easy film-forming and strong adhesion to the substrate of the polymer PEDOT:PSS; and high conductivity of the Ag NWs. The fabricated composite films with different NW densities exhibited the transmittance within the range from 82. 3 % to 74. 1 % at 550 nm. By applying 40 V potential on the films; a stable temperature from 49 °C to 99 °C was generated within 30 s to 50 s. However; the surface temperature of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film did not increase compared to the room temperature. The composite film with the transmittance of 74. 1 % could be heated to the temperatures from 41 °C to 99 °C at the driven voltages from 15 V to 40 V; indicating that the <b>film</b> <b>heater</b> exhibited uniform heating and rapid thermal response. Therefore; the PEDOT:PSS/Ag NW composite film is a promising candidate for the application of the {{transparent and}} large-scale film heaters...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} an array of {{amorphous}} silicon (a-Si:H) p-i-n diodes to monitor the spatial temperature distribution over a thin <b>film</b> <b>heater</b> used for thermal treatments in lab-on-chip systems. The effects of heater geometry and operating conditions on the spatial temperature distribution have been preliminarily investigated by using COMSOL Multiphysics, coupling the electrostatic problem with the thermal problem via the Joule effect. Depending on the analyzed system, nonuniform temperature profiles can be induced over the heater surface revealing the need for a temperature point-monitoring. An example of whole device, constituted by a serpentine shaped TiW/Al/TiW thin <b>film</b> <b>heater</b> and five a-Si:H diodes deposited between the resistor meanders, has been fabricated on a microscope glass slide and characterized. Voltage-temperature characteristics of the a-Si:H sensors, measured at constant forward current, show a sensitivity around 2. 8 mV/°C. The spatial temperature distribution along the heater has been derived measuring the voltage across each a-Si:H diode. A good agreement between modeled and measured data is obtained, demonstrating the suitability of the a-Si:H array as temperature distribution sensors in lab-on-chip application. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E

The characterization has been performed on Cr/Al/Cr meandered heaters. Techniques commonly adopted for measuring the temperature coefficient of resistance, the thermal resistance and thermal capacitance in the case of Si-based microheaters have been conveniently modified {{to take into account the}} fundamentally different thermal parameters of a heater manufactured on glass. In order to reduce power consumption, 250 μm wide trenches were manufactured on the back side of the heaters, obtaining an increase of the thermal resistance of about 50 % when the glass is in good thermal contact with a heat sink. The measured values of thermal resistance and time constants on a heat sink and in air have been justified with simple physical considerations.

40|$|There exist {{numerous}} {{methods of}} experimentally testing designs for heat sinks in the laboratory, especially for microscale fluidic devices, {{which can lead}} to a problem for comparison between new studies and those in the literature. To explore this issue, laboratory-based experiments on the heat transfer and flow impedance properties of a sample microchannel heat sink were repeated over a varying range of equipment. Three types of heat source (hot plate, <b>film</b> <b>heater</b> and copper block with cartridge heaters), two types of piping (polymer and metal), and {{the presence or absence of}} manifolds were investigated and the differences in heat sink performance were noted. Overall, especially in terms of achieving consistent, repeatable results, it was found that the arrangement of copper block heater, metal piping and the inclusion of manifolds was superior for this particular microchannel device. Hence, it is suggested that future testing of heat sinks and heat exchanger devices employ a similar arrangement of equipment for greater accuracy and comparability. In particular, the plastic tubing and hot plate configurations were found to have relatively poor consistency when testing the heat sink, and the <b>film</b> <b>heater</b> produced non-uniform heating, even over a small surface area...|$|E

40|$|Thin <b>film</b> <b>heaters</b> made of Sr- or Ca-doped {{lanthanum}} chromite (LaCrO 3) are fabricated by RF magnetron sputtering. Thin {{films of}} Sr-doped LaCrO 3 deposited on alumina substrates {{are found to}} orient in the (220) or (004) direction, unlike Ca-doped films. The resistance of the films decreased with increasing concentration of Ca or Sr. At the same mixing ratio of Ca or Sr, the resistance of Ca-doped thin films was {{lower than that of}} Sr-doped films. Heating characteristics were affected by the purity of the alumina substrate. For dc constant-current drive, heating temperature increased with increasing heating time due to the increase in resistance. From the results of compositional analysis, the main factor in the degradation of heating characteristics upon applying dc drive may be the evaporation of components such as Cr 2 O 3 at the junction of the thin film and the cathode. With ac drive, degradation did not occur. Thin <b>film</b> <b>heaters</b> exhibited uniform heating. A maximum heating temperature of over 1300 ◦C was achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of spanwise instability modes and 3 -D) pulsed disturbances {{leading to the}} formation of streamnwise vortices in a plane mixing layer and subsequently to the onset of small-scale 3 -D motion were studied in a closed-return water facility. Streamwise vortices may result from a spanwise core instability of the primary vortices, or a spanwise instability of the nominally 2 - 1) strain field between them. These two instability modes were excited by time-harmonic wavetrains with spanwise phase or amplitude variations, respectively, synthesized by a mosaic of surface <b>film</b> <b>heaters</b> flush-mounted on the flow partition. 0 The appearance of the streamnwise vortices is accompanied by significant distortion in the transverse distribution of the streamwise velocity component. Inflection points, which are not present in corresponding velocity distributions of the unforced flow, indicate the formation of locally unstable regions of large shear in which broadband perturbations already present in the base flow undergo rapid amplification which is followed by breakdown to turbulence and mixing transition. The core instability of the primary vortices suggests itself as viable mechanism for the continuation of the mixing process far downstream of mixing transition. Pulsed excitation was produced by pulsed spanwise amplitude modulation of a spanwise-uniform time-harmonic carrier wave *train synthesized by the surface <b>film</b> <b>heaters.</b> Schlieren visualization showed that the disturbance spreads rapidly in the streamnwise and lateral directions as it is advected downstream, and causes a substantial distortion of the adjacent spanwise vortices.
