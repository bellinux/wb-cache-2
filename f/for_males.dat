5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates <b>for</b> <b>males</b> and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years <b>for</b> <b>males</b> and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years <b>for</b> <b>males</b> and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
